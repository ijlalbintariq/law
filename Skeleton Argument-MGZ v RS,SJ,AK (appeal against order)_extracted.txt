Grounds of Appeal: 

Ground No.1: Whether the complainant was the owner in actual possession of the property in question? [Para.8: Line.11-16]

C’s legal and equitable rights in the property were established by the family agreement and dismissal of last civil appeal made by R3 (evidence of the constructive possession). About the Family agreement: Complainant did not even annex with his complaint, the alleged written family statement through which rests his claim of ownership over the house in question. [Para.8: Line.33-37]. However, Claimant is ready to present the family agreement at behest of the court. It is also submitted that Judgements in specific performance case (Ex.PE) and civil appeal (Ex.PG) proves that complainant has the legal and equitable right in the disputed property and constructive possession.  

  

Ground No.2: Prior to the date alleged for taking forcible possession of the same by the accused persons and whether the complainant, in fact, himself was in possession of the same [Para.8: Line.11-16], and why complainant never earlier ventured for obtaining possession of his property in absence of R3? [Para.8: Line.65-68]

It is submitted that C was not in actual possession of the property at any time before the complaint was made. However, C was in constructive possession of the disputed property. It can be proven by the theory that R3 had promised the C in presence of PW.2 and PW.3 to deliver the possession amicably, to which C agreed but R3 misused his trust (abuse of position of trust) to gain the time to illegally dispose of the property in connivance with Mr Murtaza; Mr Murtaza colluded with R1 and R2. Therefore, their complicity is undraped and C always had the constructive possession, however he was not in actual possession of the property. 

Ground No.3: Thus, if allegedly, as per civil pleadings of complainant, the last possessor of the property i.e., R3 was not present at the spot then who transferred the possession to the co-accused R1 and R2? [Para.8: Line.60-65]

It is submitted that judge did not contemplate the above question adequately. Therefore, this becomes the third ground to challenge the impugned judgement. 

It is submitted that R3 in collusion with Mr Ghulam Murtaza evidently sold legal rights to R1. R3, after the judgement in civil suit (25.09.2016) had apprehension that his legal right and actual possession in the disputed property, will be taken away by the court, therefore, to acquire maximum advantage of the disputed property and the position of trust, he evidently sold disputed property to Mr Murtaza. Mr Murtaza did not conduct reasonable conveyancing before ostensibly purchasing the disputed property papers (as in that period, it was under litigation, therefore could not be sold), on (31.12.2016), after the adverse judgement against R3 promulgated in the Civil suit on (25.09.2016) against R3, the proof is annexed as (Ex.PM). Further on, Mr Murtaza ostensibly sold the disputed property to R1, [it is evidenced in Ex.DA (copy of plaint in Rasheed v Ghulam Murtaza), Ex.DB (order from civil court-09.04.2022) and Ex.DC (application for temporary injunction)] in order to deter C from claiming actual possession, control, and occupancy of the disputed property. The reason for stating the latter theory is that R1 could deter C because R1 is a PTI party worker and holder of public office in government department, therefore have some influence over the governmental machinery.

R1 in an attempt to avoid facing criminal charges, Let the disputed property; installed R2 as the tenant in the property and acted as a legal owner, evidenced in initial police inquiry made on the request of predecessor judge; preliminary orders based on S 7 Illegal Dispossession Act 2005 (IDA 2005), and it could also be proven through Ex.PN (petition by R3) and Ex.DE (Petition by C). Thus, the collaboration of all the respondents to deter C from obtaining physical possession is writ large in C’s initial application, to which Court did not pay any or any sufficient attention. 

In summary, R3 lost the case in 2016, in fear of losing the possession of the disputed property and gaining maximum benefit from it, sold the legal rights to Mr Murtaza. Then ostensibly Mr Murtaza sold the disputed property to R1; evidently R1 installed R2 as tenant to avoid confrontation and criminal charges. In addition, R1 was the main person (master mind) who confronted C on 29.06.2020 with unknown men laden with weapons, evidenced in C’s private complaint under provision of IDA 2005. In addition, it was R3 who delivered the possession of the disputed property to the C in compliance with order of the court under section 7 IDA 2005. The court did not inquire from R1 about the latter situation. Therefore, the adequate contemplation or reasonable theory can only be that R1, R2, and R3 acted in Sophisticated and organised manner to illegally deter and dispossess C from the disputed property, which the court failed to contemplate in their judgement.

Ground No 4: issue related to possession of the dispute property prior to private complaint under provisions of IDA 2005 on 26.06.2022

It is submitted that prior to application under S3 IDA 2005, the physical possession was with R3 and constructive possession was with C. The argument is that by the virtue of court order in 2016, R3 became the trustee and he was holding the property on trust for C. It is pertinent to mention here that C always had the equitable right in the disputed property in lieu of family agreement. Since C was awarded the legal right of the disputed property by the court, R3 had come on back foot and started negotiation related to actual possession of the disputed property, which is evidence from PW.2 witness statement. Negotiation involved buying the rights in the disputed property and request for permission to extend stay until finding a proper home for the family to move. R3, cunningly made Civil Appeal and lost in lieu of order on 04.02.2020. Hence, attempted fresh negotiation like previous one. Given his family relations with C’s father, C shown mercy again and gave him extension of time to either vacate the property or buy rights in the property. Eventually, on 25.06.2020, in connivance with R2, he managed to deter C from claiming actual possession of the property. It is vital to mention here that C had no knowledge related to sale of the disputed property by R3 in favour of Mr Murtaza. In summary, C always had the control over the property therefore he afforded the leave to R3 to remain in the disputed property until suitable option for his family is not available. Hence, unequivocally, C always had constructive possession since court order in 2016 (ibid). it is also cogent that R3, took advantage of C’s good nature and abused the position of trust.

Ground No.5: The classification of the property: 



Ground No.6: S.3 Illegal Dispossession Act 2005 (IDA 2005)

Whether collusion of responds, connote their complicity as organised or sophisticated land grabbers or do they fall under any?



Ground No.7: Other provisions of the IDA 2005



Ground No.8: Time period of total case: 

The judge intentionally omitted to include that it took more than 2 years to conclude the present case, more than 6 months. The judge did not consider the adverse effect it had on C’s case like C’s one of the main witnesses (Atif Ali-PW.3) went hostile and they labelled him won over. Which is an incorrect description because Atif due to fear of his family’s safety did not attend his cross examination. Which judge conveniently omitted to mention. Atif was C’s property manager at the time, when the case was ensued. He presented his witness statement and attended examination-in-chief. The judge should have considered his evidence under res gestae principle and admitted it. therefore, it is a fallacy of inferring that C could not establish his case. 

Ground No.9: Fallacy of inference:

Moreover, the judge based his final orders on the fallacious facts, which were circumstantial, disregarding sine qua non matters (mentioned above as grounds), which produces the red herring fallacy. 

Conclusion:

Therefore, for the above set grounds the court is invited to grant permission to allow appeal of the impugned judgement.

Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Ground No.2: Judge erred in his deductions: 

 It is crystal clear that R3 had possession of property in dispute, then assertion that of complaint that accused persons forcibly dispossessed him from the house on the eventful day (26.06.2020-prior to filing of the complaint) is having serious doubts, it rather appears to be based upon concoction [Para.9: Line.11-19]

The admitted position of the falling of the suit property in joint Khata as well as admitted possession of the accused persons by the PW.2 and the report of SHO concerned prior to the filing of the instant complaint are the facts raise doubts upon the claim of the complainant that he was forcibly dispossessed by the accused persons on the day of occurrence before filing of the instant private complaint [Para.9- Line.19-28]

Claimant has failed to establish the fact that present accused persons have forcibly dispossessed him on 26.06.2020 [Para.10: Line.2-5]

S.3 IDA 2005 is meant for land grabbers and it is not meant for co-owners, co-sharer of land each of them claiming title to land in dispute. (relied on Mst. Zahida Nasreen v Additional Session Judge Sahiwal (2010 PCr. LJ 575 Lahore) & Abdul Hameed v Ghulam Farid (2016 PCr. LJ(N) 18 Lahore) [Para.9: Line. 28-36]

Ground No.4: judges wrong interpretation of Section 3:

The terms, grab, control, or occupy.

It is found that the petitioner/complainant failed to establish the moot point that he was illegally dispossessed by the hands of accused persons (R1,R2,R3), which is a Sine Qua Non under the Illegal Dispossession Act 2005 (IDA 2005) [Para.9: Line.5-9]

 Ground No.5: Judge did not apply Section 4: 

Ground No.6: Case took longer than usual (application of interest of justice fails)

Ground No.7 whether the alliance of respondents denote organized effort to dispossess Claimants:

Ground No.8: the Qualifying test for accused persons to be found guilty

Ground No.9 whether defence was sufficient to discharge the burden of proof:

Defence was that they never dispossessed rather complainant never had the possession of property in question [Para.6: Line.5-6]

Preliminary pray: 

Accused persons are land grabbers, who have illegally dispossessed him from the house/property in question [Para.5: Line.6]

The suit of specific performance of contract was filed by R3 and dismissed [Para.8: Line.18-21]

Whether Claimant had the Prior possession: 

As per submitted report of SHO P.S Zahirpir, called on at initial stage by my learned predecessor, the accused R1 was found in possession of the house in dispute, who had taken the same from R3 [Para.9: Line.1-5]

The PW.2 (M. Khalid) in his cross examination has also endorsed the fact that at the moment, when the complaint was filed, the disputed house was already in possession of the accused R3 [Para.9: Line.6-10]

It is an admitted position by the defendants or present complainant Malik Gul Zaman etc., in his pleadings, that the possession of the disputed house was with R3. [Para.8: Line.21-25]

The complainant could not bring on record as to whence the possession of house in question was in fact delivered [Para.8: Line.25-27]

Or obtained by the complainant after dismissal of the Civil Appeal (04.02.2020) filed by R3 against the decree (25.09.2016) in civil suit (Abdul Karim Tariq Shah v Mst. Bilqees Begum & Malik Gul Zaman etc.) [Para.8: Line.27-33]

The complainant in his deposition as PW.1 in Cross-Examination has admitted that he never filed any suit for recovery of possession against R3 in whole six years (since 2013-2020) [Para.8: Line.37-43]

Even complainant was not sure whether he had possession of the house in dispute prior to 1994 [Para.8: Line.43-45]

Claimant claims of house in question by his mother in late 1980’s [Para.8: Line 46-48]

It is also an astonishing fact that on one side the complainant claims that he himself witnessed the scene of delivery of possession by the accused Abdul Karim Tariq Shah in favour of accused Rashid Saeed, while on the same breath of his volunteer portion, he clarified the fact that Abdul Karim Tariq Shah was not present there at that time [Para.8: Line.53-60]

As per PW.1/ (Complainant), he was informed about the occurrence of forcible possession by one neighbour namely Ishaq [Para.8: Line.68-70]

The complainant did not bother to produce said Ishaq in the witness box to substantiate his version [Para.8: Line.71-72]

The complainant was not sure, whether the accused persons were armed with any kind of weapon at the time of his forcible dispossession by accused R1 and R2 [Para.8: Line.72-75]

Whether claimant has the prior ownership: 



Judged erred in inferring that property was the part of the joint Khata:

It is further an admitted position per record that the property in question falls within joint Khata, which fact, if required, would definitely be settled by the revenue department being the proper forum [Para.8: Line 49-53]
