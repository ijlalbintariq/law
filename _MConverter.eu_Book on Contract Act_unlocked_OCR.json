Law of Contract
01
CONTRACT AND ITS KINDS
CONTRACT
The law relating to contracts in Pakistan is contained in the Contract Act,
1872. It extends to the whole of Pakistan and came into force on the 1st day of
September, 1872. It deals with:
1. General principles governing all types of contracts (Sec. 1-75).
2. Contracts of Indemnity, Guarantee, Bailment, Pledge and Agency (Sec. 124-
238).
Initially, sections 76-123 and sections 239-266 relating to sale of goods
and partnership were contained in the Contract Act but were subsequently
repealed and a separate Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and a Partnership Act, 1932
came into force.
Definition of Contract
Some definitions are as follows:
Pollack: "Every agreement and promise enforceable at law is a contract."
Salmond: "A contract is an agreement creating and defining obligations
between the parties".
Sir William Anson: "An agreement enforceable by law made between two or
more persons, by which rights are acquired by one or more to acts or
forbearance on the part of other or others."
Sec. 2(h) of Contract Act provides "An agreement enforceable by law is a
contract." Thus a contract consists of two elements:
(a) Agreement (b) Enforceability by law
1. Agreement
Section 2(e) defines agreement as, "Every promise and every set of
promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement."
Section 2(b) defines promise as, "When the person to whom the proposal
is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A
proposal, when accepted, becomes a promise."
A promise comes into existence when one party makes a proposal to the
other party and that other party gives consent. Therefore, a contract is an
agreement, an agreement is a promise and a promise is an accepted proposal.

Contract and Its Kinds

EXAMPLE
A offers to sell his car to B for Rs. 8 Lac. B gives acceptance. It is an
agreement.
2. Enforceability
An agreement is enforceable by law if it is recognized by the court. In
order to be enforceable by law, the agreement must create legal obligations
between the parties. Thus, the term agreement is wider than a contract. All
contracts are agreements but all agreements are not contracts. Agreements are
of two types:
a. Social agreements
Social agreements are not enforceable by law because they do not create
legal obligations between the parties. In social agreements, the parties do not
intend to create legal relations.
b. Legal agreements
Legal agreements are enforceable by law because they create legal
obligations between the parties. In legal agreements, the parties intend to create
legal relations. All business agreements are contracts as there is an intention to
create legal obligations.
EXAMPLES
a. A invites B to a dinner. B accepts the invitation but does not attend. A cannot
sue B for damages. It is a social agreement.
b. A promises to sell his car to B for Rs. 2 Lac. It is a legal agreement because it
creates legal obligations. This agreement is a contract.
Essentials of a Valid Contract
A valid contract is binding and enforceable. In a valid contract, all the
parties are legally bound to perform the contract. Thus, a contract can be
enforced by either of the parties. If one party refuses to perform the contract, the
other party can enforce it through court. In order to be enforceable, an agreement
must possess the essentials of a valid contract.
According to section 10, "All agreements are contracts if they are made
by the free consent of parties, competent to contract, for a lawful consideration
and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void.
Where necessary, the agreements must satisfy the requirements of law
regarding writing, attestation or registration."
The essentials of a valid contract are as follows:
1. Offer and Acceptance
In order to form an agreement, there must be a lawful offer by one party
and a lawful acceptance of that offer by the other party. The term lawful means
that the offer and acceptance must satisfy the requirements of Contract Act.

Contract and Its Kinds
EXAMPLE
3
A offers to sell his cycle to B for Rs. 2000. This is an offer. If B accepts
this offer, there is an acceptance.
2. Legal Obligation
The parties to an agreement must create legal obligations. It means that if
one party does not fulfill his promise, he shall be liable for breach of contract. It is
presumed in commercial agreements that parties intend to create legal relations.
EXAMPLES
a. A offers to sell his watch to B for Rs. 200. B agrees to buy. It is a contract as
it creates legal obligation.
b. A husband promised to pay his wife an allowance of $30 every month. Later,
the parties separated and the husband refused to pay. The wife sued. Held,
that the wife was not entitled as agreement did not create legal obligations.
(Belfour vs. Belfour)1
3. Lawful Consideration
For a valid contract, the consideration should be lawful. Consideration is
the price paid by one party for the promise of the other party. An agreement is
enforceable only when both the parties give and take something. That something
given or taken is called consideration.
EXAMPLES
a. A agrees to sell his house to B for Rs.10 Lac. For A Rs.10 Lac is the
consideration and for B house is the consideration.
b. A promises B to get him a government job and B promises to pay Rs.1 Lac.
The agreement is void as the consideration is unlawful.
4. Capacity of Parties
An agreement is enforceable if it is made by parties who are competent to
contract. In order to be competent to contract, it is essential that the parties are of
the age of majority, have sound mind and are not disqualified from contracting by
law. Contract by a person of unsound mind is void ab-initio (from the beginning).
EXAMPLES
a. M, a person of unsound mind agrees to sell his house to S for Rs. 2 Lac. It is
not a valid contract because M is not competent to contract.
b. A, aged 20 promises to sell his car to B for Rs. 3 Lac. It is a valid contract
because A is competent to contract.

5. Free Consent
Contract and Its Kinds
For a valid contract, it is essential that the consent of parties must be free.
Consent is free when it is not obtained by coercion, undue influence, fraud,
misrepresentation or mistake. If the consent of either of the parties is not free, the
agreement cannot become a contract. (Sec. 14)
EXAMPLE
A compels B to enter into a contract at gunpoint. It is not a valid contract
as the consent of B is not free.
6. Lawful Object
It is necessary that agreement is made for a lawful object. The object of
agreement must not be fraudulent, illegal, immoral, opposed to public policy,
imply injury to the person or property of another. Every agreement with unlawful
object or consideration is illegal and therefore void. (Sec. 23)
EXAMPLES
a. A, promises to pay B Rs. 5000 if B beats C. The agreement is illegal as its
object is unlawful.
b. A hires a house to use for gambling. The object of the agreement is unlawful,
so the agreement is illegal and void.
7. Writing and Registration
A contract may be oral or in writing. It is preferable that the contract be in
writing because it is easy to prove in court. If required by law, a particular
contract must be in writing, signed, attested by witnesses and registered, e.g.
sale and mortgage of land.
EXAMPLES
a. X verbally promises to sell his book to Y for Rs. 200. It is a valid contract
because the law does not require it to be in writing.
b. A verbally promises to sell his house to B. It is not a valid contract because
the law requires it to be in writing.
8. Certainty of Terms
According to section 29, "Agreements, the meaning of which is not certain
or capable of being made certain, are void." The terms of an agreement must be
clear, complete and certain. If the terms are uncertain, the agreement is void.
EXAMPLES
a. A promises to sell 20 books to B without specifying their titles. The agreement
is void because the terms are not clear.

5
b. O agreed to purchase a van from S. The price was to be paid over two years.
Held, there was no contract as the terms were not certain about rate of
interest and mode of payment (Scammel vs. Ouston)²
9. Possibility of Performance
A valid contract must be capable of being performed. An agreement to do
an impossible act is void. If the act is legally or physically impossible to perform,
the agreement cannot be enforced by law. (Sec. 56)
EXAMPLES
a. A agrees with B to discover a treasure by magic, the agreement is not
enforceable.
b. A agrees with B to put life into B's dead brother. The agreement is void as it
is impossible to perform.
10. Not Expressly Declared Void
The agreement must not be one of those agreements which have been
expressly declared to be void by the law. Sections 24-30 explain certain
agreements which have been expressly declared to be void, e.g. agreement in
restraint of trade and wager etc. are expressly declared void.
EXAMPLES
a. A promises to close his business on the promise of B to pay him Rs. 2 Lac is
a void agreement because it is in restraint of trade.
b. A promises to pay Rs. 2000 to B if Pakistan wins the world cup final. The
agreement is void being a wagering agreement.
KINDS OF CONTRACT
The contracts can be classified into the following four categories:
1. According to Enforceability
According to enforceability, a contract can be divided as under:
a. Valid Contract
A valid contract is enforceable by law. An agreement becomes
enforceable by law when all the essentials of a valid contract are present.
Obligation of Parties
In valid contract, all parties are legally responsible for the performance of
the contract. If one of the parties breaches the contract, the other party can
enforce it through the court of law.
2 (1941) AC 251.

Contract and Its Kinds
6
EXAMPLE
A agrees to sell a car to B. If it fulfills all the essentials of a contract, it is a
valid contract. If A fails to deliver the car, B can sue him and if B fails to pay, A
can sue him.
b. Void Contract
The word void means not binding in law. Section 2(j) defines "A contract
which ceases to be enforceable by law becomes void, when it ceases to be
enforceable." It means that a void contract is not void from the beginning. It is
valid contract when it is made but subsequently it becomes void due to certain
reasons.
Obligation of Parties
In void contract both the parties are not legally responsible to fulfill the
contract. Under this contract the party who has received any benefit is bound to
return it to the other party.
A contract becomes void under the following circumstances:
i. Impossibility of Performance
A contract becomes void due to impossibility of performance. A contract
becomes void before performance when it becomes impossible to be performed
by any party due to any reason. (Sec. 56)
EXAMPLE
A agrees to sell his house to B after two days. The house is burnt next
day. The contract becomes void.
ii. Subsequent Illegality
A contract becomes void by subsequent illegality. A contract may become
illegal before performance due to certain reasons. (Sec. 56)
EXAMPLE
A agrees to sell 100 bags of wheat to B. Before delivery the government
bans private trade in wheat. The contract becomes void.
iii. Rejection of a Voidable Contract
A voidable contract becomes void when the party whose consent is not
free rejects the contract. (Sec. 19)
EXAMPLE
A forcibly buys B's car for Rs. 20,000. The contract is voidable at the
option of B. B may accept or reject it. If B rejects the contract it becomes void.
www.RiazAcademy.com

Contract and Its Kinds
iv. Impossibility of depending Event
7
The performance of a contingent contract depends upon the happening or
non-happening of a certain event. It becomes void when that event does not
happen. (Sec 32)
EXAMPLE
A contracts to give Rs. 1 Lac to B, if B gets admission in Hailey College.
B fails to get admission. The contract becomes void.
c. Void Agreement
An agreement not enforceable by law is said to be void. The void
agreement does not create legal obligations among the parties. An agreement
which is void from the beginning is void ab-initio. In void agreement, there is
absence of one or more essentials of valid contract except free consent.
Agreement with minor and agreement without consideration are void from the
beginning. (Sec. 2 (g))
Obligation of Parties
In void agreement, the party who has received any advantage is bound to
restore it to the party from which he received it. Both the parties are not
responsible for the performance of the agreement.
EXAMPLE
A promises to buy a dog from B for Rs. 10,000. The dog was dead before
the contract. The parties were unaware. The agreement is void.
d. Voidable Contract
"An agreement which is enforceable by law at the option of one or more
of the parties thereto but not at the option of the other or others is a voidable
contract." (Sec. 2 (i))
A contract is voidable when consent of one of the parties is not free. It is a
valid contract until it is avoided by the party having the right to avoid it. If the
party decides to confirm it, it remains valid. A contract becomes voidable under
the following circumstances:
A contract becomes voidable when the consent of one or more of the
parties to a contract is obtained by coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation
or fraud. (Sec. 15-18).
EXAMPLES
a. A compels B to sell his car at gunpoint. The contract is made by coercion and
is voidable at the option of B.
b. A deceives B by stating that his factory produces 90 kg of sugar daily and
induces B to buy it. The contract is voidable at the option of B.

Page 15
www.AccountancyPoint.com
8
Contract and Its Kinds
B. When one party promises to do something for the other party but the other
party prevents him from performing his promise, the contract becomes
voidable at his option. (Sec. 53)
EXAMPLE
A contracts to paint B's house. A is ready to paint but B prevents him from
doing so. This contract is voidable at the option of A.
C. When a party to the contract promises to do a certain thing within a specified
time, but fails to do it, then the contract becomes voidable at the option of the
promisee, if time is essence of the contract. (Sec. 55)
EXAMPLE
A contracts to paint B's house within one week. A, does not come within
the specified time. The contract is voidable at the option of B.
Obligation of Parties
The following are obligations of the parties:
1. It is a valid contract for both the parties if it is not rejected by the party having
the right to reject.
2. The law gives an option to one of the parties to avoid it.
3. The party entitled to cancel the contract is not bound to cancel. If he confirms
it, the other party remains bound to perform.
4. The aggrieved party can get damages from the other party.
5. If one party has received some benefit, he must return it to the other.
Burden of Proof
The burden of proof lies on plaintiff i.e. the aggrieved party. It means that
the party, who claims that his consent is unfree, has to prove in the court of law.
If he fails to prove, the contract remains valid.
e. Unenforceable Contract
An unenforceable contract is that contract which cannot be enforced in a
court of law because of some technical defects such as absence of writing,
registration, requisite stamp etc. When these defects are removed, the contract.
can be enforced.
EXAMPLE
A borrows Rs. 1 billion from B and makes a pronote on a Rs. 10 stamp
paper. It is unenforceable because pronote is undervalued.
Obligation of Parties
In an unenforceable contract, the parties may perform the contract. But in
case of breach of such contract, the aggrieved party is not entitled to legal
remedies.

Contract and Its Kinds
f. Illegal Agreement
9
An agreement is illegal when its performance is forbidden by any law.
Such an agreement can never become a contract. An agreement is illegal and
void if it is forbidden by law or is of such a nature that if permitted, it would defeat
the provisions of any law or is fraudulent or involves injury to the person or
property of another or the Court regards it as immoral or opposed to public
policy. (Sec. 23)
EXAMPLE
A gives money to B, a smuggler, to buy smuggled goods. The agreement
is illegal and the money cannot be recovered.
Obligation of Parties
The parties to the agreement are not responsible to perform their
promises. There is punishment for the parties according to law.
2. According to Formation
According to formation, a contract has the following three kinds:
a. Express Contract
Express contract is one which is expressed in words spoken or written.
When such a contract is formed, there is no difficulty in understanding the rights
and obligations of the parties. In express contract, the parties directly state the
terms of the contract. (Sec. 9)
EXAMPLE
A tells on telephone to B that he wants to sell his car and B informs A that
he agrees to buy the car, it is an express contract.
b. Implied Contract
An implied contract is made otherwise than by words spoken or written. It
arises from acts, conduct of parties, and course of dealings or circumstances. It
arises when one person, without being requested to do so, renders services
under circumstances indicating that he expects to be paid for them and the other
person knowing such circumstances accepts the benefit of those services. (Sec.
9)
EXAMPLES
a. A went into a restaurant and had a cup of tea. It is an implied contract and A
wi!! pay for the cup of tea.
b. M, a shoe shiner starts polishing the shoes of W in his presence, and W
allows him to do so. It is an implied contract.
c. Quasi Contract
In a quasi contract, the law imposes certain obligations under some
special circumstances. It is based upon the principle of equity that a person shall

Page 17

10
Contract and Its Kinds
not be allowed to get benefit at the cost of another. In fact, it is not a contract but
creates relations similar to contract. It is also called constructive contract.
EXAMPLES
a. A, finds lost goods of B. A is bound to return the goods to B.
b. A leaves his goods at B's house by mistake. B treats them as his own and
uses them. It is a quasi contract. B is bound to pay for the goods.
3. According to Performance
According to performance a contract is of the following two kinds:
a. Executed Contract
.
A contract is said to be executed when both the parties have completely
performed their obligations. It means that nothing remains to be done by either
party under the contract.
EXAMPLES
a. A buys a book from B. A delivers the books and B pays the price. It is an
executed contract.
b. A agrees to paint a picture for B for Rs. 2,000. When A paints the picture and
B pays the price, the contract is said to be executed.
b. Executory Contract
In an executory contract something remains to be done. In other words a,
contract is said to be executory when both the parties to a contract have yet to
perform their obligations.
EXAMPLES
a. M sells his car to N for Rs. 2 lac. N has not yet paid the price and M has not
delivered the car. The contract between M and N is executory.
b. A agrees to teach B, in May and B promises to pay Rs. 800 to A. It is an
executory contract because the promises are yet to be performed.
4. According to parties
According to parties a contract may be of the following two kinds:
a. Unilateral contract
In a unilateral contract only one party makes a commitment. In other.
words, it is a contract where only one party is bound but the other party chooses
to be bound by it.
EXAMPLE
A promises to pay Rs. 1,000 to any one who finds his lost bag. B finds the
bag and returns it to A. It is a unilateral contract which comes into existence
when the bag is found.

Contract and Its Kinds
b. Bilateral contract
11
It is a contract where both parties are bound by it, as soon as the contract
is made. In other words, it is a contract in which both the parties have yet to
perform their obligations.
EXAMPLE
A promises to paint a picture for B and B promises to pay Rs. 5,000 to A.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOID AGREEMENT & VOID CONTRACT

illegal.
A collateral agreement to a void
agreement is enforceable.
In void agreement the money
received must be returned to the
other party.
When an agreement is illegal, other agreement which is collateral to it is
also illegal and so not enforceable by law.
EXAMPLE
A borrows Rs. 2 lac from B to buy a car from X for bomb blast. B knows
the purpose of the loan. An agreement between A and B is collateral to the
agreement with X so it is also illegal and void agreement.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOID AGREEMENT AND VOIDABLE CONTRACT
The following are points of difference between the two:
Void Agreement
1. Enforceability
A void agreement is not enforceable
by law.
2. Defects
A void agreement is void ab-initio and
its defects cannot be removed
Voidable Contract
A voidable contract is enforceable by
law till it is rejected.
A. voidable contract is not void ab-
initio and its defects can be
removed.
3. Rights of Third Party
In a void agreement, a third party who
buys goods in good faith and for
consideration does not acquire any
rights.
In a voidable contract, a third party
who buys goods in good faith and for
consideration acquires rights before
the contract is rejected.

the contract.
A collateral agreement to a voidable
contract is enforceable by law.
It may become a valid contract if the
aggrieved party does not reject it
within a reasonable time.
7. Free Consent

of a valid contract except free
consent.

OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE
The first essential of a valid contract is an agreement i.e. offer and
acceptance. An agreement arises when one party makes an offer and the other
party accepts that offer.
Definition
OFFER
Section 2(a) defines a proposal as, "When one person signifies to another
his willingness to do or to abstain from doing any thing, with a view to obtaining
the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal."
It means that when a person shows his willingness to do or not to do
something to obtain the consent of other person, it is considered a proposal.
The person making the offer is called the offeror or promisor. The person
to whom the offer is made is called the offeree. The person accepting the offer is
called the promisee or acceptor. The word 'offer' in English Law is similar to the
word 'proposal' in Pakistani law but the word offer is usually used in our practical
life.
EXAMPLES
a. A offers to sell his watch to B for Rs. 100. A makes an offer to B.
b. A promises to sell his car to B for Rs. 3 Lac. A makes an offer to B.
Essentials of a Valid Offer
The following are legal rules or essentials of a valid offer:
1. Express or implied
An offer may be expressed or implied. An offer which is made by words
spoken or written is called an express offer. An implied offer appears from the
actions, conduct of parties, course of dealings or circumstances of the case.
EXAMPLES
a. M says to N that he will sell his motorcycle to him for Rs. 40,000. It is an
express offer.
b. A railway coolie carries the luggage of B without asking to do so. B allows
him to do so. It is an implied offer.
c. New Khan Company runs buses to carry passengers at scheduled fares. This
is an implied offer by the company.

2. Legal Relations
order fo
Offer And Acceptance
The offer must be made in order to create legal relations otherwise there
is no agreement. If an offer does not give rise to legal obligations between the
parties, it is not a valid offer. In business transactions, it is presumed that the
parties intend to create legal relations.
EXAMPLES
a. A invites B to dinner and B accepts the invitation. It does not create legal
relations, so there is no agreement.
b. A offers to sell his watch to B for Rs. 200 and B agrees. There is an
agreement because the parties intend to create legal relations.
c. Three friends agreed to enter a newspaper competition and share any
winnings. It was held that they intended to create legal relations so there was
a contract. (Simpkins vs. Pays)
3. Definite & Clear
An offer must be definite and clear. If the terms of an offer are not definite
and clear, it cannot be called a valid offer. If such offer is accepted, it cannot
create a binding contract. An agreement to agree in future is not a contract
because the terms of agreement are not clear.
EXAMPLES
a. A has two motorcycles. He offers B to sell one motorcycle for Rs. 27,000. It is
not a valid offer because it is not clear which motor cycle A wants to sell.
b. X purchased a horse from Y and promised to buy another, if the first one
proved lucky. X refused to buy the second horse. Y could not enforce the
agreement, as it is unclear. (Taylor vs. Portington)
4. Different from Invitation to Offer
An offer is different from an invitation to offer. In an invitation to offer, the
person making the invitation does not make an offer but only invites the other
party to make an offer. His object is to inform that he is willing to deal with
anybody who is willing to deal with him.
EXAMPLES
a. X displays goods for an auction sale. It is not an offer. The offer will come
from the buyer in the form of bid.
b. N advertised to sell his furniture at Bury on specified day. H came from
London to attend the auction but all furniture was withdrawn from sale. H
sued N for loss of time and expenses. Held, H could not recover expenses
because the advertisement was an invitation to offer. (Haris vs. Nickerson)'

Offer And Acceptance
5. Specific or General
17
When an offer is made to a specific person or group of persons, it is
called specific offer. Specific offer can be accepted only by the person or persons
to whom it is made. A general offer is made to public in general and it may be
accepted by any person who fulfils the conditions mentioned in it.
EXAMPLES
a. M makes an offer to N to sell his bicycle for Rs. 800, it is a specific offer. In
this case only N can accept it.
b. A announces in a newspaper a reward of Rs. 1,000 for anyone who will
return his lost radio. It is a general offer.
c. The CSB Co. advertised to pay $ 100 to any person who contracts flue after
enve using their medicine. Mrs. Carlill used the medicine but suffered from flue.
She sued for the reward. The company was held liable. (Carlill vs. Carbolic
Smoke Balls Co.)2
6. Communication with Offeree
An offer is valid only when it is communicated to the offeree. If an offer is
not communicated to the offeree, it cannot be accepted. An acceptance of offer
without having knowledge of such offer is not a valid acceptance and does not
create any legal obligations. Thus, an offer which is not communicated is not a
valid offer.
EXAMPLE
G's nephew was missing from home. He sent his servant Lalman in
search of the boy. When the servant left, G announced a reward of Rs.501 for
anyone who gives information about the boy. The servant before the
announcement found the boy and informed G. Later, he claimed for the reward.
He failed on the grounds that he could not accept the offer unless he had the
knowledge of it. (Lalman vs. Gauri Datt)
7. Negative Condition
An offer cannot contain a condition that the offer would be considered as
accepted if acceptance is not communicated up to a certain date. If the offeree
does not reply, there is no contract because an obligation to reply cannot be
imposed on the grounds of justice.
EXAMPLE
A wrote to B to sell his book adding that if he did not reply within 5 days,
the offer would be considered as accepted. There is no contract.

18
8. Conditions in Offer
Offer And Acceptance
An offeror may include any condition in his offer. There is no contract
unless all the conditions of the offer are accepted. If the offeror prescribes a
specific mode of acceptance, the offeree must adopt the same mode of
acceptance. If the offeree does not follow the prescribed mode, the offeror must
inform the offeree regarding its rejection otherwise he is considered to have
accepted the acceptance.
EXAMPLE
A asks B to send the reply of his offer by telegram but B sends reply by
letter.. A may reject such acceptance.
9. Cross Offers
When two parties make similar offers to each other without having
knowledge of other's offer, it is called cross-offers. The acceptance of cross
offers does not result in formation of a contract.
EXAMPLE
A wrote to B to sell him 1 ton of iron for Rs. 1 Lac. On the same day B
wrote to A to buy 1 ton of iron for Rs. 1 Lac. There is no contract.
Revocation of Offer
An offer may revoke in any of the following ways: (Sec.6)
1. Notice of Revocation
An offer can be revoked by sending a notice of revocation to the other
party. It means that the offeror may revoke his offer at any time before
acceptance, even though the period of acceptance of offer has not yet expired.
The offeree cannot create a contract by accepting the revoked offer.
EXAMPLE
A, at an auction gives the highest bid to buy B's goods. He withdraws the
bid before the fall of hammer. The offer is revoked.
2. Lapse of Time
When the offer is kept open for a specified time period, it terminates if it is
not accepted within that time period. If the offer does not specify any time period,
it terminates after lapse of a reasonable time. The reasonable time depends
upon the circumstances of each case. If the commodity is perishable, the
reasonable time will be relatively shorter.

Offer And Acceptance
EXAMPLE
19
M offered to buy shares of a company R, on 8th June. R allotted shares to
M on 23rd November. M refused to accept them. Held that the offer had lapsed by
delay in acceptance. (R.V. Hotel Co. vs. Montefiore)³
3. Failure to Fulfill Condition
If an offer contains some conditions and the offeree fails to fulfill these
conditions, the offer terminates.
EXAMPLE
A offers to sell his scooter to B for Rs. 50,000 if B gets admission in
medical college. B fails to get admission, the offer is revoked.
4. Death or Insanity of Offeror
An offer terminates on death or insanity of the offeror, if the offeree
comes to know about the death or insanity of offeror before his acceptance. If the
offeree does not know about the death or insanity of offeror and gives his
acceptance, it is valid acceptance. It results in a valid contract and legal
representatives of the deceased offeror will be bound by the contract.
EXAMPLE
X requested D, to give credit to Y and guaranteed payment up to Rs. 1
Lac. X died and D in ignorance of this fact continued to give credit to Y. D sued
X's legal representatives on the guarantee. Held, that the legal representatives
were liable.
5. Revocation of Offer by Offeree
If the offeree rejects the offer and communicates the rejection to the
offeror, the offer terminates even though the period for acceptance of offer has
not yet expired.
EXAMPLE
A offers to sell his cycle to B and keeps the offer open for ten days. B
refuses after three days. It terminates although the period has not yet expired.
6. Counter Offer by Offeree
When an offer is accepted with some change in the terms of the offer,
such acceptance is called counter offer. An offer terminates when a counter offer
is made. The party making a counter offer cannot accept the original offer.
EXAMPLES
a. A offers to sell his house to B for Rs. 1 Lac. B counter offers Rs. 80,000.
Later, even if B is ready to pay Rs. 1 Lac, the original offer is terminated.

Offer And Acceptance
b. W offered to sell a farm to H for £1,000. H offered £950. W refused the offer.
Subsequently H offered 1,000 £. Held, there was no contract as H by offering
950 £ had rejected the original offer. (Hyde vs. Wrence)4
7. Death or Insanity of Offeree
An offer can be accepted only by the offeree. It cannot be accepted by his
legal representatives upon his death. If the offeree dies or becomes insane
before acceptance, the offer terminates.
EXAMPLE
X offers to sell his camera to Y. Y dies before acceptance. The offer
terminates.
8. Subsequent Illegality
An offer lapses if it becomes illegal before its acceptance. An offer may
also terminate if it becomes illegal due to change in law before its acceptance by
the offeree.
EXAMPLE
A offers to sell 10 bags of rice to B for Rs. 2000. Before its acceptance, a
law bans the sale of rice. The offer terminates.
9. Destruction of Subject Matter
eviz
An offer lapses if the subject matter of the offer is destroyed before its
acceptance by the offeree.
EXAMPLE
A offers to sell his horse to B. The horse dies before the acceptance of
offer by B. The offer terminates.
10. Prescribed Manner
If the offeror prescribes the manner of acceptance, the offer terminates if
the offeree does not accept according to the prescribed manner. If the offeror
wants to reject the offer, he must inform the offeree within a reasonable time. If
offeror does not inform, he will be bound by such acceptance.
EXAMPLE
A offers to sell his car to B. A requests B to give acceptance by
telephone. B sends acceptance by letter. The offer terminates.

Offer And Acceptance

Definition
ACCEPTANCE
Section 2(b) defines acceptance as, "When the person to whom the
proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted.
A proposal, when accepted, becomes a promise."
EXAMPLE
A offers to sell his house to B for Rs. 5 Lac. B accepts the offer. This is an
acceptance.
Essentials of Valid Acceptance
The following are legal rules or essentials of a valid acceptance:
1. Acceptance by Offeree
An offer can be accepted only by the person to whom it is made. It cannot
be accepted by another person without the consent of offeror. When an offer is
made to a particular group, it can be accepted by any member of that group. If
the offer is made to general public, it can be accepted by any person who has
knowledge of that offer.
EXAMPLES
a. X offered to sell his house to Y. Z who was aware of such offer said that he is
ready to buy X's house. There is no contract with Z.
b. A sold his business to B without informing his customers. J sent an order for
the supply of goods to A by name. B received the order and supplied the
goods. It was held that there was no contract because J never made any.
offer to B. (Boulton vs. Jones)
2. Absolute & Unconditional
In order to form a valid agreement, the acceptance must be absolute and
unconditional. If the offeree imposes any condition in his acceptance, it is not a
valid acceptance but a counter offer. There is no contract until the counter offer is
accepted by the original offeror.
EXAMPLES
a. A offers to sell his watch to B.for Rs. 500. B replies that he can buy it for Rs.
300. There is no acceptance on the part of B.
b. M offered to sell land to N for £280. N accepted and enclosed £80 with a
promise to pay the balance by monthly installments of £50 each. Held, there
was no contract as the acceptance was conditional. (Neale vs. Merret)

3. Prescribed Manner
Offer And Acceptance
If the offeror prescribes a particular manner of acceptance, the offeree
must accept according to that particular manner. If acceptance is not made
according to the prescribed manner, the offeror may reject it. If no particular
manner is prescribed in the offer then acceptance should be made in a
reasonable manner.
EXAMPLES
a. A makes an offer to B and asks him to accept the offer by telegram. B sends
his acceptance by post. It is not a valid acceptance.
b. A offered to buy flour from B and requested him to send acceptance by
messenger who had brought the order. B sent his acceptance by post
thinking that it would reach A earlier than the messenger. Held, A was not
bound by the acceptance. (Eliason vs. Henshaw)
4. Communication with Offeror
The offeree or his agent must communicate the acceptance to the offeror
in a clear manner. Showing the intention to accept an offer is not a valid
acceptance. If the offeree does not accept the offer, no contract is formed. When
offeree accepts an offer but fails to clearly communicate, it is not considered an
acceptance.
EXAMPLES
a. A offers by letter to purchase B's house. B expresses his intention to sell it
but does not reply. B sells to C. A has no legal remedy against B.
b. The manager of a railway company received a draft agreement relating to
supply of coal. The manager approved and put the agreement in the drawer
and forgot all about it. Held, there was no contract, as the other party was not
informed. (Brodgen vs. Metropolitan Railway Co.)
5. Express or implied
When an acceptance is given by words spoken or written, it is called
express acceptance. When acceptance is given by conduct or action it is called
implied acceptance. If the offer is made to the public, the contract arises when
any person accepts it by words or conduct.
EXAMPLES
a. A offered by letter to sell his cycle to B for Rs. 2,000. B accepted his offer and
sent a letter of acceptance. It is an express acceptance.
b. A widow promised to give some property to her niece if she stayed with her.
The niece stayed in her residence till her death. Held, the niece was entitled
to the property. (V. Rao vs. A. Rao)

Offer And Acceptance
6. Acceptance after Offer
23
Acceptance must be given after receiving an offer. It cannot precede the
offer. If acceptance is made without having knowledge of the offer, there is no
contract because no acceptance can be made without an offer.
EXAMPLES
a. A offered a reward for anyone who finds his lost dog. B, in ignorance of the
offer, finds and returns the dog. B cannot claim the reward.
b. A company allotted shares to a person who had not applied for them. Later,
he applied for the shares. Held, that the previous allotment was invalid.
7. Reasonable time
If offeror specifies a time period for acceptance in his offer, the offeree
must give acceptance within that specified time. If no time is specified, the
acceptance must be given within a reasonable time. The reasonable time
depends upon the circumstances of each case.
EXAMPLE
M applied for shares of a company in June but allotment was made in
November. M refused to accept the shares. It was held that M could refuse to
take shares because the offer had lapsed after the expiry of a reasonable time.
(Ramsgate Victoria Hotel Co. vs. Montefiore)
Communication of Offer, Acceptance and Revocation
When the contracting parties are face to face with each other, there is
immediate communication of offer and acceptance. The moment the offeree
gives his acceptance, there is a valid agreement. When the parties are at a
distance from each other, the services of post office are utilized to enter into a
contract. In this case the following rules apply:
1. Communication of Offer
Section 4 explains, "The communication of a proposal is complete when it
comes to the knowledge of the person to whom it is made".
It means that communication of an offer completes when the letter
containing an offer comes to the knowledge of the offeree.
EXAMPLES
a. A offers, by letter, to sell a van to B for Rs. 1 Lac. The letter reaches B on 8th
March. Communication of the offer is complete on 8th march.
b. X sends a letter to Y offering to sell his motorcycle for Rs. 4,000. The letter
never reaches Y. The offer is not complete.

Offer And Acceptance
2. Communication of Acceptance
The communication of an acceptance is complete:
a. As against the proposer, when it is put in course of transmission to him, so as
to be out of power of the acceptor.
b. As against the acceptor, when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer.
(Sec. 4)
It means that the communication of an acceptance completes, as against
the offeror, when the letter of acceptance is posted to the offeror, i.e. when letter
of acceptance is out of control of the acceptor. The communication of an
acceptance completes, as against the acceptor, when the letter of acceptance
comes to the knowledge of offeror.
EXAMPLES
a. A offers, by letter, to sell a van to B for Rs. 50,000. The letter reaches B on
8th March. B accepts by a letter sent by post on 9th March. The letter reaches
A on 11th March. The communication of the acceptance is complete:
i. As against A, when the letter is posted, i.e. on 9th March.
ii. As against B, when the letter is received by A, i.e. on 11th March.
b. G offered by post to purchase share of the company. The letter of allotment
posted by the company never reached G. Held, the acceptance was
complete as soon as the letter of acceptance was posted. (H. F. Insurance
Co. vs. Grant)
3. Communication of Revocation
163
69 Revocation means cancellation. There may be a revocation of offer and
acceptance. The communication of a revocation is complete:
a. As against the person who makes it, when it is put in course of transmission
to the person to whom it is made, so as to be out of the power of person who
makes it.
b. As against the person to whom it is made, when it comes to his knowledge.
(Sec. 4)
It means that communication of revocation completes as against the
person who makes it, when the letter of revocation is posted. The communication
of revocation completes as against the person to whom it is made, when the
letter of revocation comes to his knowledge.
EXAMPLES
a. A revokes his offer by letter on 8th March. The letter reaches B on 10th
March. The revocation is complete as against A on 8th, when the letter of
revocation is posted. It is complete as against B on 10th, when the letter of
revocation reaches him.

b. T offered by a letter on October 1st, to sell goods to B in New York. B
received the offer on 11th and gave his acceptance. On 18th T wrote a letter
revoking his offer. The letter was received by B on 20th. Held, the revocation
was of no effect until it reached B. A contract made on 11th when B accepted
the offer. (Byrne vs. Van Timehoven)⁹
Time of Revocation of Offer and Acceptance
An offer may be revoked any time before communication of its
acceptance is complete as against the offeror, but not afterwards. An acceptance
may be revoked any time before communication of the acceptance is complete
as against the acceptor, but not afterwards. (Sec.5)
EXAMPLE
A offers by letter to sell his house to B. B accepts the offer by a letter
posted on 4th May. The letter reaches A on 6th May. A may revoke his offer
before B posts his letter of acceptance, i.e. 4th but not afterwards. B may revoke
his acceptance before the letter of acceptance reaches A, i.e. 6th but not
afterwards.
Loss of Letter of Acceptance
If the letter of acceptance is delayed or lost, following is the effect:
1. Position of Offeror
When the letter of acceptance is posted, the offeror is bound by that
acceptance. The contract is valid even if the letter of acceptance is delayed or
lost. In order to bind the offeror, the letter must be stamped, correctly addressed
and properly posted. If wrong address is given by the offeror himself, he will be
bound by the acceptance.
2. Position of Acceptor
The acceptor is not bound by the letter of acceptance till it reaches the
offeror. Until the letters of acceptance reaches the offeror, the contract remains
voidable at the option of acceptor. He may enforce the contract or revoke his
acceptance before the letter reaches the offeror.
3. Accidental Formation of Contract
brie
When both the letter of acceptance and letter of revocation of acceptance
are received at the same time by the offeror; the formation of a contract depends
upon chance. If the offeror first reads the letters of acceptance, a contract will
arise. But if offeror first reads the letter of revocation, there will be no contract.
4. Contracts over Telephone
In case of contract over telephone, there is immediate communication of
offer, acceptance and revocation. The rules which apply to contracts made when
9

Offer And Acceptance
parties are face to face with each other, also apply to contracts made over
telephone. If acceptance is not communicated to the offeror due to a fault in the
telephone, there will be no contract.
The offeree must make sure that his acceptance is received, heard and
understood by the offeror; otherwise there is no contract. In case of a contract
over telephone the question of revocation does not arise because an offer is
made and accepted at the same time.

CONSIDERATION AND OBJECT
Meaning and Definition
Consideration is one of the essentials of valid contract. An agreement
without consideration is void. A consideration is what a promisor demands for his
promise. An agreement is enforceable when both the parties take something and
give something. The something given or taken is called consideration.
Pollock says, "The consideration is the price for which the promise of the
other is bought and the promise thus given for value is enforceable."
Lush J defines, "A valuable consideration may consist of some right,
interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party and some forbearance, detriment,
loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by other".
Justice Patterson defines, "The consideration means something which is
of some value in the eye of law. It may be some benefit to the plaintiff or some
detriment to the defendant."
Section 2(d) defines, "When at the desire of the promisor, the promisee
or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from
doing, or promises to do or abstain from doing something, such act or abstinence
or promise is called a consideration for the promise."
EXAMPLES
a. A agrees to sell his house for Rs. 10 Lac to B. For A the consideration is
Rs.10 Lac. For B consideration is house.
b. A promises to repair B's car and B promises to pay Rs. 1 Lac. The promise of
one party is the consideration for the other party.
c. A promises not to sue his debtor B and B promises to pay additional 1 Lac.
The abstinence of A is the consideration for B's promise to pay.
d. A promises to paint a picture for B and B promises to teach him for a month.
The promise of one party is the consideration for the other.
Essentials of Valid Consideration
The essentials or legal rules of a valid consideration are as under:
1. Desire of Promisor
For a valid consideration, the act or abstinence which forms the
consideration must be done at the desire of the promisor. It means that any act
27
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 35
www.Accountancy Point.com
28
Consideration and Object
performed at the desire of third party or without the desire of the promisor cannot
be a consideration. Similarly, the act done voluntarily does not create a valid
consideration. The promisor need not necessarily get any benefit; the third party
may also get benefit from the contract.
EXAMPLES
a. A saved B's house from fire. B did not ask for help. A cannot demand
payment for his services because he acted voluntarily.
b. B promised to pay a commission on goods sold in his market if D constructed
a market in that area. Later, the collector requested D to construct the market
and D constructed the market on his request. D demanded commission from
B. Held, the promise was not enforceable because the market was not
constructed at the desire of B. (Durga Prasad vs. Baldeo)'
2. Promisee or other Person
A consideration may move from the promisee or any other person. It
means a person can sue on a contract; even if the consideration for the promise
moved from a third party.
EXAMPLE
A gifted property to her daughter R on the condition that she would pay-
certain amount annually to A's brother C. R promised to pay the amount to her
uncle C. Later, R refused to pay. C sued. Held, C could recover the amount as
the consideration had moved from A to C. (Chinnaya vs. Ramayya)²
3. Act, Abstinence or Promise
The consideration may be a positive or a negative act. Sometimes a
return promise also forms consideration.
a. Act
A consideration may be an act, i.e. doing of something. In this sense,
consideration is in positive form.
EXAMPLE
P agrees to construct A's house for Rs. 10 Lac. A's promise to pay Rs. 10
Lac is the consideration for P's promise of constructing the house.
b. Abstinence
Abstinence means refraining from doing something. In this sense
consideration is in negative form.

Consideration and Object
29
A promises not to sue B if B pays him additional Rs. 5,000. The
abstinence of A is the consideration for B's payment.
c. Promise
For a valid consideration, there must be a promise from both sides. It
means that there must be a promise by one party against the promise of other
party.
EXAMPLE
A agree to sell his horse to B for Rs. 30,000. B's promise to pay Rs.
30,000 is the consideration for A's promise. A's promise to sell the horse is the
consideration for B's promise.
4. Past, Present or Future
The consideration may be past, present or future. It means that
consideration is an act which has been done or is in progress or is promised to
be done in future.
a. Past Consideration
When the consideration is given before the formation of agreement, it is
called a past consideration. It is not a valid consideration. When an act is done
voluntarily without any promise for compensation, it is a past consideration and
the person doing the act gets no compensation. But if promise is made to
compensate a person who has rendered some services, then past consideration
is a valid consideration.
EXAMPLES
a. B found A's lost purse and gave it to him. B cannot demand payment for his
services due to past consideration.
b. A teaches B at his request in January, and in February B promises to pay A
Rs. 2,000 for his services. The service of A is past consideration.
c. A lawyer gave up his practice and served as manager at the request of
landlord. The landlord promised to pay pension. It was held that there was
valid past consideration. (Shiv Saran vs. Kesho Prasad)³
b. Present Consideration
When consideration is given immediately by one party to another at the
time of contract, it is called present consideration. The act creating the
consideration is completely performed.
EXAMPLE
A sells a book to B and B pays price immediately. It is a case of present
consideration.
c. Future Consideration
3 (42-1.c.122
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 37
www.AccountancyPoint.com
30
Consideration and Object
When the consideration on both sides is to move at a future date, it is
called future consideration. It consists of promises and each promise is a
consideration for the other party. In future consideration, the liability is
outstanding on both sides.
EXAMPLE
X promises to deliver a car to Y after a week, and Y promises to pay the
price at the time of delivery. The consideration is future.
5. Not necessarily Adequate
It is not necessary that the consideration is equal in value to the promise.
The law insists on the presence of consideration and not on its adequacy. The
parties are free to decide the value of consideration. However, inadequate
consideration may create a doubt about the free consent of the parties. But if the
consent is proved to be free, inadequate consideration is valid.
EXAMPLE
A agrees to sell his car worth Rs. 2 lac for Rs. 50,000 and his consent is
free. The contract is valid.
6. Real and Competent
It is necessary that the consideration is real and competent. A
consideration is not considered valid if it is physically impossible, illegal,
uncertain or unreal.
a. Physically Impossible
A promise to do something which is physically impossible.
EXAMPLE
Lac.
A promises to put life in B's dead brother and B promises to pay him Rs. 1
b. Legally Impossible
A promise to do something which is illegal.
EXAMPLE
A promises to pay Rs. 1 Lac to B on his promise to beat C.
c. Uncertain Consideration
A promise to do something which is uncertain.
EXAMPLE
amount.
A employs B for a certain work and promises to pay a reasonable
d. Unreal Consideration
Consideration is unreal if it consists of a promise to perform a duty which
a person is already responsible to perform under a law.

Consideration and Object
EXAMPLE
31
C was summoned to give evidence in court for G. G promised to pay
some amount. G refused to pay. C sued. Held, that consideration was unreal as
it was C's duty to give evidence. (Collins vs. Godefroy)4
Exceptions to Consideration
According to law, agreement without consideration is void. Following are
the agreements which are valid even without consideration:
1. Natural Love and Affection
The agreement which is expressed in writing and registered under the law
and is made on account of natural love and affection between the parties
standing in a near relation to each other is enforceable even if there is no
consideration. The contract without consideration shall be valid if following
conditions are satisfied: (Sec. 25)
a. The contract is in writing.
b. The contract is registered.
c. The contract is made on account of natural love and affection.
d. There must be near relation between the parties to the contract.
EXAMPLES
a. A promises to give Rs. 1000 to B for no consideration. It is a void agreement.
b. F, on account of natural love and affection, promises to give Rs. 1 Lac to his
son S. F puts it in writing and gets it registered. S can enforce it.
c. B, due to dispute with his wife R, promised on a registered document to pay
some amount. Later, B refused to pay. R sued for recovery. It was held that
agreement was void because it was not based on natural love and affection.
(Rajlakhi Devi vs. Bhootnath)
2. Voluntary Compensation
If a promise is made to compensate, wholly or in part, a person who has
voluntarily done something for the promisor, is enforceable even though without
consideration. In other words, a promise to pay for a past voluntarily service is
binding. This is an exception to the principle that past consideration is no
consideration. For this exception, the following points should be noted: (Sec.
25(2))
a. The services were rendered voluntarily for the promisor.
b. The promisor must be in existence at the time the services were rendered.
c. The intention of the promisor should be to compensate the promisee.

d. The services rendered must be legal.
EXAMPLES
Consideration and Object
a. A finds B's purse and returns it to him. B promises to give A Rs. 500. This is a
contract.
b. A saves B from drowning in the river and B promises to pay Rs. 10,000 to A.
This is a valid contract.
3. Time-Barred Debt
A debt becomes time-barred if it is not claimed for a period of three years
from the date it becomes due. Where there is an agreement, made in writing and
signed by the debtor to pay wholly or in part a time-barred debt, the agreement is
valid even though it is not supported by any consideration. Such an agreement is
valid if the following conditions are fulfilled. (Sec. 25(3))
a. The debt must be time-barred.
b. The promisor himself must be liable for the debt.
c. There must be an express promise to pay a time-barred debt.
d. The promise must be in writing and signed by the debtor or his agent.
EXAMPLE
A owes B Rs. 1000, but the debt becomes barred. A signs a written
promise to pay B Rs. 500 on account of the debt. It is a contract.
4. Completed Gift
A gift does not require consideration in order to be valid. Any gift given
will be valid between the donor and donee even though without consideration.
There need not be natural love and affection or nearness of relationship between
the donor and donee. The gift must be complete, and it is said to be completed
when possession is given to the donee by the donor. (Sec. 25 Explanation 1)
EXAMPLE
A gifted a watch to B on his birthday. Later, A cannot get his watch back
on the ground that there was no consideration for him.
5. Contract of Agency
Consideration is not necessary to create an agency. Generally, an agent
gets commission for his services. If the agent promises to perform any act for his
principal without charging any commission, the agreement is valid even without
consideration. (Sec. 185)
EXAMPLE
A promises to sell B's house on his behalf. An agreement between A and
B is valid even without consideration.
6. Remission by Promisee
When a person agrees to receive less than what is due, it is known as
remission. If a creditor agrees to give up a part of his claim, there is no need of
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 40

Consideration and Object
33
consideration for such an agreement. Similarly, an agreement to extend time for
performance of a contract need not be supported by consideration. (Sec. 63)
EXAMPLE
A owes B 5,000 rupees. A pays Rs. 2,000 to B and B accepts it in full
satisfaction of the whole debt. The whole debt is discharged.
Doctrine of Privity of Contract
Privity of contract means relationship existing between the parties who
have entered into agreement. There are two consequences of the doctrine of
privity of contract.
1. A person who is not a party to a contract cannot sue upon it even though the
contract is for his benefit and he provided consideration.
EXAMPLE
X owes Rs. 1 Lac to Y. X sells his house to B for Rs. 1 Lac and asks B to
pay to Y. B fails to pay. Y cannot sue B because he is not a party to the contract.
2. A contract cannot confer rights or impose obligations arising under it on any
person other than the parties to it.
EXAMPLE
Dunlop sold tyres to D, on the condition that he will not sell the tyres to
the public below Dunlop's list price. D. sold tyres to S on this condition. S sold
them below the list price. It was held that the Dunlops could not sue S as he was
a stranger to the contract. (Dunlop Tyres Co. vs. Selfridges Ltd.)
Stranger to Contract
A person who is not a party to the contract is called stranger to the
contract. A stranger to the contract cannot sue because he has no privity of
contract. The above rule is subject to the following exceptions:
1. Trust
In case of trust, the beneficiary can sue to enforce his rights under the
trust although he is not a party to the contract.
EXAMPLES
a. A transfers some property to B under trust for the benefit of M. M. can
enforce the agreement. (M. K. Ropai vs John)
b. An addressee of an insured article can sue the Post Office in case of loss
because on receipt of article, the Post Office becomes trustee for the
addressee. (Amir Ullah vs. Central Government)

2. Agreements relating to Immovable Property
Consideration and Object
Owner of a property may be entitled to certain rights and obligations
created by an agreement affecting the property. When a person purchases such
property with the notice of rights and obligations of the owner, he is bound by
those rights and obligations although he is not a party to the original agreement.
EXAMPLE
A buys a house through HBFC loan. A sells the house to X without
returning the loan to HBFC. HBFC can sue X.
3. Family Settlements
Where provision is made for the marriage, partition or other family
arrangements for the benefit of any member of a family, such member though not
party to the agreements, can enforce the agreements.
EXAMPLE
On a partition of joint property, two brothers agreed to pay
Rs. 300 to their mother for her maintenance. Held, she was entitled to recover.
(Shuppu vs. Ammal)
4. Agent
Where a person acts as agent for his principal, the principal can sue on a
contract although he is not a party to a contract.
EXAMPLE
A appoints B as his agent to sell goods. B sells goods to X. X can sue A
for defective goods though there is no direct contract between A and X.
5. Assignment
In assignment of rights under a contract in favour of a third party
voluntarily or by operation of law, the assignee can enforce the contract.
EXAMPLE
A assigned his insurance policy in favour of his wife. The wife can enforce
it although she is not a party to the contract.
Unlawful Considerations and Objects
For the valid agreement, the object and consideration of an agreement
must be lawful. If the consideration or object of a contract is unlawful the
agreement is illegal and therefore void.
The words 'object' and 'consideration' are different from each other. The
word object means purpose. While the consideration means the price for which
the promise of the other is taken. Sometimes the object of a contract may be
illegal though its consideration is lawful,

Consideration and Object
EXAMPLE
35
A takes a house from B on rent. It is lawful. If A wants to store illegal arms
in the house, the agreement is unlawful due to unlawful object.
According to section 23 the consideration or object of an agreement is
unlawful in the following cases:
1. Forbidden by Law
If the consideration or object of an agreement is forbidden by law, the
agreement is unlawful and void. An act is forbidden by law:
a. When it is punishable by the Criminal Law of the country, or
b. When it is prohibited by special act of legislature.
EXAMPLES
a. B and C agree to divide the goods obtained by theft. The agreement is
unlawful.
b. The sale of liquor without license is illegal and so void.
c. Agreement to sell above the price fixed by the law is illegal and void.
(Sita Ram vs. Kunj Lal)⁹
2. Defeats Provisions of Law
If the object or consideration of an agreement is of such a nature that if
permitted it would defeat the provisions of any law, then it is considered illegal.
Such objects or considerations may not be directly forbidden by law but they will
indirectly violate law.
EXAMPLE
A fails to pay his loan to HBFC. A's house is sold for recovery of debt.
According to law, A is prohibited from purchasing his house. A asks B to
purchase the house and transfer it back to him. The agreement is void.
3. Fraudulent
If the object or consideration of an agreement is to defraud others, then it
is considered unlawful and void. Where the parties agree to commit a fraud on a
third person, the agreement is illegal.
EXAMPLES
a. A promises to pay Rs. 20,000 to B, on Bs' promise to commit fraud on C. The
agreement is illegal and void.
b. A is the agent of X. A agrees to sell the land to his friend B, at a lesser price
without knowledge of his principal. The agreement between A and B is void
as it is fraud by A against X.

4. Involves Injury to Person or Property
Consideration and Object
If the object or consideration of agreement is to cause an injury to a
person or property of another, then it is illegal and also void. Injury means
criminal or wrongful harm.
EXAMPLES
a. An agreement to put certain property on fire is unlawful and void.
b. An agreement to commit an assault or to beat a man is held unlawful and
void. (Allen vs. Rescous) 10
5. Court regards as Immoral
If the consideration or object of an agreement is such that the court
regards it as immoral, the consideration is void. Immoral means acts which are
against the moral values and also prohibited by law.
EXAMPLE
A married woman was given money to obtain divorce from her husband
and then marry the lender. Woman refused to take divorce. Held, the agreement
was immoral and the lender could not recover the money. (Bai vijli vs. Hamda
Nagar)11
6. Court considers it against Public Policy
An agreement which is harmful for the welfare of the society or the state
is against the public policy. If the court considers the object or consideration of an
agreement as opposed to public policy, then the agreement is unlawful.
An agreement which leads to corruption, injustice or immorality is
considered to be against the public policy. The following agreements are held to
be against public policy:
EXAMPLES
a. The agreements to give money to induce a person to give false evidence.
*b. The agreements to influence judges.
c. The agreements with an alien enemy.
d. The agreements which disturb the friendly relations of the state.
e. The agreements the purpose of which is to influence over the officers of
justice.

CAPACITY OF PARTIES
The contracting parties must be competent to contract. Every person is
competent to contract who is of the age of majority, has sound mind, and is not
disqualified from contracting by any law. A minor, person of unsound mind and
person disqualified by law are incompetent to contract. (Sec. 11)
MINOR
Minor is a person who has not attained 18 years of age. According to
Majority Act, 1875, where a guardian of minor's person or property is appointed
or court of wards take charge of minor's property, a minor will attain the age of
majority after 21 years.
Nature of Minor's Agreements
The law regarding minor's agreements is explained as under:
1. Void Agreement
An agreement with minor is void. A minor is not liable to perform any act
which he has promised because he does not possess the capacity to judge what
is good or bad for him. A minor cannot be compelled to pay back the money
received by him under the agreement. An agreement with a minor does not
create legal rights and duties.
EXAMPLES
a. A, a minor sold his shop to B. The amount was paid to A but the sale deed
could not be registered as A was minor. On a suit by B, it was held that as A
was minor, so agreement was void ab-initio and the amount was not
recoverable. (Shiam Lal vs. Ram Piary)'
b. D, a minor mortgaged his house in favour of M to secure a loan of Rs. 20000.
D received Rs. 8000. M filed a suit for recovery of money and sale of
mortgaged property in case of default. Held that the agreement with minor
was void so M cannot recover the money or sell the minor's mortgaged
property. (Mohori Bibi vs. Dharmo Das Gosh)²
2. Minor and Ratification
Ratification means act of confirming or approving. An agreement made by
a minor cannot be confirmed by him on attaining the age of majority because an

39
agreement which is void from the beginning cannot be made valid by subsequent
confirmation.
EXAMPLE
M, a minor borrowed some money and wrote a pronote for it. On attaining
majority, M wrote a second pronote to settle the first note. It was held that the
second pronote was void for want of consideration. (Suraj Narain vs. Sukhu
Ahir)³
3. Minor and Estoppel
The rule of estoppel does not apply to a minor. It means that a minor is
not estopped from pleading his infancy in order to avoid a contract, even if he
has entered into an agreement by falsely representing that he was of full age. In
other words, where a minor represents fraudulently that he is of full age and
induces another to enter into a contract with him, he is not bound by the contract.
EXAMPLE
M, a minor fraudulently shows that he is of full age and contracts with N to
sell his house. M refuses to perform the contract on the ground that he is a
minor. N cannot sue M. (Sadiq Ali Khan vs. Jai Kishore)
4. Minor and Repayment
A minor cannot be compelled, to repay the money received by him under
an agreement. If anything is recoverable from minor out of the proceeds of the
contract made by fraudulently showing that he was of full age, the court may
compel the minor to return the amount to the other party when the minor himself
brings a suit against the other party. But, if the minor loses the property or
money, he cannot be made responsible to restore.
EXAMPLES
a. M, a minor got Rs. 17,500 as advance and promised to sell the land. Later, M
refused to perform the contract. The court ordered the minor to refund the
amount. (Khan Gull vs. Labha Singh)
b. A minor sold a house for Rs. 50,000 showing that he is an adult. Later, he
sued to cancel the sale on the ground of minority. The court ordered the
minor to return the money received by him. (Jager Nath Singh vs. Lalta
Prasad)
5. Minor and Necessaries
A person who supplies necessaries to a minor or anyone whom the minor
is bound to support, can recover reasonable value of such goods from the

property of a minor. If a minor owns no property, the supplier cannot recover the
price of necessaries.
The necessary article depends upon the status and circumstances of the
minor. If the minor already possesses a necessary at the time when necessary is
supplied to him, the supplier cannot recover value of that necessary. (Sec. 68)
EXAMPLES
a. C supplied necessaries of life to B, a minor. C can recover value from B's
property.
b. C supplies necessaries to the wife and children of B, a minor. C can recover
expenses from B's property.
c. C supplied a coat with diamond buttons to a minor. C cannot recover the
price of coat.
d. A minor purchased 11 coats. He had sufficient clothes at that time. It was
held that the coats were not necessaries of life and minor was not liable to
pay for them. (Nash vs. Inman)
6. Agreement on behalf of Minor
A contract made on behalf of a minor by his guardian is binding on the
minor. It can be enforced against the minor provided the contract is within the
authority of the guardian and for benefit of the minor.
EXAMPLE
A contract of sale of immovable property by the guardian of minor for the
minor's benefit may be enforced by either party to the contract.
(Gujoba Tulsiram vs. Nilkanth)
7. Minor as Beneficiary
A minor is capable of accepting benefit. Any contract is valid which is for
the benefit of a minor and under which the minor is not required to bear any
obligation. The minority of one party to a contract does not affect the other party's
liability.
EXAMPLES
a. A, a minor advanced some amount to B. B mortgaged his property in favour
of A. A can enforce the mortgage if B does not repay the money. (Raghva
Chariar vs. Srinivasa)⁹
b. A, a minor delivered some goods under an agreement to P. P refused to
make the payment. The court held that minor could recover the price. (Abdul

8. Minor as Agent
41
A minor can act as an agent. If a minor works as an agent, he can make
his principal responsible to third parties for his acts. But he cannot be held
personally liable for negligence or breach of duty.
EXAMPLE
A appoints M, a minor as his agent to sell his house. M makes an
agreement with B to sell A's house. The agreement is valid.
9. Minor as Partner
A minor cannot become a partner of a firm. He can be admitted only in
the benefits of the firm through his guardian with the consent of all the partners.
Minor can only inspect the accounts of a firm but not the books. He cannot
participate in the management of the firm. The minor's liability is limited to his
investment in the business.
EXAMPLE
A, B, and C are partners in a firm. In order to make M, a minor a partner,
they make a contract with X who is the guardian of M. M can be admitted to the
benefits of firm.
10. Surety for Minor
When an adult stands surety for a minor in a contract of guarantee, the
adult is liable under the contract but the minor is not answerable. The adult is
responsible because there is direct contract between adult and the third party.
EXAMPLE
is valid.
M, a minor makes a contract with X. S stands surety for M. The contract
11. Minor as Member of Company
A minor cannot directly buy shares of a company because he is not
competent to contract. If parents of a minor are shareholders in a company, the
company can transfer shares in favor of a minor upon the death of parents.
EXAMPLE
D holds shares in a company. D dies and leaves M, a minor as his legal
representative. The company is bound to transfer the shares to M.
12. Minor and Insolvency
A minor cannot be declared insolvent. A minor is not personally liable
even for necessaries supplied to him. Only the minor's property is liable. The
payment cannot be recovered if he has no property. (Sec. 68)

EXAMPLE
Capacity of Parties
M, a minor buys medicines from X. M has no property. M cannot be held
liable for payment. He cannot be declared insolvent.
13. Contract by Minor and Adult
Where a minor and an adult jointly enter into a contract with another
person, the minor has no liability. But the contract as a whole can be enforced
against the adult.
EXAMPLES
a. M, a minor and A jointly make an agreement with X to purchase a car. The
agreement is valid.
b. A minor and adult jointly agreed to pay some amount and executed a bond.
The court held that adult was liable but minor was not liable. (Jamna Bai vs.
Vasanta Rao)11
14. Liability of Minor's Parents
The parents of a minor are not liable for agreements made by the minor
even if the agreement is for the purchase of necessaries. The parents are liable if
the minor acts as an agent of the parents.
EXAMPLE
F sends his son M, a minor to buy goods from S. M buys goods from S. F
is liable for payment.
15. Minor and Negotiable Instruments
A minor can make, draw, endorse and deliver bill of exchange,
promissory note and cheque to bind other parties except himself. He himself is
not liable but all other parties to the instrument are liable in their respective
capacities.
EXAMPLES
a. M, a minor draws a bill of exchange on A. A accepts the bill. M endorses it to
C. The bill is valid.
b. X draws a bill on Y, a minor. Y accepts the bill. The bill is invalid.
PERSON OF UNSOUND MIND
For a valid contract, it is necessary that each party to the contract must
have a sound mind'. (Sec. 11)
Sound Mind
Section 12 states that: "A person is said to be of sound mind for the
purpose of making a contract if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of
understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his
11

43
interests. A person, who is usually of unsound mind but occasionally of sound
mind, may make a contract when he is of sound mind. A person, who is usually
of sound mind but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a contract when
he is of unsound mind."
It means that a person must be able to understand the nature of contract.
He should be able to make a rational judgment that whether the contract is
profitable or not. A person who is temporarily of unsound mind cannot make a
contract during such period. However, he can make a contract when he becomes
of sound mind. A person may become of unsound mind due to idiocy, insanity,
drunkenness, hypnotism, old age, etc.
EXAMPLES
a. A, a sane man who becomes temporary insane due to drug overdose, sells
his scooter to B. The agreement is void.
b. S agreed to sell property worth Rs. 25,000 for Rs. 7,000. His mother proved
that he was an idiot by birth. The agreement was held to be void. (Inder Singh
vs. Parmeshwardhari Singh)12
Effect on Agreement
An agreement by a person of unsound mind is void but he can get benefit
under it. However, the person who supplies necessaries to a person of unsound
mind or anyone whom he is legally bound to support, can recover reasonable
value of those necessaries from the property of such person. If the person of
unsound mind owns no property, then the supplier cannot recover. (Sec 68)
Burden of Proof
If a person is usually of sound mind, the burden of proving that he was of

FREE CONSENT
Consent
An agreement is valid when it is made with free consent of the parties.
According to Section 13, two or more persons are said to consent when they
agree upon the same thing in the same sense.
Definition of Free Consent
According to Section 14, consent is said to be free when it is not caused
by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake.
In other words, when the consent is obtained by coercion, undue
influence, misrepresentation or fraud, the contract is voidable at the option of the
aggrieved party. Consent is not free when it is obtained by the following means:
Definition
COERCION
Section 15 defines coercion as, "Coercion is the committing or
threatening to commit any act forbidden by the Pakistan Penal Code, or the
unlawful detaining or threatening to detain any property, to the prejudice of any
person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an
agreement."
The Explanation to the Section states that, "It is immaterial whether the
Pakistan Penal Code is or is not in force in the place where the coercion is
employed." The above definition can be analyzed as follows:
1. Commit or threat to commit
If a person commits or threatens to commit any act which is forbidden by
the Pakistan Penal Code to compel the other party to enter into a contract, is a
contract made under coercion.
EXAMPLES
a. W threatens to shoot M, if he does not give his house on rent. M agrees. The
consent of M is obtained by coercion.
b. A widow was threatened to adopt a boy otherwise her husband's dead body
would not be allowed to be removed for cremation. The widow adopted the
boy and later applied for cancellation of adoption. Held, that agreement was
not binding. (Ranganayakamma vs. Alwarsetti)'

Free Consent
2. Detain or threat to detain Property
47
If a person unlawfully detains or threatens to detain the property of
another person to compel him to enter into an agreement, the agreement is
voidable at the option of aggrieved party.
EXAMPLES
a. An agent refused to hand over the account books to the new agent unless the
principal released him from all liabilities. The principal gave a release deed. It
was held that the release deed was given under coercion. (Muthia vs.
Karuppan)²
b. The government threatened to seize the property of A to recover the fine due
from B, the son of A. A paid the fine. It was held that fine was recovered by
coercion. (Bansraj vs. Secy. of State)³
3. Threat to Third Party
The threats may be directed against third persons who are near relatives
of the person making the contract. Thus, a threat to injure one's parents, child,
husband, wife, brother, etc. is considered as coercion. Coercion need not be
exercised only by the contracting party; it can be exercised by any person related
to that party.
EXAMPLES
a. C threatens to kidnap B's son if he does not give him Rs. 2 Lac. B agrees.
The agreement is made by coercion.
b. D threatens to shoot B if he does not lend his house to C. B agrees. B's
consent is obtained by coercion.
4. Enforcement of Pakistan Penal Code
It does not matter whether Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 is or is not in force
in the place where the coercion is employed. If the suit is filed in Pakistan, the
provisions of PPC will apply.
EXAMPLE
C forced B to enter into an agreement on a ship near Jeddah. Afterwards,
B sued C for breach of contract at Karachi High Court. C has employed coercion
although Pakistan Penal Code was not in force at Jeddah.
Effects of Coercion
The effect of coercion is as under: (Sec. 19 & 72)
1. The contract is voidable at the option of the party whose consent is obtained
by coercion.

Free Consent
2. When the aggrieved party decides to cancel the contract, he must return the
benefit received from the other party.
3. The other party to whom money was paid or anything delivered under
coercion must repay or return it.
4. If the aggrieved party does not decide to cancel the contract, it remains a
valid contract.
Burden of Proof
The burden of proof that coercion was used lies on the party who wants
to cancel the contract. He has to prove that he would not have entered into a
contract, if the coercion had not been used.
Definition
UNDUE INFLUENCE
The term undue influence means the unfair use of one's superior power in
order to obtain the consent of person who is in a weaker position. It is described
under section 16 (1 & 2) as follows:
1. Section. 16(1)
It defines undue influence as, "A contract is said to be induced by undue
influence where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of
the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that position
to obtain an unfair advantage over the other." It is further explained as follows:
a. Position to Dominate
In order to prove undue influence the relations existing between the
parties should be such that one of them must be in a position to dominate the will
of the other party. The person in a superior position may obtain the consent of
other party.
EXAMPLE
U, a spiritual adviser induced his follower M, to gift him his property to
secure benefits in the next world. It was held that gift was obtained by undue
influence as U was in a position to dominate. (Mannu Singh vs. Umadat Pandey)
b. Unfair Advantage
In order to prove undue influence, it is necessary that the party who is in a
dominating position must have used his position to obtain an unfair advantage
from the other party.
EXAMPLE
A, having advanced money to his son B, obtains a bond for an amount
greater than the sum advanced by misuse of parental influence. A obtains unfair
advantage.

Free Consent
2. Section 16(2)
follows:
49
A person is deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of another as
1. Where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other.
2. Where he stands in a fiduciary relation to the other.
3. Where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is
temporarily or permanently affected by reason of age, illness, mental or
bodily distress, etc.
It is further explained as under:
a. Real or Apparent Authority
A person in authority can dominate the will of the person over whom the
authority is held. The authority may be real or apparent. For example, authority of
income tax officer over an assessee, authority of police officer over an accused
person.
EXAMPLE
A, a police officer bought a property worth Rs. 1 Lac for Rs. 5,000 from B,
an accused under his custody. Later, B sued to cancel the contract. A is in a
position to dominate the will of B.
b. Fiduciary Relation
Fiduciary relation is a relationship of mutual trust and confidence. It exists
in case of father and son, guardian and minor, advocate and client, doctor and
patient, religious adviser and follower, etc.
EXAMPLE
An illiterate elderly woman made a deed of gift of her whole property to
her nephew who managed her estate. The deed was cancelled on the ground of
undue influence. (I Gariah vs. Shaikh Allie Bin Omar)
c. Mental Distress
A person is said to be in distress when his mental capacity is temporarily
or permanently affected. It may be due to old age, mental or physical illness, etc.
Such a person is easily persuaded to give consent to a contract which may be
unfavourable to him.
EXAMPLE
A moneylender gave a loan at 100% interest to a needy widow. It was
held that undue influence was used and the court reduced the interest to 24%.

Presumption of Undue Influence
Free Consent
It is presumed that the dominating person has exercised undue influence
in these cases: father and son, guardian and minor, doctor and patient, advocate
and client, trustee and beneficiary, spiritual adviser and follower, teacher and
student, master and servant.
Burden of Proof
In these cases, the burden of proof lies on the dominating person. He can
disprove the presumption by arguing that;
1. The facts were fully disclosed.
2. The price was enough.
3. The dominated party was in a position to receive independent advice.
4. The dominated party gave his free consent.
No Presumption of Undue Influence
It is not presumed that the dominating person has used undue influence
in these cases: husband and wife, landlord and tenant, creditor and debtor,
principal and agent, mother and daughter.
Burden of Proof
In these cases, the weaker party will prove that undue influence has been
exercised over him.
Effect of Undue Influence
The effects of under influence are as follows: (Sec. 19A)
1. The agreement is voidable at the option of the party whose consent was
taken by under influence.
2. The court may direct the aggrieved party to refund the benefit or cancel the
contract
3. If the aggrieved party does not cancel the contract, it remains a valid contract.
Contract with Pardahnashin Lady
A Pardahnashin lady is one who is illiterate, ignorant and observes
complete seclusion (pardah) according to the custom of her family. If a lady
keeps her face covered but transacts her own business, collects rents from her
tenants and deals with persons who are not members of her family, then she
cannot be regarded as pardahnashin. There is a presumption of undue influence
in a contract with a pardahnashin lady. Such lady can avoid contract on the plea
of undue influence.

A lady appeared before the Registrar for registration of certain documents
and gave evidence in a suit. The court held that she could not be treated as a
pardahnashin lady. (Shaik Ismail vs. Amir Bibi)
Burden of Proof
In case of contract with pardahnashin lady, it is the duty of other party to
prove that no undue influence was applied by him. In order to disprove the undue
influence, the other party must satisfy the court that:
1. The terms and conditions of the contract were fully explained to her.
2. She was aware of the results of the contract.
3. She was free to get independent advice regarding the contract.
4. She gave her free consent to execute the contract.

8. Punishment

It does not involve criminal liability.
FRAUD
The term fraud includes all acts committed by a party to induce the other
party to enter into a contract with an intention to deceive.
Definition
Section 17 states, "Fraud means and includes any of the following acts
committed by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent, with
intent to deceive another party thereto or his agent or to induce him to enter into
the contract:
1. The suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not
believe it to be true.
2. The active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge of the fact.
3.
promise made without any intention of performing it.
4. Any other act fitted to deceive.
5. Any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent."
As per section 17, there is fraud in the following cases:
1. False Statement
When a party to the contract makes a false statement intentionally, he
can be held liable for fraud. If a person honestly believes his statement to be
true, he cannot be held liable for fraud.
EXAMPLES
a. A tells B, knowing to be false, that his factory produces 500 pounds of butter
per day. B agrees to buy. A is guilty of fraud.
b. A knows that his watch has been made in Pakistan but tells B that it has been
made in Japan. B buys the watch. A is guilty of fraud.
2. Active Concealment
When the party to the contract conceals material facts essential to the
contract, which he is under an obligation to disclose to the other party before

53
entering into a contract, he is guilty of fraud. The seller is bound to disclose to the
buyer about the faults in the goods he is selling.
EXAMPLE
A sells his house to B. The house has cracked walls. A fills it up to
conceal the defect. B cannot find the defect. A is guilty of fraud.
3. Intentional Non-performance
When a person enters into a contract with no intention to perform his part
of promise, it is considered an act of fraud.
EXAMPLES
a. X purchases goods from Y on credit without any intention of paying as he is
about to be declared insolvent. X is guilty of fraud.
b. B, knowing that he has no money, takes a meal in a hotel with an intention of
slipping away. B is guilty of fraud.
4. Intention to Deceive
Act fitted to deceive means any act which is done with the intention of
committing fraud. It includes all cases which are not covered by other clauses. A
person can adopt different methods to deceive the other party. Therefore, it is
difficult to explain all the methods under the definition of fraud.
EXAMPLE
A company issued prospectus containing a statement that company paid
dividend between 2001 and 2007. In fact, the company suffered losses in those
years and paid dividend out of secret reserves. The company is guilty of fraud.
5. Act or Omission
In certain cases, it is obligatory to disclose relevant facts to the other
party. Under section 55 of the Transfer of Property Act, the seller is bound to
disclose to the buyer all material defects about the property. If a person does not
disclose the relevant facts, he is guilty of fraud.
EXAMPLE
A sold his house to B for Rs. 1 Lac. The house was mortgaged with C for
Rs. 10,000. A did not inform B about it. Later, C claimed Rs. 10,000 from B. B
can avoid the contract as A is guilty of fraud by silence.
Essentials of Fraud
The following are essentials of fraud:
1. The representation must be false.
2. The representation must relate to a fact.
3. The representation was made to induce the other party to contract.
4. The representation was made with the knowledge of its being false.
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 61
www.AccountancyPoint.com
54
5. The representation was made before formation of the contract.
6. The other party must have relied upon the representation.
7. The other party was deceived by the fraud.
8. The other party must have suffered a loss.
Effect of Fraud
The following remedies are available to the aggrieved party:
1. He can avoid the contract.
2. He can sue for damages.
3. He can ask for specific performance and restoration
Burden of Proof
Free Consent
The burden of proof that fraud was committed lies on the party who wants
to set aside the contract on basis of fraud.
Silence as Fraud
Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a person to enter
into a contract is not fraud, unless the circumstances of the case are such that,
regard being had to them, it is the duty of the person keeping silence to speak, or
unless his silence is in itself equivalent to speech. (Sec. 17 Explanation)
Exception
The following are exceptions to the above mentioned rule:
1. Duty to Speak
When there is duty to speak and the person does not say the thing he is
bound to say, it is an act of fraud. But there is no obligation to disclose the thing
which is already known to the other party.
EXAMPLE
A sells his horse to his son S. The horse is sick. A does not tell S about
the health of horse. S can avoid the contract because A was bound to tell S
about the health of horse.
2. Silence is equivalent to Speech
When the circumstances are such that silence is in itself equivalent to
speech, there is no fraud.
EXAMPLE
B says to A, "if you do not deny it, I shall assume that horse is healthy." A
says nothing. Here A's silence is equivalent to speech. If the horse is unhealthy,
A's silence amounts to fraud.
MISREPRESENTATION
Misrepresentation means an innocent misstatement of fact about the
contract, made by one party to induce the other party to enter into a contract.
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 62
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Free Consent
Definition
According to Section 18, misrepresentation includes:
55
1. The positive assertion in a manner not warranted by the information of the
person making it, of that which is not true, though he believes it to be true;
2. Any breach of duty which without an intent to deceive, gains an advantage to
the person committing it, or any one claiming under him, by misleading
another to his prejudice or to the prejudice of anyone claiming under him;
3. Causing, however, innocently a party to an agreement to make a mistake as
to the substance of the thing which is the subject of the agreement.
There is misrepresentation in the following cases:
1. Unwarranted Positive Assertion
The positive assertion means an absolute, full and clear statement of a
fact. There is misrepresentation when a person makes a clear statement of facts
about the contract without any reasonable justification, believing it to be true
though it is not true.
EXAMPLES
a. A tells B that my land produces 4000 kg of wheat per acre. A believes it to be
true. B buys it. Later, it appears that the land produces 1000 kg of wheat per
acre. This is a misrepresentation.
b. A sold a mine to M and told certain facts about the mine which were incorrect.
A believed them to be true. Later, M discovered the real facts. This is a
misrepresentation (Sheffield Nickel Co. vs. Unvin)
2. Breach of Duty
A person commits breach of duty when it brings advantage to him and
loss to the other party. Breach of duty will be considered misrepresentation if it is
done without any intention to deceive the other party. It includes all those cases
where one party is under legal obligation to disclose all material facts to the other
party.
EXAMPLE
A told B that the monthly sale of his business was Rs. 50,000 before the
contract was signed. The sales decreased to Rs.25000. A did not inform B about
the decrease in sales. Held, that there was misrepresentation. (With vs.

3. Induce Mistake
Free Consent
If a party to an agreement induces the other party, although innocently, to
commit a mistake as to the nature or quality of subject matter of the agreement,
he becomes guilty of misrepresentation.
EXAMPLE
The seller told the buyer that the motorcycle was free from defects. But
there was an inbuilt defect in it. The buyer purchased the motorcycle. There is a
misrepresentation.
Essentials of Misrepresentation
The following conditions are necessary to prove misrepresentation:
It must be made innocently and the person making it honestly believes it to
be true.
2. It must relate to the fact essential to the contract. Mere expression of opinion
is not misrepresentation.
3. The statement made must be untrue.
4. It must induce the other party to enter into a contract.
5. It must be made without any desire to deceive the other party.
6. The other party must suffer a loss.
7. The other party cannot discover the truth by ordinary diligence.
Effects of Misrepresentation
The following remedies are available to aggrieved party:
1. He can rescind the contract.
2. He can accept the contract and ask the other party for restoration.
The aggrieved party loses the rights in the following cases:
1. If consent was given with the knowledge of misrepresentation.
2. If third party has acquired rights in the subject matter of contract in good faith
and for value.
3. If the aggrieved party could discover the truth with ordinary diligence.
Burden of Proof
The burden of proof that misrepresentation was used lies on the party
who wants to set aside the contract on ground of misrepresentation.
Contracts of Utmost Good Faith
The following contracts are the contracts of utmost good faith:
1. Fiduciary Relationship
Fiduciary relationship means a relationship of trust and confidence. Such
a relationship is supposed to exist in these cases i.e. father and son, guardian

57
and minor, doctor and patient, etc. In such cases, the person having the
dominating position must make full disclosure of facts essential to the contract.
2. Contract of Insurance
Contract of Insurance is a contract in which the insured knows more
about the subject matter of the contract than the insurer. Thus, it is the duty of
the insured to disclose all material facts which might influence the insurance
company to enter into the contract or in fixing the amount of premium. The
concealment or misstatement of a material fact will render the contract voidable.
3. Contract of Purchase of Shares
The promoters and directors, who issue the prospectus of a company to
invite the public to buy shares and debentures, possess information which is not
available to the general public. They must disclose all facts regarding the
company so that the investors have complete information while making an
investment.
4. Contract of Sale of Land
In case of contract for sale of land, the seller is bound to disclose all
material defects in the property which are within his knowledge. These are the
defects about which the buyer is not aware of and which the buyer cannot
discover with ordinary diligence.
5. Contract of Partnership
In case of Partnership, it is the duty of a partner to provide true accounts
and full information of all matters regarding the partnership firm to rest of the
partners.
6. Contract of Guarantee
According to Section 143, any guarantee which the creditor obtains by
remaining silent as to material circumstances is invalid. A creditor must disclose
all material facts to the surety.
7. Contract of Marriage Engagement
Every material fact must be disclosed by both parties to a contract of
marriage otherwise the aggrieved party is justified in breaking off the marriage
engagement.
8. Contract of Family Settlements

5.Truth
In case of fraud, the aggrieved party
can avoid contract even if it had the
means to discover the truth with
ordinary diligence.
Loss of Right of Cancellation
In case of misrepresentation, the
aggrieved party cannot avoid contract if
it had means to discover the truth with
ordinary diligence.
Right of cancellation or rescission is lost in the following cases:
1. Affirmation
After becoming aware of his right to rescind, if the aggrieved party
confirms the transaction either by express words or by an act, the right of
rescission is lost.
EXAMPLE
B purchases shares on the faith of a misleading prospectus of S
Company. B becomes aware of its falsity but accepts the dividends paid by
company. B cannot avoid the contract.
2. Restitution not Possible
The right to rescission is lost, if the aggrieved party is not in a position to
restore the benefits obtained by him under the contract, i.e. the subject matter of
the contract has been consumed or destroyed.
EXAMPLE
B buys apples from C by fraud. B eats all the apples. C cannot avoid the
contract.

3. Lapse of Time

dup If the aggrieved party fails to reject the contact within reasonable time on
discovering the false representation or on becoming aware of the fraud, the right
of rescission is lost.
EXAMPLE
X buys a T.V. from Y by fraud. Despite knowledge of the fraud, Y does
not reject the contract. Y loses his right to avoid the contract after a reasonable
time.
4. Rights of Third Party
The right of rescission is lost, the third party acting in good faith has
acquired the rights in the subject matter of the contract.
EXAMPLE
A buys a watch from B by fraud, and sells it to C. C buys the watch in
good faith. B's right to cancel the contract is lost since C gets rights in the subject
matter of the contract.
MISTAKE
When the parties give their consent under any mistake, there is no
agreement. It means that there should be consensus ad-idem. Mistake can be
divided into two types: (1) mistake of fact and (2) mistake of law
MISTAKE OF FACT
Mistake of fact may be (1) bilateral mistake (2) unilateral mistake.
1. Bilateral Mistake
According to Section 20, where both the parties to an agreement are
under a mistake as to the matter of fact essential to the agreement, there is a
bilateral mistake and the agreement is void. Explanation of section 20 states that
"an erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject matter
of the agreement is not to be deemed a mistake of fact." The following conditions
must be fulfilled to avoid a contract:
a. There must be a mistake as to the formation of contract.
b. The mistake must made by both the parties.
c. It must be a mistake of fact and not a judgment or opinion.
d. It must be about a fact essential to the agreement.
EXAMPLES
a.. A contracts B to sell his car. Both the parties think it is in A's garage. The car
was stolen before the agreement. The agreement is void.
b. A buys a car from B for Rs. 4 Lac. Later, A discovers that the actual value is
Rs. 2 Lac. A cannot avoid the contract.
A bilateral mistake may be of the following types:

60
a. Existence of Subject matter
Free Consent
The parties may be mistaken as to the existence of subject matter. If both
the parties believe the subject matter of contract to be in existence at the time of
contract, but in fact it is not in existence, there is no contract.
EXAMPLES
a. A agrees to buy a horse from B. It turns out that the horse was dead at the
time of bargain but neither party was aware of this fact. The agreement is
void.
b. H was employed to sell C's cargo which was being transported by sea. H sold
the cargo. Later, it was discovered that the cargo had been damaged and
sold at the nearest port. The buyer rejected the contract and sued for
damages. H was held not liable. (Couturier vs. Hastie) 10
b. Identity of Subject matter
When there is a mutual mistake as to the identity of the subject matter,
the agreement is void. When one party has one thing in mind while the other has
another thing, there is no consensus ad idem and no contract.
EXAMPLES
a. A agrees to buy a transformer from B. A thinks he is buying a 1-phase
transformer while B thinks he is selling a 3-phase transformer. There is no
contract.
b. W agreed to buy cotton from R. The cotton was to arrive on ship named P.
Two ships of that name were sailing, one in October and other in December.
W meant the former ship but R meant the latter. It was held that there was no
contract. (Raffles vs. Wichelhaus)¹¹
c. Ownership of Subject matter
Parties to a contract are under a mistake as to the ownership of subject
matter, if unknown to both the parties, the buyer is already the owner of the
subject matter of contract.
EXAMPLE
A agreed to take a fishery from B on lease. Both parties believed that B
was the owner. Later, it was discovered that the fishery belonged to A. Held, that
the agreement was void. (Cooper vs Pahibbs) 12

Free Consent
d. Quantity of Subject matter
61
There is no contract if there is difference between the quantity sold or
purchased. If both the parties are under a mistake as to the quantity of the
subject matter, the agreement is void.
EXAMPLE
P examined 50 rifles in a shop. Later, P sent an order by telegraph, "Send
three rifles". H, the clerk, by mistake read the message as "Send the rifles". H
sent 50 rifles. P accepted 3 and returned 47 rifles. H filed a suit for damages. It
was held that there was no contract. (Henkel vs. Pope) 13
e. Quality of Subject matter
When both the parties are under a mistake regarding the quality of
subject matter, the agreement is void.
EXAMPLE
C contracts to sell B a horse which both parties believe to be a race
horse. Later, it turns out to be a cart horse. The agreement is void.
f. Possibility of Performance
The agreement is void where there is a bilateral mistake as to the
possibility of performance. In other words, where the parties to an agreement
believe that the agreement is capable of performance but in fact it is not, the
agreement is void.
EXAMPLE
A and B, believing themselves to be married, made a separation
agreement in which A agreed to pay B £1 every week. Later, it was discovered
that they were not validly married. B claimed the promised payment. It was held
that the agreement was void. (Galloway vs. Galloway) 14
2. Unilateral Mistake
When only one party is at a mistake regarding the terms of the
agreement, it is called a unilateral mistake. Section 22 states that "a contract is
not voidable merely because it was caused by one of the parties to it being under
a mistake as to a matter of fact." The effect of unilateral mistake on contracts is
as follows:
a. Valid Contract
If a person makes a wrong contract due to his own negligence or
carelessness, he himself is responsible and cannot avoid the contract. A
unilateral mistake has no effect on the contract and the contract remains valid.

EXAMPLES
Free Consent
a. X buys rice from Y, thinking that the rice is old. However, the rice is new. X
cannot avoid the contract.
b. The government auctioned the right of fishery. A offered the highest bid
thinking that the right was being sold for 3 years but in fact it was for only 1
year. A cannot avoid the contract. (A. A. Singh vs. Union of India) 15
b. Voidable Contract
If the unilateral mistake is caused by fraud or misrepresentation etc, on
the part of the other party, the contract is voidable and can be avoided by the
aggrieved party.
EXAMPLE
A sold a house to B. The house had cracked walls. A tried to conceal the
defect but B discovered it. A is guilty of fraud. B can avoid the contract.
c. Void Agreement
A void agreement is not enforceable by law. In the following cases, no
contract will arise under a unilateral mistake:
i. Identity of Party
When the intention of the party is to enter into a contract with a particular
person, but by mistake the party enters into a contract with another person, the
agreement is void. When the intention of the party is not to enter into a contract
with a particular person, but by mistake the party enters into a contract with that
particular person, the agreement is void
EXAMPLES
a. A wants to contract with B but makes a contract with C, believing him to be B.
The contract is void.
b. B, the director of a theater, gave instructions that no ticket should be sold to S
who was critic of the plays. S got a ticket through his friend. S went to the
theater but was refused admission. S filed a suit for damages. It was held that
there was no contract because the theater company never wanted to contract
with S. (Said vs. Butt) 16
ii. Nature of Contract
When one of the parties to a contract without any fault of his own, is
made to commit a mistake as to the nature of contract, the agreement is void.

M, an old illiterate man of poor sight, was induced to sign a bill of

MISTAKE OF LAW
Mistake of law may be (1) mistake of Pakistani law or (2) mistake of
foreign law.
1.. Pakistani Law
If there is a mistake of law of the country, the contract is binding because
every one is supposed to know the law of his country. Therefore, the mistake of
Pakistani Law does not affect the validity of the contract. A contract is not
voidable because it was caused by a mistake as to any law in force in Pakistan.
Sec (21)
EXAMPLES
a. A and B make a contract which is based on erroneous belief that a particular
debt is barred by Pakistani Law of limitation. The contract is valid.
b. If someone is caught traveling without ticket in a bus, he cannot be excused
on the ground that he was not aware that the ticket is necessary for the
journey.
2. Foreign Law
A mistake as to a law not in force in Pakistan (a foreign law) has the
same effect as a mistake of fact. The law of foreign country requires to be proved
in Pakistani courts as ordinary facts and such mistake makes the contract void.
(Sec. 21)
EXAMPLE
A, a Pakistani, agrees to sell a particular medicine to B, a foreign national.
The law of that country has banned the sale and purchase of that particular
medicine. This is a mistake and the agreement is void.

VOID AGREEMENT
Void Agreement
An agreement not enforceable by law is called a void agreement. A void
agreement does not give rise to any legal consequences and is void ab-initio
(from the beginning). (Sec. 2 (g))
An agreement, in order to become a valid contract, must not be one of
those that are 'expressly declared' to be void by the law. The agreements that
are expressly declared to be void are as follows: (Sec. 10)
1. Agreement in Restraint of Marriage
Every agreement in restraint of the marriage of any person other than a
minor is void. It means that any agreement which prevents a person from
marrying is void. Thus, if a Muslim having two living wives promises any of his
wives not to marry again, then the agreement is void. A promise to marry a
particular person is not considered restraint of marriage. (Sec. 26)
EXAMPLES
a. A agrees with B that she will not marry C. It is a void agreement.
b. A promises his father F that he will marry B. It is a valid contract.
c. P promised to marry L only and to pay Rs. 2000 to L if he married someone
else. Later, P married X. Held, L could not recover the sum as the agreement
was in restraint of marriage. (Lowe vs. Peers)'
2. Agreement in Restraint of Trade
Every agreement by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful
profession, trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void. An agreement
that interferes with a person's right to engage in any lawful trade, occupation or
profession is called an 'agreement in restraint of lawful business'. Every person
has a right to carry on any lawful trade, business or profession. (Sec. 27)
EXAMPLE
An agreement in which one party agrees to close his business against the
promise of the other party to pay some amount is void, as it is an agreement in
restraint of lawful business. (Madhub Chander vs. Rajkumar)²

Exceptions
Void Agreement
Following are the exceptions to agreements in restraint of trade:
a. Sale of Goodwill
The seller of goodwill of a business may agree with the buyer on the
following conditions:
1. He can be restrained from carrying on a similar business.
2. The restraint will continue till the buyer carries on the business.
3. The restraint will be restricted to specified local limits.
4. The limits must be reasonable in the eye of the courts.
EXAMPLES
a. A sells his bakery to B with goodwill of Rs. 1 lac and agrees not to open a
bakery anywhere in Pakistan. The agreement is unreasonable and so void.
b. C sells his business of imitation jewelry in London to D and promises that for
two years he will not deal in (a) imitation jewelry in UK, (b) real jewelry in UK
and (c) real or imitation jewelry in UK, France, USA, Russian or Spain. The
first promise is held valid. The remaining promises are held void as they are
unreasonable. (Goldsoll vs. Goldman)³
b. Partner's Agreement
The following agreements are not considered in restraint of trade:
1. A partner may agree not to carry on a business similar to that of a partnership
while he is a partner.
2. A retiring partner may agree with other partners that he will not carry on a
similar business within a specified period or specified local limits.
3. In anticipation of dissolution of the firm, the partners may agree that some or
all of them will not carry on a similar business within a specified period or
specified local limits.
4. On the sale of goodwill, any partner may agree with the buyer not to carry on
similar business within a specified period or specified local limits.
EXAMPLE
A joins the firm of B and C, who deal in spare parts at The Mall, Lahore. A
agrees that after leaving the firm, he will not carry on similar business at The Mall
for 2 years. The restraint is enforceable as it is reasonable.
c. Trade Combinations
An agreement between businessmen to regulate prices, output, etc. is not
in restraint of trade and therefore, valid. But a trade combination which creates
monopoly and is against the public interest is void.

a. An agreement between two firms to avoid competition is void because it
creates monopoly and is against public interest. (Jai Ram vs. Kahna Ram)4
b. An agreement between ice manufacturing companies not to sell ice below a
stated price is valid.
d. Service Contract
In a service agreement, a person while in service with another may be
prevented from accepting jobs elsewhere during the period covered by the
agreement.
EXAMPLE
Chartered Accountant employed in a company may be debarred from
private practice during the duration of service. (Magan Lal vs. Ambica Mills Ltd.)5
3. Agreement in Restraint of Legal Proceedings
Every agreement by which any party thereto is restricted absolutely from
enforcing his rights under or in respect of any contract, by the usual legal
proceedings in the ordinary tribunals, or which limits the time within which he
may enforce his rights, is void to that extent. (Sec. 28)
It means an agreement which prohibits a person from taking judicial
proceedings in respect to any right arising from a contract is void. Similarly, an
agreement which reduces the period of limitation prescribed by law of limitation is
void because the object is to defeat the provisions of law.
EXAMPLE
a. A agrees to sell sugar to B and both agree that in case of breach of contract
by any party, none of them would go to the court. The agreement is void.
b. A gives Rs. 1 Lac to B as loan for 1 year and agrees that if B fails to return
the loan, A must sue within 2 years otherwise B will not be liable. The
agreement is void.
Exceptions
The following are exceptions to the above rule:
1. The parties may agree that in case of dispute among the parties, the dispute
will be referred to arbitration.
2. The parties may agree that neither party shall appeal against the lower
court's decision.
3. The parties may agree to select one of the two courts which are equally
competent to try the lawsuit.

arbitration and not to the court. It is a valid agreement.
b. A sells sports goods from Sialkot to B in Lahore. In case of dispute, they may
sue in the Sialkot's court or Lahore's court. Both agree that they will sue in
Lahore's court. The agreement is valid.
4. Uncertain Agreement
Section (29) states that "Agreements, the meaning of which is not certain,
or capable of being made certain, are void". It means that the terms of an
agreement must be clear, complete and certain. The ambiguity may be regarding
existence, quality, quantity, price or title of the subject matter of the agreement.
EXAMPLES
a. A agrees to sell 100 litres of oil to B. It is not clear what kind of oil is to be
sold. The agreement is void because of uncertainty.
b. A agrees to sell his horse to B for Rs. 500 or Rs. 700. It is not clear which is
the sale price. The agreement is void.
5. Wagering Agreement
Wager means a bet. A wager is an agreement to pay money or money's
worth on the happening or non-happening of a future event. Each party has
equal chance to win or lose the bet. The parties should have no interest in the
agreement other than the betting amount.
Essential of Wager
The essentials of a wagering agreement are as follows:
1. There must be a promise to pay money or money's worth.
2. The promise depends on happening or non happening of an event.
3. The event must be uncertain. If one party has control over the happening of
the event, the transaction is not a wager.
4. One party is to win and other is to lose. If one party wins but other does not
lose, it is not a wagering agreement.
5. The party should have no interest in the event.
6. The parties should have interest in the betting amount only.
EXAMPLE
A and B agree that if it rains today, A will pay Rs. 100 to B. If it does not
rain, B will pay Rs. 100 to A. It is a wagering agreement.
Nature of Wagering Agreement
Wagering agreements are void. In case of breach of such agreement,
nothing can be recovered through court. (Sec. 30).

An agreement to contribute to the payment of a prize of the value of Rs.

Collateral Agreement
All agreements knowingly made to further or assist the entering into,
effecting or carrying out or to secure or guarantee the performance of any
wagering agreement are also void.
Suit for Recovery
No suit can be filed in a court of law to recover the sum of money paid or
payable, commission, brokerage, fee or reward claimed or claimable in respect of
any void agreement.
6. Agreement Contingent on Impossible Events
Contingent agreements to do or not to do anything if an impossible event
happens, are void whether the impossibility of the event is known or not to the
parties to the agreement at the time of formation. (Sec. 36)
EXAMPLES
a. A agrees to pay Rs. 1000 to B if he can run at 500 kilometres per hour. The
agreement is void.
b. A agrees to pay Rs. 1000 to B if he marries A's daughter, C. C is not alive at
the time of the agreement. The agreement is void.
7. Agreement to do Impossible Acts
An agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void. (Sec 56, Para 1)
EXAMPLES

A agrees with B that he will discover gold by magic. The agreement is
Special Cases
1. Commercial Transactions
An agreement where delivery of goods is to be given or taken at a future
date is a valid contract. But an agreement where the difference in the market
price in future and the agreed price at present is to be paid is a wagering
agreement.
2. Insurance Contract
Insurance contracts are valid contracts even though the payment of
money depends on the happening of a future uncertain event. It differs from
wagering agreement because it has an insurable interest that is based on
scientific calculation of risk and is beneficial to the public.
3. Lottery
A lottery is a game of chance. The lottery business is a wagering
transaction. Such a business is illegal. If the lottery is authorized by the

CONTIGENT AND QUASI CONTRACTS
CONTINGENT CONTRACT
A contingent contract is a contract to do or not to do something if some
event, collateral to such contract, does or does not happen. (Sec. 31)
Collateral Event
The collateral event means a connected event. The collateral event is not
the part of the consideration but in fact, a part of the contract.
EXAMPLES
a. A contracts to pay Rs. 1000 to B, if B marries C. It is a contingent contract.
b. A promises to give a loan of Rs. 1000 to B, if he is elected the president of a
particular association. It is a contingent contract.
Performance of Contingent Contracts
The rules of performance of contingent contracts are as under:
1. Happening of Event
Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncertain future
event happens, cannot be enforced by law unless and until that event has
happened. (Sec 32)
In other words, a contingent contract dependent on the happening of a
future event cannot be enforced by law until that event has happened. If the
event becomes impossible, the contract becomes void.
EXAMPLES
a. A contracts to pay a sum of money to B, if B marries C. C dies before getting
married to B. The contract becomes void.
b. A makes a contract to sell a horse to B, if C refuses to buy it. The contract
cannot be enforced by law unless C refuses to buy the horse.
2. Non-Happening of Event
Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncertain future
event does not happen, can be enforced when the happening of that event
becomes impossible, and not before. (Sac 33)
The enforceability depends upon the impossibility of the contingent event.
Until the event becomes impossible, the contract cannot be enforced.

72
EXAMPLE
Contigent and Quasi Contracts
A agrees to pay a sum of money to B, if a certain ship does not return.
The ship is sunk. The contract becomes enforceable when the ship is sunk.
3. Depending on Future Conduct
If the future event on which a contract is contingent is the way in which a
person will act at an unspecified time, the event shall be considered to become
impossible when such person does anything which renders it impossible that he
should so act within any definite time, or otherwise than under further
contingencies. (Sec 34)
Thus, the future conduct of any person is considered impossible if it
becomes impossible to perform it in the given circumstances.
EXAMPLE
A agrees to pay a sum of money to B, if B marries C. Later, C marries D.
The marriage of B to C will be considered impossible although it is possible that
D may die and C may marry B afterwards.
4. Happening of Event within Fixed Time
Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if a specified uncertain
event happens within a fixed time become void if, at the expiration of the time
fixed, such event has not happened, or if, before the time fixed, such event
becomes impossible. (Sec 35(1))
It means that a contract contingent on the happening of an event within a
fixed time becomes void if the time fixed expires and the event does not happen
or the event becomes impossible before the time expires.
EXAMPLE
A promises to pay a sum of money to B, if a certain ship returns within a
year. The contract becomes enforceable if the ship returns within a year and
becomes void if the ship sinks within a year.
5. Non-Happening of Event within Fixed Time
Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything, if a specified uncertain
event does not happen within a fixed time, may be enforced by law when the
time fixed has expired and such event has not happened, or before the time fixed
has expired, if it becomes certain that such event will not happen. (Sec 35(2))
If performance of a contract depends on the non-happening of an event
within a specified time, its performance cannot be demanded if the event does
not happen or its happening becomes impossible before the expiry of that time.

Contigent and Quasi Contracts
EXAMPLE
73
A promises to pay a sum of money to B, if a certain ship does not return
within a year. The contract may be enforced if the ship does not return within a
year or sinks within a year.
6. Happening of Impossible Event
Contingent agreements to do or not to do anything if an impossible event
happens, are void, whether the impossibility of the event is known or not to the
parties to the agreement at the time of formation. (Sec. 36)
In means that if the performance of contract is made dependent on an
event which is already impossible, the contract becomes void whether or not the
fact is known to the parties.
EXAMPLES
a. A agrees to pay Rs. 1000 to B, if he can run at 500 kilometers per hour. The
agreement is void.
b. A agrees to pay Rs. 1000 to B, if B marries A's daughter C. C was dead at
the time of the agreement. The agreement is void.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONTINGENT AND WAGERING AGREEMENT
The main points of distinction between the two are as under:
1. Validity
Contingent
It is a valid contract.
2. Interest
The parties have real interest in the
occurrence or non-occurrence of the
event.
3. Uncertain Event
Wagering
It is absolutely void.
The parties are not interested in the
occurrence of the event except for the
winning or losing the bet amount.
The future uncertain event is merely The uncertain event is the sole
collateral.
Meaning
determining factor.
QUASI CONTRACT
Quasi contract arises under some special circumstances. It is an
obligation imposed by law upon a person for the benefit of another even in the
absence of a contract. It is based on the principle of equity and justice. It states
that nobody shall be allowed to become rich at the cost of another. Sometimes,
law requires that a particular person must perform some obligations. Such
obligations are called quasi contracts. They are also called constructive
contracts.

Kinds of Quasi Contracts
The following are different kinds of contracts:
1. Supply of Necessaries
Contigent and Quasi Contracts
AMAX
If a person, incapable of entering into a contract or anyone whom he is
legally bound to support, is supplied by another person with necessaries suited to
his condition in life, the person who has furnished such supplies is entitled to be
reimbursed from the property of such incapable person. The following points
must be noted: (Sec 68)
a. The person to whom the necessaries are supplied is incapable of entering
into a contract, i.e. minor, person of unsound mind.
b. The other person has supplied him or anyone whom he is legally bound to
support with necessaries suited to his condition of life.
c. The things supplied must be necessaries and not luxuries.
d. Incompetent person's property is liable to pay only a reasonable price and not
the contract price
e. The price of the goods or services supplied can be recovered out of property
of incompetent person if he has any. He is not personally liable.
f. The incompetent person must not have such necessaries.
EXAMPLES
a. A supplies B, a minor with necessaries suitable to his condition in life. A is
entitled to recover from B's property.
b. A supplies necessaries of life to the wife and children of an insane person B.
A is entitled to recover from B's property.
2. Payment by Interested Person
A person who is interested in the payment of money which another is
bound by law to pay, and who therefore pays it, is entitled to be reimbursed by
the other. The following points must be noted: (Sec 69)
a. A person should be interested in payment to protect his own interest.
b. A person himself should not be legally bound to pay.
c. Another person should be legally bound to pay.
d. A person should make the payment to another person.
EXAMPLES
a. A pays arrears of rent of B to avoid a dispute between B and his landlord. A
cannot recover from B as he has no interest in payment.

b. B imported goods and stored in A's warehouse without paying the custom

PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS
Performance of Contract means the fulfillment of legal obligations
created under the contract by both the promisor and promisee. When a
contract is duly performed by both the parties, the contract comes to an end.
The rules regarding the performance of contracts are as under:
PERFORMANCE OF SINGLE PROMISE
A single promise is that promise in which there is one promisor and
one promisee.
Demand for Performance
3.
In a single promise, the rules to demand performance are as under:
1. Promisee
4.
It is only the promisee who can demand performance of the contract.
A person cannot acquire rights under a contract to which he is not a party. A
third party cannot demand performance of the contract even though it was
made for his benefit.
EXAMPLE
A promises B that A will pay Rs. 500 to C. A did not pay to C. Only B can
demand performance from A. C cannot demand performance from A.
2. Legal representative
5.
In case of death of the promisee, his legal representatives can
demand performance of a contract unless a contrary intention appears form
the contract or the contract is of a personal nature.
EXAMPLES
a. A bought rice from B. B died before the recovery of payment. Legal
representatives of B can demand performance.
b. X promises to paint a picture for Y on a specified day. Y dies before that day.
Legal representatives of Y cannot demand performance of promise from X.
3. Third Party
6.
A third party can also demand the performance of contract in some

demand the performance of contract from B.
Performance of Contract
A contract must be performed as under:
1. Promisor
10.
A contract must be performed by the promisor himself. In case of
contract involving personal skill or taste, the promisor himself must perform
the contract. In case of death or disablement of a promisor, the contract will
be discharged. (Sec. 40 Para 1)
EXAMPLE
A promises to paint a picture for B. A must perform the contract himself.
2. Agent
11.
In a contract where no personal skill is involved, the promisor may

Para 2)
EXAMPLE
12.
A promises to sell goods to B. A can appoint his agent for
performance of contract.
3. Legal Representatives

become liable to perform the contract. In a contract involving personal skill,
the legal representatives of a deceased promisor are not bound to perform
the contract. But in a contract of impersonal nature, the legal representatives
are bound to perform the contract. Legal representatives are liable to the
extent of the estate of the deceased received by them. They are not
personally liable. (Sec. 37)
EXAMPLES
a. A promises to deliver goods to B on 1st May on payment of Rs. 1000. A dies
before that day. Legal representatives of A are bound to deliver the goods to
B, and B is bound to pay Rs. 1000 to legal representatives of A.

2. Any one of Promisors Perform
29.
Although the joint promisors are required to perform the promise
jointly but the promisee may compel any one of the joint promisors to perform
the promise. In case of death of original debtor, the promisee must bring the
suit against all the heirs of the debtors. [Sec. 43 Para 1)

Assignment of Contract
39.
Assignment means transfer. Assignment of contract means transfer of
contractual rights and liabilities to a third party. It may occur by (i) the act of
parties or (ii) the operation of law.
1. Assignments by Act of parties
40.
It is subject to the following rules:
a. Contractual liabilities
41.
This is subject to the following rules:
42. Contract involving personal skill or qualification cannot be assigned e.g.
painting of picture by a painter. Thus, it is the state where one party cannot
delegate the act of performance to another. (Sec. 40)
43. A promisor cannot assign his liabilities under a contract. In other words, a
promisee cannot be compelled to accept a third person to perform the
promise, e.g. A owes Rs. 100 to B and B owes the same amount to C. B
cannot ask C to recover from A.
b. Contractual rights
44.
This is subject to the following rules:
45. The rights and benefits cannot be assigned if they are of personal nature.
46. An actionable claim can be assigned only by an instrument in righting. Notice
of such assignment must also be given to the debtor.
2. Assignment by Operation of Law
47.
a. Death
48.
This may take place in any of the following circumstances:
Upon the death of a party to the contract, his rights and liabilities are
assigned to his heirs. But when the personal skill is involved, the contractual
relations come to an end on the death of promisor.
b. Insolvency
49.
In case of a party to the contract being declared insolvent, his rights
and liabilities under the contract are assigned to the official receiver or
assignee as the case may be.
Reciprocal Promise
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 90
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Performance of Contract
50.
51.
83
Promises which form the consideration for each other are called
reciprocal promises. In other words, a contract consists of reciprocal
promises when one party makes a promise in consideration of a similar
promise made by the other party. (Sec. 2 (f))
Rules of performance
52.
The rules of performance of reciprocal promises are the following:
(Sec. 51-58)
1. Mutual and Concurrent
53.
Where the two promises are to be performed simultaneously, they are
called mutual and concurrent. In case of such promise, the promisor need not
perform his promise unless the promisee is ready to perform his reciprocal
promise.
EXAMPLE
A agreed to deliver goods to B at a price to be paid by B on delivery. A
need not deliver the goods unless B is ready to pay on delivery and B need not
pay unless A is ready to deliver goods on payment.
2. Mutual and Independent
54.
Where one party has to perform his promise independently without
waiting for the performance by other party, they are called mutual and
independent. Such promises must be performed in the order fixed by the
contract. Where the order is not expressly fixed, they must be performed in
that order which the nature of the transaction requires.
EXAMPLE
A agreed to build a house for B at a fixed price. A's promise to build the
house must be performed before B's promise to pay for it.
3. Prevention of Performance
55.
When a contract contains reciprocal promises and one party to the
contract prevents the other from performing his promise, the contract
becomes voidable at the option of the party so prevented, and he is entitled
to compensation from the other party for any loss which he may sustain in
consequence of the non-performance of the contract.
EXAMPLE
56.
B agrees to execute certain work for A for Rs. 1000. B is ready to do
the work but A prevents him from doing so. The contract becomes voidable at
the option of B.
4. Conditional and Dependent
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 91
www.AccountancyPoint.com
84
57.
58.
Performance of Contract
When the performance of the promise by one party depends on the
prior performance of the promise by the other party, the promises are
conditional and dependent
If the promisor who is required to perform his promise in the first
place, fails to perform it, such promisor cannot claim the performance of the
reciprocal promise and must make compensation to the other party for any
loss which such other party may sustain by the non-performance of the
contract.
EXAMPLE
A promises to sell 100 bales of cotton to B, to be delivered next day. B
promises to pay within a month. A does not deliver the bales of cotton. B's
promise to pay need not be performed and A must make compensation.
5. Legal and Illegal Promises
59.
When persons reciprocally promise, firstly to do certain things which
are legal and secondly under specified circumstances to do certain other
things which are illegal, the first set of promises is a contract but the second
is void agreement.
EXAMPLE
60.
A agrees to sell a house to B for Rs. 100,000. If B uses it as a
gambling house, he shall pay A Rs. 500,000. The first promise is a contract
and the second promise is a void agreement.
6. Alternative promise
61.
In case of an alternative promise, one part of which is legal and other
illegal, the legal part alone can be enforced.
EXAMPLE
62.
A agrees to pay Rs.1 Lac to B for which B shall deliver either rice or
opium. It is a valid contract as to rice and illegal agreement as to opium.
Time and Place of Performance
63.
The rules regarding time and place of performance of a contract are
as follows:
1. Within Reasonable Time
64.
Where by the contract, a promisor to perform his promise without
application by the promise and no time for performance is specified, the
engagement must be performed within a reasonable time. (Sec. 46)
EXAMPLE
65.
A promises to deliver goods at B's house on 1st March before 1:00
P.M. A delivers goods before time. A has performed the contract.
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 92

Performance of Contract
2. Within Specified Time
66.
67.
85
When a promise is to be performed on a certain day and the promisor
has undertaken to perform it without application by the promisee, the
promisor may perform it at any time during the usual hours of business on
such day and place at which the promise ought to be performed. (Sec. 47)
EXAMPLE
68.
A promises to deliver goods at B's warehouse on 1st January. A
brings the goods to B's warehouse but after the usual hours of business.
Thus, the goods are not received. A has not performed his promise.
3. Proper Time and Place
69.
When a promise is to be performed on a certain day and promisor has
not undertaken to perform it without application by the promisee, it is the duty
of the promisee to apply for performance at a proper place and within the
usual hours of business. (Sec. 48)
EXAMPLE
70. A promises to deliver 1000 kg of jute to B on 1st May. B agrees to
specify the place of delivery later. B must apply to A to decide a reasonable
place for performance of contract.
4. Reasonable Place
71.
When a promise is to be performed without application by the
promisee and no place is fixed for the performance of it, it is the duty of the
promisor to apply to the promisee to appoint a reasonable place for the
performance of the promise and to perform it at such place. (Sec. 49)
EXAMPLE
72.
A agreed to deliver rice to B on 1st June but no place was fixed for
delivery. A must ask B for the place of delivery of rice.
5. Prescribed by Promisee
73.
The performance of any promise may be made in any manner or at
any time which the promisee prescribes or sanctions. (Sec. 50)
EXAMPLE
A owes B Rs. 100. B agrees to send A, a note for Rs. 100 by post. The
debt is discharged as soon as B sends the note by post to A.
Time is of the Essence of Contract
74.
'Time is of the essence of contract' means that the time is an essential
element of contract and the concerned parties must perform their promise
within specified time. The following are the rules in this regard: (Sec.55)
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 93
www.AccountancyPoint.com
86
1. Time is of the Essence of Contract
75.
76.
77.
Performance of Contract
When time is of the essence of contract and the promisor fails to
perform within the fixed time, the contract becomes voidable at the option of
the promisee. The promise may revoke the contract and sue for the breach.
EXAMPLE
78.
3RMAXS
X agreed to deliver 20 books to Y on 12th May, 2011. X failed to
deliver by that time. The contract is voidable at the option of Y.
2. Time is not of the Essence of Contract
79.
When time is not of the essence of the contract and promisor fails to
perform within the fixed time, the contract remains valid and the promisee will
have to accept the delayed performance. The promisee can claim
compensation for any loss due to delay in performance. The delay should be
reasonable otherwise it will become voidable at the option of promisee.
EXAMPLE
MAXE
80.
வல்
A promises to deliver a car to B on 1st May. A delivers it on 9th May.
B will have to accept the delivery. B can claim damages only.
3. Acceptance of Delayed Performance
81.
When the promisee accepts the delayed performance instead of
avoiding the contract, he cannot afterwards claim compensation for any loss
caused by the delay unless at the time of accepting the delayed performance,
he gives notice to the promisor of his intention to do so.
EXAMPLE
82.
M promises to supply bricks to N on 4th May. M delivers on 8th May.
N accepts the delayed delivery. Later, N cannot claim damages.
Appropriation of Payment
83.
Appropriation of payment means application of payment to a particular
debt. The following are rules in this regard: (Sec. 59-61)
1. Appropriation by Debtor
84.
Where the debtor states that the payment made by him should be
applied to discharge a particular debt, the creditor must apply the payment in
the discharge of that specific debt. Where the debtor does not express his
intention, the law will gather his intention from the circumstances attending
the payment and accordingly the payment shall be applied.
EXAMPLES
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 94
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Performance of Contract
87
a. A owes B, among other debts, Rs. 1000 upon a pronote which is due on 1st.
June. A owes B no other debt of that amount. On 1st June, A pays Rs. 1000
to B. The payment will apply to the discharge of the pronote.
b. A owes to B, among other debts, a sum of Rs. 567. B writes to A and
demands payment of this sum. A sends Rs. 567. This payment will apply to
the discharge of debt of which B had demanded payment.
2. Appropriation by Creditor
85.
If there is no indication by the debtor regarding appropriation, then the
creditor has the option to apply the payment to any debt lawfully due from the
debtor, irrespective of the question of limitation. But the creditor cannot apply
the payment to a disputed debt.
EXAMPLE
86.
A owes several debts to B; one of them of Rs. 1 Lac is time-barred. A
sends Rs. 2 Lac to B without indicating the debt which is to be appropriated.
B may appropriate Rs. 1 Lac against the time-barred debt.
3. Appropriation by Law
87.
Where neither the debtor nor creditor makes any appropriation, then
according to law, it has to be applied in discharge of the earlier debt in the
order of time. If the debts are of equal standing, the payment shall be applied
in discharge of each proportionately.
EXAMPLE
88.
A owes B, two debts of Rs. 2 Lac each which are time-barred and
another debt of Rs. 4 Lac. A sends Rs. 2 Lac to B. It will be appropriated
against the two debts of Rs.2 Lac each.
4. Appropriation towards Interest
89.
If a payment is made without expressly stating whether it is towards
interest or principal, payment will first apply towards the interest and then the
principal amount.
EXAMPLE
90.
A owes B, Rs. 1 Lac as principal amount and Rs. 20,000 as interest.
A sends 20,000 to B. B can apply it towards interest.
Contracts Need Not be Performed
91.
The following are the provisions in this regard: (Sec.62-67)
1. Termination by Agreement
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 95
www.AccountancyPoint.com
88
92.
Performance of Contract
If parties to a contract agree to Novation, Rescission or Alteration, the
original contract need not be performed. In such cases, the original contract
disappears and is substituted by a new contract.
EXAMPLE
93.
94.
95.
A promised to supply certain goods to B, six months after date. By
that time, the goods go out of fashion. A & B mutually cancel the contract. A
need not perform the contract.
2. Remission by Promisee
96.
Every promisee may dispense with or remit, wholly or in part, the
performance of the promise made to him, or may extend the time for such
performance, or may accept instead of it any satisfaction which he thinks fit.
This is called remission.
EXAMPLE
97.
A owes Rs. 2 Lac to B. A pays Rs. 1 Lac and B accepts them in full
satisfaction of his claim on A. A need not pay the remaining Rs. 1 Lac.
3. Voidable Contract
98.
When a person at whose option a contract is voidable rescinds it, the
other party thereto need not perform any promise therein contained, in which
he is a promisor.
EXAMPLE
99.
A promises to buy a car from B by coercion. B can avoid the contract.
If B rejects the contract, A need not pay the price to B.
4. Refusal to Accept Performance
100.
If promisee neglects or refuses to provide the promisor,
reasonable facilities for the performance of his promise, the promisor is
excused by such neglect or refusal as to any non-performance caused
thereby.
EXAMPLE
101.
102.
A agrees to repair B's house. B neglects or refuses to point out the
wall of his house which needs repair. A is excused for the non-performance
of the contract if it is caused by such neglect or refusal.

DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT
When the rights and obligations arising out of a contract come to an end,
the contract is said to be discharged or terminated. A contract may be discharged
in any of the following modes:
(1) Performance (2) Agreement (3) Subsequent impossibility (4) Lapse of time
(5) Operation of law (6) Breach of contract
1. Discharge by Performance
Performance is the natural mode of discharge of contract. When the
parties to a contract perform their promises, the contract is discharged. If only
one of the several parties performs the promise, he alone is discharged.
Performance may be (a) actual performance or (b) tender
a. Actual Performance
When both parties to a contract fulfill the obligations according to the
terms and conditions of the contract, it is called actual performance of the
contract and the contract comes to an end. (Sec. 37)
EXAMPLE
A agrees to sell his watch to for Rs. 400. A delivers the watch to B and
B makes the payment. This is actual performance of contract.
b. Tender
It is also known as offer of performance or attempted performance. When
one of the parties to the contract offers to perform the contract but the other party
does not accept it, there is a tender. It is not an actual performance but is
equivalent to actual performance. In offer of performance, the promisor is
excused from performance and is entitled to sue the promisee for damages.
(Sec. 38)
EXAMPLE
A agrees to sell his book to B for Rs. 500. A offers to deliver the book but
B does not accept it. This is offer of performance.
Essentials of Valid Tender
A valid tender must fulfill the following conditions:
1. It must be unconditional. It must be made in accordance with the terms of the
contract, e.g. A is a debtor of company B. A offers to pay if share are allotted
to him at par. It is not a valid tender.

Discharge of Contract
91
2. It must be made at proper time and proper place, e.g. A is tenant of B. A
offers him rent at a marriage party. B is not bound to accept as it is not at a
proper place.
3. It must be of the whole obligation. An offer to perform a promise in part is not
a valid tender, e.g. A is a debtor of B. A offers to pay in installments to B. It is
not a valid tender..
4. If the tender relates to delivery of goods, the promisee must be given
opportunity to check that the goods are according to the contract, e.g. A
delivers the goods to B at 2 P.M. and does not give him a time for inspection.
It is not a valid tender.
5. It must be made by a person who is able to perform the promise, e.g. a
tender by minor is not a valid tender.
6. It must be made to the promisee or his agent, e.g. A was liable to return the
goods to B or his agent C. But A returns the goods to X. It is not a valid
tender.
7. If there are several joint promisees, a tender to any one of them is valid, e.g.
A gets the chairs on rent from XYZ jointly. A can return the chairs to any one
of them.
8. In case of tender of money, exact amount should be tendered, e.g. tendering
cheque of Rs. 100 to a bus conductor for a ticket of Rs. 5 is not a valid
tender.
Effect of refusal
In case of refusal to accept offer of performance, the contract is deemed
to have been performed by the promisor and a suit can be filed against the
promisee for breach of contract. (Sec, 38)
2. Discharge by Agreement
A contract is discharged by agreement in the following ways:
a. Novation
Novation of contract means replacement of an existing contract by a new
contract. The new contract may be formed between the same parties or between
new parties. Thus, an old contract is discharged and a new contract comes into
existence.
EXAMPLES
a. A owed to B and B to C. A's debt to B is cancelled and C accepts A as his
debtor. It is novation.
b. A owes B, Rs. 10,000. A mortgaged his estate to B for the debt of Rs. 10,000.
This is a new contract and terminates the old one.

b. Alteration
www.Accountancy Point.com
Discharge of Contract
Alteration of a contract takes place when one or more of the terms of
contract are changed. If alteration in contract is made with the consent of all the
parties, the original contract is discharged and a new contract takes its place. In
case of alteration, the parties remain the same and only the terms of contract are
changed. (Sec. 62)
EXAMPLE
A agrees to supply salt to B on 1st Feb. Later, A and B agree to change
the date of delivery to 1st March. It is alteration of contract.
c. Rescission
The rescission means cancellation of contract by mutual consent.
contract may be cancelled by agreement between the parties at any time before
it is discharged by performance. The cancellation of agreement releases the
parties from their obligations. (Sec. 62)
EXAMPLE
A promises to deliver goods to B on a certain date. Before the date of
performance, A and B agree that the contract will not be performed. The contract
is rescinded.
d. Remission
Remission means the acceptance of lesser fulfillment of a promise that
was made. It is an act of promisee discharging the obligations of another either
wholly or partly. Thus, contract may be discharged by remission of performance
or extension of time, etc. (Sec. 63).
EXAMPLES
a. A owes B, Rs. 5,000. B agrees to accept Rs. 2,000 in full satisfaction of his
claim. The whole debt is discharged.
b. Government decided to recover only 40% of debt. Later, the Government
cannot recover more than 40% of debt. (Hari Chand Madangopal vs. State of
Punjab)¹
e. Waiver
Waiver means the intentional abandonment of a right which a person is
entitled to under a contract. When a party waives his right under the contract, the
other party is released from his obligations. In case of waiver, neither an
agreement nor consideration is necessary.

Discharge of Contract
EXAMPLE
93
A promises to make a shirt for B and B afterwards forbids him to do so.
The contract is terminated by waiver.
3. Discharge by Subsequent Impossibility
Initial Impossibility
An agreement to perform an impossible act is void ab-initio. It means
agreement which is obviously impossible cannot be binding, e.g. an agreement
to discover treasure by magic is void agreement. (Sec. 56)
Subsequent Impossibility
A contract capable to be performed after formation becomes impossible,
or unlawful and as a result void. It means that subsequent impossibility or
illegality will make the contract void and the contract will be discharged. A
contract will remain valid, if the party to a contract feels difficulty in performing the
contract. This is known as the Doctrine of Frustration or Doctrine of Supervening
Impossibility. (Sec. 56)
The following factors make the contract void:
a. Destruction of Subject matter
When the subject matter of a contract after the formation of a contract is
destroyed without the fault of the promisor or promisee, the contract is
discharged.
EXAMPLES
a. C lent his hall to T for concerts. The hall was destroyed by fire before the first
concert. The contract becomes void. (Taylor vs. Caldwell)²
b. C contracted to sell potatoes to H but failed to supply as the crop was
destroyed by a pest. The contract was held to be discharged. (Howell vs.
Coupland)3
b. Failure of Purpose
Where the formation of a contract depends upon happening of a certain
event and if that event does not happen, the contract is discharged. When there
is change in certain things which are necessary for performance, the contract
becomes void on the grounds of impossibility of performance.
EXAMPLES
a. A contracts to hire a room at a hotel to attend a seminar to be held on a
particular date. The seminar is postponed. The contract is discharged.

Discharge of Contract
b. H hired a room from K to see the coronation of king. The coronation was
cancelled due to the king's illness. K sued for rent. It was held that H need
not pay the rent. (Krell vs. Henry)4
c. Death or Personal Incapacity
Where the performance of a contract depends upon the personal skill or
qualification or existence of a particular person, the contract is discharged on the
illness, incapacity or death of that person.
EXAMPLES
a. A and B contract to marry each other. A dies before the time fixed for the
marriage. The contract becomes void.
b. An artist agreed to sing on particular date but fell ill and could not sing. Held,
that the contract was discharged. (Robinson vs. Davison)
d. Change of Law
Sometimes, contracts which are lawful when made become unlawful due
to change in law. Subsequently, such contracts become impossible to be
performed. A subsequent change in law may render the contract illegal and the
contract is deemed to be discharged.
EXAMPLES
a. A promise to sell wheat to B. Before delivery of wheat, the government
banned the sale of wheat by private traders. The contract was discharged.
b. There was a contract for sale of trees of a forest. Later, it was discharged
when the State of Rajasthan forbade the cutting of trees in that area. (Man
Singh vs. Khazan Singh)
e. Declaration of War
A contract entered into with an alien enemy during the war is void ab-
initio. A contract entered into before the commencement of war remains
suspended during the war. However, such contract may be revived after the war
is over, if the nature of the contract so permits.
EXAMPLE
A contracts to carry cargo for B at a foreign port. Later, A's government
declares war against the country where the port is situated. The contract
becomes void.
4. Discharge by Lapse of Time
The Limitation Act, 1908 states that in case of breech of contract, legal
action should be taken within a specified period. If the contract is not performed

Discharge of Contract
95
and no legal action is taken by the promisee within the period of limitation, he is
debarred from enforcing the contract. Lapse of time terminates a contract. The
period of limitation for simple contract is 3 years. If 3 years expire and creditors
fail to file a suit to recover their amount, the debtor is discharged form his
liabilities.
EXAMPLE
A owed Rs. 5000 to B. The last date for repayment of the loan expired but
B did not sue A until 3 years. B lost the rights to recover.
5. Discharge by Operation of Law
A contract terminates by operation of law in the following cases:
a. Insolvency
Where the court declares a person as insolvent, the rights and duties of
such person are transferred to the official receiver. After the order of the court,
such person is discharged from his liabilities.
EXAMPLE
A promises to sell his car to B for Rs. 2 Lac. Before the performance of
the contract, A is declared insolvent by court. The contract is discharged.
b. Merger
Merger takes place when an inferior right available to a party merges into
a superior right available to the same party under another contract. As a result,
the former contract stands discharged automatically.
EXAMPLE
Where a part-time lecturer is made full time lecturer, the contract of part
time lectureship is discharged by merger.
c. Material Alteration
Material alteration means a change which affects the rights, liabilities and
legal position of the parties to a contract. If the contract is contained in a written
document and one party alters its material particulars without the consent of the
other party, the contract is discharged.
EXAMPLE
A executes a pro-note in favour of B for Rs. 300. B exceeds the amount
from Rs. 300 to 3,000 by alteration. A may refuse to pay Rs. 300.
6. Discharge by Breach of Contract
The breech of contract means the failure of party to perform his
obligations. When a party fails to perform the contract, there is a breach of
contract. It discharges the aggrieved party from performing his obligations. It may
be (1) actual breach (2) anticipatory breach.

96
a. Actual Breach
Discharge of Contract
Actual breach of contract occurs when a party fails to perform the contract
when the performance is due. Actual breach of contract can occur in the
following two ways:
(i) On due date of performance
If a party fails to perform the contract on the due date of performance, it is
an actual breach of contract. If time is not the essence of contract, the guilty party
may later perform the contract after paying compensation for delayed
performance.
EXAMPLE
A agrees to deliver 5 bags of wheat on 1st March. He does not deliver the
wheat on that day. This is an actual breach of contract.
(ii) During the course of performance
If a party has performed a part of the contact but refuses to perform the
remaining part of the contract, it is an actual breach of contract.
EXAMPLE
A agreed to deliver 500 shoes to B. The shoes were to be delivered in
installments. After 200 shoes had been delivered, B declared that no more shoes
were required. B has committed an actual breach of contract.
b. Anticipatory Breach
Anticipatory breach of contract occurs when a party declares his intention
not to perform the contract before the due date of performance. Anticipatory
breach may happen in the following ways:
(i) Express Breach
In express breach, a party to the contract communicates to the other
party, his intention not to perform the contract before the due date of
performance.
EXAMPLE
A agrees to supply wheat to B on 1st July. On 15th June, A informs B that
he will not supply the wheat. This is express breach of contract.
(ii) Implied Breach
In implied breach, a party to the contract does an act which makes the
performance of the contract impossible.
EXAMPLE
A promises to sell his horse to B on 1st June. Before that date, A sells the
same horse to C. This is implied breach of contract.
Effects of Anticipatory Breach
In anticipatory breach, the promisee gets the following rights:
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 104
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Discharge of Contract
1. The promisee is excused from performance.
97
2. He may treat the contract as rescinded and sue the other party for damages
immediately.
3. He may ignore the conduct of promisor and wait for the time of performance
and then sue the promisor.
EXAMPLE
A employs B as a clerk and the service is to start from 1st June. On 20th
May, A informs B that his services are not required. B may sue A for damages
before 1st June. (M.S & I Co. vs. N B & Co.)

REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT
When a party breaks the contract by refusing to perform his promise, the
breach of contract takes place. The following remedies are available to the
aggrieved party against the guilty party in case of breach of contract:
1. Suit for Rescission
Rescission means cancellation of a contract. When one party breaks the
contract, the other party is released from his obligation under the contract. If the
aggrieved party wants to sue the guilty party for damages for breach of contract,
he must sue for rescission of the contract. When the court grants rescission, the
aggrieved party is free from his obligations and becomes entitled to
compensation. (Sec. 75)
EXAMPLES
a. A contracts to supply cement to B on 15th April. B agrees to pay the price on
receipt of goods. A does not supply on due date. B is discharge from liability
to pay. B can rescind and claim damages.
b. A pledges ornaments to B and gets a loan. A does not return the loan to B. B
may rescind the contract and refuse to return the ornaments.
2. Suit for Damages
The aggrieved party may sue for damages in case of breach of contact.
Damages are a monetary compensation allowed to the aggrieved party for the
loss suffered by him as a result of the breach of contract. In case of breach of
contract, the aggrieved party can claim the following kinds of damages: (Sec .73)
Kinds of Damages
The damages may be of the following five kinds:
a. Ordinary Damages
These are also called general damages. When a contract is broken, the
aggrieved party can recover ordinary damages from the guilty party. Ordinary
damages are usually assessed on the basis of actual loss. In a contract of sale of
goods, the damages payable are the difference between the contract price and
the market price at the date of breach. (Sec. 73)
EXAMPLES
a. A contracts to pay Rs. 1 Lac to B on 1st January. A could not pay on that day.
As a result, B is totally ruined. A is liable to pay B only principal sum and
nterest on it

Remedies For Breach of Contract

b. H delivered the shaft to B, a carrier, to take it to the manufacturer as a pattern
for a new one. H did not tell B that delay would result in loss of profits. The
delivery of shaft was delayed and the mill remained closed for a long period.
H sued B for loss of profits. Held, that B was not liable for loss of profits. The
ordinary damages were awarded. (Hadley vs. Baxendale)'
b. Special Damages
Special damages arise under some special circumstances. These
damages include indirect loss which may arise due to breach of contract. The
parties must be aware of the loss which may arise from the breach of contract.
The notice to this effect must have been given to the other party otherwise he is
not responsible for special damages. Subsequent knowledge of special
circumstances will not create special liability on guilty party. (Sec. 73)
EXAMPLES
a. A contracts C to buy 1 ton of iron for Rs. 80,000. A also contracts to sell B, 1
ton iron for Rs. 1 lac. A informs C about the purpose of contract. C fails to
supply. As a result, A cannot supply to B. C is liable for loss of profit which A
would have earned from B. 4
b. S delivered his samples to NWR Co. for exhibition at New Castle. He wrote
on consignment "must be at New Castle on Monday certain". Due to
negligence, the goods reached after the show. The NWR Co. was aware of
the object of carrying the goods. Held, S could claim special damages.
(Simpson vs. London & N.W Railway)2
c. Exemplary Damages
Exemplary damages are awarded to punish the guilty party for the breach
of contract. The breach of contract results in monetary loss to the aggrieved party
and causes disappointment. Exemplary damages have no place in law of
contract and are not recoverable. These are awarded in the following cases:
1. In case of breach of a contract to marry, the amount of damage depends
upon the extent of injury to the feelings of the party.
2. In case of dishonour of cheque by a bank when there are sufficient funds to
the credit of the customer. According to rule, the smaller the cheque
dishonoured, the greater the damage.
EXAMPLE
OS Bank promised to give loan to W for a trip to California by crediting his
account. Bank failed to do so and W's cheque was dishonoured. The court
ailowed exemplary damages for the emotional distress. (Westesen vs. Olathe
State Bank)

d. Liquidated Damages
Remedies For Breach of Contract
When parties to a contract fix the amount of damages for the breach of
contract at the time of formation of contract, such damages are called liquidated
damages. Where a sum is agreed in the contract to be paid by the defaulting
party in case of breach of contract, the court will allow the reasonable damages
not exceeding the amount already agreed. If the actual loss is more than the
agreed amount, damages will be payable to the agreed amount. (Sec. 74)
EXAMPLE
A contracts to pay Rs. 20,000 as damages to B, if he fails to pay Rs. 5
Lac on a given day. A fails to pay on that day. B can recover damages not
exceeding Rs. 20,000.
e. Nominal Damages
Nominal damages are neither awarded to compensate the aggrieved
party nor to punish the guilty party. When the aggrieved party suffers no loss, the
court may award nominal damages in recognition of his right. The court has
discretion in this case. The court may refuse to award damages.
EXAMPLES
a. A promises to sell cement to B for Rs. 200 per bag. A does not supply. At the
time of breach, the market rate of cement is the same. B is entitled to
nominal damages.
b. S contracted to buy a Hillman car from a car dealer C but later refused to
buy. C sold the same car to another customer and suffered no loss. C sued
for loss of profit. Held, he could recover nominal damages. (Charter vs.
Sullivan)
3. Suit upon Quantum Meruit
The term quantum meruit means payment in proportion to the work done
or reasonable value of work done. When a person has done some work under a
contract and the other party cancels the contract or an event happens which
makes the performance of contract impossible; such party can claim
remuneration for the work already done. The right to claim for quantum meruit
arises when the original contract is discharged. The aggrieved party may sue for
quantum meruit in the following cases:
a. When an agreement becomes subsequently void.
b. When there is a promise to render services but no agreement about
remuneration.
c. Where something is done without any intention to do so gratuitously.
d. When the contract is divisible.
e. When the completion of the contract is prevented by the other party.
When a divisible work is performed badly.

A stops B from work. B can get compensation for work done.
b. C was employed as Managing Director in a company. After 3 months it was
found that the directors were not authorized to appoint him. C sued for
remuneration. Held, C could recover for the work done. (Craven Ellis vs.
Canon Ltd.)³
4. Suit for Specific Performance
Specific performance means the actual carrying out of the contract by a
party. In some cases where the damages are not an adequate remedy, the court
may direct the guilty party to fulfil the contract. The aggrieved party can sue for
specific performance in the following cases:
a. When compensation in money is not an adequate remedy.
b. When it is difficult to calculate the actual damages.
c. When compensation in money cannot be obtained.
Specific performance is not granted in the followings cases:
a. When damages are an adequate remedy.
b. When the court cannot supervise the execution of contract e.g. construction
contract.
c. When the contract involves personal skill, taste and qualification.
EXAMPLES
a. A agrees to sell his plot to C, who wants to erect a mill. A commits breach.
On the suit of C, A is directed by the court to perform the contract.
b. A agrees to sell B his painting but commits breach. B cannot sue for
damages. A shall be ordered to make specific performance to B.
5. Suit for Injunction
Injunction is an order of a court, restraining a person from doing
something which he promised not to do. It is a mode of securing specific
performance in the negative form. It is a preventive relief. It is a discretionary
remedy of the court. It is appropriate in cases of anticipatory breach of contract.
EXAMPLES
a. W agreed to sing at Lu's theatre and for no one else. Afterwards, W
contracted Z to sing at another theatre and refused to sing for Lu. Held, W
could be restrained by injunction from singing for Z. (Lumly vs. Wagner)4

INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE
CONTRACT OF INDEMNITY
Definition and Nature
The term indemnity means to compensate or make good the loss. Section
124 states that, "A contract by which one party promises to save the other from
loss caused to him by the conduct of the promisor himself or by the conduct of
any other person is called a contract of indemnity."
The person who promises to make good the loss is called the indemnifier
(promisor). The person whose loss is to be made good is called the indemnity
holder or indemnified (promisee).
A contract of indemnity is made to protect the promisee against an
anticipated loss. It depends upon the happening of loss. Contract of insurance is
an example of indemnity.
EXAMPLES
a. A parked his cycle at a cycle stand. A lost the token issued by B. B refused to
return the cycle. To get his cycle, A promised to compensate B against any
loss he may suffer if any other person claims the cycle from B.
b. A contracts to indemnify B against the result of any proceedings which C may
take against B for certain sum of Rs. 2 lac. It is a contract of indemnity.
Essentials of Contract of Indemnity
Following are the essentials of a valid contract of indemnity:
1. It must contain all the essentials of a valid contract.
2. It is a contract between two parties. One person promises to save the other
from any loss which he may suffer.
3. The loss may be caused by the conduct of the promisor himself or any other
person.
4. The contract of indemnity may be expressed or implied.
Rights of Indemnity Holder
The following are rights of indemnity holder: (Sec. 125)
1. He can recover all damages which he may be compelled to pay in respect of
any suit filed against him.
2. He can recover expenses in respect of any suit filed by him with the authority
of indemnifier.

Page 111
www.AccountancyPoint.com
104
Idemnity And Gurantee
3. He can recover all expenses which he might have paid as a result of any
compromise which was made with the consent of indemnifier.
Rights of Indemnifier
There is no provision in the law about the rights of indemnifier. However,
the rights of indemnifier are the same as the rights of a guarantor. It is a principle
of law that where one person has agreed to indemnify another, his rights will be
similar to the rights of guarantor.
Definition
CONTRACT OF GUARANTEE
Section 126 states, "A contract of guarantee is a contract to perform the
promise or discharge the liability of a third person in case of his default."
A contract of guarantee is made to enable a person to get loans, goods
on credit, employment etc. It may be oral or written. It is a promise to perform the
promise of the other, on his failure to do so.
The person who gives the guarantee is called the surety or guarantor.
The person to whom the guarantee is given is called the creditor. The person in
respect of whose default the guarantee is given is called the principal debtor
EXAMPLES
a. A requests B to lend Rs. 5 Lac to C. A guarantees that if C fails to return the
loan, A will pay to B. This is a contract of guarantee.
b. On the request of B, A promises to the employer of B that if B commits a
fraud, A shall be liable. This is a contract of guarantee.
Essentials
The following are essential features of contract of guarantee:
1. Tripartite Contract
It is an agreement between the principal debtor, creditor and surety.
Three separate contracts exist among them. In a tripartite contract, the liability of
the surety arises if the promise by principal debtor is not fulfilled.
In a contract of guarantee, the principal debtor is liable and the surety
becomes liable on the default of principal debtor. The principal contract exists
between the principal debtor and creditor and the secondary contract exists
between the creditor and surety.
EXAMPLE
X takes a loan of Rs. 5000 from Y on the guarantee of Z. The agreement
between X and Y is the principal contract and the contract between Y and Z is a
contract of a guarantee. The liability of Z will arise if X fails to repay the loan.
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 112
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Idemnity And Gurantee
2. Consideration
105
Like other contracts, a contract of guarantee must fulfill essentials of a
valid contract. It must be supported by some consideration. It is not necessary
that there is direct consideration between the surety and creditor. The
consideration received by the principal debtor is sufficient for the surety.
(Sec. 127)
EXAMPLES
a. A sells goods on credit to B on C's guarantee. C's promise to guarantee is the
consideration for A's promise to sell the goods.
b. A sells goods to B. X requests A not to sue B for a week, and promises to pay
if B does not pay. It is consideration for X's promise.
3. Misrepresentation
A guarantee obtained by means of misrepresentation made by the
creditor, or with his knowledge and assent, concerning the material part of a
transaction is invalid. If the consent of surety is obtained by misrepresentation,
the surety will be discharged from his liability. (Sec. 142)
EXAMPLE
H was invited, to give a guarantee for the honesty of L's servant. L had
previously dismissed his servant for dishonesty but did not disclose this fact to H.
Later, the servant committed embezzlement. H was held not liable. (LGO Co. vs.
Holloway)
4. Concealment
Any guarantee which the creditor obtains by means of keeping silence to
material circumstances is invalid. The expression 'keeping silence' means
intentional concealment of the facts. The creditor should disclose to the surety
the facts which are likely to affect the surety's liability. (Sec. 143)
EXAMPLE
A employs B to recover money. B misappropriates the money. Later, A
asks C for surety. C being unaware of B's previous record gives guarantee for B.
B again misappropriates. C's guarantee is invalid because A concealed the facts.
5. Writing not Necessary
It is not necessary that the contract of guarantee be in writing. The
contract may be either oral or written. It may be express or implied from the
conduct of parties. (Sec. 126)
EXAMPLE
A sells and delivers goods to B on the verbal guarantee of C. It is a valid
guarantee.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INDEMNITY AND GUARANTEE
The following are the points of distinction between the two:
Indemnity
1. Number of Parties
In a contract of Indemnity, there are
two parties: indemnifier and indemnity
holder.
2. Number of contract
In indemnity, there is one contract
between indemnifier and indemnified.
3. Nature of Liability
Guarantee
In a contract of guarantee, there are
three parties: creditor, principal debtor
and surety.
In guarantee,there are three contracts
i.e. between creditor and principal
debtor, creditor and surety and surety
and principal debtor.
The liability of indemnifier is primary The liability of surety is secondary.
and independent.
4. Request
In a contract of indemnity, the
indemnifier promises without
request of the debtor.
5. Existence of Liability
the
In a contract of indemnity, the liability
of the indemnifier arises on the
happening of event.
6. Filing of Suit
In a contract of indemnity, the
indemnifier cannot sue the third party
for loss in his own name. He can sue if
the claim is assigned in his favour.
7. Purpose
Surety is liable if principal debtor fails
to perform his promise.
In a contract of guarantee, the surety
gives the guarantee on the request of
debtor.
In a contract of guarantee, the liability
already exists and its performance is
guaranteed by surety.
In a contract of guarantee, the surety
after paying to creditor can sue
principal debtor in his own name.
A contract of indemnity is for A contract of guarantee is for security
reimbursement of loss.
of a debt or performance of promise.
Surety's Liability
Extent of Surety's Liability
The liability of surety is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor
unless it is otherwise provided by the contract. The phrase 'co-extensive with that
of principal debtor' shows the quantum of the surety's liability. It means that the
liability of a surety is the same as that of a principal debtor unless there is a

contract to the contrary. The surety's liability can be made less than that of the
principal debtor but never greater. (Sec. 128)
EXAMPLE
A guarantees to B for the payment of a bill accepted by C. The bill is
dishonoured. A is liable for the payment.
Nature of surety's liability
The following are rules regarding the nature of surety's liability:
1. The liability of surety is secondary. It arises on the default of principal debtor.
2. The liability of surety arises immediately on the default of principal debtor;
unless there is a provision in the contract that creditor must file a suit against
principal debtor or give notice of default to surety.
3. Where a creditor holds securities from principal debtor for his debt, the
creditor should first sue the surety before resorting to securities unless
agreed otherwise.
4. The surety is not liable where the creditor has obtained guarantee by
misrepresentation.
5. The law does not treat the principal debtor and surety as one person. It is not
necessary that surety will be liable only if principal debtor is liable.
6. The discharge of principal debtor by operation of law does not discharge the
surety, e.g. material alteration.
7. Liability of surety does not come to an end on the death of principal debtor.
Kinds of Guarantee
The following are different kinds of guarantee:
1. Simple guarantee
A guarantee which extends to a single debt or transaction is called
ordinary, simple or specific guarantee. It comes to an end as soon as the liability
under the transaction ends.
EXAMPLE
G guarantees K for the payment of 5 bags of wheat purchased by C. C
makes the payment. Later, C again purchases 5 bags of wheat but did not pay. K
sued G. Held, G's guarantee is specific guarantee and G is not liable. (Kyk vs.
Groves)²
2. Continuing guarantee
A guarantee which extends to a series of transactions is called continuing
guarantee. In other words, a guarantee which covers a number of transactions
over a period of time is called continuing guarantee. It is like a standing offer

which is accepted by the creditor every time a subsequent transaction takes
place. (Sec. 129)
EXAMPLES
D guarantees C for B's purchases from C to the extent of Rs. 5,000 for
the next one year. This is a continuing guarantee.
Rights of Surety
A surety has the following rights:
1. Rights against creditor
The surety has the following rights against the creditor:
a. Right to Securities
At the time of payment, the surety can demand the securities which
creditor has received from principal debtor at the time of creation of contract,
whether surety is aware of such securities or not. If creditor by negligence loses
any security held by him, the surety is discharged to that extent from the payment
of guaranteed sum. But if security is lost due to unavoidable act, the surety would
not be discharged. (Sec. 141)
EXAMPLE
C gives a loan of Rs. 2 Lac to B on the guarantee of X. C also pledges B's
car. B fails to pay the loan and X pays Rs. 2 Lac to C. X can get the car from C.
b. Right to Claim Set-off
If the principal debtor has some claims against the creditor, the debtor
can ask for adjustment of his debts to the extent of his claims. If creditor sues
surety for repayment, the surety can claim set off, if any, which principal debtors
had against creditor.
EXAMPLE
A supplies furniture worth Rs. 2 Lac to B on the guarantee of C. B claims
that some furniture is defective and refuses to pay Rs. 20,000. C can ask for
adjustment of Rs. 20,000.
2. Rights against Principal Debtor
The surety has following rights against principal debtor:
a. Right of Subrogation
When surety has paid the guaranteed debt on default of principal debtor,
he is entitled to all the rights which creditor had against the principal debtor. The
surety is entitled to all the remedies which are available to creditor against
principal debtor. (Sec. 140)
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 116

Idemnity And Gurantee
EXAMPLE
109
X borrowed money from Y on the guarantee of W and mortgaged his
house to Ye X failed to pay and W paid. Now, W can enforce the mortgage of the
house against X.
b. Right of indemnity
In every contract of guarantee, there is an implied promise by principal
debtor to indemnify the surety. The surety is entitled to recover from principal
debtor whatever sum he has rightfully paid under the guarantee, but no sums
which he has paid wrongfully. (Sec 145)
EXAMPLE
B owes Rs. 1 Lac to C, and A is the surety. B fails to pay. C demands
payment from A. A refuses to pay. C sues A for the money. A defends the suit on
reasonable grounds but loses and pays debts with cost of suits. A can recover
the whole amount from B.
3. Rights against Co-sureties
Where a debt is guaranteed by more than one surety, they are called co-
sureties. In such a case, all the sureties are liable to make the payment to
creditor according to the agreement among them. If there is no agreement and
one of the co-sureties is compelled to pay the entire debt, he has a right to
contribution from the co-sureties. Following are the rules in this regard: (Sec. 146-
147)
a. Similar amount
When there are sureties for the same debt and the principal debtor has
committed a default, each party is liable to contribute equally to the extent of the
default.
EXAMPLE
A, B and C are sureties to D for the sum of Rs. 3000 lent to E. E makes
default in payment. A, B and C are liable to pay Rs. 1000 each. If C becomes
insolvent and only pays Rs. 500, then A and B will contribute equally.
b. Different amount
When there are sureties for the same debt for different sums, they are
bound to contribute equally subject to the limit fixed by their guarantee. They will
not contribute proportionately.
EXAMPLES
A, B and C are sureties for D. A, B and C guarantee for Rs. 10,000,
20,000 and 40,000 respectively.
a. If D makes default in payment to the extent of Rs. 30,000 then liability of A, B
and C is Rs. 10,000 each.

Idemnity And Gurantee
b. If D makes default to the extent of Rs. 40,000 then liability of A is Rs. 10,000,
B is Rs. 15,000 and C is Rs. 15,000.
c. If D makes default to the extent of Rs. 70,000 then A, B and C will pay Rs.
10,000, Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 40,000 respectively.
Discharge of Surety from Liability
A surety is discharged from his liability in the following ways:
1. Notice of Revocation
A specific guarantee can be revoked by notice if the liability has not
arisen. But a continuing guarantee may be revoked anytime by the surety as to
future transactions by giving a notice to the creditor. The surety remains liable for
transactions entered into prior to the notice. (Sec. 130)
EXAMPLE
A lends B a certain sum on the guarantee of C. C cannot revoke the
guarantee. But if A has not yet given the sum to B, then C may revoke the
guarantee by giving a notice.
2. Death of Surety
In specific guarantee, the surety is not discharged from liability on his
death if the liability has already occurred. But in a continuing guarantee, the
death of surety discharges him from liability regarding the transactions which
take place after his death, unless there is a contract to the contrary. The estate of
deceased surety will remain liable for past transactions. (Sec. 131)
EXAMPLE
A sells goods to B for Rs. 1 Lac. C guarantees payment. A delivers goods
worth Rs. 50,000. Later, C dies. C's property is liable up to Rs. 50,000.
3. Change in Terms of Contract
When any change is made in the terms of the contract by principal debtor
and creditor without the surety's consent, the surety stands discharged with
respect to transactions subsequent to the change. (Sec. 133)
EXAMPLE
M contracts to lend Rs.1 Lac to N on 1st March. S guarantees payment.
M pays the amount on 1 Jan. S is discharged from his liability.
4. Release or discharge of Principal Debtor
The surety is discharged by any contract between the creditor and
principal debtor by which principal debtor is released, or by an act or omission of
the creditor which discharges the principal debtor. (Sec. 134)
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 118

Idemnity And Gurantee
EXAMPLES
111
a. A contracts to build a house for B. C guarantees for the performance. If B
releases A from the performances of the contract, the surety is discharged.
b. A contracts to build house for B. B is liable to supply wood. C guarantees A's
performance of the contract. B fails to supply the wood. C is discharged from
his liability.
5. Arrangement without Surety's consent
Where the creditor, without the consent of surety, makes an arrangement
with principal debtor for composition or promises to give him time or not to sue
him, the surety will be discharged. (Sec. 135)
Where a contract to give time to principal debtor is made by the creditor
with a third person and not with principal debtor, the surety is not discharged.
(Sec.136)
EXAMPLES
a. P purchased a car from C on guarantee of S. C gave P more time for
payment. Held, the giving of time to P for payment discharged S from his
liability. (M.M Showroom Ltd vs. Newman)³
b. A lends Rs. 10 Lac to B for 1 year on the guarantee of C. A promises X, a
friend of B, to give more time to B to return the loan. C is not discharged from
his liability.
6. Creditor's act or omission
If the creditor does any act which is inconsistent with rights of the surety,
or omits to do any act which his duty to the surety requires him to do, and the
eventual remedy of the surety against the principal debtor is thereby impaired,
the surety is discharged. (Sec. 139)
EXAMPLES
a. B contracts to build a ship for C for Rs. 90 Lac to be paid by installments as
the work reaches certain stages. A guarantees C for B's performance.
Without telling A, C prepays the last two installments to B. A is discharged by
this prepayment.
b. A employs B as a cashier on the guarantee of M. A promises to count the
cash at least once a month. A does not count the cash. B commits fraud. M is
not liable to A.
7. Loss of Security
If the creditor loses or without the consent of the surety, parts with the
security given by the principal debtor against the debt, the surety is discharged

from liability to the extent of the value of security. If the security is lost due to an
act of God, the surety will not be discharged. (Sec 141)
EXAMPLE
A advances Rs. 2 Lac to B on the guarantee of X. A gets an additional
security of Rs. 50,000 by pledge of B's car. A cancels the pledge and returns the
car. B becomes insolvent. X is discharged from the liability to the extent of value
of car.
8. Invalidation of Contract of Guarantee
A surety is discharged from liability when the contract of guarantee
(between creditor and surety) is invalid. A contract of guarantee is invalid in the
following cases: (Sec. 142-144)
a. Where the guarantee is obtained by misrepresentation.
b. Where the guarantee is obtained by concealment of material facts.
c. Where guarantee is obtained under the impression that co-sureties will join
and if, no body joins.
d. Where it lacks some essentials of a valid contract, e.g. surety is incompetent
to contract or the object is illegal.
EXAMPLES
a. A employs B as a clerk. B commits fraud. Later, A asks C for guarantee
without informing C about B's previous conduct. C gives guarantee for B's
conduct. B again commits fraud. The guarantee is invalid.
b. B signed a guarantee under the impression that three other persons would
also sign it. One of them died without signing. The guarantee is not
enforceable. (NP Bank of England vs. Brackenbury)4

BAILMENT AND PLEDGE
CONTRACT OF BAILMENT
Meaning and Definition
The word bailment is derived from the French word 'baillier' which means
to deliver. According to Section 148, "A bailment is the delivery of goods by one
person to another for some purpose, upon a contract that they shall, when the
purpose is accomplished, be returned or otherwise disposed of according to the
directions of the person delivering them."
A bailment is the voluntary transfer of the possession of goods by the
owner to another person, under a contract that such other person shall hold them
or return them to the owner or deliver them according to his order.
A bailment arises when one person transfers possession of goods to
another person on condition that he will return them after the accomplishment of
purpose. If a person already in possession of the goods of another person,
contracts to hold them, he becomes the bailee and the owner becomes the
bailor.
The person delivering the goods is called the bailor. The person to whom
the goods are delivered is called the bailee.
EXAMPLES
a. A delivers a piece of cloth to B to make a suit. This is a contract of bailment
between A and B.
b. A sells goods to B who leaves them in the possession of A. A becomes the
bailee and B becomes the bailor.
Essential Features
The following are essential features of a bailment:
1. Contract
A bailment is based on a contract between the bailor and bailee. The
delivery of goods should be made for some purpose and when the purpose is
accomplished, the goods shall be returned to the bailor. There is no bailment if
the goods are delivered without any contract i.e. by mistake.
EXAMPLES
a. A gives a piece of cloth to T, a tailor, to make a suit. This is a contract of
bailment between A and T.

b. B's stolen ornaments were recovered by the police. Later, they disappeared
from police custody. Held, the state was liable. (Basava vs. State of Mysore)¹
2. Specific Purpose
The bailment of goods must be made for a specific purpose. When the
goods are delivered by mistake without any purpose, there is no contract. When
the purpose is accomplished, the goods will be returned to the bailor or disposed
of according to the directions of the bailor.
EXAMPLE
A gives his watch to B for repair. This is a bailment.
3. Delivery of Goods
The bailment is the delivery of moveable goods from one person to
another. Mere custody of goods does not create a relationship of bailor and
bailee. A servant who receives the goods from his master to take them to a third
person only gets the custody. The possession of goods remains with the master
so the servant cannot be called a bailee.
EXAMPLES
a. A buys a T.V. from B. A asks B to keep the T.V. with him for an hour, so that
A may buy other goods from the market. B is now holding the T.V as a bailee.
b. U entered a restaurant for dinner. H, the waiter, took his coat and hung it on a
hook. Later, the coat was missing. The owner of the restaurant was held
liable. (Ultzen vs. Nicols)²
4. No Change of Ownership
Under a bailment, only the possession of goods passes from the owner to
the other person and not the ownership. Mere custody of goods without
possession is not bailment, e.g. a servant holding his master's goods. If there is a
change of ownership, the transaction may be a sale or exchange but not
bailment.
EXAMPLE
A delivers his car to B for repair. The possession of car transfers from A
to B but ownership remains with A.
5. Return of Same Goods
When the purpose is accomplished, the goods must be returned in the
original form or in changed form or disposed according to the directions of bailor.
If the bailee has an option of paying money or of returning different property,
there is no bailment. The deposit of money with a bank is not a bailment because

there is no obligation to return the same money. However, notes or goods
deposited in a locker are a bailment.
EXAMPLES
a. A lends his cycle to B for a week. B is liable to return the same cycle.
b. X gives the goods to Daewoo Transport to carry them from Lahore to Multan.
This is a bailment.
Kinds of Bailment
Bailment is classified according to benefit and reward as under:
1. Benefit
According to benefit, bailment can be grouped into three classes:
a. For benefit of Bailor
It is a bailment in which goods are delivered by the bailor to the bailee
only for the exclusive benefit of the bailor himself, e.g. A delivered ornaments for
safe custody to B, his neighbor, without any charges. It is a bailment for the
benefit of bailor only.
b. For benefit of Bailee
It is a bailment where goods are delivered to the bailee to be used without
any compensation, e.g. A borrows B's pen to use in the examination hall. The
bailment is for the sole benefit of A, the bailee.
c. For benefit of Bailor and Bailee
It is a bailment where the goods are delivered for mutual benefit of both
the bailor and bailee, e.g. A delivers his car to B, a mechanic for repair. It is for
the benefit of both bailor and bailee.
2. Reward
Bailment is classified into two classes according to reward:
a. Bailment without Reward
It is bailment in which neither the bailor nor the bailee is entitled to any
remuneration. It is also called gratuitous bailment, e.g. lending a book to a friend,
depositing goods for safe custody without any charges etc.
b. Bailment for Reward
It is a bailment where either the bailor or the bailee is entitled to
remuneration. It is also called non-gratuitous bailment, e.g. car lent for hire, cloth
given for tailoring on charges etc.
Duties of Bailor
A bailor is the person who delivers the goods. The duties of a bailor are
as follows:
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 124
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Bailment and Pledge
1. Duty to Disclose Faults
117
A gratuitous bailor is bound to disclose to the bailee all those faults in the
goods bailed which are known to him and if he fails to do so, he will be liable to
pay such damages to the bailee arising from such faults. (Sec 150)
A non-gratuitous bailor is responsible for all defects in the goods bailed
whether he is aware of the defects or not. If he does not disclose the faults to the
bailee, he will be liable for damages arising due to those faults.
EXAMPLES
a. A lends a horse, which he knows to be vicious, to B. A does not disclose the
fact that the horse is vicious. B is thrown from the horse and gets injured. A is
responsible for the damages.
b. A hires a carriage from B. The carriage is unsafe and B is not aware of it. A
gets injured. B is responsible to A for the injury.
c. R hired a motorboat from D for a holiday on river Thames. The boat caught
fire and R could not put out the fire, as the fire-fighting equipment was out of
order. R was injured. Held, D was liable. (Read vs. Dean)³
2. Duty to Repay Necessary Expenses
In case of gratuitous bailment, where goods are to be kept or to be
carried by the bailee for the bailor, it is the duty of the bailor to repay all the
necessary expenses incurred by the bailee for the purpose of bailment. In case
of non-gratuitous bailment, the bailor is not liable to bear the ordinary expenses.
(Sec. 158)
EXAMPLE
A delivers a horse to B for safe custody. The horse becomes sick and B
spends Rs. 500 on medical care and Rs. 200 on feeding the horse. A is liable to
pay Rs. 700 to B.
3. Duty to Repay Extra-Ordinary Expenses
In all kinds of bailment, the bailor must bear the extra-ordinary expenses,
if any, incurred by the bailee regarding the goods bailed. (Sec. 158)
EXAMPLE
B hires a horse from A. The horse becomes sick. B spends Rs. 500 on
medical care and Rs. 200 on feeding the horse. A is liable to pay to B, Rs. 500
i.e. the extra-ordinary expenses only.
4. Duty to Indemnify for Demanding Back
If the bailor who has sent goods gratuitously for specified time, asks the
bailee to return the goods before the specified time, he must indemnify the bailee
3

www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 125
www.AccountancyPoint.com
118
Bailment and Pledge
for the loss caused to him in excess of the benefit already enjoyed by the bailee
from such goods. (Sec. 159)
EXAMPLE
A gives a cycle to B gratuitously for 3 months. B spends Rs. 200 on its
repair. If A asks for the return of cycle after 1 month, he is liable to compensate B
for expenses incurred by him in excess of the benefit enjoyed by B.
5. Duty to Indemnify for Defective Title
Where the title of the bailor to the goods is defective and as a result the
bailee suffers a loss, the bailor is responsible to indemnify the bailee for such
loss. (Sec. 164)
EXAMPLE
A gives his neighbour's scooter to B for use without the neighbor's
permission. The neighbour sues B and receives compensation. A is bound to
indemnify B for losses.
6. Duty to Receive Back Goods
It is duty of the bailor to receive back the goods when the bailee returns
them after the accomplishment of the purpose of bailment. If the bailor refuses to
receive the goods at proper time, the bailee can claim compensation for all
necessary expenses incurred for safe custody of goods. (Sec. 160)
EXAMPLE
A bails his cow to B for feeding for 2 months. A does not take his cow
back after 2 months. B has to spend more money on feeding the cow. A is liable
to compensate B.
Rights of Bailee
The rights of bailee are as under:
1. Right to Claim Damages
In case of bailment without reward, the bailee is entitled to know the faults
in the goods bailed to him of which the bailor is aware. A bailee has a right to
claim compensation from the bailor for any damages arising directly from such
faults in the goods bailed. However, in case of bailment for reward, the bailee is
entitled to claim compensation for even those faults of which bailor was unaware.
(Sec. 150)
EXAMPLE
A lends a horse to B which he knows to be vicious but does not disclose
this fact to B. B is thrown from the horse and gets injured. A is responsible to B
for the injuries sustained.

Bailment and Pledge
2. Right to Recover Expenses
119
The bailee can recover all necessary expenses incurred by him for the
purpose of the bailment from the bailor. It includes compensation for any loss
caused to him due to any defect in the bailor's title and lawful charges for
providing services. The bailee has a right to claim expenses incurred for safe
custody of the goods if the bailor has wrongfully refused to take delivery after the
term of bailment. (Sec 158)
EXAMPLE
A delivers his horse to B for safe custody. The horse becomes sick and
B's spends Rs. 200 on medical care. B can recover Rs. 200 from A.
3. Right to Deliver Goods
When the goods are bailed by several joint owners, the bailee has a right
to deliver them back to, or according to the directions of, one joint owner without
the consent of all unless there is an agreement to the contrary. (Sec 165)
EXAMPLE
AB & C jointly bail a car to X for 5 days. X can return the car to any one
of them.
4. Right to Compensation
If the bailor has no right to bail the goods or to receive them back or to
give directions regarding them and as a result, the bailee suffers a loss, the
bailee is entitled to receive such loss from bailor. (Sec. 164)
If the bailor has no title to the goods and the bailee, in good faith, delivers
them back to, or according to the directions of the bailor, the bailee is not
responsible to the owner in respect of such delivery. (Sec. 166)
EXAMPLES
a. A bails X's scooter to B without his permission. X sues B and receives
compensation. B can recover such compensation from A.
b. A bails the scooter of his friend, C to B with his permission. B has a right to
return the scooter to A. B is not liable to C.
5. Right to Stop Delivery
If a person other than the bailor claims the goods bailed, the bailee may
apply to the court to stop the delivery of goods to the bailor and to decide the title
to the goods (Sec. 167).
EXAMPLE
A bails goods to B. X claims that he is the owner of those goods and
demands from B. B can stop the delivery of goods to A and request the court to
decide about the ownership of goods.

6. Right to Sue
Bailment and Pledge
If a third person wrongfully deprives the bailee of the use or possession of
the goods bailed, or causes injury to the goods, the bailee is entitled to sue such
third person. The bailor can also bring a suit against such third person in respect
of such goods bailed. (Sec. 180)
EXAMPLE
A gave a piece of cloth to T, a tailor, to make a suit. M forcefully took the
coat from T. A or T can file a suit against M.
7. Right of Lien
Lien means the right to retain the possession of property or goods
belonging to another until some debt or claim are paid. A bailee has the right to
retain that particular property in respect of which he has rendered some services
and his charges are due but if the bailee does not complete the work within the
agreed time or reasonable time, he will not be entitled to any lien. (Sec 170)
EXAMPLES
a. A delivers a rough diamond to B, a jeweler, for cutting and polishing. B can
retain the diamond till he is paid for the services.
b. A gives his watch to B for repair. B promises A to deliver the watch next day
but takes more time to repair. B cannot retain the watch.
Duties of Bailee
The duties of bailee are as follows:
1. Duty to take Reasonable Care
In all cases of bailment, the bailee is bound to take care of the goods
bailed to him as a man of ordinary prudence under similar circumstances takes
care of his own goods of the same description. If the bailee does not take care of
the goods bailed and the goods are damaged by his negligence, he is
responsible for the loss even if the bailment is gratuitous.
In the absence of any special contract, the bailee is not responsible for
the loss, destruction or deterioration of the goods bailed if he has taken care of
them. The bailee is bound to take reasonable steps to recover the goods if they
get stolen. (Sec 152)
EXAMPLES
a. A sends some ornaments to B, a goldsmith. B keeps them in a locked safe.
The ornaments are stolen. B is not liable for loss.
b. A bails car to B. B forgets to lock up the car. The car is stolen. B is liable.

such a manner that it is possible to separate, the bailee is bound to bear the
expenses of separation and the loss. (Sec. 156)

2. Duty to take Reasonable Care
A finder must take reasonable care of the goods as a man of ordinary
prudence, under similar circumstances, takes care of his own goods of the same

2. Right of Lien
A finder can retain the goods for compensation for effort and expense
incurred by him to preserve the goods and to find out the real owner. But he has
no right to sue the real owner to recover such expenses because he incurred

possession of the goods.
4. Right to Sue for Reward

PLEDGE OR PAWN
Definition
The bailment of goods as security for payment of a debt or performance
of a promise is called pledge. (Sec 172)
The bailor in this case is called pawnor or pledger. The bailee is called
pawnee or pledgee. A pledge is a special kind of bailment. Under a pledge, one
person transfers the possession of goods to another in order to secure the
payment of debt or the performance of a promise. In case of pledge, the goods
are deposited as security to get a loan. If there is no transfer of possession of
goods, there is no pledge.
EXAMPLE
A borrows Rs. 1000 from B and gives his watch as security for payment
of the debt. The bailment of watch is called a pledge.
Essentials of Pledge
The essentials of a pledge are as under:
1. Movable Property
A pledge only involves the movable property. This includes different
goods, valuables, documents for title e.g. railway receipt, bills of lading etc.
EXAMPLE
A gives his car to B as a security and borrows Rs. 1 Lac as loan. This is a
pledge between A & B.
2. Limited Interest
When a person pledges goods in which he has only limited interest, the
pledge is valid to the extent of that interest only.
EXAMPLE
A gives his T.V to B for repair. A does not pay Rs. 500 as repair charges.
B pledges the T.V with X to borrow Rs. 900. A pledge with X is valid up to Rs.
500.

Bailment and Pledge
3. Transfer of Possession
127
Under a pledge, only the possession of goods is transferred by the
pawnor to the pawnee.
EXAMPLE
C pledges ornaments with B and gets a loan of Rs. 1 Lac. The
possession of ornaments transfers from C to B.
4. No Transfer of Ownership
Under a pledge, the ownership of goods remains with the pawnor. Only
the possession of goods is transferred and not the title thereto.
EXAMPLE
M pledges his car with N and gets a loan of Rs. 2 Lac. The ownership of
car remains with M.
5. Not Mere Custody
The person having the custody of goods cannot pledge them. For
example, a servant in control of his master's goods cannot make a valid pledge
of them.
EXAMPLE
T puts some goods in the custody of his servant, S. S pledges the goods
with B. It is not a valid pledge.
Rights of Pledgee
The rights of pledgee are as follows:
1. Right to Retain
The pledgee can retain the goods pledged until his dues are paid. He can
retain them for payment of debt or performance of promise for interest due on the
debt and all necessary expenses incurred by him for the preservation of goods.
(Sec 173)
EXAMPLE
A borrows Rs. 2 Lac from B and pledges his diamond ring. If A does not
return the loan, B can retain the ring.
2. Right to Retain for Other Debts
When the pledgee lends advances to the same pledgor after the date of
the pledge, it shall be presumed that the right to retain over the pledged goods
extends even to the subsequent advances. This presumption can be disproved
by a contract to the contrary. (Sec 174)
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 135
www.AccountancyPoint.com
128
EXAMPLE
Bailment and Pledge
M borrows Rs. 4 Lac from N on 1st March and pledges his car. On 1st
June, M borrows another sum of Rs. 3 Lac from N. M repays the first debt in full.
N can retain the car against his claim for second loan.
3. Right to Extraordinary Expenses
The pledgee has the right to recover from the pledger, extra-ordinary
expenses incurred by him for the preservation of the goods pledged. But he
cannot retain the goods if such expenses are not paid. He only has the right to
sue the pledgor for recovery of such extra-ordinary expenses. (Sec. 175)
EXAMPLE
S pledges his horse with T. The horse falls sick and T spends some
expenses on his treatment. T can sue S to recover expenses.
4. Right to Sue and Sell
If the pledgor makes default in the payment of the debt or performance of
the promise, the pledgee may sell the goods pledged after giving to the pledgor,
a reasonable notice of his intention to sell. The following points must be noted in
this regard:
a. The reasonable notice is necessary. A sale of goods without notice is void.
b. The pledgee cannot sell the goods to himself. If he does so, such sale is void.
The pledgor can recover the goods on payment.
c. If the proceeds of sale are less than the amount due, he can recover the
balance from the pledgor but if there is surplus, he must return it to the
pledgor. (Sec. 176)
EXAMPLE
A lends Rs. 5 Lac for 6 months to B and B pledges his car with A. B fails
to pay. A can sell B's car to recover his loan after giving a reasonable notice.

The duties of pledgee are as follows:
1. To take reasonable care of the goods pledged.

2. Right to Claim Damages
If the pledgee mixes the goods pledged with his own goods or converts
them into other forms, the pledgor has the right to claim damages.

goods or to raise money on the security of goods. The pledge made by a
mercantile agent is valid if the following conditions are satisfied: (Sec 178)
a.
b.
C.
d.
Mercantile agent must be in possession of the goods or the documents of
title to goods, e.g. railway receipt.
Possession of goods must be with the consent of real owner.
Mercantile agent must make the pledge in the ordinary course of his
business as mercantile agent.
The pawnee acts in good faith and does not have any notice that the pawnor
has no authority to pledge.

exhibition only but the agents pledged them. The pledge was held to be valid.
(Moddi vs. Pall Mall Deposit & Forwarding Co.)5

A person having possession of goods under a voidable contract can
make a valid pledge of the goods, provided the contract has not been rescinded

CONTRACT OF AGENCY
Agent and Principal
"An agent is a person employed to do any act for another or to represent
another in dealings with third persons. The person for whom such act is done or
who is so represented is called the principal." (Sec. 182)
A person who acts on behalf of another person is called an agent. The
person who authorizes another person to act is called a principal. The contract
which creates the relationship of principal and agent is called an agency. The
agent is authorized to create a contract between his principal and a third party.
After entering into a contract, the agent drops out and ceases to be a party to the
contract and the contract binds the principal and third party.
EXAMPLE
C appoints B to buy 10 bags of sugar on his behalf. C is the principal and
B is the agent. The contract between the two is agency
Essentials of Agency
The essentials of agency are as follows:
1. Agreement
The relationship of agency is the result of an agreement between the
principal and agent. The contract of agency may be express or implied from the
conduct of the parties.
2. Who can be Principal
Any person, who is of the age of majority according to law to which he is
subject and who is of sound mind, may employ an agent. (Sec. 183)
3. Who can be Agent
Any person may become an agent. It means that a minor or a person of
unsound mind can be appointed as an agent. A minor as agent can bind the
principal to the third parties. But a minor is not himself liable to his principal. (Sec.
184)
4. Consideration not Necessary
In order to create an agency, the consideration is not necessary.
Consideration may or may not exist in an agency. The fact that principal has
agreed to be represented by the agent is consideration for principal to support
the contact. (Sec. 185)
133
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 141
www.AccountancyPoint.com
134
5. Intention
Contract of Agency
The agent must have intention to act on behalf of the principal. When the
agent enters into a contract for himself, then the principal is not liable. The
principal is liable only when the agent contracts with the intention to act on behalf
of the principal.
Test of Agency
Agency exists whenever a person can bind another by acts done on his
behalf. When this power does not exist, the relationship is not that of agency.
Purpose of Agency
An agency is created to perform any act which the principal himself can
lawfully do. The object of agency should not be criminal in nature or against
public policy. There are certain acts, which must be performed by a person
himself and cannot be delegated to an agent.
General Rules of Agency
The following are rules regarding agency:
1. Whatever a person competent to contract can do himself, he can do through
an agent except for the acts involving personal skill, e.g. painting
2. The acts of the agent are the acts of the principal. It means he who acts
through an agent acts himself.
Kinds of Agents
The following are various kinds of agents:
1. General Agent
A general agent is appointed to perform all acts in connection with a
particular business, e.g. person appointed as general manager is a general
agent. A general agent can do any lawful acts regarding that business.
2. Special Agent
A special agent is appointed to perform a particular act in a particular
transaction, e.g. person is appointed to purchase a particular house. Special
agent has the authority only to do that particular act. His authority comes to an
end when the act is performed by him.
3. Universal Agent
A universal agent is the person whose authority is unlimited. He enjoys
powers to transact every kind of business on behalf of his principal. A universal
agent is authorized by the principal to perform all acts that can be delegated to
him. He has more powers than those enjoyed by general or special agent.
4. Mercantile Agent
A mercantile agent is the person who has authority to sell or buy goods or
to raise money on the security of goods. Mercantile agent is generally appointed

remuneration called the Del credere commission, gives guarantee to his principal
that third persons with whom he enters into contract shall perform their
obligations. Del credere agent undertakes to bear the risk of bad debts on credit
sales made by him.
8. Broker
A broker is an agent who negotiates and makes contracts between the
principal and third party. A broker does not have the possession and control of
goods. He cannot act in his own name. The commission a broker receives for his
services is called brokerage.
9. Auctioneer
An auctioneer is an agent who is appointed to sell goods to the highest

12. Advocate
Contract of Agency
An advocate can also act as an agent. He does not buy or sell goods but
appears before the court on behalf of his principal. He also performs other acts
on behalf of his client.
Creation of Agency
A contract of agency may be created in any of the following ways:
1. Agency by Express Agreement
Generally, an agency is created by an express agreement. When an
agency is created by words spoken or written, it is called express agency. The
usual form of a written contract of agency is the power of attorney on stamped
paper which gives the authority to the agent to act on behalf of the principal.
(Sec. 186)
EXAMPLES
A appoints B as his agent to sell his house. It is an express agency. A
writes a power of attorney in favour of B authorizing him to sell his plot. It is
written express agency.
2. Agency by Implied Agreement
It arises when there is no express agreement appointing a person as an
agent. An implied agency arises from conduct, situation or relationship of the
parties. (Sec. 187)
EXAMPLES
a. X & Y are brothers. X lives in Lahore and Y in Multan. Y, with the knowledge
of X, gives his land on lease. He collects the rent and remits to X. Y is the
implied agent of X.
b. M allowed her son to drive a car for her and promised to pay expenses of
maintenance. The son caused an accident and injured his wife. Held, the wife
could sue the mother as the son was an implied agent of the mother. (Smith
vs. Mose)
An implied agency may be of the following types:
a. Agency by Estoppel
Estoppel means to prevent a person from denying a fact. When a person
by his conduct or statement induces others to believe that a certain person is his
agent, he is stopped from subsequently denying it.
When an agent has without authority, done acts or incurred obligations to
third persons on behalf of his principal, the principal is bound by such acts or
obligations if he has by his words or conduct induced such third persons to

Contract of Agency
137
believe that such acts and obligations were within the scope of the agent's
authority. (Sec. 237)
EXAMPLES
a. A tells B in the presence of P that he is P's agent. P does not object to the
statement and remains quite. Later, B enters into a contract with A thinking
that A is P's agent. P is bound by this contract.
b. P terminated the services of his agent A. No notice to this effect was given by
P. Subsequently, A purchased some goods from T on behalf of P. It was held
that P was liable to pay the price to T. (Truman v. Loder)²
b. Agency by Holding Out
The principal is bound by the acts of the agent if, on an earlier occasion,
he made other persons to believe that the person doing some acts on his behalf
is doing with authority. But if an agent has a limited authority, the principal is not
bound for his acts beyond that authority.
EXAMPLE
B is a servant of A. B buys goods on credit from C and A pays for them
regularly. B buys the goods from C on credit for personal use. A is liable to C for
payment.
c. Agency by Necessity
Agency by necessity gives an authority to a person to act as an agent for
another without any consent of other person. The person can act as an agent
under the following conditions:
(i) There must be a real necessity for acting on behalf of the principal.
(ii) It must be impossible to get the principal's instructions.
(iii) The agent should act bonafide in the interests of the principal.
Generally, the agency by necessity arises in the following cases:
(i) When the agent exceeds his authority bonafide in an emergency.
(ii) When the carrier of goods does anything to protect the goods in an
emergency.
(iii) When a husband improperly leaves his wife without providing proper means
for her substance.
EXAMPLES
a. A asks B to deliver fruits to a store in Karachi. B finds that the fruits are
perishing and sells them at Multan. The sale is binding on the principal.
b. S& Co. consigned butter to a railway Co. It was delayed in transit. Being
perishable, the company sold the butter. S & Co. was held bound by the sale.

3. Agency by Ratification
Contract of Agency
Agency by ratification arises where a person acts on behalf of another
without his authority and his act is accepted by the latter. If his act is not
accepted, there is no agency.
Where acts are done by one person on behalf of another but without his
knowledge or authority, he may elect to ratify or disown such acts. If he ratifies
the acts, the same effect will follow as if they have been performed by his
authority. (Sec. 196)
EXAMPLES
a. A buys 5 bags of wheat without the authority of B. B ratifies A's act. A
becomes his agent.
b. A bought goods on behalf of P above the price authorized by P. P objected to
purchase but sold the goods. Held, he had ratified the purchase by selling the
goods. (Cornwal vs Wilson)
4
4. Agency by Operation of Law
An agency arises by operation of law. Under Partnership Act, every
partner is an agent of the firm and the act of a partner to carry on business of the
firm binds the firm. Similarly, under Companies Act, the directors are the agents
of the company.
EXAMPLE
D, the director of a company, contracts S to buy machinery for the
company. D acts as an agent of the company so the company is liable for D's
acts as a principal.
Duties of Agent
An agent has the following duties towards the principal:
1. Duty to Follow Directions or Customs
The agent is bound to conduct the business of agency according to the
directions of the principal. If the principal does not give any directions, then he
should follow the custom of trade. If he does not act according to the prevailing
customs of trade, he will be liable for any loss sustained by the principal. (Sec.
211)
EXAMPLES
a. P, the principal, instructs his agent A to insure the goods. A neglects to do so.
A is liable to compensate P if the goods get damaged.

that some goods are damaged. A must inform P and get instructions in this
regard.

CONTRACT OF SALE OF GOODS ✓
Sale of Goods Act
The law relating to sale of goods is contained in the Sale of Goods Act,
1930. This law came into force on 1st July, 1930. The act contains 66 sections
and extends to the whole of Pakistan.
Definition of Contract of Sale
Section 4(1) of the Sale of Goods Act defines a contract of sale of goods
as "A contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in
goods to the buyer for a price".
In other words, a contract to transfer the ownership of goods from the
seller to the buyer is known as contract of sale.
Essentials of Contract of Sale
The following are essentials of a contract of sale of goods:
1. Contract
Contract means an agreement enforceable by law. All the essentials of a
valid contract should also be present in a contract of sale like capacity of parties,
free consent, legality of object, etc. It may be verbal or in writing. It may be
express or implied.
2. Two Parties
There should be two parties to a contract of sale, i.e. buyer and seller.
One person cannot act as a buyer and seller because a person cannot buy his
own goods and similarly a person cannot sell his goods to himself.
However, the owner of one part can sell his share to the owner of other
part. Similarly, a partner may buy the goods from the firm in which he is a partner
and vice-versa.
EXAMPLES
a. A sells his computer to B for Rs. 40,000. A is the seller and B is the buyer.
b. A and B jointly own a computer. A sells his share to B. B becomes the sole
owner of the computer.
3. Transfer of Property
The transfer of property is an essential of the contract of sale. Here,
property means ownership. A mere transfer of possession of the goods cannot
be termed as sale. In order to constitute a contract of sale, the seller must either
transfer or agree to transfer the property (ownership) in the goods to the buyer.

www.AccountancyPoint.com
Contract of Sales of Goods
EXAMPLE
149
A sells his car to B for Rs. 80,000. The ownership and possession of the
car will transfer from A to B.
4. Goods
The subject matter of the contract of sale must be goods. According to
section 2(7), "Goods means every kind of movable property other than actionable
claims and money; and includes electricity, water, gas, stock and shares,
growing crops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land which are
agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale."
Every movable property is regarded as goods. The trees, fruits,
vegetables etc. are regarded as goods because they can be separated from the
land.
An actionable claim means a debt or a claim for money which a person
may have against another and which can be recovered by filing a suit. Money is
not regarded as goods. However, old coins are treated as goods.
EXAMPLE
A sells his car to M for Rs. 3 Lac. It is a contract of sale because the
subject matter of contract i.e. car is a moveable thing.
5. Price
The consideration in a contract of sale must be the price. When goods
are sold or exchanged for other goods, the transaction is barter and not a
contract of sale of goods. If goods are sold partly for goods and partly for price, it
is a contract of sale. (Sec.2 (10))
EXAMPLES
a. A sells his chair to B for Rs. 2,000. It is a contract of sale.
b. X sells his horse to B against B's promise to give 100 ton of wheat. It is not a
contract of sale.
6. Sale and Agreement to Sell
The term contract of sale includes both sale and an agreement to sell.
When the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer at the
time of formation of contract, the contract is called a sale.
Where under a contract of sale the transfer of ownership in the goods is
to be transferred from seller to buyer at some future date, the contract is called
an agreement to sell.
EXAMPLES
a. A buys a book from S and pays the whole price on a counter. It is a sale.
b. A agree to buy B's car for Rs 2 Lac if his mechanic approves the car. It is an
agreement to sell.

7. Other Formalities
Contract of Sales of Goods
There is no specific procedure to make a contract of sale. All essentials of
a valid contract should be there in a contract of sale like capacity of the parties,
free consent, legality of object etc. (Sec. 5)
EXAMPLE
C verbally promises to sell his radio to B. It is a contract of sale if parties
are competent to contract, their consent is free and all essentials of contract have
been fulfilled.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SALE & AGREEMENT TO SELL
The following are points of difference between the two:
Sale
1. Transfer of Property
In sale, the ownership passes to the
buyer immediately at the time of
contract. The seller ceases to be the
owner and the buyer becomes the
owner immediately.
2. Type of Goods
Agreement to Sell
In agreement to sell, the ownership
does not pass to the buyer at the time
of contract. The ownership transfers at
a certain future date.
A sale can only be in case of existing An agreement to sell is mostly in case
and specific goods
3. Nature of Rights
In sale, the buyer becomes the owner
of the goods and gets the rights against
the goods. If the seller refuses to
deliver the goods, the buyer may sue
for recovery of goods.
4. Risk of Loss
In sale, the ownership in the goods
passes from seller to buyer. If the
goods destroy the buyer suffers the
loss even though the goods are in the
possession of seller.
5. Consequences of Breach
In sale, if the buyer fails to pay the
price of the goods, the seller can sue
for the price, even though the goods
are in the possession of seller.
of future and contingent goods
In an agreement to sell, the buyer does
not get the rights against the goods. He
gets the rights against the seller. He
can sue for damages and not for
recovery of goods.
In an agreement to sell, the ownership
in the goods does not pass from seller
to the buyer. If the goods destroy the
seller suffers a loss even though the
goods are in the possession of the
buyer.
In agreement to sell, if the buyer fails to
pay the price the seller can sue for
damages and not for price, even
though the goods are in the possession
of buyer.

O Contract of Sales of Goods
6. Right of Resale
In sale, the ownership transfers to the
buyer so the seller cannot resell the
goods, even though the goods are in
the possession of seller. If the seller
sells the goods, the new buyer having
knowledge of the previous sale does
not get a title to the goods.
7. Insolvency of Buyer
In sale, if the buyer becomes insolvent
before
payment, his legal
representatives can demand delivery of
the goods from the seller. If the price of
the goods is still unpaid, the seller can
claim the price of the goods
proportionately.
8. Insolvency of Seller
In sale, if the seller becomes insolvent,
the buyer can recover the goods from
Official Receiver because the
ownership of goods is with the buyer.
9. Nature of Contract
A sale is an executed contract because
the ownership passes from seller to the
buyer.
Kinds of Goods
151
In an agreement to sell, the ownership
remains with the seller so he can resell
those goods to the new buyer. The new
buyer gets a good title to the goods,
despite the knowledge of previous sale.
The original buyer can sue for breach
of contract only.
In an agreement to sell, if the buyer
becomes insolvent, before payment,
the seller can refuse to sell the goods
until the price is paid by the legal
representative of the buyer.
In agreement to sell, if the buyer has
paid the price and the seller becomes
insolvent, he can recover the price
proportionately. He cannot get the
goods as the ownership of the goods is
with the seller.
An agreement to sell is an executory
contract because the ownership is to
pass in future.
The following are the kinds of goods:
1. Existing Goods
The goods which are owned or possessed by the seller at the time of
contract of sale are called existing goods. In other words, the goods which are
physically in existence and in seller's possession at the time of contract are
called existing goods. (Sec. 6(1))
These goods can be divided into following kinds:
a. Specific Goods
The goods identified and agreed upon at the time of contract of sale are
called specific goods. In other words, these are the goods which can be clearly
identified and recognized as separate things at the time of contract. These may
be called ascertained goods. (Sec. 2(14))

EXAMPLE
Contract of Sales of Goods
X owns many cows and promises to sell one of them. If one cow is
singled out, the contract is for specific goods.
b. Unascertained Goods
The goods which are not identified and agreed upon at the time when a
contract of sale is made are called uñascertained goods. These goods are not
definite and specific. The seller in case of contract of the sale of unascertained
goods has the option to supply any goods of the kind contracted for.
EXAMPLE
A has 100 bags of sugar. A promises to sell 10 bags of sugar out of them.
It is a contract of unascertained goods.
2. Future Goods
The goods which a seller does not possess at the time of contract but
which will be manufactured, produced or acquired by the seller after making the
contract of sale are called future goods. The seller can only make an agreement
to sell the future goods. (Sec. 2(6))
EXAMPLE
X agrees to sell to Y all the mangoes which will be produced in his farm
next year. It is a contract of sale of future goods.
3.. Contingent Goods
The goods which are not in existence at the time of contract of sale are
called contingent goods. In contract of contingent goods, the ownership does not
pass to the buyer at the time of contract. A contract of sale of contingent goods is
enforceable when the event happens on which its performance depends. If the
event does not happen, the contract becomes void. (Sec. 2(6))
EXAMPLE
A agrees to sell to B a rare painting if he is able to purchase it from its
present owner. This is a contract of sale of contingent goods.
Destruction of Goods
The following may be the causes of destruction of goods:
1. Damage to goods in which the goods have lost their commercial value e.g.
when cement is spoiled by water.
2. Loss of goods by theft.
3. When goods are lawfully confiscated by the government.
The effects of destruction of goods are as follows:
1. Perishing before Formation of Contract
When specific goods are the subject matter of contract of sale and they,
without the knowledge of the seller, perish at or before the time of the contract,
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 160
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Contract of Sales of Goods
153
the contract is void. In other words, if the goods spoil at the time of the contract,
the agreement is void. (Sec. 7)
When specific goods are the subject matter of a contract and only part of
the goods are destroyed, the effect of perishing depends upon the nature of
contract. If the contract is divisible, it will not become void and the part of goods
available in good condition must be accepted by the buyer. If the contract is
indivisible and a part of the goods has perished, the contract becomes void.
EXAMPLES
a. A agrees to sell 100 bags of sugar which are in transit by ship. On arrival of
the ship, A discovers that the sugar is spoiled. The contract becomes void.
b. A sold 10 bags of basmati rice to B. It was found that the basmati rice was
mixed with inferior quality of rice. The contract is void.
2. Perishing before Sale but after Agreement to sell
When there is an agreement to sell specific goods and subsequently the
goods perish without any fault on part of the seller or buyer, the contract
becomes void and the parties are not liable for performance. (Sec. 8)
If only part of the goods agreed to be sold are perished, the contract
becomes void if it is indivisible. If the contract is divisible, the contract remains
valid as regards to the part available in good condition.
EXAMPLES
a. A took a horse for 8 days on condition that if found suitable the bargain would
complete. The horse died on the 3rd day without the fault of any party. Held,
the contract became void and the seller would bear the loss. (Elphick vs.
Barnes)
b. A agrees to sell to B, 1 ton of rice and 1 ton of wheat which are to be
produced in his field. The crop of rice gets destroyed .A can sell wheat to B
as it is a divisible part of the contract. B is bound to accept the wheat.
3. Perishing of Future and Contingent Goods
A contract of sale of future and contingent goods is an agreement to sell.
The destruction of future and contingent goods makes the contract void.
EXAMPLE
C agreed to sell to H, 200 tons of potatoes to be grown on C's land. C
sowed potatoes but a disease attacked the crop and he could deliver only 10
tons. The contract was held to be void. (Howell vs. Couplan)²

Fixation of Price
Contract of Sales of Goods
The money consideration for sale of goods is known as price. Price is an
essential element in every contract of sale of goods. A valid sale cannot take
place without a price. The price should be paid or promised to be paid in legal
tender money of Pakistan i.e. Rupees, unless otherwise agreed.
Modes of Fixing Price
According to section 9, the price may be fixed by the following modes:
1. Parties
It is the most common mode of fixing the price. The parties are free to fix
any price. The price may be stated in a contract by the parties to the contract.
EXAMPLE
A agrees to sell his car to B for Rs. 5 Lac. Here, the price is fixed in the
contract itself.
2. Agreed Manner
The price may be fixed in a manner agreed upon in a contract. It may be
the price prevailing on any particular date or price to be fixed by a third person.
EXAMPLE
A agrees to sell 100 shares of W company to B at the market rate
prevailing on the 20th day after deal. It is a valid contract of sale.
3. Course of Dealings
When price is neither expressed in the contract nor any manner of fixing
the price is agreed, the price is determined during the course of dealings
between the parties.
EXAMPLE
A agrees to buy 100 shares of W company from B. In general course of
dealings, the accepted price of shares is the price prevailing on the date of
contract. It is the price prevailing in the stock market on the date of sale.
4. Reasonable Price
If the price is not capable of being fixed by any of the above modes, the
buyer is bound to pay to the seller a reasonable price. The amount of reasonable
price depends upon the circumstances of each case.
EXAMPLE
A orders B to supply 100 kg of sugar without fixing the price. Price of
sugar in the market on day of order will be considered as reasonable price. B
must supply sugar to A at this market rate.

CONDITIONS AND WARRANTIES
A contract of sale of goods contains various terms or stipulations
regarding the quality, price, mode of payment, delivery of goods, time of
performance and place where the goods are to be sent. The major terms of
contract are called conditions and the minor terms of contract are called
warranties.
Definition of Condition
Condition is a stipulation essential to the main purpose of the contract,
the breach of which gives rise to a right to treat the contract as repudiated. (Sec.
12(2))
A condition is essential for the main purpose of the contract. Condition is
a stipulation that forms the basis of contract of sale. Its non-fulfillment causes
irreparable loss to the aggrieved party. In case of violation of condition, the
aggrieved party has the right to cancel the contract.
EXAMPLES
a. C contracts to deliver 100 Royal fans to B. But C delivers Climax fans. It is a
breach of condition. B can accept or reject them and claim damages.
b. B asked M, a car dealer, to suggest him a car for touring purpose. M
suggested Buggatti car. B purchased the car and found it unfit. Held, it was
breach of condition. B could return the car. (Baldray vs. Marshall)
Definition of Warranty
A warranty is a stipulation collateral to the main purpose of the contract,
the breach of which gives rise to a claim for damages but not a right to reject the
goods and treat the contract as repudiated. (Sec. 12(3))
In other words, a warrantee is not essential for the main purpose of the
contract. It is subsidiary or collateral to the main purpose of contract. The breach
of warranty gives the aggrieved party the right to recover damages only but not to
cancel the contract.
EXAMPLE
C promises to deliver 100 fans to B at his office. But C delivers the fans at
his home. It is a breach of warranty. B cannot cancel the contract. B can claim
damages only.

Condition treated as Warranty
as a breach of condition
In breach of warranty, the aggrieved
party has no option to reject the
contract. He can only claim damages.
A breach of condition is treated as a breach of warranty under the
following cases:
1. Option of buyer
The breach of condition by the seller gives the right to the buyer to reject
the goods and cancel the contract, but he is not bound to do so. The buyer may
treat the breach of condition as a breach of warranty and accept the goods and
claim damages. (Sec. 13(1))
EXAMPLE
C agrees to supply first grade sugar to B but supplies second grade
sugar. B can reject it. B may accept the second grade sugar and claim damages
2. Acceptance by Buyer
When the buyer has accepted the goods, he cannot reject them but can
claim damages. If the buyer has accepted only part of the goods and the contract
is indivisible, he will have to accept the remaining part also. But in a divisible
contract, the buyer can reject the remaining goods, if he has accepted only part
thereof. (Sec. 13(2))

the goods. In case of agreement to sell, the implied condition is that the seller will
have a right to sell the goods at the time when the ownership is to pass from the
seller to the buyer. Therefore, it is presumed that the seller has a valid title to the
goods in every contract of sale. If the seller's title proves to be defective, the
buyer can reject the goods and recover his price. (Sec. 14 (a))
EXAMPLES
R purchased a car from D. After few months, the police took away the car
as it was stolen. R sued D to recover the price. Held, that R can recover the
price. (Rowland vs. Dival)³
2. Sale by Description
In a contract of sale of goods by description, it is an implied condition that
the goods shall correspond with the description. If the goods are not according to
the description, the buyer can reject the goods. If the seller supplies different
goods, the buyer is not bound to accept such goods. (Sec. 15)

discovered that it is of an earlier model. B can return the car.
b. S contracted to supply new Singer car to A. The car supplied had run some
mileage. It was held that there was a breach of condition and A could reject

Doctrine of Caveat Emptor
Conditions and Warranties
Caveat emptor means let the buyer beware. According to this principle, it
is the duty of the buyer to be careful while purchasing goods of his requirement.
The buyer must examine the goods thoroughly. He should ensure that the goods
are suitable for his purpose. If the goods prove to be defective or do not suit his
purpose, the buyer cannot hold the seller liable. If the buyer at the time of
purchase depends upon his own skill and makes a bad choice, he must blame
himself for this mistake.
According to Section 16(a), the seller is under an obligation to inform the
buyer of any defect in the goods sold at the time of contract except in a case
where the defect is obviously known to the buyer. It means that if the defects are
in the knowledge of seller, he must inform to the buyer about those defects
provided those defects are not obvious. But if the defects are obvious, the seller
is not bound to inform to the buyer.
EXAMPLE
A purchases a horse from B. A needs the horse for riding but he does not
mention it to B. The horse is not suitable for riding. cannot reject the horse.
Exceptions
The doctrine of Caveat Emptor is subject to the following exceptions:
1. Purchase by Description
When the goods are purchased by description, the doctrine of caveat
emptor does not apply if the goods do not correspond with the description. (Sec
15)
EXAMPLE
V sold a reaping machine to W, describing that it is 1 year old. W found it
to be 2 years old. W could return it as it does not correspond with description.
2. Purchase by Samples and Description
When the goods are bought by sample as well as by description and the
bulk of the goods do not correspond both with the sample or with the description,
the buyer is entitled to reject the goods. (Sec. 15)
EXAMPLE
C sells an air filter to B saying that it is genuine and fit for a Corolla car. B
finds that it is fit for Corolla car but not genuine. B can reject it.
3. Fitness for Purpose
The doctrine of Caveat Emptor does not apply when the buyer informs
the seller about particular purpose for which he needs the goods and relies upon
the seller's skill and judgment. The seller must supply the goods which shall be fit
for the buyer's purpose. [Sec 16(1)]

www.AccountancyPoint.com
Conditions and Warranties
EXAMPLE
163
C tells B, a car dealer, that he needs a car for touring purpose. B sells a
car which is not made for touring purpose. It is a breach of condition.
4. Merchantable Quality
When the goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in
goods of that description, there is an implied condition that the goods shall be of
merchantable quality. But if the buyer has examined the goods, there is no
implied condition as regards defects which such examination ought to have
revealed (Sec. 16(2))
EXAMPLE
A bought milk from B, a dairyman. It was contaminated by germs. A's wife
got infected and died after drinking the milk. B was held liable for damages.
5. Usage of Trade
When the trade usage attaches an implied condition or warranty as to the
quality or fitness and the seller deviates from that condition or warranty, the
principle of Caveat Emptor does not apply. (Sec 16(3))
EXAMPLE

opened the bottle, it burst and injured her. The proper use of bottle was known to
B. B was liable for damages. (Priest vs. Last)
6. Purchase by Sample
When the goods are bought by sample, the principle of Caveat Emptor
does not apply if the bulk does not correspond with the sample or if the buyer is
not provided an opportunity to compare the goods with the sample. (Sec 17)
EXAMPLE
X buys oil filter from Y by showing a sample. The oil filter does not
correspond with a sample. X can return it.
7. Consent by Fraud
When the seller intentionally makes a wrong statement to the buyer and
the buyer relies on it or when the seller actively conceals the defects in the goods
which could not be discovered on reasonable examination, the principle of
Caveat Emptor does not apply. (Sec. 17 of Contract Act)
EXAMPLE
A knows that his watch is made in Pakistan. In order to sell his watch, A
tells B that it is made in Switzerland. B buys the watch. B can reject the contract.
8. Consent by Misrepresentation

TRANSFER OF PROPERTY
The phrase transfer of property in the goods means transfer of ownership
of the goods. On transfer of property in goods, the buyer becomes the owner of
the goods and acquires all the rights held by the seller in respect of the goods
sold. The rules regarding transfer of property in goods are as under:
1. Unascertained Goods
Ascertainment is the process by which the goods are identified and
separated. When there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future
goods, the property in the goods does not pass to the buyer until the goods are
ascertained. (Sec. 18)
EXAMPLE
A agrees to sell 100 kg of rice to B, out of the rice stored in a godown. B
becomes the owner when 100 kg of rice will be separated from the rest.
2. Intention of Parties
In contract of sale of specific or ascertained goods, the ownership
transfers when the parties intend to transfer it. It depends on the terms of the
contact. It may transfer at the time of the contract or when the goods are
delivered or when the payment is made. (Sec. 19)
EXAMPLE
X sells a book to B on cash basis. B becomes the owner when he makes
the payment.
3. Goods in deliverable State
When there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a
deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer as soon as the
contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment of the price or
the time of delivery of goods or both is postponed. (Sec 20)
EXAMPLE
P B offers to sell his horse to A. The horse will be delivered on the stated
day and price will be paid at the time of delivery. A accepts the offer. A becomes
the owner when the offer is accepted.
4. Goods to be put in Deliverable State
The expression 'put the goods into deliverable state' means doing an act
like polishing, packing, loading or giving a finished shape to the goods etc.
Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods and the seller is bound to

Transfer of Property
do something to the goods for the purpose of putting them into a deliverable
state, the ownership does not pass until such thing is done and the buyer has
notice thereof. (Sec 21)
EXAMPLE
a. S sells a scooter to B for Rs. 50,000. B pays at the time of contract. But
contract requires S to paint the scooter in gray colour. B will become the
owner when the scooter is painted and B has notice of it.
b. A machine weighing 30 tons and fixed in a concrete floor was sold. A part of
the machine was damaged while being removed. Held, the buyer could
refuse to take the machine as it was not in a deliverable state. (Underwood
vs. BC Cement Syndicate)'
5. Goods to be measured
When there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable
state but the seller is bound to weigh, measure, test or do some other act or thing
with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the property
does not pass until such act is done and the buyer has notice thereof. (Sec 22)
EXAMPLE
Z sold 289 bales of goatskins to F. Before Z could count them, the bales
were destroyed by fire. Held, the loss fell on Z because the ownership had not
transferred to F. (Zagury vs. Furnell)²
6. Unconditional appropriation
When there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by
description, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when goods of that
description in deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract,
either by the seller with assent of the buyer or by the buyer with assent of the
seller. (Sec. 23(1))
EXAMPLE
T bought 20 bags of sugar from R. R filled up 20 bags. T took delivery of
4 bags and promised to take the rest later. T failed to collect the remaining and R
sued for price. Held, the ownership had passed to the buyer. (Rhode vs.
Thwaites)³
7. Delivery to Carrier

transfers to the buyer. The term appropriation involves separating, weighing,
measuring, counting or similar acts. (Sec. 23(2))
EXAMPLE
B buys a fridge from A, a shopkeeper. When A handovers the fridge to
the carrier, the ownership transfers to B.
8. Goods delivered on Approval
When the goods are delivered to the buyer on approval or on sale or
return' or other similar terms, the property therein passes to the buyer:
a. When he gives his acceptance to the seller or does any other act adopting
the transaction.
b. If he does not give his acceptance to the seller but retains the goods without
giving notice of rejection beyond the time fixed for the return of goods, or if no
time has been fixed beyond a reasonable time. (Sec. 24)
EXAMPLES
a. A sends jewelry to B on terms of sale or return. The jewelry becomes B's
property when B retains them.
b. B delivered a horse to E on terms of sale or return within 8 days. The horse
died on the 3rd day without any fault of E. Held, B was to bear the loss as the
horse was still his property. (Elphick vs. Barnes)4
Sale by Non-Owner
Generally, only the owner of the goods can sell the goods. If the seller is
not the owner of the goods, the buyer cannot become the true owner even
though he has paid value for the goods. This protects the true owner of the
goods. The maxim 'nemo dat quod non habet' means that no one can transfer a
better title that he himself possesses.
EXAMPE
C steals a radio and sells it to B. B buys it without notice that C is not the
true owner. The true owner can recover it from B.
Exceptions
The following are cases under which a non-owner can sell the goods and
the buyer becomes the true owner of those goods:
1. Person not the Owner
When the owner of the goods, by his words or conduct or act or omission,
causes the buyer to believe that the seller has the authority to sell them, he
cannot afterwards deny the seller's authority to sell. The buyer in such a case
gets a better title than the seller. (Sec 27 para 1)

2. Mercantile Agent
When a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession
of goods or documents of title to goods, any sale made by him in the ordinary
course of business shall be valid provided the buyer acts in good faith and
without notice that the seller had no authority to sell. (Provisio to Sec 27)

sold the car to S below the stated price. S resold the car to K. Held, S transferred
a good title to K and F was not entitled to recover the car. (Folks vs. King)
3. Joint Owner
When one of the joint owners, having possession of the goods by
permission of the co-owner, sells the goods, a buyer gets a good title to the
goods provided the buyer buys them in good faith and without notice that the
seller's title was defective at the time of contract. (Sec. 28)
EXAMPLE
A, B and C are three brothers. They jointly own a cow. B and C leave the
cow for look after in A's possession. A sells the cow to D. D gets a good title.

PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACT OF SALE
Introduction
The performance of contract of sale means the performance of
respective duties of the seller and buyer as per the terms of the contract. The
parties to a contract should include the terms in their contract regarding time,
place of delivery, modes of delivery, payment of price, etc. If the contract is silent
in this regard, the rules contained in the Sale of Goods Act apply. (Sec.31)
Delivery of Goods
Delivery means 'a voluntary transfer of possession from one person to
another.' (Sec. 2 (2))
EXAMPLE
B steals goods from A. There is no delivery of goods from A to B though
possession is transferred.
Modes of Delivery
Delivery of goods may be made in any of the following ways:
1. Actual Delivery
When the goods are physically handed over by the seller or his agent to
the buyer or his agent, the delivery is called actual delivery.
EXAMPLE
A sells a car to B. A hands over the car to B. It is an actual delivery.
2. Symbolic Delivery
When a bulk of the goods is sold, it is not possible to give actual delivery
of the goods. In such a case, the control over the goods is transferred by
symbolic delivery.
EXAMPLE
A sells to B certain goods which are stored in a locked godown. A hands
over the key of the godown to B. It is a symbolic delivery.
3. Constructive Delivery
A constructive delivery occurs when change in the possession of goods
takes place without any change in the actual custody of the goods.

to Y. Z transfers the cement in his books to Y. This is a constructive delivery.
Rules of Delivery of Goods
The rules regarding delivery of goods are as follows:

B. B is responsible to pay the price to A.
2. Delivery and Payment
Unless otherwise agreed, the seller shall be ready to deliver the goods to
the buyer in exchange for the price and the buyer shall be ready to pay the price
in exchange for possession of goods simultaneously. (Sec. 32)

Delivery of goods sold may be made by any of the ways on which the
parties agree. It may be actual, symbolic or constructive. (Sec. 33)

removal of cement from A's godown is a delivery.
4. Effect of Part Delivery
When the part delivery is made in progress of the whole delivery, it is
treated as delivery of the whole. The ownership in the whole of the goods passes
to the buyer. But when the part delivery is made with the intention of separating it
from the whole, it is not treated as delivery of the whole. The ownership of the
whole quantity does not transfer to the buyer. (Sec. 34)
EXAMPLES

bales. It will be treated as the delivery of whole.

TROME
NATURE OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT
Introduction
The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 deals with the promissory note, bill
of exchange and cheques. It came into force on 1st March, 1882. (Sec. 1 (A))
Definition
The word 'negotiable' means transferable by delivery and the word
'instrument' means a written document which creates a right in favour of some
person. Negotiable Instrument is a piece of paper which entitles a person to a
sum of money mentioned in it and which is freely transferable from one person to
another. (Sec. 13)
Characteristics
The characteristics of negotiable instruments are as follows:
1. Freely Transferable
The right of ownership in these instruments can be transferred from one
person to another easily. If the instrument is payable to bearer, the property in
negotiable instrument is transferred to the transferee by delivery. If instrument is
payable to order, the property in negotiable instrument transfers by endorsement
and delivery.
2. Rights of Holder
A holder of negotiable instrument has a right to recover the money from
the person liable on the instrument. The holder can recover this amount himself
or transfer his right to another person. The transferee can sue the person liable in
his own name in case of dishonor. The holder of the instrument need not give
notice of transfer to the party liable.
3. Better Title
A person taking the negotiable instrument in good faith without
negligence and for value trusting it bonafide becomes holder in due course. He
gets the instrument free from all defects. He is not affected by any defect of title
of the transferor or any prior party. A holder in due course gets a better title even
the title of the transferor might be defective.
4. Promise or Order
A negotiable instrument contains an unconditional promise or order to
pay. In case of promissory note the debtor promises to pay a certain sum of
money to the holder of the instrument. In case of bill of exchange and cheque
186
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 194
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Negotiable Instrument
187
the creditors orders his debtor to pay a certain sum of money to the holder of the
instruments.
5. Certain Amount
In the negotiable instruments, the promise or order is made for the
payment of certain amount. The person liable to pay on the instrument must pay
certain amount of money and not anything else. It can call for payment in
currency but cannot ask for payment in goods, etc. (Sec. 5 Para 3)
6. Presumptions
Certain presumptions of law apply to all negotiable instruments such as
consideration, date, time of acceptance, stamp, and holder in due course.
Therefore it is not necessary for the party entitled to receive money on the
instrument to prove the validity of his claim. (Sec. 118-119)
7. In writing
A negotiable instrument must be in writing. An oral promise or order to
pay money cannot be called negotiable instrument.
Negotiable Instrument
Few examples of negotiable instruments are bills of exchange,
promissory notes, cheques, dividend warrants, share warrants, bearer
debentures, government circular notes, banks drafts etc.
Non-negotiable Instrument
Few examples of non-negotiable instruments are money orders, postal
orders, fixed deposit receipt, share certificates, carrier receipts, bill of lading, etc.
PROMISSORY NOTE
Definition
"A promissory note is an instrument in writing (not being a bank note or a
currency note) containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker, to
pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time a certain sum of money
only to, or to the order of, a certain person, or to the bearer of the instrument."
(Sec. 4)

CHEQUE
195
"A cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified bank and not

payable is called payee.
Essentials
The following are essentials of a cheque:
1. In writing
The cheque must be in writing. Cheques which are printed or made out

cheques can easily be altered. Customers should be encouraged to draw
cheques in ink. Cheques prepared in lead pencil are returned unpaid.
EXAMPLES
A draws a cheque in the following terms:
a. Pay X or bearer Rs. 500.
b. Pay X Rs. 500.
The above cheques are valid.
2. Unconditional Order
It must contain an order to pay unconditionally. If the bank is ordered to
pay upon the condition of payee's signing the receipt, then the instrument is a
conditional order and thus not a cheque.
EXAMPLES
a. A draws a cheque "Pay C Rs. 300." It is a valid cheque.
b. A draws a cheque "Pay C Rs. 400, if you can." It is not a valid cheque as it is
conditional.
3. Signed by Drawer
A cheque will be valid only if it is signed by the account holder or by
someone who is authorized to sign on his behalf.
EXAMPLE
A draws a cheque but does not sign thereon. "Pay M, Rs. 500." It is not a
valid cheque.
4. Payable on Demand
nish
A cheque is always drawn payable on demand. The demand should be
made within a reasonable time. In Pakistan the cheques must be presented

needs." It is not a valid cheque.

Types of Cheque
The cheque may be divided in the following two types:
1. Open Cheque

of the cheque. It need not be presented through a bank account. It has two kinds.

holder of the cheque. There is a great risk involved in this case. If this cheque
goes into wrong hands, he may get the payment from the bank unless its
payment has already been stopped.
b. Order Cheque
It is also payable at the counter of the bank. It is paid by the bank after
being satisfied about the true identity of the holder of the cheque.

2. Crossed Cheque
Negotiable Instrument
It is not payable at the counter. Its payment is made only through the
collecting bank of a customer. The collecting bank credits the proceeds of the
cheque to the account of the payee. The crossing provides protection to the
holder of the cheque.
Crossing of a Cheque
Meaning
A cheque is said to be crossed when two parallel transverse lines are
drawn on the left upper corner of the cheque.
Purpose
The purpose of the crossing is to give a direction to the bank not to pay
the cheque across the counter but to pay it only to a bank.
Types
There are two types of crossing:
1. General Crossing
Where a cheque bears across its face an addition of the words "and
company" or any abbreviation thereof, between the two parallel transverse lines,
or of two parallel transverse lines simply, either with or without the words "not
negotiable," that addition shall be deemed a crossing, and the cheque shall be
deemed to be crossed generally. (Sec. 123)
Where a cheque is crossed generally, the bank on whom it is drawn shall
not pay it otherwise than to the bank. A general crossing can be made as follows:
(Sec. 126)

2. Special Crossing

Where a cheque bears across its face an addition of the name of a bank,
either with or without the words "not negotiable" that an addition shall be deemed

a crossing, and the cheque shall be deemed to be crossed specially and to be
crossed that bank. Thus, where a cheque is crossed specially the bank on whom
it is drawn shall not pay it otherwise than to the bank to whom it is crossed or his
agent for collection. The special crossing can be made as follows: (Sec. 124)

Account Payee & Not Negotiable
Account Payee Crossing

In this type of crossing the words 'account payee' or 'payee's account
only' or 'A/c payee' is added to the general or special crossing. It has the
following effects. (Sec. 123 (A))
1. It becomes non-transferable.
2. It becomes the duty of the collecting bank to credit the proceeds of the
cheque only to the account of the payee named in the cheque.
Not Negotiable Crossing
A cheque marked with the words 'not negotiable' can be transferred by
payee. The transferee will get the same rights, as regards payment, as the
transferor had. But the transferee will not get the rights of a holder in due course.
A person taking a cheque crossed generally or specially, bearing in either
case the words not negotiable', shall not have, and shall not be capable of
giving, a better title to the cheque than that which the person from whom he took
it had. (Sec. 130)
The object of not negotiable' crossing is to provide protection to the
holder or drawer of a cheque because even if such cheque goes to wrong hands
time true owner will not lose his claim.
Who May Cross a Cheque?
The following may cross a cheque: (Sec. 125)
1. Where a cheque is uncrossed, the holder may cross it generally or specially.
2. Where a cheque is crossed generally, the holder may cross it specially.

3. Where a cheque is crossed generally, or specially, the holder may add the
words not negotiable'.
4. Where a cheque is crossed specially, the bank to which it is crossed may
again cross it especially, to another bank or his agent for collection.
5. When an uncrossed cheque or a cheque crossed generally is sent to a bank
for collection, the bank may cross it especially to itself.
Classification of Negotiable Instruments

A note, bill or cheque drawn or made in Pakistan payable in, or drawn
upon any person resident in Pakistan shall be deemed to be an inland

contain words, prohibiting transfer or indicating an intention that it shall not be
transferable (Sec. 13(1))
5. Ambiguous Instrument.
An instrument which cannot be clearly identified either as promissory note
or as bill of exchange is an ambiguous instrument. It is a faulty instrument. Its
holder may treat it as a bill of exchange or promissory note, for example, when in
a bill the drawer and the drawee are the same persons. (Sec. 17).
6. Difference in Figures and words
If the amount undertaken or ordered to be paid is stated differently in
figures and in words, the amount stated in words shall be the amount undertaken

amount may be ascertained by referring to the figures. (Sec. 18)
7. Instrument payable on demand
A note or bill is payable on demand (a) where it is expressed to be so or
to be payable at sight or on presentment or (b) where no time for payment is

and 'presentment' means on demand. (Sec. 19)
8. Inchoate Instrument
It is an incomplete instrument. A person signs and delivers to another, a
blank or incomplete stamped instrument and authorizes the other person to
convert it into negotiable instrument by filling the blanks. When the instrument is
filled up, the signer becomes liable on the instrument. The signer is liable to the
amount specified therein but not exceeding the amount covered by the stamp.
But no person other than a holder in due course shall recover from the person
delivering the instrument anything in excess of the amount intended to be paid by
him. (Sec. 20)
9. Time Instrument

of event which is certain to happen.
The expression 'after sight' means (a) in a note, after presentment for
sight (b) in a bill, after acceptance or noting for non-acceptance or protest for
non-acceptance. A cheque cannot be a time instrument because the cheque is
always payable on demand. (Sec.21)
10. Fictitious Bill
A fictitious bill is a bill in which the name of the drawer or the payee or
both is fictitious. When both the drawer and payee of a bill are fictitious persons,
the acceptor is liable to holder in due course if the holder in due course can show

are in the same handwriting. (Sec. 42)
11. Accommodation Bill
An accommodation bill means a bill which is drawn and accepted without

Party. The party accommodated is called the accommodated Party. (Sec. 43)
12. Undated Bill
When the date of a bill is not mentioned and where the date of the
acceptance of a bill, payable at a fixed period after sight is omitted, any holder
may insert the true date of issue or acceptance as the case may be and such
insertion is valid. The instrument cannot be considered invalid merely because it
is undated.

13. Bank Draft
Negotiable Instrument
It is an order issued by one bank to another bank or to its branch to pay a
specified sum of money to a specified person or his order. It is a negotiable
instrument like a cheque. Its payment cannot be stopped. It is also known as

parts remain unpaid (c) each part must contain reference to the other parts (d)
each part must be signed and delivered by drawer (e) all the parts of the whole
set need not be accepted (f) when a person accepts or indorses different parts of
the bill in favour of different persons, he and the subsequent endorsers of each
part are liable on such parts as a it were a separate bill (g) as between holders in
due course of different parts of the same set, he who first acquired title to his part
is entitled to the other parts and the money represented by the bill (Sec. 132-133)
15. Documentary Bill
When documents relating to the goods represented by the bill, e.g., bill of
lading or railway receipt, marine insurance policy etc. are attached to a bill, the
bill is called a documentary bill.
16. Clean Bill
When no documents of title relating to the goods and other documents
are attached to the bill, it is called a clean bill.
17. Trade Bill
A bill may be trade bill or accommodation bill. When a bill is drawn,

for a special purpose only, e.g., as collateral security or for safe custody, and not
for the purpose of transferring absolutely property therein, is called an 'Escrow'.
In this case, the property in the instrument does not pass to the endorsee. The
liability to pay in case of an escrow does not arise if conditions agreed upon are
not fulfilled or the purpose for which the instrument was delivered is not satisfied.
It does not affect rights of a holder in due course. (Sec. 46)
Maturity of Negotiable Instrument
Maturity means the date on which the payment of instrument falls due.
The instrument payable on demand becomes payable immediately. The cheque
is always payable on demand so there is no question of its maturity. An
instrument which is not payable on demand becomes mature on the third day
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 210
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Negotiable Instrument
203
after the day on which it is expressed to be payable. These 3 days are called
Days of Grace.

1. If a note or bill is payable at stated number of months after date or after sight,
or after a certain event, it becomes payable after 3 days of the corresponding
date of the month after the stated number of months.
2. If the month in which the period terminates has no corresponding day, it
becomes mature on the last day of the month.
3. The day on which the bill or note is drawn, or presented for acceptance, or
sight, or the day on which the event happens, is excluded
4. When the day on which a note or bill is at maturity is a holiday, the instrument
is deemed to be due on the next preceding business day
5. The expression 'public holiday' includes Sundays, and any other day
declared by the Federal Government, by notification in the Official Gazette to
be public holiday.

Payment in Due Course
Payment in due course" means payment in accordance with the apparent
tenor of the instrument in good faith and without negligence to any person in
possession thereof under circumstances which do not afford a reasonable
ground for believing that he is not entitled to receive payment of the amount
therein mentioned. For a payment in due course the following conditions must be
fulfilled: (Sec. 10)
1. Apparent Tenor
The payment must be in accordance with the apparent tenor of the
instrument. A payment before maturity cannot be called a payment in due
course. Thus, if a bill is paid before' the last day of grace and is subsequently
indorsed over, it is valid in the hands of holder in due course and the acceptor
will be liable to pay again on the instrument. Similarly, a payment by a bank of a
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 211
www.AccountancyPoint.com
204
Negotiable Instrument
post dated cheque before the date mentioned therein cannot be called as
payment in due course.
2. Good Faith and Without Negligence
The payment must be made in good faith and without negligence. It must
be made under the honest belief that the person demanding payment is legally
entitled to it. The payer must not be guilty of any negligence in making payment.
If the payer makes payments, without making necessary inquiry in case of
suspicious circumstances, such payment cannot be called payment in due
course.
3. Holder of Instrument
The payment must be made to a person in possession of the instruments
who is entitled to receive payment. A payment without requiring production of the
instrument is not a payment in due course. The payer must see the instrument
before payment. He must also obtain the instrument on payment.
4. Legal Tender Money
The payment must be made in money only, unless the holder agrees to
accept payment in any other medium or by cheque or draft.

PARTIES TO NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT
HOLDER
Definition
The holder of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque means the
payee or endorsee who is in possession of it or the bearer thereof but it does not
include a beneficial owner claiming though a benamidar. (Sec.8)
When the note, bill or cheque is lost and not found again, or is destroyed,
the person in possession of it or the bearer thereof at the time of such loss or
destruction shall be considered its holder.
Conditions
To be a holder, a person must satisfy the following conditions:
1. Entitled to Possess
In order to become holder the person must have a legal right to possess.
The person must be named in the instrument as the payee or the endorsee or
the bearer, if it is bearer instrument. However, the heir of a deceased holder is
also a holder though he is not a payee, endorsee or bearer thereof. Thus a thief,
or a finder or an endorsee under forged endorsement cannot become holder
though he possesses the instrument.
2. Entitled to Receive the Amount
In order to become holder, the person must have the right to receive the
amount of the instrument and give a valid discharge to the payer. Thus, one may
be the bearer or the payee or endorsee but he may not be the holder if a court
prohibits him from receiving the amount. For example, in case of a pro-note
payable to A or order, A keeps the note with B, for safe custody. B will not
become the holder although the instrument is in his possession.
3. Entitled to Negotiate
In order to become holder, the person must have the right to negotiate it
further according to the law. (Sec. 57-B))
4. Entitled to Sue
In order to become holder, the person must also be entitled to sue on
such instrument in his own name. If the person responsible to make payment
refuses to pay, the person to become holder must have a right to sue in his own
name for the payment. (Sec. 57-B)
HOLDER IN DUE COURSE
Holder in due course means any person who for consideration becomes
the possessor of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque if payable to
206
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 214
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Parties to Negotiable Instrument
207
bearer, or the payee or endorsee thereof, if payable to order, before it became
overdue, without notice that the title of the person from whom he derived his own
title was defective. (Sec. 9)
The title of a person to a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is
defective when he is not entitled to receive the amount due thereon (Sec. 58)
Conditions
To become a holder in due course, the following conditions must satisfy:
1. Holder
He must be entitled to the possession of the instrument in his own name
under a legal title. He must have a legal right to recover the amount from the
parties liable to make payment.
2. Lawful Consideration
He must be the holder of the instrument against consideration.
Consideration, however, need not be adequate. A person who gets instrument by
way of gift cannot become holder in due course due to lack of consideration. The
consideration must also be lawful.
3. Holder before Maturity
The holder who gets a negotiable instrument after its maturity cannot
become holder in due course. But an accommodation bill can be negotiated after
maturity to holder in due course. (Sec. 59)
4. Complete and Regular
In order to become a holder in due course, the instrument must be
complete in all respects. If the instrument contains any alteration, which has not
been confirmed by the drawer through signature, the possessor cannot become
holder in due course. The possessor will not become a holder in due course if it
is incomplete, e.g. not properly stamped.
5. Holder in Good Faith
He must get the instrument in good faith under the belief that the title of
the transferor is not defective. He must find out the exact position of the
transferor's title. He must take the instrument without any negligence. If he does
not make proper enquiries at the time of taking instrument, he cannot be called a
holder in due course.
Privileges
A holder in due course enjoys the following privileges:
1. Better Title
A holder in due course gets a better title than that of the transferor. Any
defence on the part of the person liable that the instrument has been lost or
obtained by offence or fraud or for an unlawful consideration cannot be pleaded
against a holder in due course. (Sec. 58)
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 215
www.AccountancyPoint.com
208
EXAMPLE
Parties to Negotiable Instrument
P obtains an instrument by fraud, he cannot sue. If P transfers it to R
under circumstances which make R a holder in due course, R can sue. The
drawee can defend on the basis of fraud against P but not against R.
2. Transfer of Good Title
A holder in due course transfers a good title to subsequent holders. Once
an instrument passes through the hands of a holder in due course it becomes
free from all defects. When somebody gets instrument from holder in due course,
he can recover the amount from all prior parties provided he is not a party to the
fraud. (Sec. 53)
EXAMPLE
A bearer cheque is stolen by A, who gives it to B, a holder in due course.
B can receive the payment.
3. Incomplete Stamped Instrument
In case of incomplete stamped instrument, if the original payee fills more
amount than he was authorized, he cannot recover the whole amount. But if the
same instrument is transferred to the holder in due course, he can claim the
whole amount provided it is covered by the stamp affixed thereon. (Sec. 20)
EXAMPLE
A signs and delivers a blank promissory note to B and asks him to fill in
Rs. 500. B fills in Rs. 1000 the amount being covered by the stamp on the note;
C acquires the note as a holder in due course. C can recover Rs. 1000 from A.
4. Prior Parties
A holder in due course holds the negotiable instrument free from any
defect of title of prior parties, and free from defences available to prior parties
among themselves, and may enforce payment of the instrument for the full
amount thereof against all parties liable thereon. (Sec. 53-A)
EXAMPLE
A draws and B accepts the bill payable to C or order. C endorses it to D
and D to E, a holder in due course. E can recover the amount from A, B, C or D.
5. Fictitious Bill
The holder in due course is entitled to payment from the acceptor if he
can show that the signature of the drawer and that of the first endorser are in the
same handwriting. If the holder knows that the drawer's name is fictitious, he is
not a holder in due course. The acceptor of a bill cannot as against a holder in
due course say that the other parties to the bill were fictitious. (Sec. 42)
EXAMPLE
A draws a bill on B, payable to F, a fictitious person. B accepts and
returns to A. A endorses to C by signing as F. C endorses to X, a holder in due
course. X can recover from B by showing that the signatures of drawer and first
indorser are in the same handwriting.

6. Instrument without Consideration
209
A contract made without consideration is void. But if a negotiable
instrument goes into the hands of holder in due course, he is entitled to recover
the amount on it, from any of the prior parties thereof. (Sec. 43)
7. Conditional Instrument
When a negotiable instrument is delivered to a person for security or safe
custody, and not with the object of transferring ownership, the ownership in the
instrument does not pass to the transferee. If such an instrument is negotiated to
a holder in due course, the parties liable on the instrument shall remain liable to
him. (Sec. 46)
EXAMPLE
A does not transfer the ownership of bill to B but delivers it for safe
custody. B endorses to X, a holder in due course. It is valid bill in the hands of X.
8. Validity of Instrument
The maker of a promissory note and the drawer of a bill of exchange or
cheque and the acceptor of a bill cannot in a suit thereon by a holder in due
course, deny the validity of the instrument as originally made or drawn. (Sec.
120)
EXAMPLE
A bought a car from B and issued him a note. A felt that B got his consent
by fraud. The note reached X, a holder in due course who claimed payment. A
cannot refuse payment on the ground that contract was made by fraud.
9. Payee's Incapacity to Indorse
The maker of a note and acceptor of a bill payable to order cannot, in a
suit by a holder in due course, deny the payee's capacity at the date of the note
or bill to endorse it. A holder in due course can claim payment in his own name
despite the payee's incapacity to endorse. (Sec. 121)
EXAMPLE
A draws a bill on B and endorses it to C, a person of unsound mind. C
endorses to E, a holder in due course. In a suit by E, B cannot say that endorser
was insane.
10. Capacity of Prior Parties
No endorser of a negotiable instrument shall, in a suit thereon by a
subsequent holder, be permitted to deny the signature or capacity to contract of
any prior party to the instrument (Sec. 122).
EXAMPLE
A, a minor draws a bill on B and endorses to C. C endorses to X, a holder
in due course. In a suit by X, B cannot say that drawer is a minor.
JOINT HOLDERS
When in a bill there are several payees or endorsees, all of them are joint
holders and none of them can alone negotiate or sue on it. All of them must join
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 217
www.AccountancyPoint.com
210
Parties to Negotiable Instrument
to negotiate or sue on it. If one of them is dead, all the legal representatives of
the deceased must join with the surviving payee or endorsee to negotiate the
instrument or sue on it.
DRAWEE IN CASE OF NEED
Sometimes the name of an alternative drawee may be mentioned in a bill
of exchange. Such a person will accept the bill, if the original drawee does not
accept it or refuses to pay after acceptance. Such an alternative drawee is known
as a drawee in case of need'. If such a drawee is mentioned, a bill dishonoured
by the actual drawee must be presented to alternative drawee before the drawer
can be made liable. (Sec. 7)
ACCEPTOR FOR HONOUR
When a bill of exchange has been noted or protested for non-acceptance
or for better security, and any person not being a party already liable thereon
may, with the consent of the holder, by writing on the bill, accept the same for the
honour of any party thereto. Such person is called an "acceptor for honour. The
purpose of such acceptance is to save the honour of any party liable and to save
the prestige of the drawer. A person desiring to accept for honour must declare
that he accepts under protest. (Sec. 108-109)
Capacity of Parties
The position of different persons is as follows: (Sec. 26-29)
1. Minor
A minor can draw, endorse, deliver and negotiate a negotiable instrument
so as to bind the other parties except himself. Minor may be a payee but not a
party liable on it.
2. Insolvent
An insolvent cannot draw, make, accept or endorse a negotiable
instrument. If he endorses a negotiable instrument under which he is a payee to
a holder in due course, then the holder in due course can recover from all parties
except the insolvent. An insolvent cannot sue on the instrument as his property
comes in the possession of official receiver.
3. Person of unsound mind
A person of unsound mind is not liable upon a negotiable instrument to
which he is a party, and as such a bill or note executed by a person of unsound
mind is void as against him even in the hands of holder in due course while the
other parties remain liable on it.
4. Joint Stock Company
A company can draw, accept, or endorse a negotiable instrument if it is
authorized to do so by its Memorandum of Association. If it exceeds its powers, it
would be void and it will not be liable to even a holder in due course.

drawing, accepting, endorsing or negotiating a negotiable instrument to the
extent authorized by law relating to partnership for the time being in force.
6. Agent
An agent can draw, accept and endorse a negotiable instrument on
behalf of his principal with the express authority taken from principal. An agent
must sign the instrument indicating that he is signing on behalf of his principal
otherwise he would be personally liable.
7. Legal representative
A legal representative of a deceased person who signs the negotiable
instrument is personally liable thereon unless he expressly limits his liability to
the extent of the assets recovered by him as such. He may avoid personal
liability by writing the words "without recourse to me personally" against the
estate of the deceased only.
Liabilities of Parties
The following is nature of the liabilities of various parties:
1. Drawer
The drawer of a bill of exchange or cheque is bound, in case of dishonour
by the drawee or acceptor thereof, to compensate the holder, provided due
notice of dishonour has been given to or received by him. (Sec. 30)
2. Drawee of cheque
The bank must honour the cheque of the drawer provided he has in his
hands sufficient funds of the drawer. If the bank refuses to make payment without
sufficient cause being shown, he must compensate the drawer for any loss or
damage caused by such default. (Sec. 31)
3. Maker of note and acceptor of bill
The maker of a promissory note is bound to pay the amount of the
instrument at maturity according to the apparent tenor of the note. As soon as he
signs the note and delivers it, he becomes liable to the payee or the holder. He is
the debtor and his liability is primary. The acceptor of a bill of exchange at or
after maturity is bound to pay the amount thereof to the holder on demand. In
default of such payment the maker or acceptor is bound to compensate any party
to the note or bill for any loss or damage sustained by him and caused by such
default. (Sec. 32)
4. Indorser
The indorser of a negotiable instrument must compensate the holder for
any loss or damage caused to him by dishonour under the following conditions:

liability.
d. If due notice of dishonour is given to or received by such endorser.
5. Prior parties to a holder in due course

PRESENTMENT OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT

sight or payment before acceptor, maker, drawee or other party liable thereon by
the holder. There are three kinds of presentment.
1. Presentment for Acceptance
3. Presentment for Payment
2. Presentment for Sight

It does not apply to a cheque or a pronote. The following bills need not be
presented for acceptance:
1. A bill payable on demand.
2. A bill payable on the expiry of certain period after date.
3. A bill payable on the date of happening of a certain event.
However, the following bills must be presented for acceptance:

drawee for sight or acceptance to fix the maturity date of the bill.
2. A bill in which there is an express stipulation that it shall be presented for
acceptance before presentment for payment. (Sec. 61)
Acceptance
Acceptance means acknowledgment of the sum mentioned in a bill by the
drawee or any other person on his behalf. The drawee is not liable on the bill
unless the bill is presented to him for acceptance and he actually accepts it. The
drawee gives his consent in writing to the bill by signing it. He writes the word
accepted' and delivers back to the holder.
Essentials of valid Acceptance
The following are essentials of a valid acceptance:

NEGOTIATION OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT
Introduction
WA
Negotiation of an instrument is the process by which the ownership of the
instrument is transferred from one person to another. The holder of the
instrument does not wait for maturity but transfers it to his creditor to clear his
debts. A negotiable instrument may be transferred by (1) negotiation or (2)
assignment
1. Transfer by Negotiation
не
When a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is transferred to any
person, so as to constitute that person the holder thereof, the instrument is said
to be negotiated. As a result of negotiation, the holder will be entitled to receive
the amount and sue for recovery. Only handing over of the instrument to a
servant for safe custody is not negotiation. It must be transferred with the
intention to pass title to the transferee. (Sec. 14)
Modes of Negotiation
There are two ways of negotiating a negotiable instrument:
a. Negotiation by Delivery
W
A negotiable instrument payable to bearer can only be transferred by
delivery. It does not require the signature of the transferor. (Sec. 47)
b. Negotiation by Endorsement and Delivery
A negotiable instrument payable to order can be negotiated by the holder
by endorsement and delivery. The holder must sign his name on the instrument
for the purpose of negotiation and deliver it to the transferee. (Sec. 48)
2. Transfer by Assignment
ite
180 or W:
The ownership of the instrument may be transferred by 'assignment' by
written and registered document in accordance with the Transfer of Property Act.

debtor.
3. Title

negotiable instrument free from all
defects in the title of the previous
transferors.
4. Consideration

5. Sue

the party in his own name.
Who may Negotiate
Every maker, drawer, payee or endorsee, and where there are several
makers, drawers, payees, or endorsees, all of them jointly may negotiate an
instrument, provided the negotiability of such instrument has not been restricted
by the express words used in instrument. Only the lawful possessor can
negotiate the instrument (Sec. 51.)
Duration of Negotiability
The negotiable instruments can be negotiated by any person until
payment. However, the maker, drawee or acceptor can negotiate it until maturity.
(Sec. 60)
Definition
ENDORSEMENT
The process of transferring an instrument is called endorsement. An
endorsement means signing the negotiable instrument on the back or face
thereof or on a slip of paper (called allonge) annexed thereto for the purpose of
negotiation.
The person making the endorsement is called an endorser and the
person to whom the instrument is indorsed is called the endorsee
Essentials of Valid Endorsement
Following are the essentials of valid endorsement:
1. It must be signed by the endorser.
2. It must be made by the maker or holder of the instrument.
3. It must be on the back or face of the instrument or on a slip of paper annexed
thereto, such a slip is called allonge.
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 229
www.AccountancyPoint.com
222
Negotiation of Negotiable Instrument
4. It must be made in ink. An endorsement in pencil or by rubber stamp is
invalid.
5. If the endorser is illiterate person, he may indorse the instrument by affixing
his thumb impression thereon.
6. In case of endorsement by affixing thumb impression, it should be attested by
somebody.
7. It must be made with the intention of transferring the instrument to a third
person to give him a right to recover money.
8. The intention must be clearly expressed thereon.
9. It must be completed by the delivery of the instrument.
Effect of Endorsement
When a negotiable instrument is indorsed and delivered to the endorser,
the ownership of the instrument and the right of further negotiation passes to the
endorsee. (Sec. 50)
Kinds of Endorsement
The endorsement may be of the following six kinds:-
1. Blank Endorsement
When the endorser signs his name only and does not specify the name of
the endorsee, the endorsement is said to be in blank. This makes the instrument
transferable by delivery and it becomes payable to bearer. It is also called
general endorsement. (Sec. 16 & 54)
EXAMPLE
A bill is payable to X. X signs and endorses it without mentioning the
name of any endorsee. It is a blank endorsement.
2. Full Endorsement
If the endorser, in addition to his signature, also adds a direction to pay
the amount mentioned in the instrument to, or to the order of a specified person,
the endorsement is said to be in full or special endorsement (Sec. 16)
EXAMPLE
B makes endorsement by writing the words, 'pay to A or order' and signs
it, it is a full endorsement.
3. Partial Endorsement
A negotiable instrument cannot be indorsed for a part of the amount due
on the instrument. In other words, a partial endorsement, which transfers the
right to receive only a part payment of the amount due on the instrument, is
invalid. Where an instrument has been partly paid, it can be negotiated for the
balance provided the fact of part payment is noted on the instruments. (Sec. 56)
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 230
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Negotiation of Negotiable Instrument
EXAMPLES
223
a. A holds a bill for Rs. 5000 and endorses it in favour of B for Rs.2000 and in
favour of C for Rs. 3000 is partial and invalid.
b. The maker of a note for Rs. 10000 pays Rs. 7000 and the fact is noted on the
instruments. The holder can negotiate the note for the balance.
4. Restrictive Endorsement
When endorser by express words prohibits the endorsee from further
negotiating the instrument or restricts the endorsee to deal with the instrument as
directed by the endorser is called restrictive endorsement. (Sec. 50)
EXAMPLE
B the holder of the bill makes an endorsement on the bill saying 'pay C
only' it is a restrictive endorsement, as C cannot negotiate the bill further.
5. Conditional Endorsement
If the endorser of negotiable instrument by express words in the
endorsement, makes his liability dependent on the happening of a specified
event, although such event may never happen, such endorsement is called a
conditional endorsement (Sec. 52)
In conditional endorsement the liability of the endorser arises only upon
the happening of the event specified. If such event does not happen in specified
time, the liability of endorser comes to an end. The endorsee cannot claim
payment from prior parties. He can claim payment from the original party on
maturity.
EXAMPLE
A, the holder of the bill, makes an endorsement on the bill saying 'Pay B
or order when B qualifies B. Com.'
6. Sans Recourse Endorsement
All parties to a negotiable instrument are liable to the endorsee. However,
when the endorser expressly excludes his own liability on the negotiable
instrument to the endorsee or any subsequent holder in case of dishonour of the
instrument, the endorsement is known as sans recourse endorsement. (Sec. 52)
EXAMPLES
a. 'Pay X or order sans recourse.'
b. 'Pay B or order at his own risk.'
7. Facultative Endorsement
When the endorser expressly gives up some of his rights under the
negotiable instrument, the endorsement is called facultative endorsement.
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 231
www.AccountancyPoint.com
224
Negotiation of Negotiable Instrument
In this case the endorsee is relieved of his duty to give notice of his
dishonour to the endorser. The endorser remains liable to endorsee for non
payment, even though no notice of dishonour has been given to him.
EXAMPLE
'Pay X or order, notice of dishonour waived' is a facultative endorsement.
Negotiation Back
Negotiation back is a process under which an endorser becomes its
holder before its maturity. He has no remedy against the intermediate parties to
whom he was previously liable. (Sec. 52 P-2)
Instruments obtained by Unlawful Means
1. Lost instrument
When the holder of a negotiable instrument loses it, the finder gets no title
to it. The finder cannot lawfully transfer it. The owner can recover it from the
finder. But if the instrument is transferable by delivery, a holder obtaining it from
the finder in good faith for consideration and before maturity can recover
payment from all the parties. If the instrument is transferable by endorsement,
the finder cannot negotiate it except by forging the endorsement.
2. Stolen instrument
The position of thief of an instrument is the same as that of a finder of lost
instrument. The thief is open to criminal prosecution. A thief gets no title to an
instrument. If he receives payment on it, the holder can sue him for the recovery
of the amount. But if an instrument payable to bearer is stolen and is transferred
to a holder in due course, the owner must suffer.
3. Instrument obtained by fraud
A person who obtains an instrument by fraud, undue influence or
coercion, he is not entitled to claim payment as his title is defective. But if such
an instrument passes into the hands of a holder in due course the plea of fraud
cannot be used against him.
4. Instruments obtained for an unlawful consideration
An instrument given for an illegal consideration is void and does not
convey a valid title to the holder. He cannot enforce payment against any party
thereto. But if such an instrument passes in the hands of a holder in due course,
he obtains a good title.
5. Forged instrument
A forged instrument is that on which the signature of drawer, maker or
acceptor is forged. A forged endorsement is regarded as no endorsement. It is
ineffective and its holder cannot recover the amount due on it. It does not confer
any right or create any liability. If the holder of forged instrument obtains payment
on such instrument, the person making the payment can recover the amount.

www.AccountancyPoint.com
Negotiation of Negotiable Instrument
6. Forged endorsement
225
If an endorsement is forged, the endorsee acquires no title to the
instrument even if he is a bonafide purchaser. While, if the instrument is a bearer
instrument or has been endorsed in blank and there is a forged endorsement, the
holder gets a good title because holder derives title by delivery and not by
endorsement.
7. Instruments without consideration
A negotiable instrument made, drawn, accepted, endorsed or transferred
without consideration, creates no obligation of payment between the parties to
the transaction. But if the instrument is transferred to a holder for consideration,
such holder can recover the amount due from the transferor for consideration or
any prior party. (Sec. 43)

1. The holder of the instrument
2. The authorized agent of the holder

Notice of Dishonour Unnecessary
Dishonour of Negotiable Instrument
The notice of dishonour is unnecessary in the following cases: (Sec. 98)
1. When an endorser writes at the time of endorsement, no notice of dishonour
is required.
2. When the drawer of a cheque has stopped the payment of a cheque.
3. When the party charged could not suffer any damage for want of notice of
dishonour.
4. When the party entitled to notice could not be found.
5. When the drawer also happens to be the acceptor.
6. In case of promissory note which is not negotiable.
7. The party entitled to notice promises to pay unconditionally
modwyd epite
ST
8. When the notice could not be given due to unavoidable circumstances.
Noting
When a note or a bill has been dishonoured by non-acceptance or non-
payment, the holder may cause such dishonour to be noted by a Notary Public
upon the instrument, or upon a paper attached thereto. For this the holder takes
the bill or note to the Notary Public who makes a demand for acceptance or
payment upon the drawee or acceptor or maker formally and on his refusal to do
so notes the same on the bill or note. Thus, Noting is the authentic and official
proof of presentment and dishonour of a negotiable instrument. Noting does not
require in case of dishonour of a cheque because, the bank while refusing
payments returns the cheque giving reasons in writing for the dishonour of the
same. Such a cheque itself acts as a proof of dishonour. It contains the fact of
dishonour, the date of dishonour, the reasons for dishonour the notary's charges
and notary's signature. (Sec. 99)
Protest
Protest is a formal certificate of dishonour issued by the notary public to
the holder of the bill or note, on his demand. Noting is merely a record of
dishonour on the instrument itself. It is a proof that a bill or note was presented
for acceptance, payment or for better security but was dishonoured. The notary
public cannot grant protest unless presentment is made by himself or by his
agent. The advantage of protest is that the court on proof of the protest shall
presume the fact of dishonour. The following are the contents of protest. (Sec.
100)
1. The instrument itself or a literal transcript of the instrument and of everything
written or printed thereupon.
2. The name of the person for whom and against whom the instrument has
been protested;
3. The fact and reasons for dishonour.

4. The time and place of demand and dishonour;
5. The signature of the notary public;
229
6. In acceptance for honour or payment for honour the names of the person by
whom it is accepted or paid.
Protest for Better Security
When the acceptor of a bill becomes insolvent, the holder need not wait
till maturity of the bill. He may demand better security to ensure its payment on
due date. If on demand by the holder, the acceptor refuses to give better
security, the bill may be treated as dishonoured. But the suit may be filed only
after maturity. Such certificate is called a protest for better security. (Sec. 100)
Compensation for Dishonor
Following are the rules for determining compensation: (Sec. 117)
1. The holder is entitled to the amount due upon the instrument, together with
the expenses incurred in presenting, noting and protesting it.
2. Where the person charged resides at place, different from that at which the
instrument was payable, the holder is entitled to receive the sum at the
current rate of exchange between the two places.
3. An endorser who has paid the amount can get the amount with interest at 6
% per annum from the date of payment until realization together with
expenses caused by dishonour and non payment.
4. When the person charged and endorser reside at the different places the
endorser is entitled to receive such sum at the current rate of exchange
between two places.
5. A party is entitled to compensation may draw bill upon the party liable to
compensate him payable at sight or on demand, for the amount due to him
with all expenses properly incurred by him.
Dishonestly issuing Cheque
Whoever dishonestly issues a cheque towards re-payment of a loan or
fulfillment of an obligation which is dishonoured on presentation, shall be
punishable with imprisonment which may extend to three years, or with fine, or
with both, unless he can establish, for which the burden of proof shall rest on
him, that he had made arrangements with his bank to ensure that the cheque
would be honoured and that the bank was at fault in not honoring the cheque.
(Sec. 489-F-PPC Act 1860)

CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY LAND
Introduction
The law relating to carriage of goods may be studied under three heads:
(1) Carriage by Land (2) Carriage by Sea (3) Carriage by Air. The law relating to
carriage of goods by land is contained in (1) The Common Carriers Act, 1865
and (2) The Railways Act, 1890.
Contract of Carriage
A contract whereby a person or company agrees to carry goods or people
from one place to another in return of payment is called a contract of carriage.
Definition of Carrier
The party or person who carries goods or passengers for payment
whether by land, air or sea is called the Carrier.
Kinds of Carrier
The carrier may be of the following three kinds:
COMMON CARRIER
Definition
The Carriers Act, 1865 defines a Common Carrier as "any individual, firm
or company (other than the government) engaged in the business of transporting
for hire, goods from place to place, by land or inland navigation, for all persons
indiscriminately."
A common carrier is one who undertakes to carry goods for hire to
transport from one place to another the goods of anyone willing to employ him. A
person who reserves the right of accepting or rejecting the offers of goods for
carriage is not a common carrier.
Features
The following are features of common carrier:
1. Common Carrier
A common carrier may be an individual, firm or a company excluding
Government. Thus, Railways being owned by the Government cannot be called
as common carrier although the Railways are engaged in transporting goods.
Similarly post office is not a common carrier. It is not the agent of sender. It has
its own separate Act.

Carriage of Goods by Land
2. For Hire
237
A common carrier is one who is engaged in the business of transporting
goods for hire. It means that anyone who carries goods occasionally or free of
charge is not a common carrier. Similarly a carrier who carries passenger is not a
common carrier.
3. Regular Business
A common carrier carries goods as a regular business to earn money. If a
carrier carries goods occasionally, it is not a common carrier.
4. Inland Navigation
The carriage must be made by land or inland navigation (waterways). By
the term inland navigation means the carriage of goods by boats, steamers that
sail in canals and rivers.
5. All Persons Indiscriminately
A common carrier is bound to carry the goods of any person who offers
his goods for carriage and pays for the service, without any discrimination. If a
carrier reserves the right to reject an offer even if there is accommodation in the
carriage and the offeror is ready to pay the freight, he is not a common carrier.
Exceptions
A common carrier is one who is bound to carry the goods of any person
who employs him. However, a common carrier can refuse to carry goods in the
following circumstances:
1. If the vehicle is already full.
2. If goods are of such nature which he does not carry.
3. If goods are of dangerous nature and may result some extra-ordinary risk.
4. If the destination to which the goods are to be transported is not on his
normal route.
5. If reasonable charges for the carriage are not paid.
6. If goods are not properly packed.
7. If goods are offered at an unreasonable hour.
8. If the consigner refuses to disclose the nature of goods offered for carriage.
PRIVATE CARRIER
A private carrier is one who does not make general offer but carries
goods occasionally. He carries goods for a particular person on some terms
mutually agreed upon. He is not bound to carry goods for all indiscriminately. He
can accept or reject the offer for carriage of goods. In other words, when a
person does the work of carrying, not as a regular business but as a casual
contractor or reserves the right to accept or to reject the goods offered at his own
discretion, he is a private carrier. The Common Carriers Act, 1865 does not

Liabilities of Common Carrier
1. Under English Common Law
241
According to the English Common Law, a common carrier is liable as an
insurer of the goods. He is liable for damages to the goods whether he is
negligent or not. He is not responsible under the following circumstances:
a. Act of God
The Common carrier is not liable for losses due to an act of God. Usually
the lost caused by lightening, earthquake, flood etc. are due to an act of God.
b. Enemies of State
The carrier is not liable for losses caused by enemies of the state. The
enemies of the state mean alien enemies at war with Pakistan. It does not
include losses due to thieves, strike etc.
c. Inherent Defect
The common carrier is not liable for losses arising from inherent defects
e.g. evaporation of liquid material, perishing of fruits and vegetables, disease in
animals.
d. Defective Packing
goods.
The carrier is not liable if the loss arises due to defective packing of
e. Fraud or Fault of Consignor
If the consignor is guilty of fraud, the carrier is not liable for any loss. He is
also not liable for damages arising from the faults of the consignor or his agent.
2. Under Carrier Act, 1865
The liability of a Common Carrier is similar to that of a bailee. The carrier
is liable only if the loss occurs due to his fault or negligence. If he is not
negligent, he is not liable. The goods for the purpose of the carrier's liability are
classified into two categories namely scheduled goods and non-scheduled
goods.
a. Scheduled Goods
The scheduled goods are those which include valuable goods such as
gold, silver, precious stones, currency, title deeds etc. The carrier cannot be held
liable in spite of negligence on his part, if the consignor has not declared the
value and description of such goods. But when the consignor discloses the
description and value of the scheduled goods, the carrier will be liable for their
loss. He cannot limit his liability even by any special-agreement.
b. Non-scheduled Goods
The goods not included in list are called non-scheduled goods. The
common carrier is not liable for any loss or damage to such goods unless it is
proved that there was negligence on the part of the common carrier. The
www.RiazAcademy.com

242
Carriage of Goods by Land
common carrier, can limit his liability by a special agreement with the consignor.
Such a liability can be increased by an agreement.
c. Criminal Act
The carrier is always liable for loss or damage to the goods caused by
any criminal act of the carrier himself, his servant or agent and for unlawful acts
or misfeasance i.e. he converts the goods to his own, use or knowingly delivers
the goods to a wrong person. Such a liability cannot be avoided by a special
agreement with the consignor.
RAILWAYS AS CARRIER
Railway is owned and run by the Government so it is not a Common
Carrier. The carriage of goods by railways is governed by Railways Act, 1890.
Definition of Railway
According to the section 3 of the Railways Act 1890 the word "Railway""
means a railway or any portion of a railway for the public carriage of passengers,
animals or goods. Railways may transport goods in freight trains or in passenger
trains.
Forwarding Note
Every consignor of goods or animals has to prepare a note called
forwarding note or consignment note. It contains the description of goods,
number of packages, weight, names and addresses of the consignor and
consignee, liability of the railway and freight paid or freight to pay. In freight paid,
the freight is paid by consignor. In freight to pay, the consignee has to pay the
freight. The terms and conditions under which the goods are transported are
printed on the back of the note. (Sec. 72)
Railway Receipt (R/R)
On submission of the forwarding note to the railway 'parcel office' the
consignor is given a receipt acknowledging the goods with an undertaking to
carry them in accordance with the terms and conditions given on the back of the
forwarding note. It is a document of title to the goods. The consignor is required
to send R/R to the consignee, so that he can take the delivery of the goods.
Duties of Railway Administration
The following are the duties of railway administration:
1. Provide Facilities
It is the duty of railway administration to provide all reasonable facilities
for the receiving, forwarding and delivering of traffic without unreasonable delay.
2. Treat Equally
It is the duty of railway administration not to give any undue or
unreasonable preference or advantage to or in favour of, any particular person
or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever or subject to
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 250

Carriage of Goods by Land
243
any particular person or any particular description of traffic to any undue or
unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.
3. Follow Directions
It is the duty of railway administration to follow directions of Federal
Government for transport of goods in the public interest. The railway is bound to
carry goods of every person who pays freight and follow the regulations
regarding packing etc; without unreasonable delay and any partiality.
Liabilities of Railway Administration

Law of Partnership

LAW OF PARTNERSHIP
The law of partnership is contained in the Partnership Act, 1932 which
came into force on 1st October 1932. It extends to whole of Pakistan. (Sec. 3)
Meaning and Definition
A partnership is a voluntary association of two or more persons who
contribute money, property, time and skill to carry on business for profit and to
share the losses of the business.
Some definitions of partnership are as under:
USA Partnership law: "An association of two or more persons who carry
on as co-owners, a business for profits."
Dr. William R. Spriegel: "Partnership has two or more members, each of
whom is responsible for obligation of the partnership. Each of the partners may
bind the others and the assets of partners may be taken for the debts of the
partnership."
Kimball and Kimball: "A partnership is a group of men who have joined
capital or services for the prosecuting of some business."
Prof. Haney: "Partnership is the relation existing between persons to
make contracts who agree to carry on a lawful business with a view to private
gain."
Partnership Act Sec. 4: "Partnership is the relation between persons
who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any one of
them acting for all."
Characteristics
The following are characteristics or features of partnership:
1. Legal Entity
A partnership has no separate legal entity apart from its members. It
means that the partnership and partners are not separate from one another. The
rights and liabilities of the firm are considered the rights and liabilities of the
partners. If any of the partners dies, retires or becomes insane, the partnership
comes to an end.,
2. Agreement
A partnership is the result of an agreement between two or more persons.
An agreement may be written or oral. Only the persons who are competent to
324
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 332
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Law of Partnership
325
contract can form a partnership. On the death of father who was a partner in a
firm, the son can claim share in the partnership property but cannot become a
partner unless he enters into an agreement with the other partners.
3. Number of Partners
At least 2 persons are required to form a partnership. The Partnership Act
does not mention any maximum limit of persons who can be partners in a
partnership firm. According to Section 14 of Companies Ordinance, 1984 a
partnership consisting of more than 20 persons cannot be formed.
4. Existence of Business
In order to form a partnership, the partners must agree to carry on a
certain business. If the purpose is something other than business, it cannot be
called a partnership. Therefore, where there is no business, there is no
partnership.
5. Sharing of Profits
The agreement between the partners must be to share the profits of a
business. The profit will be distributed among the partners according to their
agreement. If there is no agreement regarding the distribution of profit, it will be
equally distributed among the partners. The partners will share the loss
according to the agreed ratio. Some partners may agree to bear all the losses of
the business.
6. Mutual Agency
The business must be carried on by all the partners or any of them acting
for all the partners. Each partner acts as an agent of the other partners of the
firm. Again, each partner acts as a principal also because he binds himself to the
activities of other partners. It means that the contract of agency exists among
partners.
7. Unlimited Liability
The liability of all the partners is unlimited. All the partners are individually
and collectively responsible for the debts of the business. It means that if there is
any loss and the business sources are insufficient to satisfy the claims of the
creditors, the private assets of the partners can be sold to satisfy the claims of
creditors.
8. Capital
Generally, the capital for the partnership firm is provided by all the
partners. It is not necessary that all the partners contribute equal amount of
capital. Capital is contributed according to the partnership agreement. A person
without contributing any capital may become a partner on the basis of his ability,
skill, knowledge or experience.

326
9. Utmost Faith
Law of Partnership
A partnership is based on mutual confidence and trust of the partners.
The partners must be fair and honest with each other. They must disclose all
facts and provide true accounts relating to the business to each other. They must
not make any secret profit or involve in any activity which could harm the
interests of other partners.
10. Management
According to law, every partner can participate in the conduct and
management of the partnership firm. Usually, the management work is divided
among the partners according to their experience, ability and knowledge. In
practice, the senior partner exercises overall supervision over the firm.
11. Control
Since a partnership is formed by an agreement, its control depends on
the terms of the agreement. Where all the partners take an active part in the
conduct of the business, the control remains with all of them and major decisions
are taken with the consent of all the partners. Otherwise, control may be given to
one or more partners under the agreement.
12. Transfer of Ownership
Usually, the partnership deed includes provisions regarding transfer of
ownership of partners. If there are no such provisions in the partnership deed, a
partner cannot transfer his ownership in the partnership to an outsider without the
consent of all other partners. Thus, the share in a partnership is not freely
transferable.
13. Duration
The partnership continues as long as the partners are willing to run the
business. It comes to an end on the death, insanity or insolvency of any of the
partners. However, if the remaining partners agree to continue the business and
make a new agreement, the firm will not dissolve.
Advantages
The following are important advantages of partnership:
1. Easy Formation
The partnership can be formed easily because no complicated legal
formalities are required for its formation. The registration of firm is not
compulsory. The cost of formation of partnership is small and process can be
completed quickly.
2. Larger Capital
In sole proprietorship, the amount of capital is limited to the personal and
borrowing capacity of one individual. But in case of partnership, there are more
persons who can easily collect huge amount of capital. If the present partners are
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 334
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Law of Partnership
327
not in a position to supply the needed capital, the amount can be borrowed.
Moreover, the capital can also be increased by admitting new partners.
3. Better Management
In sole proprietorship, it is difficult for sole proprietor to manage the
business effectively. But in case of partnership, the partners may perform those
duties for which they are more suitable. In case of important matters all the
partners can get together and decide. This ensures more efficiency and increase
profits.
4. High Credit Standing
In sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor due to unlimited liability enjoys
high credit standing. In case of partnership the liability of all the members is also
unlimited. It means that in case of loss the personal assets of all the partners can
be held liable to meet the claims of the creditors, so the financial institutions give
loans without fear.
5. More Participation
All the partners work hard to make the partnership firm successful. They
know that in case of failure of business, they will have to bear the loss. Moreover,
if the resources of business are not enough to meet the loss, their personal
assets shall be utilized to satisfy the claims of the creditors. Thus, all the partners
participate in business activities.
6. Skilled Employees
In sole proprietorship, it is difficult to employ skilled persons because they
demand high salaries. But in case of partnership, the resources of the firm are
larger, so the services of educated, experienced and skilled persons can be
obtained. In addition, such persons can also be attracted by making them
partners of the firms.
7. Public Relations
The partners personally look after the affairs of business, so they develop
good relations with the employees and customers which are beneficial for the
firm. Direct contact with customers helps to build trust and loyalty. The
employees can be supervised more effectively when the partners show active
interest in management.
8. Flexibility
A partnership is free from legal restrictions. It is formed by an agreement
so the business can be changed easily. Its objects, membership and capital may
be easily adjusted according to changes in the business conditions. But in case
of company, a change in objects requires the sanction of Securities and
Exchange Commission of Pakistan.

9. Decision Making
Law of Partnership
The interest of minority partner in a partnership is protected by law. In
policy matters, all partners must agree. In ordinary affairs, a dissatisfied partner
may withdraw his share and dissolve the firm. Thus, the minority partner enjoys
the right of veto. In fact, the law gives each partner the right to be heard and
consulted.
10. Protection of Minor Partner
In partnership, the interest of minor partner is properly protected. A minor
partner enjoys special protection in a partnership firm. His liability is limited to the
extent of his capital contribution. This protection is beneficial as the death or
insanity of partner does not dissolve the firm if in his place his minor successor is
taken as a partner.
11. Quick Decision
In partnership, quick decisions can be taken regarding business policies
which enable a firm to take advantage of changing market conditions. The
decisions can be taken quickly as compared to companies because fewer
persons are to be consulted. Thus, the risk of missing out on business
opportunities from delay in decision making is lesser in partnership as compared
to a company.
12. Sharing of Risk
A partnership firm enjoys the advantage of sharing of risk. Each partner
shares risk according to the terms established in the partnership agreement. The
losses suffered by the firm are shared by all partners and the burden of loss on
each partner is lesser as compared to sole proprietor.
13. Possibility of Expansion
A partnership is flexible in its business operations and expansion of
business is easy. Firm can expand its business because of its larger resources,
favorable credit standing and managerial ability. The business can be expanded
by adding more partners in the firm. But in case of sole proprietorship, it is
difficult to expand the business.
14. Business Secrets
The success of business depends on secrecy. It is possible in a
partnership to maintain secrecy. A partner having knowledge about the business
secrets will suffer loss if he reveals those business secrets as the losses of the
firm are shared by all the partners.
15. Spirit of Cooperation
The success of a partnership firm depends upon mutual trust, cooperation
and confidence. Profits or losses of the firm are shared by all the partners. This
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 336
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Law of Partnership
329
increases the spirit of cooperation among the partners because they know that
minor differences may terminate the partnership.
16. Personal Supervision
The partners personally manage and supervise the business. The
employees can be supervised more effectively when the partners show interest
in management of firm. Thus, personal supervision of the partners leads to
increased efficiency, reduced wastage and increased profits.
17. Easy Dissolution
The partnership can be dissolved very easily by mutual consent of the
partners. Formal documents are not required as in case of a joint stock company.
In case of partnership-at-will, a partner may dissolve the firm any time by giving a
notice to other partners. The partners of unregistered firm can take the help of
court for dissolution of firm.
Disadvantages
The following are disadvantages of partnership:
1. Unlimited Liability
The partners have unlimited liability with regard to debts of the business.
Every partner is individually and jointly liable for all the debts of the firm. If the
business suffers loss and the business assets are not enough to satisfy the
claims of the creditors, the personal assets of all the partners can be utilized to
clear the claims. If some partners become insolvent, the solvent partner has to
bear all the losses.
2. Risk of Dissolution
In case of death, insolvency or insanity of a partner, the partnership is
terminated. The remaining partners will have to make a new agreement if they
want to continue with the business. The remaining partners can purchase the
share of such partner or sell these shares to an outsider.
3. Possibility of Disagreement
A partnership is started by a group of persons having good relations. But
with the passage of time, differences may develop among them resulting in
dissolution of firm. The business decisions are made by consultations,
discussions and voting among the partners. This may create distrust among the
partners resulting in the failure of the firm.
4. Limited Resources
In a joint stock company, there are thousands of shareholders and a large
amount of capital can be gathered in order to expand the business. But in case of
partnership, the maximum limit of members is 20 and large amount of capital
cannot be raised easily. Moreover, a company can raise funds by issuing bonds
and debentures which is not possible in firms.
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 337
www.AccountancyPoint.com
330
5. No Transfer of Ownership
Law of Partnership
In a joint stock company, the shareholder can transfer his shares any time
to any person. But in case of partnership, the partner cannot transfer his
ownership to any other person without the consent of all the other partners. It is
easy to invest in a partnership but difficult to withdraw.
6. Lack of Public Confidence
A partnership firm does not enjoy public confidence due to lack of
marketing and publicity. The people have little knowledge about its activities
because its accounts and reports are not published. The affairs of business are
not legally controlled. As a result, people do not have a favourable opinion about
partnership firms.
7. Lack of Authority
All the partners have independent decision making authority in the
management. As a result, many types of problems may arise when there is no
mutual trust, understanding and cooperation. Disagreement, opposition and
misunderstanding among partners may result in dissolution of partnership.
8. Lack of Harmony
As all the partners have equal authority in the management of the firm, so
every partner tries to impose his own decision which leads to misunderstanding,
distrust and dispute. As a result, the harmony among partners is disturbed and
the business is negatively affected.
9. Lack of Secrecy
Lack of secrecy may occur in a partnership because business secrets are
known to all the partners. While in case of sole proprietorship, the secrets remain
restricted to a single person. The business rivals may exploit this weakness if a
partner is ready to reveal the secrets.
10. Authority of Partners
A partner acts as the agent of the firm and co-partners. He can bind the
firm and co-partners by making agreements with outsiders. Thus, a dishonest,
careless and incompetent partner may create problems for his co-partners and
the firm.
11. Loss of Opportunities
The partnership may miss out on business opportunities due to delay in
decision making. The consent of all the partners is necessary before bringing any
change in the business. Differences among the partners also decrease the
efficiency of the firm.
12. Possibility of Fraud
The registration of a firm is not compulsory. The governments do not
regulate the formation or activities of business so there are chances of fraud. The
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 338
www.AccountancyPoint.com
Law of Partnership
331
partners of unregistered firm can easily commit fraud against each other. So the
partnership agreement should be in writing to decrease the possibility of fraud.
Test of Partnership
In order to determine the existence of partnership, the following must be
proved:
1. There must be an agreement among the persons to be held as partners.
2. The agreement must be for doing some business.
3. The agreement must be to share the profits of a business.
4. There must be a relationship of principal and agent among the partners.
5. There must be an agreement to carry on the business by all or any of them
acting for all.
Partner
Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are called
individually partners. Generally, the word partner means a person who has
agreed to share the profit of the business.
Firm
The persons who have entered into a partnership with one another are
collectively called a firm.
Firm's Name
The name under which partners carry on their business is called the firm's
name. The partners can choose any name for the firm according to the following
rules: (Sec. 58)
1. The name must not be identical or similar to the name of an existing firm.
2. The name must not contain words 'Government', 'Jinnah', 'Quaid-e-Azam' or
words showing the approval or patronage of the Federal Government or any
Provincial Government, without the consent of the provincial government.
3. A firm name must not contain the name of 'United Nations' or abbreviations
of its subsidiary body without the sanction of the Secretary-General of the
UNO.
4. A firm name must not contain the name of the 'World Health Organization' or
its abbreviations without the sanction of the Director-General of WHO.
5. A firm must not contain any word which may be declared by the Provincial
Government as undesirable.
Ideal Partnership
The following are characteristic of ideal partnership:
1. Mutual Understanding
There must be mutual understanding and cooperation among the
partners. Mutual trust is essential to effectively run a firm and to make it a
www.RiazAcademy.com

Page 339
www.AccountancyPoint.com
332
Law of Partnership
success. This is possible only when the partners entering into an agreement
know each other for a long time.
2. Common Purpose
All the partners must act for the common benefit of the partnership firm.
The partners must cooperate with each other and make joint efforts to achieve
common objectives. The partners should not pursue individual or personal goals
but focus on collective benefits of the partners.
3. Good Faith
All the partners in a firm should work in good faith. They should act with
complete honesty, sincerity and integrity. The partners must not take any unfair
advantage of each other. Every partner should fully participate in the
management of the firm.
4. Sufficient Capital
The business needs capital for both long term and short term purposes.
The partners can borrow capital from external sources like banks and financial
institutions. The profits extracted from the business must not be too large. The
profits should be reinvested in the business to achieve further growth and
development.
5. Long Duration
The duration of partnership should be long. Only long-term partnerships
can properly formulate and implement long term plans for the business. It takes
time to understand the affairs of business so the short term partnerships rarely
succeed. Expansion and growth strategies cannot be implemented in short term
partnerships.
6. Number of Partners
The number of partners must be appropriate and suitable. If the number
of partners is small, the firm will suffer from lack of capital resources. If the
number of partners is large, there is possibility of disagreement and mistrust
among the partners.
7. Written Agreement
In order to avoid misunderstanding and future disputes, there must be a
written agreement among the partners. The rights and duties of the partners
must be included in the partnership deed. It should contain full details about
capital, profit sharing and authority of each partner.
8. Registration
The registration of partnership is not compulsory. It is better to register a
partnership as soon as it is formed. If a partnership is not registered, it cannot
sue outsiders although the outsider can sue it.

The following are kinds of partners according to liability, participation in
management, shares of profits, etc.
1. Active Partner
A partner who takes an active part in the management of firm is called
active partner. He takes much interest in the affairs of the firm. Such a partner
must give public notice of his retirement from the firm in order to free himself from
liability. He is also called the working partner.
2. Sleeping Partner
One who does not take an active part in the management of the firm is
called sleeping or dormant partner. Such partner brings only capital in the
business. He is also liable to the creditors of the firm like other partners. He is not

because he is not known to the general public.
3. Nominal Partner
One who lends his name and reputation to the firm is called nominal
partner. He does not invest in business. He does not take part in the
management like other partners. He does not get share in profits. But, he is
regarded as partner in the eye of law. He is liable to the outsiders for the debts of
the firm.

is called senior partner. He plays a major role in the management of the business
due to experience, age, capability and other skills.
5. Junior Partner
A junior partner is the opposite of a senior partner. Usually, he is a young
man who has recently become a partner of the firm. He has a small investment in
the business. Due to small investment and less experience, he receives a
nominal share in the profits. He has no major role in decision-making.
6. Partner in Profits Only

losses. A sleeping partner may be a partner in profits only. He is equally liable to

outsiders. Secret partner takes an active part in management of the partnership
firm. He is liable for the debts of the firm like other partners.

carry on a business. The differences between the two are as follows:
1. Agreement
Partnership
A partnership is a result of agreement.

A partner is an agent of the firm. He
can bind other partners for his acts.
3. Lien
A partner has a lien on the property of
partnership for expenses incurred by
him
4. Transfer of Interest
A partner cannot transfer his share
without the consent of all the partners.
5. Common Interest

business. He cannot bind the co-
owners for his acts.
A co-owner has no lien on the property
of co-ownership for expenses spent by
