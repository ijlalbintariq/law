This book is about criminal justice process-
criminal procedure. Whatever meaning 'justice'
may bear in a particular context, justice in its
truest sense of the word, is the ultimate goal of
the criminal procedure in any civilized society
There can be no greater testimony to the
importance of 'Criminal Procedure' than this
that the basic criminal procedural rights, in the
form of fundamental human rights, stand
incorporated in, and guaranteed by, almost all
the democratic constitutions of the world,
including Pakistan. Yet, despite these
constitutional guarantees, the international
community has remained so concerned with
the misuse and abuse of the criminal process
that the right to fairness has been reaffirmed
and elaborated, since 1948, in numerous
international treaties and conventions,
establishing international standards of
fairness, reflecting the saying of Martin Luther
King:
"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice
everywhere"
'Criminal Procedure thus stands
internationalized; this, in reality, is an
international effort at humanizing criminal
procedure.
So important is the place of 'Criminal
Procedure', in the hierarchy of laws that "the
quality of a nation's civilization can be largely
measured by the methods it uses in the
enforcement of its criminal law". In short,
criminal procedure is criminal justice in action.

PREFACE
William Smellie in his preface to what became the first edition of
Encyclopedia Britannica said: Utility and the diffusion of
knowledge - these are the goals, which "ought to be the principal
intention of every publication".
This is also the intention of this publication, in the hope that it will
stimulate the readers' quest for knowledge of the criminal justice
process. The importance of that process was encapsulated in the
words quoted by Chief Justice Earl Warren in the most famous
American case on Constitutional Criminal Procedure, namely,
Miranda v Arizona, which are as follows:
"The quality of a nation's civilization can be largely
measured by the methods it uses in the enforcement of its
criminal law".
The intended audience of this book, originally, were the law
students. But as the saying goes, the tale has grown in the telling.
and the book, in its finished form, will hopefully be as useful to the
profession at large, the academics, the practicing lawyers and the
judges. Crime affects the very quality of life and my intended
audience may well include every curious and serious lay person,
who wants to be better educated and more informed about the role
of criminal procedure in his everyday life.
The distinctive feature of the book, if I may venture to say, is that it
introduces the "Constitutional Criminal Procedure" - a procedure
that has its roots in a written Constitution to the academic and
forensic landscape of Pakistan. "Constitutional Criminal
Procedure" as a topic is well known to the academics and the
lawyers in the United States of America and in the United
Kingdom, but was unknown in Pakistan. It is a distinction of the

n
Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) that this topic
has, from the beginning, been part of the curriculum at LUMS.
The credit for this book, in a large measure, goes to Justice Jawwad
S.Khawaja then Head of the Law & Policy Department of LUMS,
and now a Judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, who took the
great risk of initiating me as an academic. He was reading the book
in manuscript and sharing his valuable ideas with me when his
elevation to the Supreme Court interrupted that remarkable
intellectual exercise.
I am fortunate in having a bunch of delightful grandchildren living
with and around me -Nisha Aftab, Nida Aftab, Adeel S. Karim,
Noor Aftab, Rohma S. Karim. While all of them helped me in their
small ways, the eldest of them, Nisha Aftab, deserves my special
thanks. She is not a lawyer. Yel, endowed as she is with robust
common sense and sharp intellect, she helped me in a variety of
ways willingly and with enthusiasm.
Last but no the least is the debt of gratitude I owe to Mr. Qasim
Rasool, LLM, Advocate, with whom I had the good fortune to be
associated at the penultimate stage. He was full of zest and ideas
and it was his capacity for hard work and will to learn that enabled
me to put this work together and bring it to fruition. I am also
grateful to Mr. Muhammad Imran and Khalid Mahmood Siddiqi of
LUMS for rendering valuable secretarial services.

Some Preliminary Matters
Chapter 1
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF CRIMINAL
PROCEDURE
Strange things, stranger than fiction, have happened in...
the world of criminal justice.
We often hear it said, "Let justice be done, though the
heavens should fall". You would think that it has a respectable
origin. In fact, it was first used to excuse the most outrageous
injustice. It comes from a story told by Seneca. Piso sentenced a
soldier to death for the murder of one Gaius. He ordered a
centurion to execute the sentence. When the soldier was about to be
executed, Gaius came forward himself alive and wex. The
centurion reported it to Piso. Piso sentenced all three to death. The
soldier, because he had already been sentenced, the centurion, for
disobeying orders, and Gaius, for being the cause of the death of
two innocent men. Piso excused it by the plea: Let justice be done.
though the heavens should fall (The story has been reproduced by
Lord Denning in his book "The Family Story", at p. 172).
In 399 BCE, Socrates was accused of and tried for (i)
not believing in the gods that the citizens believed in and (ii)
corrupting the youth.
The procedure at an Athenian trial was very different
from that at a modern trial. Trials took place during a single day.
To make bribery of jurors more difficult, juries were very large and
were chosen by lot from those citizens who made themselves
available, There were no professional lawyers, and no public
prosecutors. So prosecutions were brought by individuals.
Speeches were timed by a water-clock, which was stopped while
evidence from witnesses was heard.

The prosecution spoke first followed by the defendant.
After these two speeches, the jury voted the accused innocent or
guilty. If innocent, he was released. If guilty, the jury next voted on
the sentence. The procedure here was for the prosecution and the
defence each to suggest a penalty and for the jury to decide
between the two.
For the trial of Socrates, the jury consisted of as many as
five hundred jurors, and he was found guilty by a narrow margin of
280 to 220.
Many people in Athens did not want Socrates' death.
What they possibly wanted was an apology, which they did not get.
He was condemned to death by drinking hemlock. His friends
offered him an easy escape; they had bribed the officials. He asked
his friends, is it right? And when they failed to satisfy him, he
preferred to die.
From the mid-13 century to the mid-18th century, a
system of judicial torture lay at the heart of continental criminal.
procedure. The application of torture was routine and a judicially
supervised feature of the European criminal procedure. Under
certain circumstances, the law permitted the criminal courts to
employ physical coercion against suspected criminals to induce
them to confess.
In England, in the dark past, when a suspect was brought
before the Star Chamber (essentially a torture Chamber), he was
commanded to answer questions, even when there was no evidence
that he had anything to do with the crime. If he declined to answer,
he could be incarcerated, mutilated or banished. A discussion on
this subject will be found in Part II of this book under the heading
"Privilege against self-incrimination" as guaranteed by the US
Constitution, Fifth Amendment, particularly in the opinion of Chief
Justice Earl Warren in the famous case of Miranda v Arizona (384
US 436; 16 L Ed 2d 694).
There is a method of criminal justice known as pure
procedure. In some areas of Pakistan, suspects of crimes were
made to walk on burning coals, the prevailing myth being that the
fire did not burn the innocent. Under the Frontier Crimes
Regulations, 1901, which have remained in force in the tribal areas
of Pakistan till recently, the Council of Elders, who were the judges
of fact, could adopt any procedure for ascertaining the facts. In
practice, the Council held secret and open inquiries. It examined
witnesses informally, visited the place of crime or its neighborhood
often incognito, to ascertain the truth.
In the field of fiction, an outstanding example of pure
procedure is the justice of Homer as portrayed in the Iliad.
Conflicts brought to court were argued by the parties in the
presence of the spectators, who, after witnessing the process, voted
for a solution, not on the basis of set principles but on how they felt
about what had been put before them. And whatever agreement the
spectators reached was binding. Italo Calvino, in his "A judgment
in Adams, one Afternoon" tells the shocking tale of a trial which
ended in the conviction and execution not of the accused but of the
judge himself.
And to have an idea of what terrible things could happen
in the guise of criminal prosecution in totalitarian regimes, one has
only to read the French novels by Victor Hugo, e.g. Hunchback of
Notre Dame and Les Miserables and the art imitating-life novels by
Solzhenitsyn and Fyoder Dostoevsky, e.g. Crime and Punishment.
Now, there can be many ways to decide a dispute: you
can decide it by throwing dice, or by spinning a coin, or consulting
un astrologer, or on the toss of a coin or by asking the spectators to
vote on which of the two conflicting witnesses to believe as a
Manhattan criminal court judge, as recently as 1983, did.
But cun a modem Judge, in this enlightened age, decide
cases in any of these ways? The answer plainly is 'No'.

Chapter 2
Criminal Procedure-Traditional Perspective:
We may well begin with the Irite words of Justice
Holmes from his famous book, "The Common Law";
"The life of the law has not been logic; it
has been experience. The felt necessities
of the time, the prevalent moral and
political theories, intimations of public
policy, avowed or unconscious, even the
prejudices which judges share with their
fellow-men, have had a good deal more
to do than the syllogism in determining
the rules hy which men should be
governed. The law emphasizes the story
of a nation's development through many
centuries and it cannot be dealt with as if
it contained only the axioms and
corollaries of a book of mathematics".
In order to know what it (the law) is, so says Justice
Holmes, we must know what it has been and what it tends to
become. This is what we propose to do: to know what the law is.
we must first know what it has been.
It has been said, and rightly in our view, that the law is
probably the "institution that changes least in any society. The
reason is that the visible evidence of a continuing legal tradition
enhances the impression of a community living under a permanent
and consistent rule of law "The Day the World Changed" by
James Burke, p.13).
That is why it has been said that "The law, so far as it
depends on learning, is indeed..... the government of the living by
the dead". But it must be remembered that in today's legal world,
Change is the only constant, and Justice Holmes warns us that "the
present has the right to govern itself, so far as it can, and it ought
always to be remembered that historic continuity with the past is
not a duty; it is only a necessity"
WESTERN TRADITIONS
Due Process, Natural Justice, Procedural Fairness:
The expressions. "Due Process". "Natural Justice",
"Procedural Fairness", are customarily employed in describing the
procedural law, both civil and criminal. They all go together.
General ideas about them in the West are usually considered with
reference to three different traditions, namely -
The English Constitution and Common Law
1)
system:
2)
The American Constitutional tradition.
3)
The newer doctrines of the European Union
and the European Convention on Human
Rights.
Common Law: "Common Law" forms the basis of much of the
English statutory and case law. It has often been called the major
source of modem criminal law in common law jurisdictions. The
study of procedures "has never been a major interest of English
lawyers, and yet the growth of the common law, indeed the very
foundations of the common law, are tied inseparably to
procedures" ("Due Process and Fair Procedures" by Professor D.J.
Galligan, p.167). And Lord Denning tells us "to remember that
much of our substantive law is found laced in with procedure".
"Common Law is variously described as English,
Anglo-Saxon or Anglo- American." Despite its conceptualization
by Lord Coke as the perfection of reason, it is indeed a vast and
complete instrument of justice" ("The Judicial Process" by Henry
J. Abraham, 4 ed. p8). It refers to a historical body of unwritten
legal precedents created from everyday English social customs.
rules, and practices that were supported by judicial decisions in the
Middle Ages. As novel situations arose and were dealt with by
English judges, their declarations became the starting point of any
5

Page 21
future declarations. These decisions generally incorporated the
customs of the society as it operated at that time. Eventually, this
growing body of judicial pronouncements developed into a set of
legal rules widely accepted as a kind of national law, commonly
applied throughout England. Thus Common Law was bom.
During this early stage, judges often took upon themselves to
formally criminalize actions that had previously been regarded as
the basis for private disputes. Hence many acts we call "crimes"
today, for example, murder, rape, arson and burglary, might have
remained in the private sphere had it not been for the development
of the common law,
Eventually, courts decisions were recorded and made.
available to barristers (the English word for trial lawyers) and
judges. As Howard Abadinsky says:
"Common law involved the
transformation
of
community rules into a national legal system. The
controlling element was precedent". (See "Criminal
Justice Today" by Frank Schmalleger, 4" edition.
p.116).
Due Process
The concept of "Due Process" is to a modern English
lawyer an American concept; it is enshrined in the US Constitution
and several of the State Constitutions. In reality, it was an English
concept; its origin can be traced back to Magna Carta, the Great
Charter of 1215; Clause 39 of the Charter provided: "No freeman
shall be taken and imprisoned or dissiesed of any tenement or of
his liberties or free customs...... except by lawful judgment of his
peers or by the law of the land". The expression "by the law of the
land" in that clause means the same thing as "due process of law".
A statute of Edward IV passed in 1354 stated:
"That no man of what state or condition
that he be, shall be put out of land or
tenement, nor taken nor imprisoned
6
without being brought in answer by due
process of law",
Like some of the best English families, "Due Process"
emigrated to the US in the 17th century.
It needs to be noted that the people in Europe and
England enjoyed only the rights expressly granted by law. But at
the time of the passing of the US Constitution, the prevailing idea
was that certain rights were inherent in human nature; they did not
depend upon being granted by law. As was said by Alexander
Hamilton, one of the US Founding Fathers, "why declare that
things shall not be done which there is no power to do". Thus, the
famous American Declaration of Independence simply invoked the
self-evident truths that "all men are created equal, that they are
endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among
those are life, liberty and pursuit of happiness".
Accordingly, in the original Constitution, there was no
mention of any human or fundamental rights. Yet, it soon became
apparent that the omission of a Bill of Rights was a serious flaw
and great difficulties were encountered in the ratification of the
Constitution. It was then that the first Ten Amendments, known as
the Bill of Rights, were enacted and included in the US
Constitution.
Thus, the 5 Amendment, among others, provides that
"no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property.
without due process of law.......
The essential. purpose of the due process clause is to
prevent the Goverment, its officials and instrumentalities, like the
law enforcement agencies, e.g. police, from acting arbitrarily. The
focus is on procedure itself.
"Due process of law" according to the Great English
Judge, Lord Denning (see his book "The Due Process of Law")
means-

"the measures authorized by the law so
as to keep the stream of justice pure; to
see that trials and enquiries are fairly
conducted; that arrests and searches are
properly made; that lawful remedies are
readily available and that unnecessary
delays are eliminated",
Willoboughy explains the term as follows:
As between the State and the individual,
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
the individual shall have duc notice of
proceedings which affect his rights;
the individual shall be given reasonable
opportunity to defend:
the tribunal or court before which his rights
are adjudged is so constituted as to give
reasonable assurance of its honesty and
impartiality, and
it is a court of competent jurisdiction. (The
Constitution of the United States, 2 Ed. V.II.
p.1709, cited in Government of Balochistan v
Aziz Ullah Memon-PLD 1993 SC 341).
In determining what process is due, the US Supreme
Court's recent doctrine has involved a balancing of interests at
stake. This utilitarian approach requires that the Court considers -
"First, the private interest that will be
affected by the official action; second
the risk of an erroneous deprivation of
such interest through the procedures
used, and the probable values, if any, of
additional
substitute procedural
safeguards, and finally, the
govemment's interest, including the
function involved, and the fiscal and
administrative burdens that the
additional substitute
procedure
g
requirement would entail" (Mathews y
Eldridge 424 US 319, 334-5; 1976).
The US Supreme Court has continually held that a fair
trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process. (e.g. In
re Murchison, 349 US 133; 99 L Ed 942).
Procedural Fairness
Procedural fairness is the modern English concept, and
one can say that "Due Process of Law" is its predecessor, Thus
"when we say in English law that all public authorities are now
subject to the principles of procedural faimess, reference is being
made to a set of procedural doctrines, largely created by the courts
which express fundamental principles about the fair treatment of
persons and the procedures needed to give effect to fair treatment.
When American lawyers talk about procedural due process they are
doing something very similar, except that the primary source of
their procedural doctrines is the Constitution with its general
provisions requiring due process of law when life, liberty or
property is in issue (Professor D.J. Galligan in his "Due Process
and Fair Procedures" p.74).
Natural Justice:
"Natural justice", it has been said, is 'fair play in action'.
(Lord Morris in Wiseman v Borneman - (1969) 3 All ER 275.
278). A natural right is a right which man has simply by virtue of
being bom a human being and that is also true of "natural justice".
Amongst the procedural doctrines recognized and frequently
invoked by the English courts, and other courts following the
common law tradition, including Pakistan and India, the first to be
noted is the maxim "Justice should not only be done, but should
manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done".
This means that in trials held in the public eye, the
appearance of faimess is as important as actual faimess itself.

The hearing principle and the principle against bias,
which principles will be discussed below, are illustrations of this
maxim. The principle of public hearing, which will be discussed at
its proper place and which has been accorded legislative
recognition in section 352 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898, is another manifestation of this general principle.
Its Twin Pillars: The rule against bias and right to be heard - two
separate concepts and governed by separate considerations are
the essential characteristics of what is called natural justice. They
are the twin pillars supporting it (Kanda v Government of Malaya
[(1962) AC 322 PC). The rule against bias is put in the maxim-
nemo judex in causa sua-and the right to be heard is "neatly and
briefly stated in the recently resuscitated Latin expression - audi
alteram partem". [Darayappah v Fernando (1967) 2 AC 337 PC).
The two concepts have been recently put in the two words,
impartiality and faimess. (Kanda v Government of Malaya (1962
AC 322 PC: Council of Civil Services v Minister (1984) 3 All ER
935). Lord Devlin put them in one sentence; they are, he said "the
right to be heard by an unbiased tribunal, (United Engineering v
Deveanayagam-(1967) 2 All ER 367, 382).
Right of hearing: Right of hearing may be provided by statute or a
statutory instrument (which is a convenient expression to use for
statutory rules, regulations, bye-laws etc) or it may rest upon the
principles of natural justice.
The maxim, audi alteram partem no man shall be
condemned unheard is of universal application (Faridsons y
Pakistan PLD 1961 SC $37); it is one of the first principles of
justice that no man should be condemned without being heard.
That the conception of natural justice should at all stages guide
those who discharge judicial functions is not merely an acceptable
but an essential part of the philosophy of our law, and it appears
that whenever any person or body of persons is empowered to take
decision after ex post facto investigation into facts which would
result in consequences affecting the person, property or other rights
of any person, then in the absence of any express words in the
10
enactment giving such power, excluding the application of
principles of natural justice, the courts of law are required
generally to imply that the power so given is coupled with the duty
to act in accordance with such principles of natural justice as may
he applicable in the facts and circumstances of a given case.
(Hamood-ur-Rehman J in University of Dacca v Zakir Ahmad -
PLD (1865 SC 90). For its application the rule does not depend
upon whether the proceedings are judicial or quasi judicial as well
as administrative or quasi administrative. The rule applies to
judicial as well as administrative bodies, especially where the
proceedings taken may affect the person or property or other rights
of parties concerned in the dispute. (Chief Commissioner v Mrs.
Dina Sohrab PLD 1959 SC (Pak) 45].
In England, the violation of a statutory provision giving
a right of hearing and the violation of the principle of audi alteram
partem stand on the same footing; both are treated as jurisdictional
defects resulting in a nullity. [Anisminic case (1969), 1 All ER
208; also see Professor Wade's article in (1968) 84 LQR 951.
Reid said:
Thus, in Ridge v Baldwin ((1963) 2 All ER 66], Lord
"Time and again in the cases I have cited
it has been stated that a decision given
without regard to the principles of
natural justice is void...... I see no
reason to doubt these authorities. The
body with the power to decide cannot
lawfully proceed to make a decision
until it has afforded the person affected a
proper opportunity to state his case".
This view was reaffirmed in Anisminic (1969) | All ER 208,
2131 in which Lord Reid said that there are many cases, one of
them being where a tribunal may have failed in the course of the
inquiry to comply with the requirements of natural justice, in which
II

Page 24
"Although the tribunal had jurisdiction
to enter on the inquiry, it has done or
failed to do something in the course of
the inquiry which is of such a nature that
its decision is a nullity".
And in AG v Ryan (1980) AC 718). Lord Diplock referred both to
Anisminic and Ridge to hold that "it has long been settled that a
decision affecting legal rights of an individual which is arrived at
by a procedure which offends against the principles of natural
justice is outside the jurisdiction of the decision-making
authority".
In Pakistan, violation of the right of hearing when
provided by a statute or a statutory instrument has been held to be
productive of different results from the right of hearing when it
rests upon the principle of natural justice. Again, when the right of
hearing is provided by a statute or a statutory instrument a
distinction is made between the provision being mandatory or
directory.
The earliest case on the right of hearing provided by a
statute or a statutory instrument is Zafar-ul-Ahsan v Republic of
Pakistan (PLD 1960 SC (Pak) 113). In the Full Bench case of
Muhammad Ishaque v Saeed-ud-Din (PLD 1959 Kar 669), Kaikaus
J. made the distinction between the statutory provision being
mandatory or directory: "If the statutory provision for notice be
mandatory, the order without notice may be wholly void. If it be
directory the court may still presume prejudice for want of notice
till the contrary is shown". This was approved by the Supreme
Court in Collector v Muhammad Akhtar (1971 SCMR 681): "The
principle, so far as this country is concemed, is accordingly well
settled that where notice required to be given by the statute is a
mandatory notice, then the failure to comply with such mandatory
requirement of the statute would render the act void ab initio as
being an act performed in disregard of the provisions of the statute.
Furthermore, any further action on the basis of such a void order
would also be vitiated and the defect at the initial stage would be
incurable by a hearing at a subsequent stage". This view was
reiterated in Atta Muhammad Qureshi v Settlement Commissioner
(PLD 1971 SC 61).
The principle thus is that where a statute provides for
hearing and the provision is mandatory in character its violation
will render the consequent order without jurisdiction, void and a
nullity. In such a case, the argument that opportunity was provided
at a later stage by an appellate or revisional authority and that had
the effect of curing the initial defect will not avail, the rule
applicable being that "if on the basis of a void order subsequent
orders have been passed either by the same authority or by other
authorities, the whole series of such orders, together with
superstructure of rights and liabilities built upon them most, unless
some statute or principle of law recognizing as legal the changed
position of the parties, is in operation, fall to the ground, as such
orders have as little legal foundation as the void order on which
they are founded" (Yousaf Ali v M. Aslam Zia PLD 1958 SC (Pak)
104). But if the statutory provision giving the right of hearing is
merely directory only then its violation is to be treated on an equal
footing as violation of the principle audi alteram partem (Sind
Employees Social Security v Dawood Cotton Mills - PLD 1997
SC 177). As an instance of the statutory provision being merely
directory, Manzoor-ul-Haq v Controlling Authority (PLD 1963 SC
652) may be referred to.
Comments: If we may say so with great respecs, the question
whether an action taken in disregard of a statutory right of hearing
should result in a nullity, ought not to depend on the fine, or if we
may say, esoteric, distinction between mandatory or directory. The
true view seems to be that when a statute gives the right of hearing.
what it does is merely to incorporate the principle of natural justice
- audi alteram partem - into the statute. As Abdul Kadir Sheikh J
put it in Shah Mardan v Chief Land Commissioner (PLD 1974 Kar.
375,391)-
"In making the provision for notice to be
given to the party affected, the rules
12
13
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 25
sought to incorporate only what is
otherwise to be read into them, in spite
of absence of such a provision".
Logically, therefore, there appears no reason to treat cases in which
the right is a statutory right and cases in which it is based on
natural justice differently.
The Rule against Bias: The rule against bias is the second pillar
supporting natural justice. It is commonly (but only partially)
captured in the phrase nemo judex sua causa (1999 Public Law
391; Analysis by Timothy H. Jones), which phrase means that
nobody may be a judge in his own cause (Lord Goff in R v Gough
(1993) 2 All ER 724, 730). There is an overriding public interest
that there should be confidence in the integrity of the
administration of justice, which is always associated with the
statement of Lord Hewart in R v Sussex Justices, ex parte
McCarthy (1923) All ER 233) that it is-
"of fundamental importance that justice
should not only be done, but should
manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to
be done",
So fundamental indeed that almost every Judge swears, before
entering upon his office, to be impartial. Thus the oath that the
Supreme Court and High Court Judges are required to take under
the Constitution of Pakistan needs:
Prends:
"I will not allow my personal interest to
influence my official conduct or my
official decisions; .........in all
circumstances, I will do right to all
manner of people, according to law,
without fear or favour, affection or
ill-will",
When it is said that a judicial decision
maker was
biased, it means "that he was motivated by a desire unfairly to
favour one side or to disfavour the other". (Lord Goff in R v
Gough (1993) 2 All ER 724, 728; in Corpus Juris Secundum, V. X.
pp. 354-5, quoted in Asif Ali Zardari v The State PLD 2001 SC
568, 587, bias is described as under: "bias" has been held
synonymous with "partiality", and strictly to be distinguished from
"prejudice". Under particular circumstances, the word has been
described as a condition of mind; and has been held to refer, not to
views entertained regarding a particular subject-matter, but to the
mental attitude or disposition towards a particular person and to
cover all varieties of personal hostility or prejudice against him).
It is a principle of interpretation of statutes that "the
presumed intention of parliament is that one of the qualifications of
the decision-maker is that of absence of bias" (Diplock L.J. in
Anisminic case (1967) 2 All ER 986). In the determination of
their rights and liabilities, civil or criminal, everyone is entitled to a
fair hearing by an impartial tribunal. That right has been described
as a fundamental right in the European Convention on Human
Rights (Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms (Rome, 4 Nov 1950: TS 71 (1953); Cmd
8969). The reason is obvious. All legal arbiters are bound to apply
the law as they understand it to the facts of individual cases as they
find them. They must do so without fear or favour, affection or ill-
will, that is, without partiality or prejudice. Justice is portrayed as
blind not because she ignores the facts and circumstances of
individual cases, but because she shuts her eyes to all
considerations extraneous to the particular case. As Lord Denning
put it in Jones v National Coal Board, (1957) 2 QB 55):
"It is all very well to paint justice blind,
but she does better without a bandage
round her eyes. She should be blind
indeed to favour or prejudice, but clear
to see which way lies the truth......

The law on the subject has been exhaustively dealt with
in the recent but already famous House of Lords cases of Locabail
Ltd. v Bayfield Properties (2000) 1 All ER 65, 69), and R v Bow
Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate ex p Pinochet ((1999) 1
All ER 577), and in Pakistan in the recent case of Asif Ali Zardari
v State (PLD 2001 SC 568).
The fundamental principle is that a man may not be a
judge in his own cause. "There is a species of bias which vitiates
judicial proceedings irrespective of the correctness or otherwise of
the result, but that is not because bias, whatever form it may
assume, avoids the result of judicial proceedings, but because the
judge with that kind of bias is, on grounds of public policy,
disqualified to be a judge" (Muhammad Munir C.J in Anwar v
Crown PLD 1955 FC 185; also see, among others, Farzand Ali
case-PLD 1970 SC 98, Begum Nusrat Bhutto case PLD 1977 SC
657).
The basic rule is not in doubt. Nor is the rationale of the
rule: if a judge has a personal interest in the outcome of an issue he
is to resolve, he is improperly acting as a judge in his own cause;
such a proceeding would, without more, undermine public
confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice.
(Locabail Limited v Bayfield Properties - (2000) 1 All ER 65, 69,
72).
The decision of the House of Lords in what is known as
Pinochet No.2 is, it has been said, of historic importance for two
reasons. It is the first decision in which the House of Lords has
been persuaded to re-open an appeal and set aside one of its own
orders, secondly, it is now well known that undisputed links of
Lord Hoffmann (a member of the Committee which heard the
original House of Lords appeal) to Amnesty International raised
the issue of judicial bias. It is unprecedented for a decision of an
appellate court in England and Wales to have to be set aside on this
ground.
16
Pinochet was a former Head of State of Chile. He was
living in England when the Government of Spain sought his
extradition. He challenged the extradition proceedings in the High
Court. The matter ultimately reached the House of Lords; one of
the parties before the House was Amnesty International. The House
upheld the extradition by its decision dated 25 November. One of
the members of the House who recorded that decision was Lord
Hoffmann who was a director and chairperson of Amnesty
International Charity. Pinochet applied that the 25 November
decision be set aside on the ground that there was a real danger or
reasonable apprehension that Lord Hoffmann might have been
biased. The House of Lords agreed and setting aside the 25
November decision ordered a re-hearing by a new Bench.
Asif Ali Zardari case was an appeal by Ms. Benazir
Bhutto a former Prime Minister of Pakistan and her husband, Asif
Ali Zardari, against their conviction and sentence recorded by a
Bench of two learned Judges of the Lahore High Court under the
Ehtsab Act 1997. After examining the concept of bias, in its
various aspects, the Supreme Court held that the senior member of
the bench "had acquired a personal interest in the case by an out of
the way favour" and that the facts also divulged "a close liaison
between the learned Judge, Senator Saifur Rehman and Mian
Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, the then Prime Minister, whose political
rivalry with Ms Benazir Bhutto appellant is a matter of common
knowledge". In the view of the Supreme Court "there is sufficient
material on record which substantiates the allegation of bias". The
trial, it was held, was not fair and on account of bias of the Ehtsab
Bench, it stood vitiated.
Procedural fairness in Europe: Procedural fairness in Europe is
considered with reference to the (European) Convention of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European Convention), which
contains a statement of the Fundamental Human Rights; the
member states of the Council of Europe are bound by international
law to ensure that the principles of the Convention are respected
and enforced in their national legal systems. As an international
convention or treaty is not the law of a country unless it is formally
17

Page 27
made part of the law of that country, in England, the Convention
Rights are now, by virtue of the Human Rights Act, 1998, part of
the law of England.
The result of the Human Rights mentioned in the
European Convention becoming part of the law of England is that
any action, legislative, executive or judicial, incompatible with
such a right can now be challenged. This is so provided in sections
6 and 7 of the Human Rights Act. In other words, the position of
the European Convention so far as these Human Rights are
concerned, is now that of a written Constitution for England.
As is well-known, England had no written Constitution
and the Parliament was, in its law making power, supreme. The
position, therefore, was that it was a sin to think that an Act of
Parliament could be challenged by courts. "An Act of Parliament",
it was said in Wood (1701) 12 Mod. Report - 669) "can do no
wrong though it may do several things that look pretty odd". This
was also the constitutional position in Europe. The great change
brought about by the adoption of the European Convention is, as is
provided in the Human Rights Act, 1998, that even an Act of
Parliament can now be challenged as being incompatible with the
Human Rights guaranteed by the European Convention.
As we have seen, anything done by the public authorities
incompatible with the rights concerning procedural fairness can
now be challenged in the Courts. These rights are aimed at
providing procedural fairness; in their application, the European
Court has developed the principle of "Equality of Arms" under
which a defendant in a criminal proceeding must have a reasonable
opportunity of presenting his case to the court under conditions
which do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his
opponent.
Only two traditions now: In practical terms, the adoption of the
Human Rights mentioned in the European Convention by the
United Kingdom has reduced the number of the traditions with
reference to which the procedural laws in the West may be
considered to two, namely,
(1)
(2)
the American constitutional tradition; and
the English and the European procedural
faimess tradition.

Criminal Justice-its Constitutional Context
The punishments that our laws sanction, and which can
be validly imposed are:

imprisonment, which involves loss of liberty;
cutting of hands etc, and

The relevance of this to criminal procedure may be
demonstrated as follows.
Article 4 of the Constitution of Pakistan forbids any
action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property
to be taken "except in accordance with law" and Articles 9 and 24
of the Constitution guarantee the Fundamental Rights to life,
liberty and property; according to them "no person shall be
deprived of life, liberty and property save in accordance with law.

Justice and Social Justice: The Constitution of Pakistan, by its
preamble, which is a reproduction of the principles and provisions
set out in the Objective Resolution, which Resolution has been
reproduced in the Annex to the Constitution and is, as stated in
Article 2A, now a substantive part of the Constitution and "shall
have effect accordingly", lays down that, among others, the
objectives of the Constitution are to establish an order-
"Wherein the principles of democracy,
freedom, equality, tolerance and social
justice, as enunciated by Islam, shall be
fully observed":
guaranteed
"Wherein shall be
fundamental rights, including equality of
status. of opportunity and before law.
social, economic and political justice,
and freedom of thought, expression,
belief, faith, worship and association.
subject to law and public morality" and
"Wherein the independence of the
judiciary shall be fully secured.
We are here concerned with "justice" and "social justice", in
particular, in the context of the criminal justice system. What do
the terms "justice" and "social justice" mean?
Justice
Justice, it has been said, is largely an abstract and
normative concept and like beauty can be said to be in the eye of
the beholder; as an American author has written, even to attempt to
pen down the meaning of the term is to raise "an unimportant
question to which no definitive answer can be given" (Karl Popper
in his "The Open Society and its Enemies" V.1, p.89). It has been
said that "if it were not for injustice, men would not know justice".
Thus, while "justice" cannot be defined, a starving poor child
begging for a piece of brend and an innocent man rotting in prison
know what injustice is.
Justice has, like many other words, several meanings.
The Greek philosophers, including Plato and Aristotle, thought,
originally on grounds derived from religion, that each thing or
person has its or his proper sphere, to overstep which is unjust.
("History of Western Philosophy" by Bertrand Russell, p.194).
Thus, according to this view, justice is to remain within your own
proper sphere. Otto Bird thinks that the most famous and
influential definition in the entire discussion of Justice is the one
the Roman lawyers enshrined in the Justinian Code which,
translated in English, says that justice is the constant and perpetual
means to render to each one his rights. The well known British
philosopher and statesman, Benjamin Disraeli, once defined justice
as 'truth in action'.
The definition of "justice" namely to render to each one
his rights is neatly illustrated by an old anecdote, from an old book.
relating to Cyrus. Cyrus was asked by his father to give an account
of his last lesson. Cyrus answered thus: one of the boys of our
school had a coat too small for him and gave it to one of his
companions, a little smaller than himself, and forcibly took in
exchange the smaller boy's coat, which was too large for him. The
teacher made me judge of the ensuing dispute and I decided that
the matter should be left as it was, since the parties seemed to be
better accommodated than before. Upon this, the teacher pointed
out to me that I have gone wrong, for I had been satisfied with
considering the convenience of the thing, whereas I ought to first
have considered the justice of it. (The anecdote has been related by
Robson in his excellent book "Justice and Administrative Law" 3
ed p.362. It has been referred to by Akram J. in Hameed-ul-Haq
Chaudhry v GG-PLD 1953 FC 279.297).
Thus, "justice" has been a favourite subject with all the
great philosophers of the world. It must however be remembered
that in a court of law justice does not mean abstract justice or
justice in any esoteric or philosophic sense; it means, and means
20

only, legal justice, that is justice in accordance with law. (Lord
Denning in Jones v National Coal Board (1957) 2 QB 55). Thus, in
Duport Steels v Sirs (1980) 1 All ER 529) Lord Scarman, in setting
aside the decision of the Court of Appeal said:
"My basic criticism of all three
judgments in the Court of Appeal is that
in their desire to do justice, the Court
failed to do justice according to law".
And in Ali Nawaz Gardezi case (PLD 1962 Lah. 558, 619),
Shabbir Ahmed, J. said:
"The invocation of the oft-quoted
judicial maxim to the effect that justice.
should not only be done but must been,
seen to be done would not be apt in a
case where the court has followed the
law because in a court of law justice
means neither more nor less than the
administration of the law of the land"..
Social Justice
Whatever meaning the term 'justice' may bear in a
particular context, justice in its truest sense of the word is the
ultimate goal of criminal justice; "criminal justice cannot be
achieved in the absence of social justice", an ideal "which
embraces all aspects of civilized life and which is linked to
fundamental notions of fairness and cultural beliefs about right and
wrong". ("Criminal Justice Today" by Frank Schmalleger, 4" ed.
P.14).
Criminal justice and civil justice are both aspects of the
wider form of equity termed 'social justice'. Civil justice concerns
itself with faimess in relationship between citizens, government
agencies, and business in private matters involving contractual
obligations, business dealings, hiring and equality of treatment and
22
so on. Criminal justice, in its broadest sense, refers to those aspects
of social justice which concern violations of the criminal law.
Community interests demand apprehension and punishment of law
violators. At the same time, criminal justice ideals extend to the
protection of the innocent, the fair treatment of offenders, and fair
play by the agencies of law enforcement. ("Criminal Justice
Today" at p.14).
An indication of what the concept "social justice" means
and includes is afforded by Article 37 of the Constitution, which
occurs in Part II, Chapter 2, titled "Principles of Policy". Though
the Principles of Policy are not enforceable at law, yet, as Article
29, clause (1), provides "it is the responsibility of each organ and
authority of the State, and of each person performing functions on
behalf of an organ or authority of the State, to act in accordance
with those Principles in so far as they relate to the functions of the
organ or authority".
The heading of Article 37 is: "Promotion of social
justice and eradication of social evils". The State shall, so directs
Article 37, among others, promote, with special care, the
educational and economic interests of backward classes or areas:
ensure inexpensive and expeditious justice etc.
While ensuring inexpensive and expeditious justice is
directly related to the administration of justice, both civil and
criminal, promoting 'economic interests of backward classes" has
an indirect but very significant relation with the economic interests
of the poor and indigent class of accused persons, who have no
means to hire private counsel. This provision can thus serve as an
aid to the interpretation of Article 10 of the Constitution, which.
inter-alia, guarantees the right to counsel. (Please see the
discussion under Article 10 in the Constitutional Criminal
Procedure part of this book).

Social Justice In Islam
As regards 'social justice as enunciated by Islam', the
fundamental principle both in civil and criminal matters, in Islam is
Al-Adl wal Ehsan. Adl is usually translated as 'justice', but is a
much more comprehensive expression. It means social balance or
equilibrium in social and economic relations. (Qazalbash Waqaf
case - PLD 1990 SC 99, 125). "Ehsan' literally means 'restoring
the balance by making up for a loss or a deficiency". The relevant
provisions in the Holy Quran, inter-alia, are S.4:58, S.16:90,
S.4:136, and S.5:8; translated in English, they read:
S.4:58-
S.16:90-
S.4:136-
S.5:8-
"Allah doth command you.....when
ye judge between man and man, to
judge with justice.....
"Allah commands justice, the doing
of good (Ehsan).
O ye who believe! Stand out firmly
for justice, as witnesses to Allah,
even as against yourselves, or your
parents or your kin and whether it
be (against) rich or poor.....
O ye who believe! Stand out firmly
for Allah, as witnesses, to fair
dealing (Qist) and let not the hatred
of others to you make you swerve
to wrong or depart from justice
(Adl). Be just that is next to piety
(Taqwa) and fear Allah.
It will be noted that the Holy Quran uses 'Adl' in S.4:58,
Adl and Ehsan' in S.16.90, 'Qist' in S.4:136 and 'Qist', 'Adl' and
'Taqwa in $.5:8.
Adl and Ehsan thus appear to be comprehensive enough
to include 'social justice'. (See Qazalbash case at p. 125). Unlike
the Western system of administration of justice, it is not all one-
sided all in favour of the accused person. It strikes a fair balance
between the rights of the society, of the victim and his heirs and of
the accused. As was said in Gul Hassan case (PLD 1989 SC 635.
650, 670), all offences affecting human body are, from Islamic
point of view, to be considered from two perspectives; one, as
injuring the rights of the victim or his survivors and two, as
injuring the rights of the society. The Islamic system is dominated
not by the passion of vengeance (a theory of punishment known as
retaliation) alone, but justice tempered with mercy. (Pervaiz Iqbal
case PLD 1985 SC 134). Along with Qisas (retaliation) it
recognizes the in the victim or his heirs to forgive the
offender and compound the offences affecting human body. Under
this system. "To forgive is blessed" and forgiveness is as much part
of justice as revenge. According to Al-Quran, S.2:237, translated
into English, forgiveness is the nearest to righteousness. (Taqwa:
The word "righteousness" does not do justice to Taqwa'; it is a
word of much greater and higher significance).
Thus, one important feature of the Islamic
administration of criminal justice in contrast to the Anglo-
American system is that while in the Anglo-American system.
victims of crime are a vast forgotten class, in the Islamic system,
the victim or his heirs have an important role to play in the decision
of cases of crimes affecting human body. There is, it is interesting
to note, now in the West a new recognition of the need to balance
(1) the respect accorded the rights of individuals facing criminal
prosecution against (2) the valid interests of society in preventing
future crimes..... Thanks to a grass root resurgence of concern for
the plight of victims which began in the early 1970s there is a
move in America for a victim's Bill of Rights. (See "Criminal
Justice Today" by Frank Schmalleger, p. 8 and p. 376. Also see the
book "The Victims" by Frank G. Carrington. What Mr. Carrington
proposes "as our central task" is: We must develop a "victim -
consciousness" ini our society, and reorient the thinking and
concerns of the criminal justice system towards the rights of the
24

victims of crime). As was said in a recent case, "justice is not for
one, but is for all and while examining the case of convict, the
court owes a duty to the legal heirs/relatives of the victim and to
the society that justice shall also be done with them as well".
(Kamran Malik v State-PLD 2006 SC 354).
Chapter 4
The Constitutional Setting
It is one of the basic and underlying principles of every
constitutional government that governmental powers are divided
into three principal departments the Legislative, the Executive
and the Judicial (Exparte Virginia- 100 US 339-25 L Ed 676). In
other words, a State acts by its legislative, its executive or its
judicial authorities. It can act in no other way. As Chief Justice
Marshall put it, "The legislature makes, the executive executes and
the judiciary construes the law. (Wayman-(1825) 6 L Ed 253).
Pakistan is a Federation, and it is a special feature of the
federal system of government that the powers of sovereignty are
divided between the federation and the federating units; in our
country, it is between the Federation and the Provinces, in US, it is
between the Federation and the States.
Chapter 1 of Part V of the Constitution of Pakistan
provides for the distribution of legislative powers between the
Parliament, which is the legislative organ of the Federation, and the
Provincial Assemblies of the Provinces, which are the legislative
organs of the Provinces. The legislative powers are listed in the
Federal Legislative List, which contains a list of the matters in
respect of which the Parliament has the exclusive power to
legislate, in the Concurrent Legislative List, which contains a list of
the matters in respect of which both the Parliament and the
Provincial Assemblies can legislate. The matters which are not
mentioned in either of these Lists are within the exclusive
legislative competence of the Provincial Assemblies. A relevant
example is "land"; it is a matter not mentioned in either of the Lists
and is therefore an exclusive provincial legislative matter.
These lists are to be found in the 4 Schedule of the
Constitution.
"Criminal Law" including all matters included in the
Pakistan Penal Code and "Criminal Procedure" including all
matters included in the Code of Criminal Procedure, are matters
which appear as items 1 and 2 in the Concurrent Legislative List;
that is to say, these are matters on which both the Parliament and
the Provincial Assemblies can legislate.
Other matters relating to procedure, such as civil
procedure, evidence and limitation, are also in the Concurrent
Legislative List; they are items 3 and 4 respectively.
Subject to the Constitution, Parliament may make laws.
so provides Article 141, including laws having extra-territorial
operation, for the whole or any part of Pakistan and a Provincial
Assembly may make laws for the Province or any part thereof.
Regarding such areas as are not included in any Province, e.g.
Tribal Areas, the Parliament has, under Article 142, exclusive
power to make laws.
Article 143 makes provision for a situation where on a
matter in the Concurrent Legislative List, both the Parliament and a
Provincial Assembly choose to legislate, or where there is
inconsistency between an existing law and a Provincial. In such a
case, the Act of Parliament or as the case may be, the existing law
"shall prevail and the Act of the Provincial Assembly shall, to the
extent of the repugnancy, be void".
"Existing law" is defined in Article 268(7) of the
Constitution to mean all laws in force in Pakistan immediately
before the Constitution of 1973 came into effect.

All three organs of the State the Legislature, the
Executive and the Judiciary - are involved in an effective criminal
justice system. The Legislature makes laws creating offences,
fixing penalties for them and providing for the procedure for their
enforcement; the Executive executes these laws by detecting
crimes, arresting the offenders, collecting the evidence and
determining whether the case against the alleged offender merits
prosecution, and the Judiciary tries the alleged offender to
determine his guilt and if found guilty to punish him in accordance
with law. Every trial, it is to be mentioned, involves the exercise of
judicial power, and the criminal justice system is an important
element in the rule of law.
Chapter 5
Substantive and Procedural Criminal Law
General Observations:
Crime affects the quality of life of citizens and non-
citizens alike and it is the direct responsibility of the criminal
justice system to control it.
The basic purpose of government is to protect the life,
liberty and property of its citizens and this purpose is largely
achieved by the enforcement of its criminal law. The stress is on
preservation of social order and the society's values. By
'enforcement we mean the detection and investigation of crimes,
and the arrest, charging, adjudication, sentencing and execution of
punishment. A system of criminal law, including its enforcement
by the State, is therefore an essential component in the existence of
a civilized society under the rule of law, (R v Connor (2004) I All
ER 925, 965).
Criminal justice is said to have two aspects: substantive
and procedural. Substantive criminal law creates offences and
provides punishments for them; and procedural criminal law (or
criminal procedure) provides for the means and mechanism for the
enforcement of the substantive criminal law. It is the substantive
law which tells us what we can and cannot do in our relationship
with other individuals as well as the society, represented by the
State. In the field of criminal law, for example, the statutes which
define crimes are substantive laws. In the words of Hart, "The aim
of making an act criminal is to announce to society that these acts
are not to be done...". Procedural law, on the other hand, is that
law which tells us how we may enforce the substantive law. It
defines the process (ie. the procedure) of the law, dealing with
such subjects as the method of determining whether the substantive
law has been violated. In the field of criminal law, procedural law
encompasses the processes followed in investigating crimes,
apprehending the offender, determining his guilt or innocence and
applying the sentence ordered by the court". (Introduction to the
"Criminal Justice System" by Hazel B. Kerper, 2d ed. p.32).
Thus substantive criminal law tells us what constitutes a
crime, and if it is duly proved to have been committed, what its
punishment will be for the offender, and procedural criminal law
tells us how to enforce it. In the words of Karam Elahi Chohan J. in
S. M. Junaid case (PLD 1981 SC 12) "substantive law is concerned
with the ends but the procedural law with the means and
instruments by which those ends are to be attained".
Nature of distinction - Drawing the line:
It is not always easy to state with precision the exact
nature of the distinction between the substantive law and the
procedural law:
"The reasons for this are not far to seek.
Generally it is said that substantive law
is that which defines the rights (and
obligations) while procedural law
determines the remedies, but this may
not always be correct, inasmuch as there
are many rights in wide sense which
belong to the sphere of procedure, for
28
29

Page 33
example, a right of appeal, a right to give
evidence on one's own behalf.........
which are considered as substantive
rights. This shows that rules defining the
remedies may sometimes be as much
part of the substantive law as are those
which define the right itself....... what
then is the true distinction? In our
opinion the law of procedure may be
defined as that branch of law which
govers the process of litigation. It is the
law of action using the term
'action' in a wide sense to include all
legal proceedings, civil and criminal. All
the residue is substantive law and relates
not to the process of litigation but to its
purpose and subject-matter. Substantive
law is concerned with the ends but the
procedural law with the means and
instruments by which those ends are to
be attained.
These are the broad outlines of some of
the principles with reference to which
the nature of each law or of a provision
of any law should generally be
examined. in its own context, hefore
holding whether it is a procedural law or
a substantive law, taking notice also of
such rules of procedure as mentioned
earlier which in practical operation are
sometimes wholly or substantially
equivalent to rules of substantive law,
and wherein difference between two
branches is merely one of form rather
than of substance". (S. M. Junaid v
President of Pakistan PLD 1981 SC
12, 15).
30
In this behalf, Adnan Afzal v Sher Afzal (PLD 1969 SC
187) is also frequently cited. Reference may also usefully be made
to Hakim Ali Zardari v State (PLD 1998 SC 1), a bail matter which
has been considered under the heading 'Bail' in a later part of this
book.
S. M. Junaid case did not turn upon the facts of a
particular case. The question was an abstract question whether
section 3 of the Limitation Act. 1908, was repugnant to the
Injunctions of Islam within the meaning of Article 203D of the
Constitution. That section provides that any suit instituted, appeal
preferred, and application made after the period of limitation
prescribed in the First Schedule to the Act "shall be dismissed.
although limitation has not been set up as a defence". Under Article
203B of the Constitution, the jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat
Court does not extend, inter-alia, to any law relating to the
procedure of any court or tribunal, and the question in S. M. Junaid
case was whether section 3 of the Limitation Act was a law relating
to the procedure of any court or tribunal. The answer was 'yes'.
The general observation of the Supreme Court that "the law of
procedure may be defined as that branch of law which governs the
process of litigation. It is the law of 'action', using the term
'action' in a wide sense to include all legal proceedings, civil or
criminal" (which observation seems to be based largely upon
Salmond's Jurisprudence) must therefore be read in that limited
context. The question whether one can acquire a vested right under
a procedural law, e.g. under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898.
or under the Limitation Act, 1908, is altogether a different question
and will be dealt with when we consider the rule that generally
procedural laws are retrospective.
Chapter 6
Importance and Status of Criminal Procedure
There can be no greater testimony to the importance of
the criminal procedure than this that in the US Constitution and in
31
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 34
almost all the democratic constitutions of the world, including
Pakistan, which follow the US pattern, the basic criminal
procedural rights stand incorporated and guaranteed. This is "based
on the cognizance of the historical and potential abuses of the
criminal prosecution and therefore of the necessity of erecting
elaborate procedural safeguards between the govemment and the
individual". But as has been said it is a very easy thing to devise
good laws; the difficulty is to make them effective. Despite these
constitutional guarantees, the international community has
remained so concerned with the misuse and abuse of the criminal
justice process that the right to due process and fairness has been
reaffirmed and elaborated since 1948 in numerous binding
international treaties and conventions, establishing international
standards of faimess, They reflect the saying of Martin Luther
King:
"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice
everywhere".
"Criminal procedure" has thus been internationalized
(Based upon these treaties and conventions, Amnesty International
has prepared a Fair Trial Manual listing as many as 32 Human
Rights which assure that individuals receive fair treatment and are
not unjustly punished). This is in reality an international effort at
humanizing criminal procedure. The result is that no country can
now afford to be a 'republic of bees'; no country can now remain
unconcemed with and uninfluenced by what is going on around the
world. Decisions of courts such as the English Courts, the US
Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice have great
persuasive value and decisions of one country are frequently cited
and followed in other countries.
We have seen that 'criminal law' creates offences; in so
doing it identifies certain ends, which it seeks to achieve. However
good and just the laws and the political principles supporting them
may be, without suitable procedure, they would fail in their
purposes" (Professor DJ. Galligan in his "Due Process and Fair
Procedure").
Much of our substantive law, Lord Denning tells us to
remember, "is found laced in with procedure". For example, Justice
Frankfurter said that "the history of American freedom is, in no
small measure, the history of procedure". But in addition, "the
procedural rules which have been fashioned from the generality of
due process are our best instruments for the distillation and
evaluation of essential facts from the conflicting welter of data that
life and our adversary methods present. It is those instruments of
due process which enhance the possibility that truth will emerge
from the confrontation of opposing versions and conflicting data.
Procedure is to law what scientific method is to science". (In re
Guait-387 US I per Justice Fortas).
Thus, procedure is a means to an end; as Justice William
0. Douglas of the US Supreme Court said in a 1956 case-
"A civilized system of law is as much
concerned with the means employed to
bring people to justice as it is with the
ends themselves. A first principle of
jurisprudence is that the ends do not
justify the means".
So important is the position of the criminal procedure in the
hierarchy of laws that-
"The quality of a nation's civilization
can be largely measured by the methods
it uses in the enforcement of its criminal
law" (quoted by Warren CJ. in Miranda
v Arizona-384 US 436).
In sum, the substantive criminal law and the procedural criminal
law complement each other and failure of the latter is failure of the
former, which can mean failure of the social goals which the
society seeks to achieve by enacting the substantive criminal law.
Thus, criminal procedure is the criminal justice system in action.

Chapter 7
Procedural Laws their purpose, and interpretation
The law of procedure is what is commonly termed by
jurists as 'adjective law the aggregate of rules of procedure or
practice, as opposed to the body of law which the courts are
established to administer, that is, the substantive law; it means the
rules according to which the substantive law is administered; that
part of the law which provides a method or mechanism for
enforcing or maintaining rights or obtaining redress for their
invasion. (This statement has been taken from Black's Law
Dictionary; it is based upon some American cases cited there).
i)
Their purpose and status
Rules of procedure are a means of ascertaining and
reaching the truth and doing justice in accordance with law. "While
considering the importance of legal technicalities and rules of
procedure in the administration of justice, it is inevitable to recall
the various evolutionary stages in the transition from justice
without law of primitive society to justice in accordance with law
of modern society and the conflict between equity and law in
judicial history. It cannot be denied that legal precepts were
devised with a view to impart certainty, consistency and uniformity
to administration of justice and to secure it against arbitrariness,
errors of individual judgment and malafide... Mere
technicalities unless offering an insurmountable hurdle should not
be allowed to defeat the ends of justice..." (Khuda Yar case -
PLD 1975 SC 678, 691). "I think", said Kaikaus J. in Imtiaz
Ahmad v Ghulam Ali, (PLD 1963 SC 382, 400) "the proper place
of procedure in any system of administration of justice is to help
and not to thwart the grant to the people of their rights. All
technicalities have to be avoided unless it be essential to comply
with them on ground of public policy. The English system of
administration of justice on which our own is based may be to a
certain extent technical but we are not to take from that system its
defects. Any system, which by giving effect to the form and not to
the substance defeats substantive rights and is defective to that
extent. The ideal must always be a system that gives to every
person what is his". As has been said by Lord Donaldson MR, in a
recent English case, Kenneth Allision Ltd. v A. E. Lime House,
(1990) 2 All ER 723, 727) "The rules are servants of the courts and
of their customers, not their masters; unless expressed in a wholly
mandatory and exclusive fashion........it would be wholly contrary
to the spirit of the times that the rules should be construed in a
manner which would forbid parties to litigation to act reasonably
with a view to eliminating or reducing the acerbilies inevitable in
litigation.......
ii)
To be construed liberally:
Keeping in view the purpose that the procedural laws are
intended to subserve and the status of procedural rules, as noticed
above, procedural statutes must receive broad and beneficial
construction (Maxwell on "Interpretation of Statutes". 12th ed.
p.102). It is a sound rule of construction that procedural enactments
should be construed liberally and in such manner as to render the
substantive rights effective (Veluswami v Raja Nainar - AIR 1959
SC 422, 426). The rules are made for the advancement of justice
and they should not, as far as possible, be allowed to operate so as
to defeat the ends of justice. The rules are in the nature of enabling
provisions and substantial compliance with them should be enough
(Toor Gul v Mumtaz Begum - PLD 1972 SC 9, 13). It is on this
principle that the law of pleadings has never been strictly construed
and rigorously applied in its technicalities to this country (S. M.
Ayub v Yusaf PLD 1967 SC 486).
Procedural statutes are remedial statutes and the
principle is that remedial statutes should be construed in a manner
so as to advance the remedy and suppress the mischief or else it
would frustrate the legislative intendment (Divl. Supdt v Bashir
Ahmad-PLD 1973 SC $89).
34

Page 36
As to the rules of construction applicable to the statutes
like the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal
Procedure, the classic statement of the law is to be found in
Mehmood J's judgment in Narsingdas v. Mangle Dubey (1882) s
All 172); said that great Judge:
"the courts are not to act upon the
principle that every procedure is to be
taken as prohibited unless it is expressly
provided for by the Code, but on the
converse principle that every procedure
is to be understood as permissible till it
is shown to be prohibited by the law. As
3 matter of general principle,
prohibitions cannot be presumed, and in
the present case therefore it rests upon
the defendants to show the suit in the
form in which it has been brought is
prohibited by the rules of procedure
applicable to the courts of justice in
India".
It is now a settled rule of interpretation of procedural
laws that the Court should proceed on the principle that every
procedure which furthers administration of justice is permissible
even if there is no express provision permitting it, and that the
court ought not to act on the principle that every procedure is to be
taken as prohibited unless it is expressly provided for (S. M. Saya
and Co. v Wazir Ali-PLD 1969 SC 65).
Also, it is a sound rule, recognized by almost all general
codes of procedural law and absolutely essential for the
preservation of all duly considered verdicts that an omission or
error in procedure, unless it has occasioned a failure of justice of
prejudiced a party in the presentation of his case, is not a sufficient
ground for reversing the decision (Mst. Bibi Jan and others versus
R. A. Monny and another PLD 1961 SC 69).
iii)
Retrospectivity and Procedural Laws:
Power to legislate includes the power to
legislate Retrospectivity
The established rule is that subject to any constitutional
bar there is no legal limit to the making and un-making of laws by
a Legislature. Also, it is within the domain of the Legislature to
appoint a date for the commencement of the laws made by it
including a date preceding the making of the laws. In short, the
authority to legislate includes the authority to legislate with
retrospective effect, even from a date earlier than the formation of
the legislative body itself (Sh. Amin Ullah v Pannu Ram - PLD
1967 SC 289). As long as the power to enact laws remains in force,
it is a power to make laws for all times past as well as future, that
is, with prospective as well as retrospective operation, unless of
course there be some limitation on the power of the Legislature
(Noorani Cotton Corp. v Sales Tax Officer PLD 1965 SC 161).
For example, in Sh. Amin Ullah v. Pannu Ram (PLD 1967 SC
289), the Governor had promulgated the Rent Restriction
Ordinance 1959 in pursuance of the proclamation of emergency
issued on 7 October 1958 and the question was whether he could
give effect to the Ordinance from an earlier date. It was held that
the Governor could make law with retrospective effect. In Khaliq
and Najam Company v. Sales Tax Officer (PLD 1959 (WP) Lah.
915), the President promulgated an Ordinance amending Section
2(11) of Sales Tax Act 1951 with retrospective effect, making
cotton ginners liable to sales tax from a back date. The power was
up-held.
b)
Constitutional bar to Retrospectivity
The only constitutional bar against retrospectivity is
contained in Article 12 of the Constitution, which forbids any law
to authorize the punishment of a person (a) for an act or omission
that was not punishable by law at the time of the act or omission; or
(b) for an offence by a penalty greater than, or of a kind different
36
37
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 37
from, the penalty prescribed by law for that offence at the time the
offence was committed".
The equality clause in Article 25 of the Constitution
does not, however, create a bar against retrospective laws
(Muhammad Yousaf v Chief Settlement Commissioner - PLD
1968 SC 101).
c)
Meaning of Retrospectivity
"Retrospectivity has been variously defined. "If an Act
provides that at a past date the law shall be taken to have been what
it was not, that I understand to be retrospective........"; (1891) 2
Ch.1.11,12 cited in Emperor v Sibnath Bannerjee - AIR 1943 FC
75); according to Halsbury's Laws of England Vol. 36, p.436. "The
courts regard as retrospective any statute which operates on cases
or facts coming into existence before its commencement" (cited in
Nabi Ahmad v Home Secretary - PLD 1969 SC 599). A statute is
retrospective if it takes away or impairs a vested right acquired
under existing laws, or creates a new obligation or imposes a new
duty, or attaches a new disability, in regard to events already past
(Yew Bon Tew - (1962) 3 All ER 833, 836).
There is no fundamental difference between
retrospective and ex post facto law. The former expression is used
in respect of civil matters and the latter in respect of criminal
matters which by their nature are more serious (Nabi Ahmad v
Home Secretary-PLD 1969 SC 599, 610). The leading authority
in America on the meaning of ex post facto legislation is Calder v
Bull (3 US (3 Dall) 386): "(i) Every law that makes an action done
before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done,
criminal, and punishes such action; (ii) Every law that aggravates a
crime or makes it greater than it was when committed; (iii) Every
law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment,
than the law annexed to the crime when committed; (iv) Every law
that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less or different
testimony than the law required at the time of the commission of
the offence, in order to convict the offender" is an ex post facto law
38
(cited in Nabi Ahmad v Home Secretary PLD 1969 SC 599,
611).
d)
The Rule against Retrospectivity
Power to legislate retrospective laws is one thing and the
power to determine whether a law is or is not retrospective in
operation is another. The latter is a question of interpretation and is
for the courts. For the determination of that question, the
fundamental rule is that the statutes "are construed as operating
only on cases and on facts which come into existence after the
statutes were passed unless a retrospective effect is clearly
intended. It is a fundamental rule that no statute shall be construed
to have a retrospective operation unless such a construction appears
very clearly in the terms of the Act, or arises by necessary and
distinct implication". (This statement of law is at page 215 of
Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes. It has been "so frequently
quoted with approval that it now itself enjoys almost judicial
authority". See Amir Ashfaque Qureshi v University of
Engineering 1992 CLC 2186, 2189).
The general principle with regard to the interpretation of.
statutes as laid down in the well known case of Colonial Sugar
Refining Company v. Irving (1905) AC 369) is that "if the matter
in question is a matter of procedure only", the provision would be
retrospective. "On the other hand, if it be more than a matter of
procedure, if it touches a right in existence at the passing of the
Act", then "in accordance with a long line of authorities extending
from the time of Lord Coke to the present day", the legislation
would not operate retrospectively, unless the Legislature had either
"by express enactment or by necessary intendment" given the
legislation retroactive effect. In the Colonial Sugar Refining
Company Ltd. case, right of appeal was treated as a substantive
right and not a procedural right: "In principle their Lordships see
no difference between abolishing an appeal altogether and
transferring the appeal to a new tribunal".

c)
Exception-Procedural Laws
Procedural laws are generally retrospective, and
constitute an exception to the rule pertaining to retrospectivity of
statutes generally. The reason why there is an exception in the case
of a statute which is 'purely procedural", is because "no person has
a vested right in any particular course of procedure, but a right to
prosecute or defend a suit according to the rules for the conduct of
an action for the time being prescribed". (A. M. Qureshi v USSR -
PLD 1981 SC 377,421)
Though the rule is that all alterations in procedure are
retrospective unless there is some good reason to the contrary, yet
as was emphasized by the Federal Court in Venugopala Reddiar
case, (AIR 1943 FC 24) this rule is sometimes too broadly stated.
In one sense, a right of appeal may be spoken of as a matter of
procedure as it is usually provided for in codes relating to
procedure. But as was recognized in Colonial Sugar Refining
Company v. Irving, that is not sufficient to make a legislative
provision governing the right of appeal retrospective. In short, all
that is contained in a procedural code, such as the Code of Criminal
Procedure 1898, is not necessarily procedural. Similarly a
Limitation Act is usually described as procedural, but in fact it may
be both procedural and substantive. For example, Section 28 of the
Limitation Act, 1908, was an example of a substantive law; it
provided that at the expiration of the period of limitation for
recovery of property, the title of the owner stood extinguished.
ก
Amending Law affecting rights:
This question assumes importance, when the law is
enacted or amended during the pendency of a suit or proceeding. In
Adnan Afzal v Sher Afzal (PLD 1969 SC 187) 'A' applied for
maintenance under section 488 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
before a Magistrate on 4 of September 1964. The matter was
pending when the West Pakistan Family Courts Act 1964 came
into force giving jurisdiction in such matters to the Family Court.
The Magistrate directed 'A' to seek his remedy in Family Courts.
In these facts it was held that the Family Courts Act had changed
the forum, altered the method of trial and empowered the Family
Courts to grant better remedies and it had "in every sense of the
term brought about only procedural changes and not affected any
substantive right". As there was nothing in the West Pakistan
Family Court Act to the contrary, that Act was given retrospective
effect and the Magistrate was held to have rightly directed 'A' to
seek his remedy in the Family Courts. This principle was applied in
Hakim Ali Zardari v Siate (PLD 1998 SC 1). The amendment in
bail law was treated as procedural and hence retrospective. (This
view has been commented upon under the title 'Bail').
But, when the question is whether an amending law has
affected or impaired existing rights or obligations, it is not enough
to decide what label to apply to the amending law - procedural or
substantive or whether the amending law is procedural or
substantive For as was said in Yew Bon Tew v Kenderaan Bas
Mora (1982) 3 All ER 833), the expressions 'retrospective' and
"procedural', though useful in a particular context, are equivocal
and therefore can be misleading. This question can best be
illustrated by some cases under the law of limitation.
The relevance of the law of limitation, itself a procedural
law, to the 'criminal procedure is that time-limits may be fixed
within which a prosecution will be brought, and if the prosecution
is not brought within that time-limit, it may not be brought at all.
For example, section 198A, Cr.P.C. by its sub-section (4), forbids
the court to take cognizance of the offence mentioned in sub-
section (1) thereof, unless the complaint is made within six months
from the date of the offence. And one important change brought
about by the re-enacted Indian Code of Criminal Procedure 1973,
successor of the 1898 Code, is that by its section 468(2), it has
fixed the following periods of limitation:
six months, if the offence is punishable with
fine only;
(a)
(b)
one year, if the offence is punishable with
imprisonment for one year,
40

Page 39
(c)
three years, if the offence is punishable with
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year
but not exceeding three years.
In Yew Bon Tew (1982) 3 All ER 833), an action could be
brought, under a 1948 Ordinance, within a period of 12 months,
which ended on 5 April 1973. No action was brought within that
period. On 13 June 1974, the law was, amended and the period of
limitation for such actions was fixed as 36 months. An action was
actually brought on 20 March 1975. It was held that the proper.
approach to the construction of the 1974 Act-
"is not to decide what label to apply to it,
procedural or otherwise, but to see
whether the statute, if applied
retrospectively to a particular type of
case, would impair existing rights and
obligations. A Limitation Act
may be procedural in the
context of one set of facts but
substantive in the context of a different
set of facts".
As the action here was brought long after the lapse of the period of
limitation prescribed by the 1948 Ordinance, the defendant had
acquired a right to plead the time-bar which-
"is in every sense a right, even though it
arises under an Act which is
procedural".
Let us apply this principle to a criminal case. Suppose
that the 1948 Ordinance prescribed a period of 12 months for
bringing a prosecution against an accused, but no prosecution was
brought within that period. Suppose also that after the expiry of the
period of 12 months, the 1948 Act was amended prescribing a
period of 36 months for such an offence and taking advantage of
the amended law, a prosecution is brought long after the period of
12 months under the 1948 Ordinance had expired. On the principle
42
enunciated in Yew Bon Tew, such a prosecution must fail, for the
accused had acquired under the 1948 Ordinance, a vested right to
plead the time-bar, which was in every sense a right even though it
had arisen under a procedural law.
But if by the amending law, the time is enlarged while a
person is still within time under the existing law, the statute will be
procedural and retrospective. Thus, in R v Chandra Dharma (1905)
2 KB 335: (1904-7) All ER 570), an offence was committed on 15
July 1904. Under the relevant law, a prosecution could be brought
within 3 months, that is up to 15 October 1904. On 1 October
1904, the law was amended and the time-limit was extended to 6
months. The prosecution was initiated on 27 December, 1904. It
was held that the prosecution was within time, for the amended law
was, in the facts of the case. applied retrospectively.
The principle, thus, is that if the new statute alters the
character of the offence or takes away any defence which was open
to the defendant, it is a matter of substantive law. But if it merely
alters the time-limit, it is a matter of procedure..
However, if the time-limit under the old law had expired
before the new law extending the period of limitation is passed, the
new law would not apply, because then the accused's right to plead
the time-bar, acquired under the old law, would be affected, and the
new law would not be applied retrospectively.
It is, therefore, unwise to attribute a prima facie
retrospective effect to all that is contained in a procedural statute.
e.g. a statute of limitation. Statutes which enable a person to
enforce a cause of action which was then barred or provide a bar to
an existing cause of action by abridging the time of its institution
could hardly be described as merely procedural. They would affect
substantive rights.
The view taken in Yew Bon Tew and Chandra Dharma
cases seems to be in accord with Article 264 of the Constitution
and the corresponding provision in the General Clauses Acts,
43
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 40
which provide for the effect of repeal of laws. They provide that
the repeal of a law shall not, among others, "affect any right,
privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or suffered under
the (repealed) law". These provisions make no distinction between
a right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or
incurred under a substantive or a procedural law. As Yew Bon Tew
holds, a right acquired under a procedural law is as much a right as
the one acquired under a substantive law.
g)
Rule applies to prevent unfairness
It is chiefly where the enactment would prejudicially
affect vested rights, or the legality of past transactions, or impair
existing contracts, that the rule against retrospectivity prevails
(Nagina Silk Mill v Income Tax Officer PLD 1963 SC 322).
A vested right must be distinguished from a contingent
right. Also, there is a distinction between a vested right and a mere
right (assuming it to be properly so called) to take advantage of an
enactment (Rafi-ud-Din v Chief Settlement Commissioner - PLD
1971 SC 252, 271 and Amir Ashfaq Qureshi v University of
Engineering 1992 CLC 2186).
Thus, the doctrine of retrospectivity operates only 10
prevent unfaimess and when the effect of a law is not unfair, the
presumption against retrospectivity will not apply. (Plewa v Chief
Adjudicating Officer-(1994) 3 WLR 317).
h)
Subordinate legislation and Retrospectivity
The general rule is that subordinate legislation operates
prospectively (Hashwani Hotels v Federation PLD 1997 SC 315).
But it can operate retrospectively if it is beneficial (Anoud Power
Generation y Federation-PLD 2001 SC 340).
PART II
Categories of Criminal Procedure
We propose to divide "Criminal Procedure" into the
following two categories, and to discuss it accordingly:
1.
2.
Constitutional Criminal Procedure; and
Ordinary or Legislative Criminal Procedure.
Chapter 1
Distinction between Constitutional and Ordinary Criminal
Procedure
Before we begin with a discussion of the two categories
of criminal procedure, we need to know what distinguishes the one
from the other.
"Constitutional Criminal Procedure" is the criminal
procedure which has been provided for, and has its roots in a
written Constitution. And as the Constitution is the supreme and
paramount law, so are the provisions relating to criminal procedure
enshrined in it, c.g. the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the
Constitution, the underlying theory of a written Constitution, in the
trite words of the great Chief Justice John Marshall being, "that an
act of the Legislature repugnant to the Constitution is void"
[Marbury v Madison-5 US (1 Cranch) 137 (1803)].
A striking illustration is an English enactment of 1503
called the Boiling of Prisoners Act. Suppose the US Congress had
re-enacted that Act now. Would the courts have to sentence
prisoners to be boiled? The answer is 'no', for Amendment VIII to
the US Constitution forbids the infliction of "cruel and unusual
punishment". The same will be true if such a law were tested on the
touchstone of the Fundamental Right guaranteed by Article 14 of
44
45
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 41
the Constitution of Pakistan, clause (1) whereof ensures "the
dignity of man",
An Act of Legislature is an ordinary legislative
enactment enacted by a competent legislative authority in exercise
of the powers derived from the Constitution. The Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898, which is the principal criminal procedural law of
Pakistan, is an example of an ordinary Act of the legislature, and
that Act or for that matter any other criminal procedural enactment,
will be, to the extent of any inconsistency or repugnancy to the
Constitution, void. Article 8 of the Constitution of Pakistan so
provides expressly.
We can illustrate the distinction with reference to Article
9 of the Constitution of Pakistan. That Article guarantees one of the
Fundamental Rights relating to criminal procedure and reads: "No
person shall be deprived of life and liberty save in accordance with
law".
The "law" here obviously means a valid law a
constitutionally valid law. Thus, a law made by a Provincial
Assembly, which under the Constitution is within the exclusive
legislative competence of the Parliament, will not be a valid law;
nor will a law made by any legislature be valid which contravenes
any of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Part II, Chapter 1, of
the Constitution. Thus a law which, for example, permits the
detention of an arrestee by the police beyond twenty-four hours of
his arrest without being produced before a magistrate, or which
provides for retroactive punishment, or which permits double
jeopardy or self-incrimination in contravention of Article 10, 12 or
13 respectively, will not be a valid law. As was said in Zia-ur-
Rehman case (PLD 1972 SC 49, 67) by Hamoodur Rahman C.J.
".....even non-constitutional provisions, if incorporated in a
Constitution, acquire a higher sanctity and stand on the same
footing as strictly constitutional provisions. No differentiation can
be made between them, once they have been given a constitutional
status by being incorporated in the Constitution itself. (For a
detailed discussion, see the author's book "Judicial Review of
Public Actions", p616).
We often say that "no person has a vested right in any
particular course of procedure". This seems to be true only of the
procedure prescribed by an ordinary enactment. This does not
apply to the procedural rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Thus,
an ordinary enactment cannot deprive a person of his constitutional
right to silence or the right against double jeopardy guaranteed by
Article 13 of the Constitution. These and other rights enshrined in
Part II, Chapter 1, of the Constitution are vested rights, vested in
the people of Pakistan by the Constitution and no ordinary law can
take them away or abridge them.
This distinction is hierarchical; it establishes the relative
importance of the two categories of criminal procedure. In the
hierarchy of laws the Constitution is supreme, and where the
Constitution and a statute collide, the latter must yield.
The second distinction lies in the consequences which
flow from the contravention of the rights guaranteed by the
Constitution and the consequences which flow from the
contravention of the tights given by ordinary legislation. It is a
well-established principle of the constitutional law that an act of
the legislature or the executive which violates, or is inconsistent
with, the Constitution is void. This principle has been expressly
recognized by Article 8 of the Constitution, which occurs in
Chapter 1 of Part II of the Constitution, which chapter confers the
Fundamental Rights enumerated therein; this principle seems to be
the basis of the American exclusionary rule namely "all evidence
obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is
......inadmissible..." (Mapp v Ohio - 367 US 643). On the
contrary, the common law rule was that the court had no discretion
to exclude evidence simply because it had been illegally or
improperly obtained (R v Sang (1979) 2 All ER 1222, 1230).
Provided the evidence was relevant, it was admissible in law
regardless of how it was obtained. "It matters not how you get it; if
you steal it even, it would be admissible in evidence" (Crompton J.
in R v Leatham-(1861) 8 Cox CC 499, 501). Then, consequences
of the violation of any procedural provision will be determined
46

with reference to the relevant procedural law, e.g. section 537 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure or Article 162 of Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984, and those consequences may not be as serious as
treating the act in question void and non-existent.
Chapter 2
Constitutional Criminal Procedure
"Constitutional Criminal Procedure" is a new creature in
the legal landscape of Pakistan; it is also new as an academic topic.
But it is well-known to the Anglo-American legal literature as also
to the academics of the United States of America and the United
Kingdom. [See, for example Carol S. Steiker's "First Principles of
Constitutional Criminal Procedure: A Mistake" (1999) 112
Harvard LR 680; "Criminal Procedure and the Constitution" by
Jerold H. Israel, Yale Kemisar and Wayne R. LaFave, 1994 ed; that
book presents a collection of leading Supreme Court of US
decisions in the field of "Constitutional Criminal Procedure" and
"The Bill of Rights as a Code of Criminal Procedure" by Henry J.
Friday in (53) 1965 California Law Review 929. Also sce
"Criminal Evidence" by Professors Paul Roberts and Adrian
Zuckerman, in which at p 32 is discussed the subject under the
heading "The Human Rights Act, Constitutional Criminal
Procedure, and Beyond".]

PART II A
Chapter 1
Criminal Procedure In US Constitution
Bill of Rights
The First Ten Amendments to the US Constitution,
passed in 1791, also known as the Bill of Rights, read with the 14"
Amendment, contain several procedural provisions that have
exclusive applicability to criminal cases. The constitutional rights
to counsel, to indictment by grand jury, to trial by impartial jury
['grand' is sometimes misunderstood. It only means large and
distinguishes the grand jury from the petit (small) jury. So the term
refers to the size, not to the importance of the jury. The function of
the grand jury is not to determine whether someone is guilty or not,
that is the responsibility of the petit jury. The function of the grand
jury is to determine whether there is probable cause that a crime
was committed and that the accused committed it, to freedom
from cruel and unusual punishment, right against excessive bail
and double jeopardy, right to freedom from unreasonable searches
and seizures and to confront one's accusers and to have
compulsory process for one's witnesses, right not to incriminate
oneself and not to be deprived of life, liberty and property without
due process of law, have all their roots in the US Constitution.
Concepts such as the presumption of innocence, proof
beyond a reasonable doubt, general notions of fair procedure and
right to privacy are not specifically mentioned in the US
Constitution, but are part of the constitutional law of America, as
developed by the US Supreme Court. Presumption of innocence,
proof beyond reasonable doubt, it has been held, are part of the
"due process of law" Clauses in Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.
Thus, the Constitution of the United States provides a
constitutional model of a fair criminal procedure. Of the twenty
three fundamental rights guaranteed by the First Eight
Amendments (Bill of Rights), twelve relate to criminal procedure.
"Criminal procedure was a major part of these bill of rights. The
basic rights of man turned out, in large part, to be rights to fair
criminal trial. The fundamental rights of man were closely
49

Page 43
identified........with the basic rights to a fair trial. ("A History of
American Law" by Lawrence M. Friedman, pp 100, 207). In the
words of the learned author of "A History of American Law" (at p
74)-
"The Bill of Rights contained, in a way,
a mini-code of criminal procedure -
rules about warrants, searches and
seizures, forms of punishment, the
privilege against self-incrimination, and
so on".
The American Criminal Justice System, as has been said:
"values procedural faimess both as a
means to an end and as an end itself.
(The Most Wonderful Work" by Thomas
E. Baker, p 482).
The following leading cases will serve to show how this
"mini-code of criminal procedure" has developed at the hands of
the US Supreme Court, gradually, keeping pace with the changing
times; they contain what, in philosophers' language, may be called
"conceptual analysis" of the ideas enshrined in the Bill of Rights.
To quote Judge Henry J. Friendly (see his Article "The Bill of
Rights as a Code of Criminal Procedure" in 53 California Law
Review, 1965, 929, 930)-
"There are fewer brighter pages in the
history of the Supreme Court than its
efforts over the past forty years to
improve the administration of criminal
justice".
The period, if we may add, will come to about fifty years
if we add another ten years of the Warren Court, during which
period such land-mark cases as Miranda v Arizona were decided.
This should naturally lead us to a consideration of the
relevance of the American Constitution and the American
constitutional law to the Constitution of Pakistan and the
Fundamental Rights guaranteed by it. That question will be dealt
with immediately after we have had a feel and flavour of the
leading American cases.
Chapter 2
Searches and Seizuers; the Right to Privacy-
Fourth Amendment
The Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution reads:
"The right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects
against unreasonable searches and
seizures shall not be violated, and no
warrants shall issue but upon probable
cause, supported by oath or affirmation,
and particularly describing the place to
be searched and the persons or things to
be seized".
In Katz v US (389 US 347; 19 L Ed 2d 576-1967), the
petitioner was convicted in the District Court on the charge of
transmitting information by telephone from Los Angeles to Miami
and Boston, in violation of a federal statute. At trial the
Government was permitted over the petitioner's objection to
introduce evidence of the petitioner's end of telephone
conversations, overheard by FBI agents who had attached an
electronic listening and recording device to the outside of the
public telephone booth from which he had placed his calls. In
affirming his conviction, the Court of Appeals rejected the
contention that the recordings had been obtained in violation of the
Fourth Amendment, because there was no physical entrance into
the area occupied by the petitioner. On certiorari, the US Supreme
Court reversed:

protected deflects attention from the
problem presented by this case. For the
Fourth Amendment protects people, not
places. What a person knowingly
exposes to the public, even in his own
home or office, is not a subject of Fourth
Amendment protection. But what he
seeks to preserve as private, even in an
area accessible to the public, may be
constitutionally protected.
.........One who occupies it (a telephone
booth) shuts the door behind him, and
pays the toll that permits him to place a
call, is surely entitled to assume that the
words he utters into the mouthpiece will
not be broadcast to the world. To read
the Constitution more narrowly is to
ignore the vital role that the public
52
telephone has come to play in private
communication.
The Goverment urges that, because
they (its agents) did no more here than
they might properly have done with prior
judicial sanction, we should retroactively
validate their conduct. That we cannot
do. It is apparent that the agents in this
case acted with restraint. Yet the
inescapable fact is that this restraint was
imposed by the agents themselves, not
by a judicial officer......
The ratio of Katz is "that the searches conducted outside
the judicial process, without prior approval of a judge or magistrate
are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment subject
only to specifically established and well-delineated exceptions".
In Coolidge (403 US 443) the Supreme Court
invalidated a warrant issued by the State's attorney.
In Johnson v US (333 US 10-1948) Mr. Justice Jackson
delivered the opinion of the Court. Petitioner was convicted of four
counts charging violation of federal narcotic laws. "The only
question which brings the case here is whether it was lawful,
without a warrant of any kind, to arrest petitioner and to search her
living quarters". The opinion proceeds as follows:
"Taking the Government's version of
disputed events, decision would rest on
these facts:
At about 7:30 p.m. Detective Lieutenant
Belland, an officer of the Seattle police
force narcotic detail, received
information from a confidential
informer, who was also a known
53

Page 45

narcotic user, that unknown persons
were smoking opium in the Europe
Hotel. The informer was taken back to
the hotel to interview the manager, but
he returned at once saying he could
smell burning opium in the hallway.
Belland communicated with federal
narcotic agents and between 8:30 and 9
o'clock went back to the hotel with four
such agents. All were experienced in
narcotic work and recognized at once a
strong odor of buming opium which to
them was distinctive and unmistakable.
The odor led to Room 1. The officers did
not know who was occupying that room.
They knocked and a voice inside asked
who was there. 'Lieutenant Belland."
was the reply. There was a slight delay,
some 'shuffling or noise in the room.
and then the defendant opened the door.
The officer said, 'I want to talk to you a
little bit. She then, as he describes it,
stepped back acquiescently and admitted
us. He said, "I want to talk to you about
this opium smell in the room here'. She
denied that there was such a smell. Then
he said, 'I want you to consider yourself
under arrest because we are going to
search the room'. The search turned up
incriminating opium and smoking
apparatus, the latter being warm,
apparently from recent use. This
evidence the District Court refused to
suppress before trial and admitted over
defendant's objection at the trial.
Conviction resulted and the Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed.
54
The defendant challenged the search of
her home as a violation of the rights
secured to her, in common with others,
by the Fourth Amendment to the
Constitution.
The Government defends the
search as legally justifiable, more
particularly as incident to what it urges
was a lawful arrest of the person.
Entry to defendant's living quarters,
which was the beginning of the search,
was demanded under color of office. It
was granted in submission to authority
rather than as an understanding and
intentional waiver of a constitutional
right.
At the time entry was demanded the
officers were possessed of evidence
which a magistrate might have found to
be probable cause for issuing a search
warrant. We cannot sustain defendant's
contention, erroneously made, on the
strength of Taylor v United States, 286
US 1, that odors cannot be evidence
sufficient to constitute probable grounds
for any search. That decision held only
that odors alone do not authorize a
search without warrant. If the presence
of odors is. testified to before a
magistrate and he finds the affiant.
qualified to know the odor, and it is one
sufficiently distinctive to identify a
forbidden substance, this Court has
never held such a basis insufficient to
justify issuance of a search warrant.
55

Page 46
Indeed it might very well be found to be
evidence of most persuasive character.
The point of the Fourth Amendment,
which often is not grasped by zealous
officers, is not that it denies law
enforcement the support of the usual
inferences which reasonable men draw
from evidence. Its protection consists in
requiring that those inferences be drawn
by a neutral and detached magistrate
instead of being judged by the officer
engaged in the often competitive
enterprise of ferreting out crime (United
States v Lefkowitz, 285 US-452, 464).
Any assumption that evidence sufficient
to support a magistrate's disinterested
determination to issue a search warrant
will justify the officers in making a
search without a warrant would reduce
the Amendment to a nullity and leave
the people's homes secure only in the
discretion of police officers (Agnello v
United States. 269 US 20, 33). Crime,
even in the privacy of one's own
quarters, is, of course, of grave concern
to society, and the law allows such crime
to be reached on proper showing. The
right of officers to thrust themselves into
a home is also a grave concern, not only
to the individual but to a society which
chooses to dwell in reasonable security
and freedom from surveillance. When
the right of privacy must reasonably
yield to the right of search is, as a rule,
to be decided by a judicial officer, not by
a policeman or government enforcement
agent.
There are exceptional circumstances in
which, on balancing the need for
effective law enforcement against the
right of privacy, it may be contended
that a magistrate's warrant for search
may be dispensed with. But this is not
such a case, No reason is offered for not
obtaining a search warrant except the
inconvenience to the officers and some
slight delay necessary to prepare papers
and present the evidence to a magistrate.
These are never very convincing reasons
and, in these circumstances, certainly are
not enough to by-pass the constitutional
requirement. No suspect was fleeing or
likely to take flight. The search was of
permanent premises, not of a movable
vehicle. No evidence or contraband was
threatened with removal or destruction,
except perhaps the fumes which we
suppose in time would disappear. But
they were not capable at any time of
being reduced to possession for
presentation to court. The evidence of
their existence before the search was
adequate and the testimony of the
officers to that effect would not perish
from the delay of getting a warrant.
If the officers in this case were excused
from the constitutional duty of
presenting their evidence to a magistrate,
it is difficult to think of a case in which
it should be required".
The Supreme Court held that the officers had no
probable cause to arrest the defendant until they entered the
56
57

Page 47
defendant's quarters, and reasoned that the search (entry and visual
inspection) preceded the arrest. It was not possible, therefore, to
justify the officers' conduct on a search incident to a valid arrest
theory.
In Illinois y Gates (462 US 213; 76 L Ed 2d 527-1983)
the respondents, Lance and Susan Gates, were indicted for
violating state drug laws, after police officer executing a search
warrant discovered marijuana and other contraband substances in
their automobile and home. Prior to that the Gates moved to
suppress evidence seized during the search. The lower court
granted the motion to suppress evidence and the State Supreme
Court affirmed. The warrant application was based upon an
anonymous handwritten note received by the police by mail and
subsequent enquiries made by the police. In pursuance of the
search warrant about 350 pounds of marijuana was recovered from
a trunk and a search of Gates' home revealed marijuana, weapons
and other contrahands. The ground on which this evidence was
suppressed by the lower court was that the affidavit submitted to
the Circuit Judge failed to support the necessary determination of
probable cause to believe that the Gates', automobile and home
contained the contraband in question...
The US Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed:
"We agree with the Illinois Supreme
Court that an informant's veracity.
reliability and basis of knowledge are all
highly relevant in determining the value
of his report. We do not agree, however,
that these elements should be understood
as entirely separate and independent
requirements to be rigidly exacted in
every case, which the opinion of the
Supreme Court of Klinois would imply.
Rather, as detailed below, they should be
understood simply as closely intertwined
issues that may usefully illuminate the
58
commonsense, practical question
whether there is probable cause to
believe that contraband or evidence is
located in a particular place.
This totality of the circumstances
approach is far more consistent with our
prior treatment of probable cause than is
any rigid demand that specific tests be
satisfied by every informant's tip
Perhaps the central teaching of our
decisions bearing on the probable cause

technical conception.

reduced to a near set of legal rules.
Informants tips doubtless come in many
shapes and sizes from many different
types of persons.
Moreover, the two-pronged test directs
analysis into two largely independent
channels the informant's veracity or
reliability and his basis of knowledge.
There are persuasive arguments against
according to these two elements such
independent status. Instead, they are
better understood as relevant
considerations in the totality of
circumstances analysis that traditionally
has guided probable cause
determinations: a deficiency in one may
be compensated for, in determining the
overall reliability of a tip, by a strong

Page 48
showing as to the other, or by some
ather indicia of reliability.
Unlike a totality of circumstances
analysis, which permits a balanced
assessment of the relative weights of all
the various indicia of reliability (and
unreliability) attending an informant's
tip, the two-pronged test has encouraged
an excessively technical dissection of
informants' tips, with undue attention
being focused on isolated issues that
cannot sensibly be divorced from the
other facts presented to the magistrate.
Finely-tuned standards such as
proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a
preponderance of the evidence, useful in
formal trials, have no place in the
magistrate's decision. While an effort to
fix some general, numerically precise
degree of certainty corresponding to
probable cause may not be helpful, it is
clear that only the probability, and not a
prima facie showing, of criminal activity
is the standard of probable cause.
We have also recognized that affidavits
are normally drafted by nonlawyers in
the midst and haste of a criminal
investigation. The rigorous inquiry
inte the Spinelli prongs and the complex
superstructure of evidentiary and
unalytical rules that some have seen
implicit in our Spinelli decision, cannot
be reconciled with the fact that many
warrants are quite properly - issued on
the basis of non-technical, commonsense
judgments of laymen applying a
standard less demanding than those used
in formal legal proceedings.
If the affidavits submitted by police
officers are subjected to the type of
scrutiny some courts have deemed
appropriate, police might well resort to
warrantless searches, with the hope of
relying on consent or some other
exception to the warrant clause that
might develop at the time of the search.
In addition, the possession of a warrant
by officers conducting an arrest or
search greatly reduces the perception of
unlawful or intrusive police conduct, by
assuring the individual whose property is
searched or seized of the lawful
authority of the executing officer, his
need to search, and the limits of his
to search. Reflecting this
preference for the warrant process, the
traditional standard for review of an

prongs. Yet, such tips, particularly when
supplemented by independent police
investigation, frequently contribute to
the solution of otherwise perfect crimes.
While a conscientious assessment of the
basis for crediting such tips is required
by the Fourth Amendment, a standard
that leaves virtually no place for
anonymous citizen informants is not.
For all these reasons, we conclude that it
is wiser to abandon the two-pronged test
established by our decisions in Aguilar
and Spinelli. In its place we reaffirm the
totality of the circumstances analysis
that traditionally has informed probable
cause determinations. The task of the
issuing magistrate is simply to make a
practical, commonsense decision
whether, given all the circumstances set
forth in the affidavit before him,
including the veracity and hasis of
knowledge of persons supplying hearsay
information, there is a fair probability
that contraband or evidence of a crime
will be found in a particular place. And
the duty of a reviewing court is simply to
ensure that the magistrate had a
substantial basis for concluding
that probable cause existed....
Our earlier cases illustrate the limits
beyond which a magistrate may not
venture in issuing a warrant. A sworn
statement of an affiant that he has cause
to suspect and does believe that liquor
illegally brought into the United States is
located on certain premises will not do.
An affidavit must provide the magistrate
with a substantial basis for determining
the existence of probable cause, and the
wholly conclusory statement at issue in
Nathanson failed to meet this
requirement. An officer's statement that
affiants have received reliable
information from a credible person and
believe that heroin is stored in a home, is
likewise inadequate. As in Nathanson,
this is a mere conclusory statement that
gives the magistrate virtually no basis at
all for making a judgment regarding
probable cause. Sufficient information
must be presented to the magistrate to
allow that official to determine probable
cause; his action cannot be a mere
ratification of the bare conclusions of
others. In order to ensure that such an
abdication of the magistrate's duty does
not occur, court must continue to
conscientiously review the sufficiency of
affidavits on which warrants are issued.

requirement".
Magistrate/ Judicial Officer
In Shadwick v City of Tampa (407 US 345-1972), the
sole question was whether the clerks of the municipal committee,
who, by law, had authority to issue arrest warrants, qualified as
neutral and detached magistrates for purposes of the Fourth
Amendment. The Supreme Court held, that they did, and the
warrant was not unconstitutional.
Justice Powell delivering the opinion of the Court said:
"In some cases, the term judicial officer
to have been used
appears
interchangeably with that of magistrate.
In others, it was intended simply to
underscore the now accepted fact that
someone independent of the police and
the prosecution must determine probable
cause. The very term judicial officer
implies, of course, some connection with
the judicial branch. But it has never been
held that only a lawyer or judge could
grant a warrant regardless of the court
system or the type of warrant involved.
The substance of the Constitution's
warrant requirements does not tum on
the labeling of the issuing party. The
warrant traditionally has represented an
independent assurance that a search and
arrest will not proceed without probable
cause to believe that a crime has been
committed and that the person or place
named in the warrant is involved in the
crime. Thus, an issuing magistrate must
meet two tests. He must be neutral and
detached, and he must be capable of
determining whether probable cause
exists for the requested arrest or search".
In Connelly v Georgia (429 US 245), the Supreme Court
was unanimous in holding that a magistrate who was paid if he
issued a warrant and nothing if he denied an application was not
neutral and detached.
Warrantless arrests:
We have seen that the cases establish that generally
warrants are necessary to search for property and to seize it. It
seems to follow that to search and seize a person (that is, to arrest
him) would a fortiori require a warrant; this however is not the law
of the United States.
The Fourth Amendment, it will be noted, does not use
the word "arrest", but it uses the expressions "unreasonable
searches and seizures" and the "persons or things to be seized", and
"there is no doubt that by the reference to the seizures of the
persons, the Fourth Amendment was intended to be applied to
arrests". (Justice Marshall in his dissenting opinion in Watson, 423
US 411). As was said in Terry (392 US 1), "It is quite plain that the
Fourth Amendment governs seizures of the persons arrests in
traditional terminology".
In US v Watson (423 US 411), the relevant events began
when an informant, one K, telephoned a postal inspector informing
64
65

Page 51
him that the respondent. Watson, was in possession of a stolen
credit card and had asked K to cooperate in using the card to their
mutual advantage. Later that day. K delivered the card to the
inspector. On learning that Watson had agreed to furnish additional
cards, the inspector asked K to arrange to meet with Watson. K met
with Watson at a designated restaurant, K was to give a designated
signal if Watson had additional stolen credit cards. The signal was
given and Watson was arrested. A search of Watson's person
revealed credit cards and this led to the search of Watson's car with
Watson's consent. Using the keys furnished by Watson the
inspector found two credit cards in the names of other persons
under the floor mat in an envelope.
Watson moved to suppress the cards claiming that his
arrest was illegal for want of probable cause and an arrest warrant.
Contrary to the Court of Appeals" view the Supreme
Court held that Watson's arrest was not invalid, and his arrest did
not violate the Fourth Amendment. In that connection reference
was made to Title 18,S.3061(a)(3), which expressly empowered the
Board of Governors of the Postal Service to authorize postal
service officers and employees to make arrests under the laws of
the United States. The Supreme Court held:
"Section 3061 represents a judgment by Congress that it
is not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment for
postal inspectors to arrest without a warrant provided
they had probable cause to do so. This was not an
isolated or quixotic judgment of the legislative
branch. Moreover there is nothing in the court's
prior cases indicating that under the Fourth Amendment
a warrant is required to make a valid arrest for a felony.
Indeed the relevant prior decisions are uniformly to the
contrary:
The usual rule is that a police officer
may arrest without warrant one believed
by the officer upon reasonable cause to
66
have been guilty of a felony...."
(Carroll v US. 267 US 132).
"The cases construing the Fourth
Amendment thus reflect the ancient
common law rule that a police officer
was permitted to arrest without a warrant
for a misdemeanor or felony committed
in his presence as well as for a felony
not committed in his presence if there
was reasonable ground for making the
arrest
Justice Powell, concurring, observed:
Today's decision is the first
square holding that the Fourth
Amendment permits a duly authorized
law enforcement officer to make a
warrantless arrest in a public place even
though he had adequate opportunity to
procure a warrant after developing
probable cause for arrest".
In Gerstein v Pugh (420 US 103-1975), the Supreme
Court held that after a warrantless arrest is effected the arrestee is
entitled to a prompt screening by a magistrate, that is the probable
cause hearing, but the screening process need not provide the
adversary safeguards associated with the trial.
In County of Riverside v Mclaughin (1991) 111 Sct.
1661) the Court considered how prompt the probable cause hearing
must be:
"Taking into account the competing
interests articulated in Gerstein, we
believe that a jurisdiction that provides
judicial determination of probable cause
67
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 52
Arrest in the home:
within 48 hours of arrest will, as a
general matter, comply with the
promptness requirement of Gerstein....".
The question whether a warrant was necessary to enter a
home to make an arrest was left open in Watson and Gerstein. This
question was answered in Payton (455 US 573 (1980). Justice
Stevens' majority opinion emphasized that the house has always
been viewed as an especially private place, set forth a history that
indicated there were doubts at common law concerning authority to
invade a home to make an arrest and concluded that "the Fourth
Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house" and
that "absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not
reasonably be crossed without a warrant":
"If there is sufficient evidence of a
citizen's participation in a felony to
persuade a judicial officer that his arrest
is justified, it is constitutionally
reasonable to require him to open his
doors to the officers of law. Thus for
Fourth Amendment purposes, an arrest
warrant founded on probable cause
implicitly carries with it the limited
authority to enter a dwelling in which
the suspect lives when there is reason to
believe the suspect is within".
The concept of exigent circumstance:
In Justice Brennan's opinion in Welsh (466 US 740
(1984), the importance of protecting the home from warrantless
intrusions was reiterated and it was stated that exigent
circumstances must be narrowly construed when the home is the
target of police conduct. "Courts have permitted warrantless home
arrest for major felonies if identifiable exigencies, independent of
68
the gravity of the offence, existed at the time of arrest...... We
noted that it is difficult to conceive of a warrantless home arrest
that would not be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment when
the underlying offence is extremely minor".
Stop and Frisk:
In Terry v Ohio (392 US 1), serious questions
concerning the role of the Fourth Amendment in the confrontation
on the street between the citizens and the policemen investigating
suspicious circumstances arose.
Terry and Chilton were found on the street in a
marketplace in suspicious circumstances. They attracted the
attention of an experienced policeman who testified that he took up
a post of observation 300 to 400 feet away from the two men. He
became thoroughly suspicious and considered his duty to
investigate further. He feared that the suspects might have a gun.
Accordingly the policeman approached the suspects, identified
himself as a police officer and asked for their names. When the
suspects mumbled something, the police officer grabbed Terry,
spun him around and patted down the outside of his clothing. (This
is called frisk i.e. feeling the outer clothing of the suspect to detect
the possible presence of a weapon) and felt a pistol in the pocket of
Terry's overcoat. The policeman removed the pistol and discovered
another revolver in Chilton's pocket. They were formally charged
with carrying concealed weapons.
On a motion to suppress the guns, it was held that the
guns were properly admitted in evidence. Chief Justice Warren
delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court said:
"When an officer is justified in believing
that the individual whose suspicious
behaviour he is investigating at close
range is armed and presents danger to
the officer and others, it would be clearly
unreasonable to deny the officer the
69
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 53
power to take necessary measures to
determine whether the person is in fact
carrying a weapon and to neutralize the
threat of physical harm".
Justice Douglas in his dissent, referred to Brinegar (338
US 160, 175) where it was held that:
dealing
with
probable
"In
cause as the very name implies,
.....we deal with probabilities. These are
not technical, they are factual and
practical and considerations of every day
life on which reasonable men, not legal
technicians, act"
Thus in Terry, the Supreme Court recognized that "a police officer
may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner
approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal
behaviour even though there is no probable cause to make an
arrest".
Search incident to valid arrest:
A warrantless search incident to a valid, lawful, arrest
was an accepted practice at the time the Bill of Rights was passed.
The practice is still well accepted and it was recognized in Chimel
v California (395 US 752, 23 L Ed 2d 685). Justice Stewart in
delivering the opinion of the Court said:
"When an arrest is made, it is reasonable
for the arresting officer to search the
person arrested in order to remove any
weapons that the latter might seek to use
in order to resist arrest or affect his
escape. Otherwise, the officer's safety
might well be endangered and the arrest
itself frustrated. In addition, it is entirely
70
reasonable for the arresting officer to
search for and seize any evidence on the
arrestee's person in order to prevent its
concealment or destruction. And the area
into which an arrestee might reach in
order to grab a weapon or evidentiary
items must, of course, be governed by a
like rule. A gun on a table or in a drawer
in front of one who is arrested can be as
dangerous as one concealed in the
clothing of the person arrested. There is
ample justification, therefore, for a
search of the arrestee's person and the
area within his immediate control
construing that phrase to mean the area
from within which he might gain
possession of a weapon or destructible
evidence.......
In US v Robinson (414 US 218). Justice Rehnquist
delivering the opinion of the Court observed:
Consent Searches:
"It is the fact of the lawful arrest which
establishes the authority to search, and
we hold that in the case of a lawful
custodial arrest a full search of the
person is not only an exception to the
warrant requirement but is also a
reasonable search under the Fourth
Amendment".
A search based upon valid consent is reasonable even in
the absence of a warrant or any suspicion. In the leading case.
Schneckloth (412 US 218), Justice Stewart held that the proper test
in consent searches is not whether there was a waiver of the
defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, but whether the consent
71
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 54
was voluntary under the totality of circumstances. A search upon
voluntary consent is thus a reasonable search in compliance with
the Fourth Amendment.
There were powerful dissents. But the learned authors of
the "American Criminal Procedure" 4" ed. p. 332, have an
interesting and if we may say, persuasive comment, to make. It is
that when the government seeks to invade the privacy of a person,
even if the government asks permission the person asked may take
the most polite request by a government official, especially a police
officer, to be equivalent to an order, or at a minimum, a prelude to
the coercive search that surely would take place if permission is
refused.
Search and seizure-what they entail:
In Horton v California (496 US 128), Justice Stevens
delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court said:
"The right to security in person and
property protected by the Fourth
Amendment may be invaded in quite
different ways by searches and seizures.
A search compromises the individual's
privacy; a seizure deprives the individual
of dominion over his person or
property".
In Mincey (437 US 385). Justice Stewart expressed.
what the Fourth Amendment means, as follows:
"Moreover, the mere fact that law.
enforcement may be made more efficient
can never by itself justify disregard of
the Fourth Amendment. The
investigation of crimes could always be
simplified if warrants were unnecessary.
But the Fourth Amendment reflects the
72
view of those who wrote the Bill of
Rights that the privacy of a person's
home and property may not be totally
sacrificed in the name of maximum
simplicity in enforcement of criminal
law".
Chapter 3
Privilege against Self-incrimination - Fifth Amendment:
The Fifth Amendment reads:
"No person shall be compelled in any
criminal case to be a witness against
himself".
The constitutional foundation, so observed Chief Justice Earl
Warren in that famous case, Miranda v Arizona (384 US 436: 16 L
Ed 2d 694), underlying the privilege against self-incrimination is
the respect a government state or federal must accord to the
dignity and integrity of the citizens. To maintain a fair state-
individual balance, to require the government shoulder the entire
load to respect the inviolability of the human personality our
accusatory system of criminal justice demands that the government
seeking to punish an individual produce the evidence against him
by its own independent labors, rather than by the cruel, simple
expedient of compelling it from his own mouth....".
Historical background:
In a system of criminal justice based on accusation, not
inquisition, a person is innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt. The State has, therefore, not only the duty but
also a right to investigate and present evidence to the court, even
though interrogation and torture of the suspect would be clearly
more efficient. An outstanding illustration of the use of
inquisitional tactics to obtain confessions during the struggle for
the right against self-incrimination is the case of John Lilburne, a
73
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 55
twenty-three-year-old clothier's apprentice, imprisoned for
shipping seditious books into England in 1637. He refused to
answer questions, and when called before the Star Chambers,
Lilburne's refusal to take its oath began his twenty-year battle for
liberty against the tyrannies of the King, Parliament and
Cromwell's military dictatorship. His struggle culminated in the
recognition of the right against self-incrimination and in 1641, the
abolition of the Star Chamber and its ecclesiastical counterpart, the
High Commission.
The Star Chamber's oath required the accused to swear
on the Bible that he would truthfully answer all questions without
knowing why they were asked and without knowing the charges
against him. After 1611, if anyone refused to take the oath he could
be found in contempt of court and sent to prison until he agreed to
swear the oath and answer questions. Even if he did not take the
oath, under another rule, the judge was allowed to convict the
accused anyway, as if he had confessed to the crime. Ever since
Henry VIII had made himself head of the Church as well as the
State one hundred years earlier, the crime of heresy had merged
with treason and religious persecution had steadily increased.
Hundred of Catholics, Puritans, and Quakers had been tortured,
imprisoned, buried or executed for refusing to swear the oath and
accuse themselves of crimes against the State. They drew.
inspiration from the trial of Jesus who, when brought before
Pontius Pilate and interrogated, refused to answer.
Being forced to answer questions under oath violated not
only the sanctity of conscience and the teachings of Jesus, but it
also presented persons who took the oath with an excruciating
choice. If they lied about their religious beliefs, they faced eternal
damnation; if they told the truth, they faced execution. (These are
excerpts from the book "In Our Defence" by Ellen Alderman and
Caroline Kennedy, pp 169-171).
This is briefly the history of the right to remain silent,
described as "one of the great landmarks in man's struggle to make
himself civilized", and "the essential mainstay of our adversary
system",
Relationship between Fourth and Fifth Amendments:
There is, it was said in Boyd v US (116 US 616-1886).
an intimate relation between the two Amendments:
"They throw great light on each other.
for the unreasonable searches and
seizures, condemned in the Fourth
Amendment, are almost always made for
the purpose of compelling man to give
evidence against himself, which in
criminal cases is condemned in the Fifth
Amendment, and compelling a man in a
criminal case to be a witness against
himself which is condemned in the Fifth
Amendment throws light on the question
as to what is an "unreasonable search
and seizure" within the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment. And we have been
unable to perceive that the seizure of a
man's private books and papers to be
used in evidence against him is
substantially different from compelling
him to be witness against himself. We
think it is within the clear intent and
meaning of those terms. And we are
further of the opinion that a compulsory
production of the private books and
papers of the owner of the goods sought
to be forfeited in such a suit is
compelling him to be a witness against
himself within the meaning of the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution and is
the equivalent of a search and seizure-
and an unreasonable search and seizure-
74
75

Page 56
within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment".
Thus, the US Supreme Court has consistently given the privilege
against self-incrimination a very broad interpretation holding that it
"not only protects the individual against being involuntarily called
as a witness against himself in a criminal prosecution but also
privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any
other proceedings, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the
answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings",
Police Interrogation and Confessions:
The Supreme Court of the United States did not apply
the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination to the
proceedings in the police station and other in-custody questioning
until its 1966 decision in Miranda v Arizona. Thus, Wigmore, a
leading American authority on Evidence, reflected the law
prevailing at the time when in 1940 he wrote that a confession was
not inadmissible because of "any illegality in the method of
obtaining it" or "because of any connection with the privilege
against self-incrimination".
In the first confession case under the Fourteenth
Amendment Due Process Clause (that clause, in its relevant part,
provides that "No state shall.......deprive any person of life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law.....") namely,
Brown v Mississippi, (297 US 278 1936) where the Deputy
Sheriff who had presided over the beating of the defendants
conceded that one of the defendants had been whipped, "but not
too much for a negro", the Supreme Court summarily reversed the
conviction holding that the confession was involuntary and violated
the basic due process rights.
While Brown was a case of physical coercion, Payne v
Arkansas (356 US 560, (1958)) was a case of denial of food and
Ashcraft (322 US 143) was a case of denial of sleep for thirty six
hours, in which confessions were excluded.
76
Ashcraft illustrates how the rationale for excluding
confessions was changing. It has been said to be a great case only
because of Justice Jackson's dissent. There was good reason to
think that Ashcraft was guilty of the murder of his wife. In
excluding the confession, Justice Black, speaking for the Court
held that "if Ashcraft made a confession it was not voluntary but
compelled":
"We think that a situation such as that
here shown by uncontradicted evidence
is so inherently coercive that its very
existence is irreconcilable with the
possession of mental freedom by a lone
suspect against whom its full coercive
force is brought to bear. It is
inconceivable that any court of justice in
the land, conducted as our courts are,
open to the public, would permit
prosecutors serving in relays to keep a
defendant witness under continuous
cross examination for thirty six hours
without rest or sleep in an effort to
extract a 'voluntary' confession. Nor can
we, consistently with constitutional due
process of law. hold voluntary a
confession where prosecutors do the
same thing away from the restraining
influences of a public trial in an open
court room.
The Constitution of United States stands
as a bar against the conviction of any
individual in an American Court by
means of a coerced confession. There
have been, and now are, certain foreign
nations with govemments dedicated to
an opposite policy: governments which

America will not have that kind of
government".
them
Justice Jackson, with whom Justice Roberts and Justice Frankfurter
joined in his dissent, said:
on
"As we read the present decision the
Court in effect departs from well-
established principles. Instead, it: (1)
substitutes for determination
conflicting evidence the question
whether the confession was actually
produced by coercion, a presumption
that it was, on a new doctrine that
examination in custody of this duration
is inherently coercive; (2) it makes that
presumption irrebuttable - i.e., a rule of
law because, while it goes back of the
State decisions to find certain facts, it
refuses to resolve conflicts in evidence.
to determine whether other of the State's
proof is sufficient to overcome such
presumption; and, in so doing, (3) it sets
aside the findings by the courts of
Tennessee that on all the facts this
confession did not result from coercion,
either giving those findings no weight or
regarding them as immaterial. ***
The burden of protecting society from
most crimes against persons and
property falls upon the state. Different
states have different crime problems and
some freedom to vary procedures
according to their own ideas. Here, a
state was forced by an unwitnessed and
baffling murder to vindicate its law and
protect its society. To nullify its
conviction in this particular case upon a
consideration of all the facts would be a
delicate exercise of federal judicial
power. But to go beyond this, as the
Court does today, and divine in the due
process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment an exclusion of confessions
on an irrebuttable presumption that
custody and examination are inherently
coercive if of some unspecified duration
within thirty-six hours, requires us to
make more than a passing expression of
our doubts and disagreements.**
This Court never yet has held that the
Constitution denies a State the right to
use a confession just because the
confessor was questioned in custody
where it did not also find other
circumstances that deprived him of a
free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse
to answer. The Constitution requires that
a conviction rest on a fair trial. Forced
confessions are ruled out of a fair trial.
They are ruled out because they have
been wrung from a prisoner by measures
which are offensive to concepts of
fundamental faimess. Different courts
have used different terms to express the
78
79
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 58
test by which to judge the inadmissibility
of a confession, such as forced, coerced,
involuntary, extorted, loss of freedom of
will. But always where we have
professed to speak with the voice of the
due process clause, the test, in whatever
words stated, has been applied to the
particular confessor at the time of
confession.
It is for this reason that American courts
hold almost universally and very
properly that a confession obtained
during or shortly after the confessor has
been subjected to brutality, torture,
beating, starvation, or physical pain of
any kind is prima facie involuntary. The
effect of threats alone may depend more
on individual susceptibility to fear. But
men are so constituted that Imany will
risk the postponed consequences of
yielding to a demand for a confession in
order to be rid of present or imminent
physical suffering. Actual or threatened
violence have no place in eliciting truth
and it is fair to assume that no officer of
the law will resort to cruelty if truth is
what he is seeking. We need not be too
exacting about proof of the effects of
such violence on the individual involved,
for their effect on the human personality
is invariably and seriously demoralizing.
When, however, we consider a
confession obtained by questioning.
even if persistent and prolonged, we are
in a different field. Interrogation per se is
not, while violence per se is, an outlaw.
80
Questioning is an indispensable
instrumentality of justice. It may be
abused, of course, as cross-examination
in court may be abused, but the
principles by which we may adjudge
when it passes constitutional limits are
quite different from those that condemn
police brutality, and are far more
difficult to apply. And they call for a
more responsible and cautious exercise
of our office. For we may err on the side
of hostility to violence without doing
injury to legitimate prosecution of crime;
we cannot read an undiscriminating
hostility to mere interrogation into the
Constitution without unduly fettering the
States in protecting society from the
criminal.
It probably is the normal instinct to deny
and conceal any shameful or guilty act.
Even a voluntary confession is not likely
to be the product of the same motives
with which onc may volunteer
information that does not incriminate or
concern him. The term voluntary
confession does not mean voluntary in
the sense of a confession to a priest
merely to rid one's soul of a sense of
guilt. Voluntary confessions in criminal
law are the product of calculations of a
different order, and usually proceed from
a belief that further denial is useless and
perhaps prejudicial. To speak of any
confessions of crime made after arrest as
being voluntary or uncoerced is
although
somewhat
traditional.
81
inaccurate,
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 59
A confession is wholly and incontestably
voluntary only if a guilty person gives
himself up to the law and becomes his
own accuser. The Court bases its
decision on the premise that custody and
examination of a prisoner for thirty-six
hours is inherently coercive. Of course it
is. And so is custody and examination
for one hour. Arrest itself is inherently
coercive, and so is detention. When not
justified, infliction of such indignities
upon the person is actionable as a tort.
Of course such acts put pressure upon
the prisoner to answer questions, to
answer them truthfully, and to confess if
guilty.
But does the Constitution prohibit use of
all confessions made after arrest because
questioning, while one is deprived of
freedom, is inherently coercive? The
Court does not quite say so, but it is
moving far and fast in that direction. The
step it now takes is to hold this
confession inadmissible because of the
time taken in getting it.
The duration and intensity of an
examination or inquisition always have
been regarded as one of the relevant and
important considerations in estimating
its effect on the will of the individual
involved. Thirty-six hours is a long
stretch of questioning. That the inquiry
was prolonged and persistent is a factor
that in any calculation of its effect on
Ashcraft would count heavily against the
82
confession. But
some men would
withstand for days pressures that would
destroy the will of another in hours.
Always heretofore the ultimate question
has been whether the confessor was in
possession of his own will and self-
control at the time of confession. For its
bearing on this question the Court
always has considered the confessor's

If the constitutional admissibility of a
confession is no longer to be measured
by the mental state of the individual
confessor but by a general doctrine
dependent on the clock, it should be
capable of statement in definite terms. If
thirty-six hours is more than is
permissible, what about 24? or 12? or 6?
or 1? All are inherently coercive. Of
course questions of law like this often
turn on matters of degree. But are not the
states entitled to know, if this Court is
able to state, what the considerations are
which make any particular degree
decisive? How else may state courts
apply our tests?
Apart from Ashcraft's uncorroborated
testimony, which the Tennessee courts
refused to believe, there is much
evidence in this record from persons
whom they did believe and were
justified in believing. This evidence
shows that despite the inherent
83

coerciveness of the circumstances of his
examination, the confession when made
was deliberate, free, and voluntary in the
sense in which that term is used in
criminal law. This Court could not, in
our opinion, hold this confession un
involuntary one except by substituting
its presumption in place of analysis of
the evidence and refusing to weigh the
evidence even in rebuttal of its
presumption"..
In Watts v Indiana (338 US 49; 93 L. Ed 1801 (1949),
until his inclupatory statements were secured, the petitioner was a
prisoner in the exclusive control of the prosecuting authorities. He
was kept for the first two days in solitary confinement in a cell
aptly enough called 'the hole in view of its physical conditions.
Apart from the five night sessions the police intermittently
interrogated him during the day. During the entire period of
interrogation, he was without friendly or professional aid and
without advice as to his constitutional rights. To all this was added
the disregard of rudimentary needs of life-opportunities for sleep
and a decent allowance of food. Justice Frankfurter said:
"A confession by which life becomes
forfeit must be the expression of free
choice... A confession to be voluntary
need not be volunteered. But if it is the
product of sustained pressure by the
police it does not issue from a free
choice.... To turn the detention of an
accused into the process of wrenching
from him evidence.....is so grave an
abuse of power of arrest as to offend the
procedural standards of due process......
This is so because it violates the
underlying principle in our enforcement
of the criminal law. Ours is the
accusatorial as opposed to inquisitorial
system. Such has been the characteristic
of Anglo-American criminal justice
since it freed itself from practices
borrowed by the Star Chamber from the
Continent whereby an accused was
interrogated in secret for hours on end.
Under our system society carries the
burden of proving its charge against the
accused not out of his mouth. It must
establish its case, not by interrogating
the accused even under the judicial
safeguards, but by evidence
independently secured through skillful
investigation. The requirement of
specific charges, their proof beyond a
reasonable doubt, the protection of the
from confessions extorted
accused.
through
whatever form of police
pressures, the right to a prompt hearing
before a magistrate, the right to
assistance of counsel, to be supplied by
government when circumstances make it
necessary, the duty to advise an accused
of his constitutional rights - these are all
characteristics of the accusatorial system
and manifestations of its demands.
Protracted, systematic and uncontrolled
subjection of an accused to interrogation
by the police for the purpose of eliciting
disclosures or confessions is subversive
of the accusatorial system. It is the
inquisitorial system without its
safeguards.....
We are deeply mindful of the anguishing
problems which the incidence of crime
presents to the State. But the history of

the criminal law proves overwhelmingly
that brutal methods of law enforcement
are essentially self-defeating.....
Law triumphs when the natural impulses
aroused by a shocking crime yield to the
safeguards which our civilization has
evolved for an administration of justice
at once rational and effective".
Justice Jackson again wrote a dissent. He posed the question that
"if ultimate quest in a criminal trial is the truth and if the
circumstances indicate no violence or threats of it, should society
be deprived of the suspect's help in solving a crime merely because
he was confined and questioned when uncounseled? and observed:
"We must not overlook that in these as
in some other previous cases, once a
confession is obtained it supplies ways
of verifying its trustworthiness. In these
cases before us the verification is
sufficient to leave one in no doubt that
the admissions of guilt were genuine and
truthful. Such corroboration consists in
one case of finding a weapon where the
accused said he hid it, and in others that
conditions which could only have been
known to one who was implicated
correspond with his story. It is possible.
but it is rare, that a confession, if
repudiated on the trial, standing alone
will convict unless there is extemal
proof of its verity.
I suppose no one would doubt that our
constitution and Bill of Rights, grounded
in revolt against the arbitrary measures
of George III and in the philosophy of
the French Revolution, represent the
86
maximum restrictions upon the power of
organized societly over the individual
that are compatible with the maintenance
of organized society itself. They were so
intended and should be
interpreted...
In Massiah v US (377 US 201: 12 L Ed 2d 246), M was
indicted for conspiracy to posses narcotics aboard a US vessel. He
retained a lawyer, pleaded not guilty and was released on bail. C, a
co-defendant, also retained a lawyer, pleaded not guilty and was
released on bail. C then invited M to discuss the pending case in
C's car, parked in a city street. Unknown to M. C had become a
police agent. A radio transistor was installed under the front seat of
C's car, enabling a nearby federal agent who was equipped with a
recording device to overhear their conversation. As expected, M
was convicted of several narcotic offences. The Court referred to
Spano (360 US 315), where the Court noted that "during perhaps
the most critical period of the proceedings, that is to say, from the
time of their arraignment until the beginning of their trial, when
consultation, thorough going investigation and preparation are
vitally important, and pointed out that under our system of justice
the most elemental concepts of due process of law contemplate that
an indictment be followed by a trial, in an orderly court-room.

the procedural safeguards of the law". The Court held -
"that the petitioner was denied the basic
protections of that (Sixth Amendment)

him at his trial evidence of his own
incriminating words, which federal
agents had deliberately elicited from him
after he had been indicted and in the

Right to counsel-Sixth Amendment
The Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution provides
"in all criminal prosecutions, the accused
shall enjoy the right to have the
assistance of counsel for his defence".
It is helpful, so observe the learned authors of "The
Criminal Procedure and the Constitution" (1994 ed. p 232, 234).
"to view criminal procedural due process as containing two major
values or objectives. The first and the more obvious one is insuring
the reliability of the guilt-determining process. The second and the
more elusive one is insuring respect for the dignity or liberty of the
individual without regard to the reliability of criminal process. The
exclusionary rule implements the second goal; the right to counsel
(sometimes called the most pervasive right of the uccused or the
master-key to all rights) effectuates the first and the most basic
goal". In Johnson v Zerbst (304 US 458) Justice Black called the
right to counsel "one of the safeguards......deemed necessary to
insure fundamental rights of life and liberty" and the Sixth
Amendment "a constant admonition that if the constitutional
safeguards it provides be lost, justice will not still be done". The
Sixth Amendment, it was concluded, embodies the obvious truth
88
that the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill
to protect himself when brought before a tribunal.
Right to hearing Includes right to be heard by Counsel
Powell v Alabama (287 US 45-1932) has been called
the first modern procedural due process case; it establishes the
essential relationship between "the right to be heard" and "the right
to be heard by counsel.
The petitioners were negroes charged with the crime of
rape, committed upon the persons of two white girls. The
punishment for the offence was from ten years imprisonment to
death. The trial was completed within a single day in an
atmosphere of tense, hostile and excited public sentiment, and until
the very morning of the trial no lawyer had been named or
definitely designated to represent the petitioners; prior to the
calling of the case for trial, a leading member of the local bar
agreed to be employed to help the prosecution. The petitioners.
young, ignorant, illiterate, surrounded by hostile sentiment,
charged with an atrocious crime regarded with especial horror in
the community were thus put in peril of their lives within a few
moments after counsel for the first time charged with any degree of
responsibility began to represent them.
The question before the Supreme Court was "whether
the denial of the assistance of counsel contravenes the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution"?
Justice Sutherland spoke eloquently for the Court as follows:
"It is hardly necessary to say that, the
right to counsel being conceded, a
defendant should be afforded a fair
opportunity to secure counsel of his own
choice."
After discussing the historical development of the right to counsel
in England and colonies, Justice Sutherland said:

whether the settled usages and moxles of

would be, in many cases, of little avail if
it did not comprehend the right to be
heard by counsel. Even the intelligent
and educated layman has small and
sometime no skill in the science of law.
If charged with crime, he is incapable,
generally, of determining for himself
whether the indictment is good or bad.
He is unfamiliar with the rules of
evidence. Left without the aid of
counsel, he may be put on trial without a
proper charge, and convicted upon
incompetent evidence, or evidence
irrelevant to the issue or otherwise
inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and
knowledge adequately to prepare his
defence, even though he has a perfect
one. He requires the guiding hand of
counsel at every step in the proceedings
against him...if in any case, civil
or criminal, a state or federal court were
arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by
counsel, employed by and appearing for
him, it reasonably may not be doubted
that such a refusal would be a denial of a
hearing and, therefore, of due process in
the constitutional sense.
........All that is necessary now to decide.
and we do decide, is that in a capital
case, where the defendant is unable to
employ counsel, and is incapable
adequately of making his own defence
because of ignorance, feeble
mindedness, illiteracy or the like, it is
the duty of the court, whether requested
or not, to assign counsel for him as a
necessary requisite of due process of
law.......
In Gideon v Wainwright (372 US 335, 9 L Ed 2d 799
(1963), described as one of the most popular cases ever decided by
the Supreme Court, the petitioner was charged with a felony of
having broken and entered a poolroom. Appearing in court without
funds and without a lawyer, he asked the court to appoint counsel
for him, but the trial court refused saying that under the law, "the
only time the court can appoint counsel to represent a defendant is
when that person is charged with a capital offence". Put to trial
before a jury, Gideon conducted his defence about as well as he
could. The jury retumed a verdict of guilty, and the petitioner was
sentenced to five years in prison. Justice Black, delivering the
opinion of the Court, wrote:
90

Page 64
"Not only these precedents but also
reason and reflection require us to
recognize that in our adversary system of
criminal justice, any person haled into
court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer,
cannot be assured a fair trial unless
counsel is provided for him. This seems
to us to be an abvious truth.
Governments, both state and federal,
quite properly spend vast sums of money
to establish machinery to try defendants
accused of crime. Lawyers to prosecute
are everywhere deemed essential to
protect the public's interest in an orderly
society. Similarly, there are few
defendants charged with crime, few
indeed, who fail to hire the best lawyers
they can get to prepare and present their
defence. That govemments hire lawyers
to prosecute and defendants who have
the money hire lawyers to defend are the
strongest indications of the widespread
belief that lawyers in criminal courts are
necessities, not luxuries. The right of one
charged with crime to counsel may not
be deemed fundamental and essential to
fair trials in some countries, but it is in
ours. From the very beginning, our state
and national constitutions and laws have
laid great emphasis on procedural and
substantive safeguards designed to
assure fair trials before impartial
tribunals in which every defendant
stands equal before the law. This noble
ideal cannot be realized if the poor man
charged with crime has to face his
accusers without a lawyer to assist him".
Justice Harlan, concurring, observed that-
"The Constitution makes no distinction between capital
and non-capital cases.......

by a sentence of up to one year in jail, and in Griffin (351 US 12), a
case in which the defendant needed trial transcripts for appeal
purposes, but was denied because he could not pay, Justice Black
said:
"There can be no equal justice where the
kind of trial a man gets depends on the
amount of money he has.......
Criminal Prosecution begins at Investigation Stage
In Escobedo v Illinois (378 US 478: 12 L Ed 2d 977
(1964), it was held that "criminal prosecution" within the meaning
of Sixth Amendment begins not with the trial, the indictment, or
even the preliminary examination before a magistrate but as soon
as an investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved
crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect.
On confessions, the following excerpt from Escobedo
reveal the heart of the problem that had always plagued the courts:
"We have leamed the lesson from
history, ancient and modern, that a
system of criminal law enforcement
which comes to depend on the
"confession' will, in the long run, be less
reliable and more subject to abuses than
a system which depends on extrinsic
evidence independently secured through
skillful investigation. We have also
learned the companion lesson of history
that no system of criminal justice can or

should survive if it comes to depend for
its continued effectiveness on the
citizens abdication
through
unawareness of their constitutional
rights. No system worth preserving
should have to fear that if an accused is
permitted to consult with lawyers, he
will become aware of, and exercise these
rights. If the exercise of constitutional
rights will thwart the effectiveness of a
system of law enforcement, then there is
something very wrong with that system".
What is Compulsion
Use of the contempt power is the classic form of
compulsion, since it imposes substantial punishment on the witness
(e.g. when the accused opts to give evidence on oath). As we shall
see, the Supreme Court in Miranda v Arizona found compulsion in
the setting of custodial interrogation.
In Griffin v California (380 US 609), the Supreme Court
held that adverse comments to the jury by either the Judge or the
prosecutor on the defendant's election not to testify constituted
punishment for the invocation of silence and this violates the Fifth
Amendment. The fact that the defendant did not testify is,
therefore, not evidence against him.
The Privilege to silence applies to testimonial Evidence:
Schmerger v California (384 US 757) was a case in
which the offence was one of driving under the influence of
intoxicating liquor. The petitioner was compelled to give blood
sample which was found to contain a percentage of alcohol in his
blood at the time of the offence which indicated intoxication. This
evidence was sought to be excluded on ground of self-
incrimination. Justice Brennan delivering the opinion of the Court
wrote:
"We hold that the privilege protects an
accused only from being compelled to
testify against himself, or otherwise
provide the State with evidence of a
testimonial or communicative nature and
that the withdrawal of blood and the use
of the analysis in question in this case
did not involve compulsion to these
ends.
History and a long line of authorities in
lower courts have consistently limited its
protection to situations in which the
State seeks to submerge those values by
obtaining the evidence against an
accused through the cruel. simple
expedient of compelling it from his own
mouth. In sum, the privilege is
fulfilled only when the person is
guaranteed the right to remain silent
unless he chooses to speak in the
unfettered exercise of his own will.

emerged, often expressed in different
ways, is that the privilege is a bar against
communications of
compelling
testimony, but that compulsion which
makes a suspect or accused the source of
real or physical evidence does not
violate it.

a distinction is not readily drawn. Some

In US v Wade (388 U 218), the defendant was arrested for robbing
a bank and a counsel was appointed to represent him. Fifteen days
later, an FBI agent, without notice to Wade's lawyer, arranged to
have two bank employees observe a line-up made up of Wade
and five or six other prisoners and conducted in the local county
courthouse. Each person in the line wore strips of tape such as
allegedly worn by the robber at the time of the robbery and upon
direction each said something like 'put the money in the bag", the
words allegedly uttered by the robber. The bank employees:
identified Wade in the line-up as the bank robber, and at the trial,
when asked on direct examination if the robber was in the
courtroom, pointed to Wade. The court held that "Neither the line-
up nor anything shown by this record that Wade was required to do
in the line-up violated his privilege against self-incrimination". On
the question, whether the denial of Wade's motion to strike the
courtroom identification by the bank witnesses at trial because of
the absence of his counsel at the line-up, the conviction was set
aside and the case was remanded.
Miranda Warnings:
In the field of the rights of the suspects, no case is as
famous as Miranda v Arizona (386 US 936; 16 L. Ed 24 694 -
1966). Chief Justice Earl Warren's opinion in that case has been
regarded by some as the most far-reaching opinion "to have
impacted criminal justice in the last four decades". Indeed,
Miranda has its critics who argue that "the decision puts police
agencies in the uncomfortable and contradictory position of not
only enforcing the law, hut also of having to offer defendants
advice on how potentially to circumvent conviction and
punishment". However that may be. Miranda warnings are, so to
say, now part of the American legal culture. To ensure that proper
advice is given to suspects at the time of their arrest, the now-
famous Miranda rights are read before any questioning by police
begins. These rights appear on a Miranda warning card now
commonly used by police agencies. Once suspects have been
advised of their Miranda rights, they are commonly asked to sign a
paper which lists each right in order to confirm that they were
advised of their rights, and that they understood each right.
Questioning may then begin, but only if suspects waive their rights
not to talk or to have a lawyer present during interrogation.
The opinion of the Court delivered by Chief Justice Earl
Warren and excerpts from some of the dissenting opinions have
been reproduced below. Suffice to say here that Miranda's was one
of the cases before the Supreme Court. He was accused of having
kidnapped and raped a young woman. At the police station, he was
identified by the victim. After being interrogated for two hours,
Miranda signed a confession which later formed the basis of his
conviction. The Supreme Court held that his conviction was
unconstitutional because "the entire aura and atmosphere of police
interrogation without notification of rights and an offer of
assistance of counsel tends to subjugate the individual to the will of
his examiner".

The right to counsel and the Privilege against self-

We have seen that the Fifth Amendment, inter alia,
guarantees that "No person shall be compelled in any
criminal case to be a witness against himself........
Its intimate connection with the Sixth Amendment right
to counsel was established in Miranda, which case may he said to
have merged self-incrimination and confession law.
Miranda v Arizona
In Miranda v Arizona, Chief Justice Earl Warren
delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:
"The cases before us raise questions which go to
the roots of our concepts of American criminal
jurisprudence: the restraints society must observe
consistent with the Federal Constitution in
prosecuting individuals for crime. More
specifically, we deal with the admissibility of
statements obtained from an individual who is
subject to custodial police interrogation and the
necessity for procedures which assure that the
individual is accorded his privilege under the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution not to be
compelled to incriminate himself.
Our holding will be spelled out with some
specificity in the pages which follow but briefly
stated it is this: the prosecution may not use
statement, whether exculpatory or inclupatory.
stemming from custodial interrogation of the
defendant unless it demonstrates the use of
procedural safeguards effective to secure the
98
privilege against self-incrimination. By custodial
interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law
enforcement officers after a person has been taken
into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom
of action in any significant way. As for the
procedural safeguards to be employed, unless other
fully effective means are devised to inform accused
persons of their right of silence and to assure a
continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following
measures are required. Prior to any questioning, the
person must be warned that he has a right to remain
silent, that any statement he does make may be
used as evidence against him, and that he has a
right to the presence of an attorney, either retained
or appointed. The defendant may waive
effectuation of these rights, provided the waiver is
made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. If.
however, he indicates in any manner and at any
stage of the process that he wishes to consult with
an attorney before speaking there can be no
questioning. Likewise, if the individual is alone and
indicates in any manner that he does not wish to be
interrogated, the police may not question him. The
mere fact that he may have answered some
questions or volunteered some statements on his
own does not deprive him of the right to refrain
from answering any further inquiries until he has
consulted with an attomey and thereafter consents
to be questioned.
The constitutional issue we decide in each of these
cases is the admissibility of statements obtained
from a defendant questioned while in custody or
otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any
significant way. In each, the defendant was
questioned by police officers, detectives, or a
prosecuting attorney in a room in which he was cut
off from the outside world. In none of these cases
99

Page 68
was the defendant given a full and effective
warning of his rights at the ontset of the
interrogation process. In all the cases, the
questioning elicited oral admissions, and in three of
them, signed statements as well which were
admitted at their trials. They all thus share salient
features incommunicado interrogation of
individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere.
resulting in self-incriminating statements without
full warnings of constitutional rights.
-
An understanding of the nature and setting of this
in-custody interrogation is essential to our
decisions today. The difficulty in depicting what
transpires at such interrogations stems from the fact
that in this country they have largely taken place
incommunicado. From extensive factual studies
undertaken in the early 1930's, including the
famous Wickersham Report to Congress by a
Presidential Commission, it is clear that police
violence and the third degree flourished at that
time.***
Again we stress that the modern practice of in-
custody interrogation is psychologically rather than
physically oriented. Interrogation still takes
place in privacy. Privacy results in secrecy and this
in turn results in a gap in our knowledge as to what
in fact goes on in the interrogation rooms. A
valuable source of information about present police
practices, however, may be found in various police
manuals and texts which document procedures
employed with success in the past, and which
recommend various other effective tactics. These
texts are used by law enforcement agencies
themselves as guides. It should be noted that these
texts professedly present the most enlightened and
effective means presently used to obtain statements
100
through custodial interrogation. By considering
these texts and other data, it is possible to describe
procedures observed and noted around the country.
To highlight the isolation and unfamiliar
surroundings, the manuals instruct the police to
display an air of confidence in the suspect's guilt
and from outward appearance to maintain only an
interest in confirming certain details. The guilt of
the subject is to be posited as a fact. The
interrogator should direct his comments toward the
reasons why the subject committed the act, rather
than court failure by asking the subject whether he
did it. Like other men, perhaps the subject has had
a bad family life, had an unhappy childhood, had
too much to drink, had an unrequited desire for
women. The officers are instructed to minimize the
moral seriousness of the offence, to cast blame on
the victim or on society. These tactics are designed
to put the subject in a psychological state where his
story is but an elaboration of what the police
purport to know already that he is guilty.
Explanations to the contrary are dismissed and
discouraged.
The texts thus stress that the major qualities an
interrogator should possess are patience and
perseverance. **
The manuals suggest that the suspect be offered
legal excuses for his actions in order to obtain an
initial admission of guilt, ***
When the techniques described above prove
unavailing, the texts recommend they be alternated
with a show of some hostility. ***
101

Page 69
The interrogators sometimes are instructed to
induce a confession out of trickery. The technique
here is quite effective in crimes which require
identification or which run in series. In the
identification situation, the interrogator may take a
break in his questioning to place the subject among
a group of men in a line-up. The witness or
complainant (previously coached, if necessary)
studies the line-up and confidently points out the
subject as the guilty party'. Then the questioning
resumes as though there were now no doubt about
the guilt of the subject. A variation on this
technique is called the reverse line-up:
"The accused is placed in a line-up but
this time he is identified by several
fictitious witnesses or victims who
associated him with different offences. It
is expected that the subject will become
desperate and confess to the offence
under investigation in order to escape
from the false accusations'.
t
Even without employing brutality, the 'third
degree or the specific stratagems described above,
the very fact of custodial interrogation exacts a
heavy toll on individual liberty and trades on the
weakness of individuals. **
In the cases before us today, given this background,
we concern ourselves primarily with this
interrogation atmosphere and the evils it can bring.
In No.759. Miranda v Arizona, the police arrested
the defendant and took him to a special
interrogation room where they secured
confession. In No.760, Vignera v New York, the
defendant made oral admissions to the police after
interrogation in the aftemoon, and then signed an
102
11
inclupatory statement upon being questioned by an
assistant district attorney later the same evening. In
No.761, Westover v United States, the defendant
was handed over to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation by local authorities after they had
detained and interrogated him for a lengthy period,
both at night and the following morning. After
some two hours of questioning, the federal officers
had obtained signed statements from the defendant.
Lastly, in No.584, California v Stewart, the local
police held the defendant five days in the station
and interrogated him on nine separate occasions
before they secured his inclupatory statement.
In these cases, we might not find the defendants"
statements to have been involuntary in traditional
terms. Our concern for adequate safeguards to
protect precious Fifth Amendment rights is, of
course, not lessened in the slightest. In each of the
cases, the defendant was thrust into an unfamiliar
atmosphere and run through menacing police
interrogation procedures. The potentiality for
compulsion is forcefully apparent, for example, in
Miranda, where the indigent Mexican defendant
was a seriously disturbed individual with
pronounced sexual fantasies, and in Stewart, in
which the defendant was an indigent Los Angeles
Negro who had dropped out of school in the Sixth
grade. To be sure, the records do not evince overt
physical coercion or patent psychological ploys.
The fact remains that in none of these cases did the
officers undertake to afford appropriate safeguards
at the outset of the interrogation to insure that the
statements were truly the product of free choice.
It is obvious that such an interrogation environment
is created for no purpose other than to subjugate the
individual to the will of his examiner. This
103

Page 70
atmosphere carries its own badge of intimidation.
To be sure, this is not physical intimidation, but it
is equally destrictive of human dignity. The
current practice of incommunicado interrogation is
at odds with one of our Nation's most cherished
principles that the individual may not be
compelled to incriminate himself. Unless adequate
protective devices are employed to dispel the
compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no.

the product of his free choice.
From the foregoing, we can readily perceive an
intimate connection between the privilege against
self-incrimination and police custodial questioning.
It is fitting to turn to history and precedent
underlying the Self-Incrimination Clause to
determine its applicability in this situation.
The Court briefly traces the roots of the Fifth
Amendment and how the privilege against self-
incrimination obtained constitutional status in the
United States.]
The question in these cases is whether the privilege
is fully applicable during a period of custodial
interrogation. We are satisfied that all the
principles embodied in the privilege apply to
informal compulsion exerted by law-enforcement
officers during in-custody questioning. An
individual swept from familiar surroundings into
police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces.
and subjected to the techniques of persuasion
described above cannot be otherwise than under
compulsion to speak. As a practical matter, the
compulsion to speak in the isolated setting of the
police station may well be greater than in courts or
other official investigations, where there are often
104
impartial observers to guard against intimidation or
trickery.
This question, in fact could have been taken as
settled in federal courts almost 70 years ago, when,
in Bram v United States, 168 US 532, 542 (1897).
this Court held:
In criminal trials, in the courts of the United
States, wherever a question arises whether a
confession is incompetent because not voluntary
the issue is controlled by that portion of the Fifth
Amendment commanding that no person
'shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a
witness against himself.".
Today, then, there can be no doubt that the Fifth
Amendment privilege is available outside of
criminal court proceedings and serves to protect
persons in all settings in which their freedom of
action is curtailed in any significant way from
being compelled to incriminate themselves. We
have concluded that without proper safeguards the
process of in-custody interrogation of persons
suspected or accused of crime contains inherently
compelling pressures which work to undermine the
individual's will to resist and to compel him to
speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.
In order to combat these pressures and to permit a
full opportunity to exercise the privilege against
self-incrimination, the accused must be adequately
and effectively apprised of his rights and the
exercise of those rights must be fully honored.
It is impossible for us to foresee the potential
alternatives for protecting the privilege which
might be devised by Congress or the States in the
exercise of their creative rule-making capacities.
105

Therefore, we cannot say that the Constitution
necessarily requires adherence to any particular
solution for the inhercat compulsions of the
interrogation process as it is presently conducted.
Our decision in no way creates a constitutional
straitjacket which will handicap sound efforts at
reform, nor is it intended to have this effect. We
encourage Congress and the States to continue their
laudable search for increasingly effective ways of
protecting the rights of the individual while
promoting efficient enforcement of our criminal
laws. However, unless we are shown other
procedures which are at least as effective in
apprising accused persons of their right of silence
and in assuring a continuous opportunity to
exercise it, the following safeguards must be
observed.
At the outset, if a person in custody is to be
subjected to interrogation, he must first be
informed in clear and unequivocal terms that he has
the right to remain silent. For those unaware of the
privilege, the warming is needed simply to make
them aware of it-the threshold requirement for an
intelligent decision as to its exercise. More
important, such a warning is an absolute
prerequisite in overcoming the inherent pressures
of the interrogation atmosphere. It is not just the
subnormal or woefully ignorant who succumb to an
interrogator's imprecations, whether implied or
expressly stated, that the interrogation will continue
until a confession is obtained or that silence in the
face of accusation is itself damming and will bode
ill when presented to a jury. Further, the warning
will show the individual that his interrogators are
prepared to recognize his privilege should he
choose to exercise it.
106
The Fifth Amendment privilege is so fundamental
to our system of constitutional rule and the
expedient of giving an adequate warning as to the
availability of the privilege so simple, we will not
pause to inquire in individual cases whether the
defendant was aware of his rights without a
warning being given. Assessments of the
knowledge the defendant possessed, based on
information as to his age, education, intelligence,
or prior contact with authorities, can never be more
than speculation, a warning is a clear-cut fact.
More important, whatever the background of the
person interrogated, a warning at the time of the
interrogation is indispensable to overcome its
pressures and to insure that the individual knows he
is free to exercise the privilege at that point in time.
The warning of the right to remain silent must be
accompanied by the explanation that anything said
can and will be used against the individual in court.
This warning is needed in order to make him aware
not only of the privilege, but also of the
consequences of forgoing it. It is only through an
awareness of these consequences that there can be
any assurance of real understanding and intelligent
exercise of the privilege. Moreover, this warning
may serve to make the individual more acutely
aware that he is faced with a phase of the adversary
system that he is not in the presence of persons
acting solely in his interest.
The circumstances surrounding in-custody
interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear
the will of one merely made aware of his privilege
by his interrogators. Therefore, the right to have
counsel present at the interrogation is indispensable
to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege
under the system we delineate today. Our aim is to
107
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 72
assure that the individual's right to choose between
silence and speech remains unfettered throughout
the interrogation process. A once-stated warning,
delivered by those who will conduct the
interrogation, cannot itself suffice to that end
among those who most require knowledge of their
rights. A mere warming given by the interrogators is
not alone sufficient to accomplish that end.
Prosecutors themselves claim that the
admonishment of the right to remain silent without
more will benefit only the recidivist and the
professional. Even preliminary advice given to the
accused by his own attorney can be swiftly.
overcome by the secret interrogation process. Thus.
the need for counsel to protect the Fifth
Amendment privilege comprehends not merely a
right to consult with counsel prior to questioning,
but also to have counsel present during any
questioning if the defendant so desires.
That presence of counsel at the interrogation may
serve several significant subsidiary functions as
well. If the accused decides to talk to his
interrogators, the assistance of counsel can mitigate
the dangers of untrustworthiness. With a lawyer
present the likelihood that the police will practice
coercion is reduced, and if coercion is nevertheless
exercised the lawyer can testify to it in court. The
presence of a lawyer can also help to guarantee that
the accused gives a fully accurate statement to the
police and that the statement is rightly reported by
the prosecution at trial.
An individual need not make a pre-interrogation
request for a lawyer. While such request
affirmatively secures his right to have one, his
failure to ask for a lawyer does not constitute a
waiver. No effective waiver of the right to counsel
108
during interrogation can be recognized unless
specifically made after the warnings we here
delineate have been given. The accused who does
not know his rights and therefore does not make a
request may be the person who most needs counsel.
Accordingly we hold that an individual held for
interrogation must be clearly informed that he has
the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the
lawyer with him during interrogation under the
system for protecting the privilege we delineate
today. As with the warmings of the right to remain
silent and that anything stated can be used in
evidence against him, this warning is an absolute
prerequisite to interrogation. No amount of
circumstantial evidence that the person may have
been aware of this right will suffice to stand in its
stead. Only through such a warning is there
ascertainable assurance that the accused was aware
of this right.
If an individual indicates that he wishes the
assistance of counsel before any interrogation
occurs, the authorities cannot rationally ignore or
deny his request on the basis that the individual
does not have or cannot afford a retained attorney.
The financial ability of the individual has no
relationship to the scope of the rights involved
here. The privilege against self-incrimination
secured by the Constitution applied to all
individuals. The need for counsel in order to
protect the privilege exists for the indigent as well
as the affluent. In fact, were we to limit these
constitutional rights to those who can retain an
attomey, our decisions today would be of little
significance. The cases before us as well as the vast
majority of confession cases with which we have
109
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 73
dealt in the past involve those unable to retain
counsel. While authorities are not required to
relieve the accused of his poverty, they have the
obligation not to take advantage of indigence in the
administration of justice. Denial of counsel to the
indigent at the time of interrogation while allowing
an attorney to those who can afford one would be
no more supportable by reason or logic than the
similar situation at trial and on appeal. ***
In order fully to apprise a person interrogated of the
extent of his rights under this system then, it is
necessary to warn him not only that he has the right
to consult with an attorney, but also that if he is
indigent a lawyer will be appointed to represent
him. Without this additional warning, the
admonition of the right to consult with counsel
would often be understood as meaning only that he
can consult with a lawyer if he has one or has the
funds to obtain one. The warning of a right to
counsel would be hollow if not couched in terms
that would convey to the indigent-the person most
often subjected to interrogation the knowledge
that he too has a right to have counsel present. As
with the warnings of the right to remain silent and
of the general right to counsel, only by effective
and express explanation to the indigent of this right
can there be assurance that he was truly in a
position to exercise it
Once warnings have been given, the subsequent
procedure is clear. If the individual indicates in any
manner, at any time prior to or during questioning,
that he wishes to rernain silent, the interrogation
must cease. At this point he has shown that he
intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege;
any statements taken after the person invokes his
privilege cannot be other than the product of
110
compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the right
to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody
interrogation operates on the individual to
overcome free choice in producing a statement
after the privilege has been once invoked. If the
individual states that he wants an attorney, the
interrogation must cease until an attorney is
present. At that time, the individual must have an
opportunity to confer with the attorney and to have
him present during any subsequent questioning. If
the individual cannot obtain an attorney and he
indicates that he wants one before speaking to
police, they must respect his decision to remain
silent.
This does not mean, as some have suggested, that
each police station must have a 'station house
lawyer present at all times to advise prisoners. It
does mean, however. that if police propose to
interrogate a person they must make known to him
that he is entitled to a lawyer and that if he cannot
afford one, a lawyer will be provided for him prior
to any interrogation. If authorities conclude that
they will not provide counsel during a reasonable
period of time in which investigation in the field is
carried out, they may refrain from doing so without
violating the person's Fifth Amendment privilege
so long as they do not question him during that
time.
If the interrogation continues without the presence
of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy
burden rests on the government to demonstrate that
the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived
his privilege against self-incrimination and his right
to retain or appoint counsel. This Court has always
set high standards of proof for the waiver of
constitutional rights, and we reassert these
411
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 74
standards as applied to
in-custody
interrogation. Since the State is responsible for
establishing the isolated circumstances under which
the interrogation takes place and has the only
means of making available corroborated evidence
of warmings given during incommunicado
interrogation, the burden is rightly on is shoulders.
An express statement that the individual is willing
to make a statement and does not want an attorney
followed closely by a statement could constitute a
waiver. But a valid waiver will not be presumed
simply from the silence of the accused after
warnings are given or simply from the fact that a
confession was in fact eventually obtained. ***
Moreover, where in-custody interrogation is
involved, there is no room for the contention that
the privilege is waived if the individual answers
some questions or gives some information on his
own prior to invoking his right to remain silent
when interrogated.
Whatever the testimony of the authorities as to
waiver of rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy
interrogation or incommunicado incarceration
before a statement is made is strong evidence that
the accused did not validly waive his rights. In
these circumstances the fact that the individual
eventually made a statement is consistent with the
conclusion that the compelling influence of the
interrogation finally forced him to do so. It is
inconsistent with any notion of a voluntary
relinquishment of the privilege. Moreover, any
evidence that the accused was threatened, tricked.
or cajoled into a waiver will, of course, show that
the defendant did not voluntarily waive his
privilege. The requirement of warnings and waiver
112
of rights is a fundamental with respect to the Fifth
Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary
ritual to existing methods of interrogation.
The warnings required and the waiver necessary in
accordance with our opinion today are, in the
absence of a fully effective equivalent.
prerequisites to the admissibility of any statement
made by a defendant. No distinction can be drawn
between statements which are direct confessions
and statements which amount to "admissions of
part or all of an offence. The privilege against self-
incrimination protects the individual from being
compelled to incriminate himself in any manner; it
does not distinguish degrees of incrimination.
Similarly, for precisely the same reason, no
distinction may be drawn between inclupatory
statements and statements alleged to be merely
'exculpatory'. If a statement made were in fact
truly exculpatory it would, of course, never be used
by the prosecution. In fact, statements merely
intended to be exculpatory by the defendant are
often used to impeach his testimony at trial or to
demonstrate untruths in the statement given under
interrogation and thus to prove guilt by implication.
These statements are incriminating in any
meaningful sense of the word and may not be used
without the full warnings and effective waiver
required for any other statement. **
The principles announced today deal with the
protection which must be given to the privilege
against self-incrimination when the individual is
first subjected to police interrogation while in-
custody at the station or otherwise deprived of his
freedom of action in any significant way. It is at
this point that our adversary system of criminal
proceedings commences, distinguishing itself at the

part, said:
aulset from the inquisitorial system recognized in
some counties. Under the system of warnings we
delineate today or under any other system which
may be devised and found effective, the safeguards
to be erected about the privilege must come into
play at this point.
Our decision is not intended to hamper the
traditional function of police officers in
investigating crime. When an individual is in
custody on probable cause, the police may, of
course, seek out evidence in the field to be used at
trial against him. Such investigation may include
inquiry of persons not under restraint. General on-
the-scene questioning as to facts surrounding a
crime or other general questioning of citizens in the
fact-finding process is not affected by our holding.
It is an act of responsible citizenship for individuals
to give whatever information they may have to aid
in law enforcement. In such situations the
compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of
in-custody interrogation is not necessarily present.
In dealing with statements obtained through
interrogation, we do not purport to find all
confessions inadmissible. Confessions remain a
proper element in law enforcement. Any statement
given freely and voluntarily without any
compelling influences is, of course, admissible in
evidence".

and entails harmful consequences for the
country at large. How serious these
consequences may prove to be only time
can tell
I turn now to the
court's asserted reliance on the Fifth
Amendment, an approach which I
frankly regard as a tromp l'ocil. The
court's opinion in my view reveals no
adequate basis for extending the Fifth
Amendment's privilege against self-
incrimination to the police station.
Historically, the privilege
against self-incrimination did not bear at
all on the use of extra-legal confessions,
for which distinct standards evolved.
Even those who would readily enlarge
the privilege must concede some
linguistic difficulties since the Fifth
Amendment in terms prescribes only
compelling any person in ay criminal
case to be a witness against himself".
The cases before the Supreme Court in which what is
now known as Miranda principles were laid down were four in
number. But for an understanding of those constitutional
principles, it will make the analysis "more graphic to consider the
115
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 76
actual facts of one of the four cases reversed by the court. Miranda
serves best, being neither the hardest nor easiest of the four under
the court's standards".
On March 13, 1963, petitioner Ernesto Miranda was
arrested at his home and taken in custody to police station. He was
there identified by the complainant. The police then took him to the
interrogation room where he was questioned by two police officers.
The officers admitted at trial that Miranda was not advised that he
had a right to have attorney present. Two hours later, the officers
emerged from the interrogation room with a written confession
signed by Miranda. At the end of the statement was a typed
paragraph stating that the confession was made voluntarily, without
threats or promises of immunity and "with knowledge of my legal
rights, understanding any statement I make may be used against
me".
Miranda was found guilty of kidnapping and rape. On
appeal, the Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed the conviction. In
reaching its decision, the court emphasized heavily the fact that
Miranda did not specifically request counsel.
In reversing, Warren Chief Justice held:
"From the testimony of the officers and
by the admission of respondent, it is
clear that Miranda was not in any way
apprised of his right to consult with any
attorney and to have one present during
the interrogation, nor was his right not to
be compelled to incriminate himself
effectively protected in any other
manner. Without these warnings the
statements were inadmissible. The mere
fact that he signed a statement which
contained a typed-in clause stating that
he had full knowledge of his legal rights
does not approach the knowing and
116
intelligent waiver required to relinquish
constitutional rights".
Illustrating Miranda
The following illustrative cases will suffice to help in explaining
the application of the Miranda principles.
In Rhode Island v lanis (446 US 291, 1980), J.M., a
taxicab driver, disappeared on the night of January 12, 1975 after
being despatched to pick up a customer. His body was discovered
four days later buried in a shallow grave. He had died of a shotgun
wound. The respondent was arrested the same day; he was
unarmed and was advised of his Miranda rights. The respondent
stated that he understood those rights and wanted to speak with a
lawyer. He was placed in a 'caged wagon', a four-door police car
with a wire screen mesh between the front and rear seats and was
driven to the police station. Three police officers accompanied him.
They placed the respondent in the vehicle and shut the doors. The
police officers were instructed not to question the respondent, or
intimidate or coerce him in any way, While enroute to the police
station, one police officer initiated a conversation with another
police officer concerning the missing shotgun. That conversation
was to the effect that because a school of handicapped children was
located nearby and there were a lot of handicapped children
running around, one of them might find a weapon with shells and
they might hurt themselves. The policemen agreed that they would
continue for the search of the weapon. The respondent interrupted
the conversation and asked the policemen to turn the car around so
that he could show them where the gun was located. The police
vehicle then returned to the place of arrest; there the respondent
was again advised of his Miranda rights. The respondent said that
he understood those rights but that he "wanted to get the gun out of
the way because of the kids in the area in the school". The
respondent then led the police to a nearby ficid, where he pointed
out the shotgun under some rocks.
117

Page 77
A motion to suppress was denied and Innis was
convicted. The State Appellate Court, however, agreed to suppress
the evidence, observing that "even though the police officers may
have been genuinely concerned about the public safety and even
though the respondent had not been addressed personally by the
police officers, the respondent nonetheless had been subjected to
subtle coercion' that was the equivalent of 'interrogation' within
the meaning of Miranda opinion
The Supreme Court reversed. The issue, said Justice
Stewart in his opinion for the court, was "whether the respondent
was interrogated by the police officers in violation of the
respondent's undisputed right under Miranda to remain silent until
he had consulted with a lawyer. In resolving this issue, we first
define the term 'interrogation' under Miranda before turning to a
consideration of the facts of this case". Justice Stewart wrote:
"In Miranda v Arizona, the court held
that, once a defendant in custody asks to
speak with a lawyer, all interrogation
must cease until a lawyer is present.
The starting point for defining
'interrogation in this context is, of
course, the Court's Miranda opinion.
There the Court observed that "by
custodial interrogation. we mean
questioning initiated by law enforcement
officers after a person has been taken
into custody or otherwise deprived of his
freedom of action in any significant
way'. This passage cr other references
throughout the opinion to 'questioning'
might suggest that the Miranda rules
were 10 apply to those police
interrogation practices that involve
express questioning of a defendant while
in custody.
118
We do not however construe the
Miranda opinion so narrowly. The
concern of the Court in Miranda was that
the 'interrogation environment' created
by the interplay of interrogation and
custody would 'subjugate the individual
to the will of his examiner' and thereby
undermine the privilege against

police practices that evoked this concern
included several that did not involve
express questioning..........
This is not to say, however, that all
statements obtained by the police after a
person has been taken into custody are to
be considered the product of
interrogation. It is clear therefore
that the special procedural safeguards
outlined in Miranda are required not
where a suspect is simply taken into
custody, but rather where a suspect in
custody is subjected to interrogation.
'Interrogation' as conceptualized in the
Mirada opinion, must reflect a measure
of compulsion above and beyond that
inherent in custody itself.
We conclude that the Miranda
safeguards come into play whenever a
person in custody is subjected to either
express questioning or its functional
equivalent. That is to say, the term
'interrogation' under Miranda refers not
only to express questioning but also to
any words or actions on the part of the
police (otherwise than those normally
119
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 78
attendant to arrest and custody) that the
police should know are reasonably likely
to elicit an incriminating response from
the suspect. The latter portion of this
definition focuses primarily upon the
perceptions of the suspect, rather than
the intent of the police. This focus
reflects the fact that the Miranda
safeguards were designed to vest a
suspect in custody with an added
measure of protection against coercive.
police practices, without regard to
objective proof of the underlying intent
of the police. A practice that the police
should know is reasonably likely to
evoke an incriminating response from a
suspect thus amounts to 'interrogation'.
But, since the police surely cannot be
held accountable for the unforeseeable
results of their words or actions, the
definition of interrogation can extend
only to words or actions on the part of
the police officers that they should have
known were reasonably likely to elicit an
incriminating response".
Brewer Williams (930 US 387; 51 L Ed 2d 424
(1977), shows that Massiah is still good law; that law, you will
recall, is that the use of incriminating statements made in the
absence of his lawyer by an individual who had been indicted
violated the accused's Sixth Amendment right to legal
representation.
In Brewer v Williams, cn the afternoon of December 24,
a ten-year old girl named Pamila went to see a wrestling match in
YMCA in Des Moines and went missing. The respondent Williams
had recently escaped from a mental hospital. Soon after the girl's
disappearance, Williams was seen in YMCA lobby carrying some
120
clothing and a large bundle wrapped in a blanket. He obtained help
from a 14 years old boy in opening the street door of the YMCA
and the door of his automobile parked outside. When Williams
placed the bundle in the front seat of his car the boy saw two
skinny and white legs in it. Before anybody could see what was in
the bundle Williams drove away. His abandoned car was found the
following day in Davenport roughly 160 miles east of Des Moines.
A warrant was issued in Des Moines for his arrest on a charge of
abduction.
Williams surrendered to the police in Davenport. He was
given the Miranda warnings. A lawyer. Henry McKnight, advised
Williams in the presence of the police that he would be transported
to Des Moines, that the officers would not interrogate him and that
he would not talk to the officers until his return to Des Moines.
after consulting with him. It was then agreed between the lawyers
and the police officers that they would not question him during the
trip. A lawyer at Davenport also told the police officers that
Williams would not be questioned during the journey. One of the
police officers escorting Williams knew that Williams was deeply
religious, and during the journey he and Williams embarked on a
wide-ranging conversation, including the subject of religion, and
then that officer delivered what has been described as the
"Christian burial speech". The officer told Williams that it was
raining, it was sleeting, it was freezing; that they were expecting
several inches of snow, that he, Williams, alone knew where the
girl's body was, that they could stop and locate the body and that
the parents of the little girl should be entitled to a Christian burial
for the little girl who was snatched away from them on Christmas
eve and murdered. As the car approached a place, Grinnell, about
100 miles from Davenport, Williams asked whether they had found
the victim's shoes. Williams then directed the officer to a service
station where Williams said he had left the shoes. The search
proved unsuccessful. He then led to another place where he said he
had left the blanket. Again nothing was found. As the car
approached a place called Mitchellville, William led to the body of
the girl.

Williams was indicted for first-degree murder, His

from any statements made during the joumey. The trial judge

conviction was set aside. When the matter reached the US Supreme
Court, that Court held that Williams was deprived of the right to

prove an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known
right or privilege and that the record fell far short of sustaining that
burden:
" is true that Williams had been
informed of and appeared to understand
his right to counsel. But waiver requires

relinquishment, and Williams' consistent
reliance upon the advice of counsel in

about Pamila in the absence of his
counsel).

Chief Justice Burger wrote a powerful dissent:
"The result in this case ought to be

to call itself an organized society. It
continues the court by the narrowest
margin-on the much criticized course of
punishing the public for the mistakes and

joined by Justice Brennan, held that while the right to counsel
generally attaches after proceedings have commenced, "if the
authorities take a person into custody in order to interrogate him or

A Note on Miranda:
While Chief Justice Earl Warren's period as Chief
Justice has been described as an era of judicial revolution, Miranda
has been described as "the centerpiece of the Warren Court's
revolution in American Criminal Procedure". (See the Criminal
Procedure and the Constitution by Professors Israel, Kamisar and
LaFave, 1994 ed. p 306). Miranda has been the most famous, the
most cited and at the same time the most criticized case in
America. "Following Miranda, public outcry against the Warren
court intensified". The debate was confined not to the police station
and the halls of academia, but also filtered into presidential politics.
In 1968, Richard Nixon, in his presidential bid, said that "the
comulative effect of these decisions has been to very nearly rule
out the confession as an effective and major tool in prosecution and
law enforcement". Congress also reacted and quickly enacted 18
USC S.3501, an Act designed to confine the law of confessions
solely to the pre-Escobedo, due process voluntariness test.
Essentially, Congress attempted to overrule the Warren court's
Miranda ruling. Yet, Miranda remained intact. When the Supreme
Court came under the leadership of the conservative Chief Justice
Warren Burger, many began to wonder if Miranda would survive.
"In a series of decisions, the Burger court began to peel away at the
scope of the Warren court's holding". However, as the 1970s gave
way to the 1980s, the court's position seemed to be changing, and
Chief Justice Burger commented that "law enforcement practices
had adjusted to Miranda's stricture" and that he had no intention of
overruling it. Then, in Dickerson v US, a 2000 case, the Rehnquist
court was faced with the difficult decision to overrule Miranda or
hold the Congress enactment unconstitutional. The conservative
Chief Justice, in a 6 3 majority opinion, refused to overrule
Miranda, and wrote-
"While Congress has ultimate authority
to modify or set aside any such rules that
124
are not constitutionally required, it may
not supersede this court's decisions
interpreting and applying the
Constitution.
Whether or not this court would agree
with Miranda's reasoning and its rule
stare decisis weighs heavily
against overruling it. Even in
constitutional cases, stare decisis carries
such persuasive force that the court has
always required a departure from
precedent to be supported by some
special justification. There is no such
justification here. Miranda has become
embedded in routine police practice to
the point where the warnings have
become part of our national culture".
This reminds one of the oft-repeated saying of Chief
Justice Charles Evans Hughes:
"We are under a Constitution, but the
Constitution is what the Judges say it is",
Chapter 6
The Exclusionary Rule
There are two extremes of a wide spectrum:
At one end of the spectrum is the traditional common
law rule, going back at least to the mid-18" Century, succinctly
put by Lord Scarman in R v Sang (1979) 2 All ER 1222, 1242) as
follows:
"...subject to exceptions, of which
hearsay evidence is far the most
125

important, evidence which a judge rules
relevant is admissible however obtained.
"It matters not how you get it; if you
steal it even, it would be admissible":
this was the stark assertion by Crompton
1 in R v Leatham (1861) 8 Cox CC
498,501). The modem foundation of the
principle is to be found in the opinion of
the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council prepared by Lord Goddard CJ in
Kuruma son of Kania v R (1955) 1 All
ER 236, 239):
"...In their Lordships' opinion the test
to be applied in considering whether
evidence is admissible is whether it is
relevant to the matters in issue. If it is, it
is admissible, and the court is not
concerned with how the evidence was
ob:ained....."
In 2 recent English case, Fox v Chief Constable (1986) 1 AC 281),
which was decided shortly before section 78 of the (English) Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) came into force, which
section changed the common law rule by giving discretion to the
court to admit or not to admit any evidence, the facts were that in
the aftermath of a road traffic accident involving the accused, the
police officers unlawfully entered the accused's home and asked
him to provide a specimen of breath. When he refused, the accused
was arrested, taken to a police station and forced to comply with
the officer's request. His breath specimen duly showed that he had
consumed alcohol more than the prescribed limit. This led to his
conviction. Lord Fraser in the House of Lords held:
"The duty of the court is to decide
whether the appellant has committed the
offence with which he is charged, and
not to discipline the police for exceeding
their powers.....
Accordingly, the evidence of the breath specimen, obtained after a
wrongful arrest of the accused and unlawful entry into his house.
was not excluded.
The common law rule that seizure of evidence by illegal
means did not affect its admissibility at the trial prevailed in
America until the Supreme Court ruled in Weeks v US (1914) 232
US 383) that in a federal prosecution, the Fourth Amendment
barred the use of evidence secured through an illegal search and
seizure. This is known as the Exclusicnary Rule. In Weeks the
question was whether the court could retain in a criminal
prosecution for the purpose of evidence the letters and
correspondence of the accused, seized from his house in his
absence and without his authority by the police holding no warrant
for his arrest and none for the search of his premises in violation of
Fourth Amendment. It was held:
"The efforts of the courts and their
officials to bring the guilty to
punishment, praiseworthy as they are,
are not to be aided by the sacrifice of
those great principles established by
years of endeavour and suffering which
have resulted in their embodiment in the
fundamental law of the land......... To
sanction such proceedings would be to
affirm by judicial decision a manifest
neglect if not an open defiance of the
prohibitions of the Constitution intended
for the protection of the people against
such unauthorized action".
This was followed in Welf v Colorado (338 US 25; 93 L Ed 1782
(1949).
126

Page 82
The Fourth Amendment says nothing about how it is to
be enforced, and in Wolf, the Supreme Court explained:
"This ruling (in Weeks)... was not
derived from the explicit requirements of
the Fourth Amendment; it was not based
on legislation expressing congressional
policy in the enforcement of the
Constitution. The decision was a matter
of judicial implication. Since then it has
been frequently applied and we stoutly
adhere to it. But the immediate question
is whether the basic right to protection
against arbitrary intrusion by the police
demands the exclusion of logically
relevant evidence obtained by an
unreasonable search and seizure..... As a
matter of inherent reason. one would
suppose this to be an issue as to which
men with complete devotion to the
protection of the right of privacy might
give different answers. When we find
that in fact most of the English speaking
world does not regard as vital to such,
protection the exclusion of evidence thus
obtained, we must hesitate to treat this
remedy as an essential ingredient.......".
The Exclusionary Rule was therefore not extended to prosecutions
in a State court for a State crime; the Fourth Amendment, it was
held, "does not forbid the admission of evidence obtained by an
unreasonable search seizure" in the States.
Mapp v Ohio (367 US 643; 6 L Ed 2d 1081 (1961)
described by a writer as a bombshell in the form of exclusionary
rule, extended the rule to the States for State crimes. The facts in
Mapp were as follows: On May 23, 1957, three Cleveland police
officers arrived at Mapp's residence pursuant to information that a
128
person was hiding out in the home who was wanted for questioning
in connection with a recent bombing and that there was a large
amount of policy paraphernalia hidden in the home. Mapp and her
daughter lived on the top floor of the dwelling. Upon their arrival
at the house, the officers knocked on the door and demanded
entrance but Mapp. after telephoning her attorney, refused to admit
them without a search warrant.
The officers again came to the house some three hours.
later and forced their entry into the house by forcibly opening one
of the doors. In the meantime Mapp's attorney arrived, but the
officers would not allow him to enter or to see Mapp. Mapp
demanded to see the search warrant. A paper claimed to be a
warrant was held up by one of the officers. She grabbed the paper
and placed it in her bosom. A struggle ensued in which the officers
recovered the paper and handcuffed Mapp. She was taken to her
bedroom which was searched. After a widespread search, some
obscene materials were recovered and it was for their possession
that she was tried and convicted.
At the trial, no search warrant was produced. The State
argued that even if the search was without warrant, or otherwise
unreasonable, the seized evidence was admissible. In extending the
exclusionary rule to the State crimes, Justice Clark wrote for the
Court:
"Today we once again examine Wolf's
constitutional documentation of the right
to privacy free from unreasonable state
intrusion........ We hold that all
evidence obtained by searches and
seizures in violation of the Constitution
is, by that same authority, inadmissible
in a state court..........
In extending the substantive protection
of the process to all constitutionally
unreasonable searches state or federal
129

Page 83
it was logically necessary and
constitutionally necessary that the
exclusion doctrine an essential part of
the right to privacy be also insisted
upon as an essential ingredient of the
right newly recognized by the Wolf case.
In short, the admission of the new
constitutional right by Wolf could not
consistently tolerate denial of its most
important constitutional privilege,
namely, the exclusion of the evidence
which an accused had been forced to
give by reason of the unlawful seizure.
To hold otherwise is to grant the right
but in reality to withhold its privilege
and enjoyment the purpose of
exclusionary rule is to deter - to compel
respect for the constitutional guarantee
in the only effective available way by
removing the incentive to disregard".
Justice Clark found intimate relation between a coerced
confession and coerced testimony by way of unconstitutional
seizure of goods, papers, effects, documents etc:
"They express 'supplementary phases of
the same constitutional purpose - to
maintain inviolate large areas of
personal privacy'. The philosophy of
each Amendment and of each freedom is
complementary 10, although not
dependent upon, that of the other in its
sphere of influence - the very least that
together they assure in either sphere is
that no man is to be convicted on
unconstitutional evidence",
Dealing with the argument of those who say, as did Justice (then
Judge) Cardozo in People v Defore, that under our constitutional
exclusionary doctrine "the criminal is to go free because the
constable has blundered", Justice Clark said:
"In some cases, this will undoubtedly be
the result. But, as was said in Elkins
'there is another consideration - the
imperative of judicial integrity, The
criminal goes free, if he must, but it is
the law that sets him free. Nothing can
destroy a government more quickly than
its failure to observe its own laws, or
worse, its disregard of the charter of its
own existence. As Justice Brandeis said
in Olmstead... 'If the government
becomes a law-breaker, it breeds
contempt for the law; it invites anarchy".
In US v Leon (468 US 897; 82 L Ed 2d 677 (1984), the
US Supreme Court created what is called 'good faith' exception to
the exclusionary rule. The question was whether the Fourth
Amendment exclusionary rule should be modified so as to bar the
use in the prosecution's case-in-chief of evidence obtained by
officers acting in reasonable reliance on a search warrant issued by
a detached and neutral magistrate but ultimately found to be
unsupported by probable cause.
Justice White, writing for the Court, said:
"The (exclusionary) rule
operates
as judicially created remedy designed to
safeguard Fourth Amendment rights
guaranteed through its deterrent effect,
rather than a personal constitutional right
of the person aggrieved.........
130
131

Page 84
Justice Brennan in his dissenting opinion, which, if we may say so,
is one of the best statements of the rationale behind the
exclusionary rule, said that "the deterrence theory is both
misguided and unworkable". In his view, "By remaining within its
redoubt of empiricism and by basing the rule solely on the
deterrence rationale, the court has robbed the rule of legitimacy".
He went on to say that the Fourth Amendment, like other
provisions of the Bill of Rights, "restrains the power of the
govemment as a whole........ The judiciary is responsible, no less
than the executive, for ensuring that constitutional rights are
respected". He went on to say:
"When that fact is kept in mind, the role
of the courts and their possible
involvement in the concems of the
Fourth Amendment comes into sharper
focus. Because seizures are executed.
principally to secure evidence, and
because such evidence generally has
utility in cur legal system only in the
context of a trial supervised by a judge,
it is apparent that the admission of
illegally obtained evidence implicates
the same constitutional concerns as the
initial seizure of that evidence. Indeed,
by admitting unlawfully seized evidence,
the judiciary becomes a part of what is in
fact a single governmental action
prohibited by the terms of the
Amendment. Once that connection.
between the evidence-gathering role of
the police and the evidence-admitting
function of the courts is ucknowledged,
the plausibility of the Court's
interpretation becomes more suspect.
Certainly nothing in the language or
history of the Fourth Amendment
suggests that a recognition of this
132
evidentiary link between the police and
the courts was meant to be foreclosed. It
is difficult to give any meaning at all to
the limitations imposed by the
Amendment if they are read to proscribe
only certain conduct by the police but to
allow other agents of the same
government to take advantage of
evidence secured by the police in
violation of its requirements. The
Amendment therefore must be read to
condemn not only the initial
unconstitutional invasion of privacy
which is done, after all, for the purpose
of securing evidence but also the
subsequent use of any evidence so
obtained".
-
Thus, the rationale for the Exclusionary Rule articulated
in Weeks and repeated in later cases is two-fold:
i)
that the exclusionary rule is the only effective
means of protecting Fourth Amendment
rights; and
ii)
that judicial integrity requires that the courts
do not sanction illegal searches by admitting
the fruits of illegality into evidence.
As regards the consequences of the violation of the Fifth
and Sixth Amendments rights namely the right to silence and the
right to counsel, we have noticed the Exclusionary Rule laid down
in Massiah (377 US 201) that the accused's incriminating
statements (not necessarily confessions), obtained in violation of
these rights "could not constitutionally be used by the prosecution
as evidence against him at his trial"; and that laid down in Miranda
(384 US 436) namely that "the prosecution may not use statements,
whether exculpatory or inclupatory, stemming from custodial
interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of
133
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 85
procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-
incrimination".
The Exclusionary Rule, it has been said, is simple to
state, but difficult to apply. (See the book "Justice Overruled by
Judge Burton S. Katz, p 37). Any evidence seized or obtained by
the police in violation of a fundamental constitutional right may not
be used as evidence against a criminal defendant. There are indeed
some extensions, exceptions, and permutations.
Doctrine of Fruit of Poisonous Tree
"Fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine is an extension of the
Exclusionary Rule. (The phrase 'fruit of the poisonous tree was
coined in Nordone (308 US 338) and was used in Brown (1975)
422 US 590). Linder this doctrine, 'derivative evidence' would also
be excluded so that e.g. evidence obtained by virtue of an
inadmissible confession such as the recovery of stolen goods
hidden by the accused, would also be inadmissible. To illustrate:
suppose that the police fail to read Miranda warnings to a person
suspected of murder. The suspect confesses the killing and tells the
police the he hid the weapon of offence at a certain place. He
actually leads the police to the recovery. The confession will be
suppressed as being in violation of the Miranda rights and the
recovery of weapon, as being "the fruit of the poisonous tree".
It needs to be explained that the Exclusionary Rule is
specific to systems of government with a written constitution,
which guarantees some fundamental rights relating to criminal
procedure.

PART II B
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND THE CONSTITUTION OF
PAKISTAN
Chapter 1
Preliminary
We have seen, that one of the objectives of the
Constitution of Pakistan is to ensure that the principles of "social
justice" as enunciated by Islam are observed. We have discussed
the meaning and implications of "social justice" in the context of
the Islamic concept of 'Adl'. We shall discuss below the impact of
the Fundamental Rights generally on the criminal justice system in
Pakistan. Suffice it to say here that besides the Fundamental
Rights, the Constitution sets out, in Chapter 2 of Part II. certain
principles known as the "Principles of Policy", and though, as
clause (2) of Article 30 declares. those principles are not
enforceable at law, as the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by
Chapter of Part II are, yet, under Article 29(1). "it is the
responsibility of each organ and authority of the State, and of each
person performing functions on behalf of an organ or authority of
the State, to act in accordance with those principles in so far as they
relate to the functions of the organ or authority". Articles 37 and 38
are particularly relevant in this context: Article 37 enumerates the
principles for the "promotion of social justice and eradication of
social evils", one of them being the responsibility of the State to
"ensure inexpensive and expeditious justice", and Article 38 sets
out the principles for the "promotion of social and economic well-
being of the people".
Chapter 2
Relevance of cases from America and other foreign
jurisdictions:
While discussing the Fundamental Rights as guaranteed
by the Constitution of Pakistan, reference will frequently be made
135
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 86
to cases from foreign jurisdictions, such as America, Britain, and
European Union. The justification for doing so may be briefly
stated as follows.
As regards the cases from America, it is a well
recognized fact that since the incorporation of the Bill of Rights
into the US Constitution, guaranteeing the fundamental human
rights, "the same pattern has been followed in almost all the written
constitutions of incorporating a declaration of fundamental rights
therein. (Hamoodur Rehman CJ in State v Zia-ur-Rehman - PLD
1973 SC 49, 67). Muhammad Yaqub Ali J. said in Manzoor Elahi v
Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1975 SC 66, 82):
"Part II, Chapter I of the Constitution
(of Pakistan) contains in all twenty
Fundamental Rights which provide for
security of persons, safeguard as to
arrest and detention, prohibition of
slavery, forced labour etc. Most of these
rights reflect the Charter of Human
rights adopted by the United Nations
Organization and to which all states are.
required to subscribe when admitted to
the Organization. These rights are by
now also incorporated in the written
constitutions of a number of civilized
states of the world. Pakistan has, in fact,
improved on them in more than one
respect
Thus, it was acknowledged in Jibendra Kishore case (PLD 1957
SC (Pak) 9, 39) that the expression "equal protection of law (in
Article 25) as used in our Constitution has been borrowed from the
US 14th Amendment. This afforded sufficient justification for a
liberal use of decided cases from America. In Shehla Zia case
(PLD 1994 SC 693) American cases (including Munn 94 US
113) were referred for determining the meaning of 'life' as used in
Article 9.
In India, which, in this respect, also follows the
American pattern, Shah J. said in State of Uttar Pardesh v Deoman
Upadhyaya (AIR 1960 SC 1125):
"Article 14 of the Constitution of India
is adopted from the last clause of section
1 of the 14 Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States of
America, and it may reasonably be
assumed that cur Constituent Assembly
when it enshrined the guarantee of equal
protection of the laws. in Our
Constitution, was aware of its content
delineated by judicial interpretation in
the United States of America. In
considering the authorities of the
superior courts in the United States, we
would not therefore be incorporating
principles foreign to our constitution or
be proceeding upon the slippery ground
of apparent similarity of expressions or
concepts in an alien jurisprudence
developed by a society whose approach
to similar problems on account of
historical or other reasons differs from
ours".
In Deoman, the Supreme Court of India relied upon
some American cases to determine the scope of the equality clause
in the Indian Constitution. In a recent case, District Registrar v
Canara Bank (AIR 2005 SC 186), a number of American cases
were relied upon to show how the concept of 'privacy of the home'
had developed in America and what relevance the concept so
developed had to the constitutional law of India. Relying upon
Katz (389 US 347), which holds that the US Fourth Amendment
protects "people and not places", it was held that the Indian
Supreme Court had accepted that the right to privacy (which itself
136
137

Page 87
was not expressly provided but was derived, inter alia, from the
right to life and liberty) "deals with persons and not places".
As regards cases from the United Kingdom, they have.
so said Anwar-ul-Huq J. in Manzoor Elahi case (PLD 1975 SC 66.
145)
A word of caution:
"a direct bearing under the system of law
and the constitutional pattern we have
chosen to adopt in Pakistan".
The idea is to stimulate an interest in the development of
a Constitutional Criminal Procedure of our own and for that
purpose to encourage the gleaning of guidance from all available
sources. Obviously, everybody concerned with the development of
this branch of the law the academics, the law students, the
practicing lawyers and most importantly the courts have each a
role to play. Yet, far be it from us to suggest that in the
performance of this task, the participants would wear blinkers, and
follow blindly the cases from the American jurisdiction. Linguistic
differences might suggest differences in meaning; that would
require the juxtaposition of the provision in our constitution and
the provision in the constitution of the country whose precedent is
sought to be relied upon. History, traditions and effect of the
decisions on the jurisprudence and social conditions of the country
whose decisions are invoked are all matters that will enter into the
courts consideration in the development of our own Constitutional
Criminal Procedure.
We know of Blackstone's famous boast that English law
considers it better "to let ten guilty men go free than to convict one
innocent". The American approach is exemplified by Justice Oliver
W. Holmes' statement that "it is a lesser evil that some criminals
should escape than that the government should have played an
ignoble part",
138
We have seen that the rules enunciated in the American
case of Miranda have become the national culture of America. Yet
Miranda and the cases on Exclusionary Rule noticed above have
been severely criticized. We have noticed Justice Harlan's
dissenting opinion in Miranda; he believed that the decision
"represents poor constitutional law and entails harmful
consequences for the country at large"; in his view, there was no
adequate basis for extending the 5 Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination to the police station. Judge Harold J. Rothwax in
his book "Guilty - the Collapse of Criminal Justice", thinks that
Miranda "was folly - a terrible decision atop many other terrible
decisions". The authors of "The Devil's Advocates" (at p 258, the
authors are Michael S Lief and H. Mitchell Caldwell) note that
"Following Miranda, public outcry against the Warren Court
intensified. For many, 'Impeach Earl Warren was not merely a
suggestion, it was a mandate. How could the court let a confessed
rapist go free?
Aside from the immediate effect of the
Miranda ruling, the more controversial issues lay in its effects upon
future police interrogation. One police chief declared
that the Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution as a shield for
criminals. As to the American Exclusionary Rule. US Chief
Justice Burger had some extremely harsh words to use in his
dissent in Brewer v Williams (430 US 387); he said:
"The result of this case ought to be
intolerable in any society which purports
to call itself an organized society. It
continues the Court... on the much
criticised course of punishing the public
for the mistakes and misdeeds of law-
enforcement officers, instead of
punishing the officer directly, if in fact
he is guilty of wrongdoing. It
mechanically and blindly keeps reliable
evidence from juries whether the
claimed constitutional violation involves
gross police misconduct or bonest
human error"
139
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 88
The Exclusionary Rule, so says another American trial judge -
Judge Burton S. Katz (in his book "Justice Overruled", at p 36-7)
"is bad law. It is demeaning, an insult, a slap in the face to our
cops. Worse, it makes the truth irrelevant to the criminal justice
The rule should be eliminated and replaced
system
with measures that will preserve our constitutional rights and let
the truth back into our courtrooms".
In the book "The Devil's Advocates", (pp 67-68), the
authors have this to say:
"Most Americans take great exception to
this idea that criminals go free because
of some police error. Such an outcome
strikes us as fundamentally unfair; a
windfall for criminals and a body blow
to public safety.
How can we
let criminals go free?
The American Exclusionary Rule exacts
a high cost. The incriminating evidence
(the drugs, the blood, the knife) that is
on display for the world to see is now
rendered unusable against the very
criminal that produced it: a legal
loophole that allows dope dealers, rapists
and even murderers back onto the
streets. Judges are prevented from
considering evidence that often shows
beyond doubt that the defendant is guilty
of the crime. It is understandable-
expected that this perception serves to
undermine public confidence in our
system of justice".
One painful result, notes Judge Burton S. Katz in his
book "Justice Overruled" of the Exclusionary Rule is that some
-
good cops have now to tell "what they regard as white lies under
path". For this a new word 'testi-lying' testifying dishonestly
about how they got the evidence against a defendant has been
coined. The author quotes here a highly regarded member of the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal, the Honourable Alex Kozinski, who
says:
"It is an open secret shared by
prosecutors, defense lawyers and judges
that perjury is widespread among law
enforcement officers.
The
exclusionary rule is a great incentive for
police to lie to avoid
letting someone they think cr they know
is guilty, go free".
Judge Bowman in US v Jefferson (906 F.2d 346-1990)
used the very strong expression "the perversity of the exclusionary
rule" in a case in which discovery of evidence (nine kilogram of
cocaine) of substantial criminal activity had to be excluded.
It may be pointed out that in the United Kingdom the
Report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure (Cmnd
8092, para 4.126) referred to the American automatic exclusionary
rule and took the view that its use appeared to be justified as a
deterrent to unlawful conduct by the police and to preserve the
integrity of the court by preventing its involvement in illegal
activity. The Report comments that the United States Supreme
Court had felt constrained to develop the rule to protect the
citizens' constitutional rights and that the Supreme Court's
assumptions of this role derived its moral and political force from
its responsibility to protect and interpret the rights of the citizens of
the United States that are enshrined in the Bill of Rights. (See
Michael S. Pike's "The Principles of Policing", P 54).
Yet, the American automatic exclusionary rule, it is
interesting to note, has not been adopted by the British Parliament.
That Parliament has, by enacting section 78 of the Police and
140
141
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 89
Criminal
Evidence Act, 1984, (PACE) departed from the
traditional common law rule, stretching back at least to the mid-
eighteenth century, namely, that admissibility of evidence at trial is
wholly unaffected by the circumstances in which it was obtained.
Section 78 of PACE provides:
"In any proceedings the court may refuse
to allow evidence on which the
prosecution proposes to rely to be given
if it appears to the court that having
regard to all the circumstances, including
the circumstances in which the evidence
was chained, the admission of the
evidence would have such an adverse
effect on the faimess of the proceedings
that the court ought not to admit it".
Section 78 of PACE seems to have devised a middle
course between the American exclusionary rule and the traditional
common law rule; it gives discretionary power to the court to
determine, in the circumstances of each particular case, whether it
would be fair or unfair to admit or not to admit a piece of evidence.
Comments:
It may well be that in the light of the American and the
English experience and in view of our own tradition and the
doctrine of Adl, this middle course, is followed in Pakistan. As in
America, sa in Pakistan, there is no provision in the Constitution
providing for the automatic exclusionary rule. The rule is a judge-
made rule, the object being to preserve the Constitution inviolate.
That object can as well be achieved by leaving the judges with a
judicial discretion to decide on a case-to-case basis whether the
exclusion of evidence will serve the ends of justice. In so doing,
they will naturally be guided by the doctrine of proportionality-
whether the suppression will be proportionate to the alleged
constitutional violence and whether or not it will amount to
suppression of truth.
142
Chapter 3
Rights relating to Criminal Procedure in the Constitution of
Pakistan
We have noticed that of the twenty three fundamental
rights guaranteed by the American Bill of Rights, twelve related to
criminal procedure, and that, for that reason, the American Bill of
Rights has been described as a "mini-code of criminal procedure"
and the provisions in that constitution relating to criminal
procedure as the Constitutional Criminal Procedure.
Similarly, of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by
Articles 9 to 28 of the Constitution of Pakistan, almost 16 belong to
criminal procedure, and it may as well be described as a mini-code
of criminal procedure. These Fundamental Rights have both
substantive and procedural contents; the focus here of course is on
the procedural aspects of these rights. (For a detailed study of these
rights, the reader may consult the author's book "Judicial Review
of Public Actions", Part VIII, Sections A and B).
Article 9
This Article confers two rights:
i)
ii)
the right to life; and
the right to liberty.
It provides-
"No person shall be deprived of life or
liberty, save in accordance with law".
This right seems to have been modeled on the Fifth and
Sixth Amendments of the US Constitution.
The significance of the Fundamental Rights conferred by
this Article and their relevance to the criminal procedure lies in this
that whenever someone faces a criminal charge what is at stake is
his life or liberty or property. This may be put in another way, that
143

is, by considering the punishments that a person can suffer in a
criminal case.
severity:
Punishments fall into three categories of relative
1)
2)
3)
Fines, which involve loss and deprivation of
property;
Imprisonment, which
and
means loss
deprivation of liberty; and
Death, which means loss and deprivation of
life.
Article 9, reproduced above provides protection against
deprivation and loss of life and liberty, and Article 24, clause (1),
provides protection against deprivation and loss of property.
Right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights and "any
decision affecting human life, or which may put an individual's life
at risk, must call for the most anxious scrutiny". (Lord Bridge in
Bugdaycay v Secretary of State-(1987) 1 All ER 940, 972).
The constitutional law in America, as was observed in
Shehla Zia case (PLD 1994 SC 693), provides an extensive and
wide meaning to the word "life".
The leading authority on the meaning of life' as it
occurs in the American Constitution. Amendments Fourth and
Fourteenth, is the opinion of Justice Field in Munn v Illinois (94
US 113); life, it says, is something more than mere animal
existence. This view has been adopted in Shehla Zia case.
Access to Justice means the right to have access to justice through
independent judiciary as envisaged by the Constitution and
includes the right to have a fair and proper trial, by an impartial
court or tribunal. A person cannot be said to have been given a fair
or proper trial unless he is provided reasonable opportunity to
144
defend the allegations made against him. Trial by military courts
established in the purported exercise of the power under Article
245 of Pakistan Constitution, or by courts manned and run by
executive authorities is violative of the right to access to justice,
(Liaqat Hussain v Federation PLD 1999 SC 504, 632: Mehram
Ali v Federation - PLD 1998 SC 1445) which right is part of the
right to life guaranteed by Article 9.
Validity of primary as well as subordinate legislation
may be tested on the ground that it violates the right of access to
justice. A recent English case, R v Lord Chanceller ex parte
Witham (1997) 2 All ER 779) provides an interesting illustration.
In it, the Supreme Court Fees (Amended) Order 1996, was declared
invalid because it had by prescribing fees barred absolutely many
persons from seeking justice from the courts. Dr. Mehmood-ur-
Rehman v Secretary, Ministry of Law (PLD 1997 Lah 434) and
Sind High Court Bar v Islamic Republic of Pakistan (PLD 1991
Kar. 178) are also cases in which the imposition of court fee as
affecting the right of access to justice was held invalid.
The right of accused to be present at the trial
At common law, the defendant has, in general, a right to
be present at his trial and a right to be legally represented; those
rights can be waived, separately or together, wholly or in part, by
the defendant himself. As was held in R v Jones (2002) 2 All ER
1131, under the English Law, there is a discretion in the trial judge
to proceed with the trial in the absence of the defendant. In
expressing that view, due notice was taken of the provisions of the
European Convention. That Convention does not expressly
mention the right to be present at the trial, but the European Court
has held that the object and the purpose of Article 6 of the
Convention mean that a person charged with a criminal offence is
entitled to take part in the trial hearing. (Colozza and Rubinat, 12
February 1985, cited at p 38 of the Amnesty International Fair
Trials Manual).

In the United States, the right to be present at the trial is
"rooted to large extent in the confrontation clause of the Sixth
Amendment" as also in the due process clause (US v Gagnon - 470
US 522 (1985). Accordingly the right is not restricted to those parts
of trial in which the defendant is "actually confronting witnesses or
evidence against him". The question is related to the fullness of his
opportunity to defend against the charge.
The question whether the right of the accused to be
present at the trial is so absolute that no matter how unruly or
disruptive the defendant's conduct might be, he could never be
held to have lost that right, fell for consideration in Illinois v Allen
(397 US 337, 25 L ED 2d 353 (1970). Allen insisted to conduct his
own defense, although he had a court-appointed counsel. During
the trial, he started arguing with the trial Judge, threatened him
with death and when the trial Judge wamed him that he would be
removed from the court room, there was another outbreak. After
more abusive remarks, the Judge ordered the trial to proceed in his
absence. After the recess, the Judge allowed Allen to return but he
continued with his abusive behaviour and he was again removed
from the court room.
He was convicted and sentenced and the conviction and
sentence were affirmed in appeal. By way of habeas corpus, the
matter reached the Court of Appeals, who held that the right to be
present at his trial was an absolute right and reversed. The Court of
Appeals was, in turn, reversed by the US Supreme Court. Justice
Black speaking for the US Supreme Court recognized that one of
the most basic of the rights guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause
is the accused's right to be present in the courtroom at every stage
of his trial and held:
"We cannot agree that the Sixth
Amendment, the cases upon which the
Court of Appeals relied....so handicap a
trial Judge in conducting a criminal
trial.....No doubt the privilege (of
personally confronting witnesses) may
146
be lost by consent or at times even by
misconduct. Although mindful that
courts must indulge every reasonable
presumption against the loss of
constitutional rights, we explicitly hold
today that a defendant can lose his right
to be present at trial if, after he has been.
wamed by the Judge that he will be
removed if he continues his disruptive
behaviour, he nevertheless insists on
conducting himself in a manner so
disorderly, disruptive and disrespectful
of the court that his trial cannot be
carried on with him in the courtroom
It is essential to the proper
administration of criminal justice that
dignity, order, and decorum be the
hallmarks of all court proceedings
The flagrant disregard in the courtroom
of elementary standards of proper
conduct should not and cannot be
tolerated. We believe that trial judges
confronted
with disruptive,
contumacious, stubbornly defiant
defendants must be given sufficient
discretion to meet the circumstances of
each case".
Justice Black went on to say that "no one formula for
maintaining the appropriate courtroom atmosphere will be best in
all situations". He thought that "there are at least three
constitutionally permissible ways for a trial judge to handle an
abstreperous defendant like Allen (1) bind and gag him, thereby
keeping him present; (2) cite him for contempt; (3) take him out of
the court room until he promises to conduct himself properly".
Justice Black did not approve of binding and gagging the
accused, for such a technique "arouses a feeling that no person
147
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 92
should be tried while shackled and gagged except as a last
resort..... The use of this technique is itself something of an affront
to the very dignity and decorum of judicial proceedings that the
judge is seeking to uphold". As to the remedy of contempt of court,
the US Supreme Court observed that "citing or threatening to cite a
contumacious defendant for criminal contempt might in itself be
sufficient to make a defendant stop interrupting a trial. If so, the
problem would be solved easily.... Of course, if the defendant is
determined to prevent any trial, then a court in attempting to try the
defendant for contempt is still confronted with the identical
dilemma..... And criminal contempt has obvious limitations as a
sanction when the defendant is charged with a crime so serious that
a very serious sentence such as death or life imprisonment is likely
to be imposed. In such a case the defendant might not be affected
by a mere contempt sentence when he ultimately faces a far more
serious sanction. Nevertheless, the contempt remedy should be
bome in mind by a judge in the circumstances of this case.......
The court however found nothing unconstitutional about Allen's
removal from the courtroom and held that "under these
circumstances...... Allen lost his right guaranteed by the Sixth and
Fourteenth Amendments to be present throughout his trial".
In the Constitution of Pakistan, there is no provision.
expressly providing for the accused's right to be present at his trial;
yet, in Mehram Ali case (PLD 1998 SC 1445, 1488), the right
seems to have been treated as an absolute right, for, so held the
Supreme Court, right to access to justice is enshrined in Article 9.
In that case, section 19 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 authorized
the court to order removal of an accused person from the court if
his behaviour was such as to impede the course of justice and then
to proceed with the case in absentia. It was held that if an accused
person is removed from the court on account of misbehaviour and
in his absence the trial is concluded and he is sentenced to death, he
will be deprived of his life without due course of law and also of
his right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his
choice guaranteed by Article 10. Section 19 of the Act was
therefore held to be violative of the Constitution, Articles 9 and 10,
and of no legal effect.
Despite the holding in Mehram Ali, provisions
permitting trial in absentia continue to be part of the statutory law
of Pakistan. For example, section 5(4) of the Offences in respect of
Banks (Special Courts) Ordinance 1984 authorizes the court to try
an accused in his absence if. in its opinion, his absence is deliberate
and brought about with a view to impeding the course of justice or
behavior of the accused has been such as to impede the course of
justice and the court has on that account ordered his removal from
the court room. In M.B. Abbasi v State (PLJ 2009 SC 458), the
petitioners were accused of banking offences; they were tried in
their absence and convicted and sentenced. Relying upon Articles 4
and 9 of the constiution and upon the precedent cases of Mehram
Ali (PLD 1998 SC 1445), Muhammad Fazil v State (2006 SCMR
1432), Muhammad Arif v State (2008 SCMR 829) and Mir Ikhlaq
Ahmad v State (2008 SCMR 951) the petitioners challenged their
conviction and sentence. It was found that the petitioners were, at
the relevant time, out of the country; that they were never served
because they could not be traced out. It was held:
the proceedings in absentia hed
lost efficacy besides being violative
of the principle of natural justice as per
maxim audi alteram partem and Articles
9 and 10 (1) of the Constitution.......
The conviction and sentence were set aside.
Mir Akhlaq Ahmad v State (2008 SCMR 951) and
Muhammad Arif v State (2008 SCMR 829) were cases under the
Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, which also permitted the accused to be
tried in his absence. The accused was an abscondor, he was tried in
his absence and was convicted and sentenced. The convictions and
sentences were set aside as being violative of the legal and
constitutional provisions namely Articles 9 and 10(1) of the
Constitution and Section 10(11-A) of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
1997.

These cases call for two observations: (i) The provisions
permitting trial in absentia were not declared void; and (ii) it is not
clear how the provisions of Article 10 (1) of the Constitution were
attracted. In other words how did the court reach the conclusion
that Article 10 (1) of the Constitution was violated,
Position under the Code of Criminal Procedure
There are three provisions in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, which bear upon this subject. Under section 205 a
Magistrate, issuing a summons may, if he sees reason so to do,
dispense with the personal attendance of the accused and permit
him to appear by his pleader. However, at any subsequent stage of
the trial or enquiry, the Magistrate can require the personal
attendance of the accused. Section 353 provides that except as
otherwise expressly provided, all evidence in trials by Magistrates
under Chapter XX, in summary trials under Chapter XXII, and in
trials before the High Courts and Courts of Session under Chapter
XXII-A, "shall be taken in the presence of the accused or when his
personal attendance is dispensed with, in the presence of his
pleader". Section 540A provides:
"(1) At any stage of an enquiry or trial
under this Code, where two or more
accused are before the court, if the Judge
or Magistrate is satisfied, for reasons to
be recorded, that any one or more of
such accused is or are incapable of
remaining before the court, he may, if
such accused is represented by a pleader;
dispense with his attendance and
proceed with such enquiry or trial in his
absence, and may at any subsequent
stage of the proceeding direct the
personal attendance of such accused.
(2) If the accused in any such case is not
represented by a pleader, or if the Judge
150.
or Magistrate considers his personal
attendance necessary, he may, if he
thinks fit, and for reasons to be recorded
by him, either adjourn such enquiry or
trial or order that the case of such
accused be taken up or tried separately".
Section 540A was considered in Z A Bhutto case (PLD
1978 SC 53) in which his absence on account of illness and his
removal from court room on account of what was treated as
misbehavior were held to fall within the meaning of the words.
"is....incapable of remaining before the court". It was held that the
elements necessary for attracting the jurisdiction of the Judge or
Magistrate under the section are:
a)
b)
that there two or more accused before the
court facing an enquiry or trial under the
Code;
that one or more such accused is or are
incapable of remaining before the court; and
that such accused is represented by a pleader.
"It is only on the fulfillment of these conditions precedent that the
jurisdiction of the Judge or Magistrate is attracted, and he may after
having so satisfied himself in his discretion dispense with the
personal attendance of such accused and proceed in his absence".
This section, it was held, "was enacted not merely for the benefit of
the accused who is incapable of remaining before the court, but
also for the benefit of other accused whose trial is likely to be
delayed unnecessarily for no fault on his part".
Comments:
Now imagine that the validity of Mr. Z A Bhutto's trial
had been questioned before the Supreme Court on the ground that
his trial in his absence was in violation of the right to access to
justice guaranteed by Article 9 or Article 4. Imagine also that the
Supreme Court were persuaded, as it was in Mehram Ali case, that
the provision authorizing an accused to be tried in his absence or
151
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 94
that his alleged misbehavior did not justify his removal, was void.
Having allowed your imagination to run so far, imagine also what
would have been the consequences. The consequences would be
one, that section 540A would have been declared unconstitutional
being in violation of the right to access to justice and two, that his
trial in his absence and the resulting death sentence would, in view
of the decision in Mehram Ali case, be deprivation of life without
due course of law.
As observed above, the Constitution of Pakistan does not
provide in express terms that an accused has a right to be present at
his trial. That right is, as was held in Mehram Ali case, derived
from the Fundamental Rights expressly granted by Articles 9 and
10 of the Constitution. It is to be noted that the rights conferred by
Article 9 are not absolute rights, for they can be interfered with in
accordance with law, be it substantive or procedural law. And if
that right is subject to law, so is, it follows logically, its penumbras
namely the right to access to justice or the right to be present at the
trail. Unfortunately for the development of the law, the English and
the American cases referred to above were not brought to the
notice of the Bench which decided Mehram Ali case. However that
may be, the view taken therein, it is submitted with respect, needs
reconsideration. The view taken in the English and American
cases, it is further submitted, is more in accord with the provisions
of Article 9 of the Constitution.
Right to liberty:
The world has, so said Abraham Lincoln, never had a
good definition of liberty. The shepherd, he said, drives the wolf
from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as
his liberator, while the worlf denounces him for the same
act.....plainly, the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon the
definition of liberty. What is freedom for the lion is death for lamb.
(See the Article "On the meaning of the First Amendment.
Absolutes in the Balance"-50 California Law Review 821(1962).
The term "liberty' has been given a wide meaning in
America. A summary of what 'liberty" comprises may be found
stated in the concurring opinion of Justice Douglas in Roe v Wade
(410 US 113):
First is
the autonomy over the
development and expression of one's
intellect, interests, tastes and personality:
Second is the freedom of choice in the
basic decisions of one's life respecting
marriage, divorce, procreation.
contraception and the education and
upbringing of children......
Third is the freedom to care for one's
health and person, freedom from bodily
restraint, or compulsion, freedom to
walk, stroll or loaf..........
Thus liberty has been held to include the liberty of
contract (Allgeyer v Louisiana - 165 US 578 and Lochner v New
York (198 US 45), right of privacy (Griswold case-381 US 479;
and Roc v Wade (410 US 113), which limits the State's right to
interfere with a person's most basic decisions about family and
parenthood as well as bodily integrity including a woman's right to
terminate her pregnancy in its early stages.
The American view of 'liberty' has been followed in
India in cases on the corresponding provision in the Indian
Constitution namely Article 21, and it is submitted that the term
"liberty' as used in Article 9 has also the same meaning.
As to its procedural aspect, according to Lord Denning.
the English law respecting the freedom of the individual has been
built up from the procedure of the courts (Family Story. pp. 172,
178). The history of liberty, so said Justice Frankfurter in McNabb
(318 US 332)-
152
153
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 95
"has largely been the history of the
observance of procedural safeguards"
And Justice Jackson said in Shaughnessy (345 US 206)-
"Procedural faimess and regularity are
of the indispensable essence of liberty.
Some substantive restrictions can be
endured if they are fairly and impartially
applied."
"In accordance with law"
While the procedural right to liberty etc. in the
American Constitution. Amendments V and XIV, has been
guaranteed by providing that no person shall be
"deprived of life. liberty or property.
without due process of law"
in the Constitution of Pakistan, Article 9, the right guaranteed is as
follows:-
"No person shall be deprived of life or
liberty save in accordance with law
Thus, what is ensured by the expression "due process of law" in the
American Constitution is ensured by Article 9 in the Constitution
of Pakistan by using the expression "in accordance with law."
The expression "in accordance with law" emphasizes, in
the famous language of Massachusetts Bill of Rights the distinction
between 'government of laws" and "govemment of men'.
Do the two expressions "due process of law" and
"in accordance with law" mean the same thing? In Hurado v
California (110 US 516; 28 LEd 232), which is a classic
example of procedural due process of law, Justice Mathew.
after observing that each State prescribes its own modes of
judicial proceedings, went on to say what the term 'law' in the
phrase "due process of law" means:
"But it is not to be supposed that these
legislative powers are absolute and
despotic. and that the Amendment
prescribing due process of law is too
vague and indefinite to operate as a
practical restraint. It is not every act,
legislative in form that is law. Law is
something more than mere will exerted
as an act of power. It must not be a
special rule for a particular person or a
particular case, but in the language of
Mr. Webster, in his familiar definition.
the general law, the law which hears
before it condemns, which proceeds
upon injury, and renders judgment only
after trial, so that every citizen shall hold
life, liberty, property and immunities
under the protection of the general rules
which govern society and thus
excluding, as not due process of law.
acts of attainder, bills of pain and
penalties, acts of confiscation, acts
reversing judgments and acts directly
transferring one man's estate to another,
legislative judgments and decrees, and
other similar special, partial and
arbitrary exertion of power under the
forms of legislation. Arbitrary power.
enforcing its edicts to the injury of the
persons and property of its subjects, is
not law, whether manifested as the
decree of personal monarch or of an
impersonal multitude".

It should be mentioned here that a number of Constitutions and
Instruments, such as the European Convention, use a number of
variants e.g. "prescribed by law". "as provided by law"
"established by law", "in accordance with law".
The European Court of Human Rights has held that the
phrases "prescribed by law" and "in accordance with law" must be
given an identical meaning in order to ensure that all the relevant
Articles of the European Convention "can be read as a coherent
whole". (See among others Silver v UK-(1983) 5 EHRR 347, para
85). And the Privy Council has held, in cases from Singapore
namely Haw Tua v Public Prosecutor (1981) 3 All ER 14 and On
Ahg Chuan v Public Prosecutor (1980) 3 WLR 855) that so long as
Article 9 of the Singapore Constitution, which also uses the
expression "in accordance with law" remained unamended,
provision that "purports to assure to all individual citizens the
continued enjoyment of fundamental liberties or rights, reference to
'law' in such contexts as in accordance with law, equality before
law, protection of the law.and the like.......refer to a system of law
which incorporate those fundamental rules of natural justice that
had formed part and parcel of the common law of England that was
in operation in Singapore at the commencement of the
Constitution.
The Indian Constitution, in its corresponding Article 21,
provides that no person shall be deprived of life and personal
libeny except according to procedure established by law. In A.K.
Gopalan case (AIR 1950 SC 27), the Supreme Court of India held,
by a majority, that 'procedure established by law' means any
procedure established by law made by the Parliament or the
legislatures of the State. As was said in M. Nagaraj (AIR 2007 SC
71, 82) the Supreme Court refused to infuse the procedure with
principles of natural justice. It concentrated solely upon the
existence of enacted law. A.K. Gopalan was overruled in Maneka
Gandhi case (AIR 1978 SC 597) which held that the procedure
contemplated by Article 21 must be fair, reasonable and just
procedure and should also be in conformity with the principles of
natural justice.
The same view seems to have been taken of the
expression "in accordance with law" in Government v Muhammad
Akbar Mir (PLD 1971 SC. 60) as it occurred in Article 2(2) of the
1962 Constitution of Pakistan (predecessor of Article 4 of the 1973
Constitution). The rule of natural justice it was held is presumed to
be grafted into every law. According to this rule, no action
affecting the reputation (also life and liberty) of any person can be
taken unless he has been given an opportunity of showing cause
against the action proposed to be taken. Similarly, in every statute.
the presumed intention of the legislature is that one of the
qualifications of the decision-maker is that of absence of bias
(Diplock L.J. in Anisminic- (1967)2 All ER 986).
While Article 9 of the Constitution guarantees the right
of life and liberty, and ordains against deprivation of this right save
in accordance with law. Article 4 (which is not part of Chapter 1 of
Part II providing for the Fundamental Rights) state, as one of the
foundational principles of the Constitution, that-
"(1) To enjoy the protection of the law and to be
treated in accordance with law is the inalienable
right of every citizen, wherever he may be, and of
every other person for the time being within
Pakistan.
(2) In particular-
(s) No action detrimental to the life.
liberty, body, reputation or property
of any person shall be taken except
in accordance with law;
(b) No person shall be prevented from
or be hindered in doing that which
is not prohibited by law; and
(c) No person shall be compelled to do
that which the law does not require
him to do".
Anticle 5 of the Constitution provides:
156
157
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 97
"S. Loyalty to the State and obedience to Constitution and law;
Loyalty to the State is the basic duty of every
citizen.
Obedience to the Constitution and law is the
inviolable obligation of every citizen
wherever he may be and of every other person
for the time being within Pakistan."
In a system of government under a written Constitution, the written
constitution is the rule of law. (For a discussion on "The Rule of
Law" please see Part II Chapter 4, of the author's book "Judicial
Review of Public Actions", p 46). The maintenance of the rule of
law, so said Lord Bridge in X Ltd. v Morgan Grampian (1990) I
All ER 616) "is in every way as important in a free society as the
democratic franchise". There is, to quote Lord Bridge again from
another landmark case Bennet v Horseferry Road Magistrates'
court (1993) 3 All ER 138), "....no principle more basic to
any proper system of law than the maintenance of the rule of law
itself".
Articles 4 and 5 of the Constitution embody the essence of the
rule of law. (Manzoor Elahi v Federation - PLD 1975 SC 66, 101).
While Article 4 stresses the right to enjoy the protection of law and
to be treated in accordance with law, Article 5 stresses the
obligations and duties of the citizens. Thus, the Constitution is not
a code of rights only; it lays equal stress on obligations. Nobody is
above the law; everybody. "even the Prime Minister is, under
clause (2) of Article 5 of the Constitution bound to obey the
Constitution and law as that is the basic obligation of every
citizen". (Zahoor Elahi v Zulfikar Ali Bhutto - PLD 1975 SC 383,
393, 395). To every subject in this land, said Lord Denning in
Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers (1977) 1 All ER 696.
718), "no matter how powerful. I would use Thomas Fuller's
words over 300 years ago: 'Be you never so high, the law is above
you. To this may be added the following observations of Wilmot
CJ in that historic case, Wilkes v Woods (1769) 19 St. Tr. 1406):
"The law makes no distinction between
great and petty officers; thank God, they
are all amenable to justice".
So predominant is the position of Article 4 that it "confers a
right which is more basic than fundamental rights because while
the fundamental rights can be suspended, the right given by Article
4 cannot. (Muhammad Munir, former Chief Justice of Pakistan in
his commentary on the Constitution of Pakistan 1973, 1976 ed. p
82).
Article 199, clause (1)(c) of the Constitution, empowers
the Supreme Court to enforce the Fundamental Rights guaranteed
by Part II, Chapter 1, of the Constitution. Clause 1(b) of Article
199 provides that the High Court may, on the application of any
person, make an order-
"directing that a person in custody
within the territorial jurisdiction of the
court be brought before it so that the
court may satisfy itself that he is not
being held in custody without lawful
authority or in an unlawful manner"
It was held in Government of West Pakistan v Begum Agha Abdul
Karim Shorish Kashmiri (PLD 1969 SC 14), a case under Article
98 of the Constitution which was the predecessor of Article 199 of
the 1973 Constitution, that-
"The words 'in 2n unlawful
manner have been used
deliberately to give meaning and content
to the solemn declaration under Article 2
of the Constitution (now Article 4 of the
1973 Constitution) itself that it is the
158

inalienable right of every citizen to be
treated in accordance with law and only
in accordance with law........Law is here
not confined to statute law alone but is
used in its generic sense as connoting all
that it is treated as law in this country
including even the judicial principles
laid down from time to time by the
superior courts. It means according to
the accepted forms of legal process and
postulates a strict performance of all the
functions and duties laid down by law. It
may well be as has been suggested in
some quarters, that in this sense it is as
comprehensive as the American 'due
process' clause in a new grab".
Article 4, so said Salahuddin Ahmad J. in Manzoor Elahi case
(PLD 1975 SC 66, 109). "may be compared with the 'due process
of law in the American Constitution". The above cited Begum
Agha Shorish Kashmiri's case, so said the learned Judge, "supports
this view".
The cases determining the validity of proceedings under
section 11 of the Frontier Crimes Regulation provide an apt
illustration of what, in the context of Articles 4 and 9, the word
'law' means. Section 11 of the FCR gave unfettered powers to the
Deputy Commissioner. to refer the question as to the guilt or
otherwise of a person to the Council of Elders. No rule of
procedure or evidence had been prescribed for the proceedings
before the Council. The Council could make such enquiry 'as may
be necessary' including secret enquiries, there being nothing to
prevent it "from adopting methods which are arbitrary and
inconsistent with reason and the civilized decencies". Even the
proceedings before the Deputy Commissioner and the
Commissioner were not amenable to any rule which might be
regarded as a rule of 'due process' or 'best evidence'. It was
accordingly held in Samundar v Crown (PLD 1954 FC 228) that
160
"the proceedings which have been taken in the present case are not
to be regarded as proceedings in justice, but they are from every
point of view to be regarded as proceedings before an
administrative agency....". The process of decision provided under
the Regulation, so held Cornelius J. "is also foreign to justice as
administered by the courts". In Malik Muhammad Usman v State
(PLD 1965 Lah. 229), a Full Bench of the High Court of West
Pakistan declared the reference under sections 8 and 11 of the
Regulation and convictions based on them vaid, inter alia, on the
ground that they were "repugnant to the Fundamental Right No. I
(the same as Article 9 of the 1973 Constitution) it being now
settled that the Jirga procedure cannot be described as "law" in any
recognized sense of the term".
After considering all these cases, it was held in Manzoor
Elahi case (at p 120), that section II of the Regulation "does not
seem to me to be 'law' as contemplated by Articles 4 and 9 of the
Constitution".
We shall consider later the remedies that the
Constitution itself, by its Articles 8 and 199, provides for the
enforcement of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the
Constitution. It is sufficient to say here, in the context of the right
of liberty, that the most well-known and important remedy
commonly known as habeas corpus, is to be found in Article 199,
clause 1 (b), which empowers the High Court to direct that the
person in custody be brought before it so that the High Court may
satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody (a) without lawful
authority or (b) in an unlawful manner. The expression "in an
unlawful manner" in that clause seems to have the same meaning
as not "in accordance with law" in Articles 4 and 9 of the
Constitution. This is clear from the following observations of
Hamood ur Rehman CI in Begum Shorish Kashmiri case (PLD
1969 SC 14, 31):
"It is in this sense that an action which is
malafide or colorable is not regarded as
action in accordance with law. Similarly,
161

Page 99
action taken upon extraneous DE
irrelevant considerations is also not an
action in accordance with law. Action
taken upon no ground at all or without
proper application of mind of the
detaining authority would also not
qualify as action in accordance with law
and would, therefore, have to be struck
down as being an action in an unlawful
manner."
Article 10:
This Article can be divided into two parts:
(1) clauses (1) and (2), which provide safeguards against
arrest followed by detention;
(2) clauses (3) to (9) which provide safeguards against
preventive detention.
Arrest followed by detention
Clauses (1) and (2) of Article 10 read:
"No person who is arrested shall be detained in
custody without being informed, as soon as
may be, of the ground of such arrest, nor shall
he be denied the right to consult and be
defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.
Every person who is arrested and detained in
custody shall be produced before a Magistrate
within a period of twenty-four hours of such
arrest, excluding the time necessary for the
journey from the place of arrest to the court of
nearest Magistrate, and no such person shall
be detained in custody beyond the said period
without the authority of a Magistrate."
162
It is important to note that sections 60 and 61 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure 1898 provide similar safeguards against arrest.
Sections 60 and 61 Cr.P.C. apply to arrest without warrant, as
distinguished from arrest under the order or warrant issued by a
court. Section 60 provides that "A police officer making an arrest
without warrant shall, without unnecessary delay.....take or send
the person arrested before a Magistrate.......or before the officer in
charge of a police station". Section 61 provides that "No police
officer shall detain in custody a person arrested without warrant for
a longer period that under all the circumstances of the case is
reasonable, and such period shall not, in the absence of a special
order of Magistrate under section 67, exceed twenty four
hours........
Section 81 Cr. P.C. deals with arrest under a warrant. It
requires the police officer or other person executing a warrant of
arrest "without unnecessary delay to bring the person arrested
before the court before which he is required by law to produce such
person".
The reason why the Constitution makers thought it
necessary to give these safeguards constitutional protection is
obvious. It is to take these safeguards out of the reach of ordinary
or sub-constitutional legislation. It is now well-settled that merely
because such protections are also provided by sections 60 and 61
Cr. P.C. would not reduce the provisions of Article 10 (and Article
22 of the Indian Constitution) to a sub-constitutional level. The
effect of these provisions being incorporated into the Constitution
is that the rights conferred by them are as much Fundamental
Rights as any other right guaranteed by Chapter 2 of Part 11 of the
Constitution. (See State v Zia-ur-Rehman PLD 1973 SC 49,67;
Manzoor Elahi v Federation - PLD 1975 SC 66; Bazal Ahmad v
West Pakistan- PLD 1957 WP 388). Cases such as Government of
East Pakistan v Mrs. Rowshan Bijya Shaukat Ali Khan (PLD 1958
SC (Pak) 499) and Habib Jilani v Federation (PLD 1974 Lah. 53)
which seem to take the contrary view should be deemed to have
ceased to be good law.

The Rights conferred by Clauses (1) and (2)
Article 10, by its clause (1), prescribes the procedure to
be followed when a person is arrested to be detained, and requires
that such person-
(i) shall be informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds of
such arrest; and
(ii) shall not be denied the right to consult and be defended
by a legal practitioner of his choice.
Clause (2) of Article 10 requires that a person who is arrested and
detained in custody-
(i)
(ii)
shall be produced before a Magistrate, within a period
of twenty four hours of such arrest; and
shall not be detained in custody beyond that period of
twenty four hours without the authority of a Magistrate.
It was held in Manzoor Elahi case (PLD 1975 SC 66, 84, per
Yaqoob Ali J.) that any law or action which is violative of these
rights will be void under Article 8 of the Constitution.
Arrest, detention, custody
The safeguards and the protections, provided by clauses
(1) and (2) of Article 10, are for persons arrested and detained or to
be detained in custody. Our enquiry must therefore start with an
understanding of the expressions-
(i) arrest;
(ii) detention in custody; and
(iii) magistrate
Arrest: We have seen that the American Constitution, Fourteenth
Amendment, does not use the words "arrest". What in traditional
terminology is 'arrest' is according to that Amendment 'seizure of
person'; there is no doubt therefore that by reference to the seizure
of person, the Fourth Amendment was intended to apply to arrests.
(Terry-392 US 1).
'Arrest' is a public act that may seriously interfere with
the defendant's liberty, whether he is free or on bail, drain his
financial resources, curtail his associations, subject him to public
chloquy and create anxiety in him, his family and friends. (Marion
404 US 307 (1971)). At common law, "it is the right of every
citizen to be free from arrest unless there is in some other citizen,
whether a constable or not, the right to arrest him....it is a corollary
of the right of every citizen to be thus free from arrest that he
should be entitled to resist arrest unless that is lawful. How can
these rights be reconciled with the proposition that he may be
arrested without knowing why his is arrested"? (Lord Simonds in
Christie v Leachinsky-(1947) I All ER 567, 574-5)
The term 'arrest" has various definitions and that may
tend to confusion in the discussion of Article 10 of the Constitution
when the question is whether a particular seizure of person by a
public authority amounts to arrest.
The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, by its section
46, provides that "in making an arrest, the police officer or other
person making the same shall actually touch or confine the body of
the person to be arrested, unless there be submission to the custody
by word or action".
This provision obviously applies to arrests under the
Code of Criminal Procedure only and may not necessarily apply to
arrests under other statutes; in particular, this meaning of "arrest"
will not be binding upon a court in a case in which the question is
whether a seizure of one's person is or is not arrest within the
meaning of Article 10 of the Constitution.
164

According to Lord Denning. "when a police constable
says to a man 'come with me, I am taking you to the station"", this
is an arrest. ("The Due Process of Law" by Lord Denning, p 103).
In Holgate Muhammad v Duke (1984) 1 All ER 1054, 1056), it
was held that the word "arrest' as used in criminal statutes is a term
of art. First, it should be noted that arrest is a continuing act, it
starts with the arrester taking a person into custody (by action or
words restraining him from moving anywhere beyond the arrester's
control) and it continues until the person so restrained is either
released from custody or having been brought before a Magistrate,
is remanded in custody by the Magistrate's judicial act. In practice,
since the creation of organized public forces....an arrested person,
on being taken into custody, is brought to a police station and it is
there that he is detained until he is either brought before a
Magistrate or released on bail. In modern conditions, any other way
of dealing with an arrested person would be impracticable;
provisions for bail by the police are drafted on the assumption that
this will be done.
There is a common statutory definition of "arrest" in
America. It means 'the taking of a person into custody for the
purpose of charging him with crime. This ordinarily involves the
police officer's exercise of physical control over the arrestee for the
purpose of first transporting him to a police station followed by
what is called 'booking'. In Terry y Ohio (392 US 1), it was held
that-
"It is quite plain that the Fourth Amendment
governs 'seizures" of the person which do not
eventuate in a trip to the station house and
prosecution for crime arrests' in traditional
terminology. It must be recognized that whenever a
police offics: accosts an individual and restrains his
freedom to walk away, he has 'seized" that person".
Broadly speaking, there can be an arrest authorized by a court or
Magistrate (arrest under warrant) and an arrest without the
authority of a court or Magistrate (arrest without warrant). In State
166
of Punjab v Ajaib Singh (AIR 1953 SC 10), the respondent, Ajaib
Singh, had three abducted persons in his possession. The police
raided his house and took a girl named Sardaran into custody and
delivered her to the custody of officer in charge of the Muslim
Transit Camp at Ferozpur from where she was transferred to a
camp in Jalandher. The question was whether the recovery of
Sardaran was an arrest within the meaning of Article 22(1) of the
Indian Constitution, which corresponds to Article 10(2) of the
Constitution of Pakistan. It was held that the taking of Mst.
Sardaran into custody did not fall within the definition of 'arrest",
and that should have been the end of the matter. Yet, the court went
on to consider the question whether an arrest under a warrant of the
court was an arrest governed by Article 22(1) of the Indian
Constitution. The learned Judges expressed the opinion-they were
careful to say that it was not a final opinion- that such an arrest was
not governed by Article 22(1), for that Article applied to arrests
without warrant only.
The view also seems to have been taken in Ajaib Singh
that Article 22 applied only to cases in which the arrest was in
connection with any allegation or accusation of any actual or
suspected or apprehended commission of any offence of a criminal
or quasi-criminal nature. In Collector v Ebrahim Hajce (AIR 1957
SC 388) the respondent had been arrested in pursuance of a warrant
issued by the Collector under the Madras Revenue Recovery Act,
1864, for a civil debt as arrears of land revenue. It was held that
this was not an 'arrest' within the meaning of Article 22 of the
Indian Constitution.
These Indian cases fell for consideration in Bazal
Ahmad v West Pakistan (PLD 1957 WP Lah. 388) a case under the
Punjab Control of Goondas Act 1951. Under that Act, a Tribunal
was constituted with the power to declare persons, against whom
information was laid by a police officer, goondas or dangerous
goondas. The petitioners challenged, by way of judicial review, the
proceedings against them on various grounds. The petitioners had
been arrested in pursuance of an order of the Tribunal, and it was
held that Article 7 (the present Article 10 of the Constitution) was
"apparently attracted", The decision in Ajaib Singh case, it was
167
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 102
said, "takes too narrow a view of the corresponding provision in
the Indian Constitution". In Manzoor Elahi y Federation (PLD
1975 SC 66,86), the arrest of Ch. Zahoor Elahi, detenue, was in
pursuance of a warrant issued by the Additional District
Magistrate, Kohlu. The Supreme Court held that the arrest was
unlawful, on the basis that Article 10(2) applied to arrests in
pursuance of a warrant, for the detenue had not been produced
before a Magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest.
It appears that Ajaib Singh adopts the view enacted in
sections 60, 61 and 81 Cr.P.C. Sections 60 and 61 apply to arrests
without warrant and section 81 to arrests under the authority of a
warrant or order of a court. Section 81 provides that a person
arrested in pursuance of a warrant will be produced, without
unnecessary delay (not necessarily within 24 hours) befor: the
court before which he is required by law to be produced. So, the
Code treats arrest under warrant and without warrant differently.
Validity of Sections 60, 61, 81 Cr.P.C.
It follows logically that the view taken in Bazal Ahmad case would
raise questions as to the constitutional validity of sections 60, 61
and 81 Cr.P.C. For example, suppose a person is arrested under a
warrant, but is not produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours of
his arrest, and is produced before a court which issued the warrant
long after 24 hours. Such an arrest and detention would be, as
Bazal Ahmad holds, invalid under Article 10 of the Constitution.
Detention in custody: The protection under Article 10, clause (1).
is for a person arrested and under clause (2) thereof, for a person
arrested and detained in custody.
"Detain' is defined in Black's Law Dictionary to mean,
among others, to arrest, to hold or to keep in custody and
'detention' is defined therein to mean the act of keeping back or
withholding either accidentally or by design, a person or thing.
'Detention' may be-
(i)
ordinary detention, that is detention for a
criminal offence; and
(ii)
preventive detention.
Ordinary detentions are governed by clauses (1) and (2) of Article
10, and preventive detentions by clauses (4) to (9) of Article 10. As
clause (3) of Article 10 provides;
"Nothing in clauses (1) and (2) shall apply to any
person who is arrested or detained under any law
providing from preventive detention".
Clause (4) of Article 10 requires a law to be made providing for.
preventive detention to deal with persons acting in a
manner prejudicial to the integrity, security, or defence of Pakistan
or any part thereof, or external affairs of Pakistan, or public order,
or the maintenance of supplies or services. Under such a law, a
person can be detained for a period not exceeding three months
"unless the appropriate Review Board has, after affording him an
opportunity of being heard in person, reviewed his case and
reported, before the expiration of the said period, that there is, in its
opinion, sufficient cause for such detention".
Custody: The essence of custody is that-
"there should be lack of freedom to
move about where and when one
pleases, coupled with a physical power
immediately available to prevent an
attempt at breaking the restrictions
imposed as distinguished from the power
subsequently to punish a breach of such
restrictions".
And if a person is told that he must not go beyond certain
boundaries and
168
169

Page 103
"he sees or is told that if he did, physical
force would be available to prevent him
from doing so, there would.....then be
no difference of kind between his
confinement or custody and that of a
person confined in jail, though there
would, of course, be a difference of
degree". (Muhammad Anwar
Government PLD 1963 Lah. 109;
Begum Nazir Abdul Hamid v Pakistan-
PLD 1974 Lah. 7, 16-17).
V
On this view, an order confining a person to the limits of his house
will be confinement in custody.
Magistrate Production before him within 24 hours: Under
clause (2) of Article 10 of the Constitution, "Every person who is
arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before a
Magistrate within a period of twenty four hours of such arrest...."
We have seen that the US Constitution, by its Fourth
Amendment, protects privacy and provides that "no warrants shall
issue but upon probable cause........"
Issued by whom? On this, Fourth Amendment of the US
Constitution is silent. This gap has been filled by the Supreme
Court. The Constitution, it has been held, interposes a judicial
officer a neutral officer between the police and the suspect to
decide whether the probable cause and other requirements have
been satisfied. The requirement does not turn upon the labeling of
the warrant issuing authority. While the term 'judicial officer'
implies some connection with the judicial branch, the judicial
officer may not necessarily be a Magistrate. (See US cases Gates
and Shadwick noticed earlier).
Meaning of Magistrate: We have seen that in the constitutional
law of America, the term 'magistrate in the arrest and search
warrant context has not been used in a technical sense. Thus, the
arrest warrant issuing authority in Shadwick (407 US 345) noticed
earlier was a clerk of the Muncipal Court and the question,
"whether these clerks qualify as neutral and detached magistrates.
for purposes of Fourth Amendment". was answered in the
affirmative; and the clerk was held to satisfy the requirement of a
neutral and detached magistrate.
Does the term 'Magistrate' in Article 10 have a technical
meaning? Does it mean a Magistrate under the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898, or does it mean any neutral and detached judicial
officer authorized by law to perform this function?
In a general sense, a magistrate is a public officer
possessing such power, legislative. executive or judicial. as
government appointing him may ordain, although in a narrow sense
he is regarded as an inferior judicial officer. (Black's Law
Dictionary). The word magistrate' has several meanings:
arbitrator, assessor, judge, jurist, justice, legist, moderator, and
officer, official. (Legal Thesaurus by William C.Burton, 3rd
edition)
Suppose that in a special law, e.g. an anti-terrorism law,
an arrestee is required to be produced before the Judge appointed
under that law within 24 hours of his arrest. Would it satisfy the
requirement of Article 10? In view of the law developed by the US
Supreme Court, the answer ought to be "yes"..
The word 'Magistrate occurring as it does in the
Constitution may be understood in its generic sense of a judicial
officer and may not have the same meaning as it has in the Code of
Criminal Procedure. For the definition of 'Magistrate' in the Code
of Criminal Procedure, section 4(1)(ma), is for the purposes of that
Code only and the court, in interpreting Article 10, and in
determining the meaning of 'Magistrate' as used therein, may
adopt its generic sense and not the sense in which it has been used
in the Code.

Right to be Informed of the grounds for arrest:
Clause (1) of Article 10 forbids the detention in custody
of an arrestee "without being informed, as soon as may be, of the
grounds of such arrest".
Grounds- meaning and significance:
The word 'grounds' means that which can form a basis
for an order and what cannot form a true basis can hardly be called
a ground. (B.Z. Kaikaus J, Rowshan Bijaya - PLD 1966 SC 286,
323). As there must be grounds, there can be no order without
grounds; therefore, grounds are the basis supporting the order of
arrest and detention; they are the necessary substratum of fact upon
which the satisfaction of the detaining authority is founded (Shazia
Parveen v D. M.-PLD 1988 Lah. 611).
It was an established proposition at common law
that-
"If a policeman arrests without warrant
on reasonable suspicion of felony, or of
other crime of a sort which does not
require a warrant, he must in ordinary
circumstances inform the person arrested
of the true ground of arrest".
This proposition was stated in the speech of Viscount Simon in
Christie v Leachinsky (1947) I All ER 567, 571), and it was held
that an arrest without informing the arrestee of the grounds of
arrest is unlawful, and the arrestor is liable in tort for false
imprisonment.
There are practical considerations, as well as theory, said
Viscount Simon in Christie,
"to support the view I take. If the charge
on suspicion of which the man is
arrested is then and there made known to
172
him, he has the opportunity of giving an
explanation of any misunderstanding or
of calling attention to other persons for
whom he may have been mistaken, with
the result that further enquiries may save
him from the consequences of false
accusation......
The general proposition thus is "that it is a condition of lawful
arrest that the man arrested should be entitled to know why he is
arrested.....The exigency of the situation, which justifies or demand
arrest without a warrant cannot... justify or demand either a
refusal to state the reason or a misstatement of the reason. Arrested
with or without warrant, the subject is entitled to know why he is
deprived of his freedom, if only in order that he may without a
moments' delay take such steps as will enable him to regain it".
(Lord Simond in Christie, at p 575).
Christie illustrates that "the liberty of the subject and the
convenience of the police or any other executive authority are not to
be weighed in the scales against each other....." and that "a man is
not to be deprived of his liberty except in due course and process of
law"
As soon as may be:
The grounds for arrest must be conveyed "as soon as
may be". These words in clause (1) of Article 10 must be construed
in the light of clause (2) of Article 10, bearing in view the object of
the requirement that the arrestee must be produced before a
Magistrate. That object is to enable the arrestee to have a neutral
and detached judicial mind applied to the question whether there are
grounds for arrest. To borrow from the American law, there should
be screening by a judicial officer to determine whether there was a
probable cause for arrest. And as the arrestee must, under clause (2).
be produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours, that seems to be
the maximum period within which the arrestee must know of the
grounds. For, unless he knows of the grounds, he would not be able
173
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 105
to plead against them when he is produced before the Magistrate.
"As soon as may be" therefore means within a maximum period of
24 hours of the arrest.
Unlawful arrest and detention- their consequences:
(1) A person's arrest and detention are unlawful when
he is, under clause(1) of Article 10, not informed of
the grounds of his arrest. As was held in Christie v
Leachinsky (1947) I All ER 567, 579), omission to
tell a person who is arrested at, or within a
reasonable, time of arrest, (under Article 10 within
a maximum period of 24 hours of the arrest) with
what offence he is charged (that is, why he is being
arrested) is not a mere irregularity; it renders the
arrest unlawful and the person arresting, be he a
private citizen or a public functionary, liable,
among others, in tort to pay damages.
(2) A person's arrest may also be unlawful, when he is
arrested but is not produced before a Magistrate
within twenty four hours of arrest.
The view, at one time was that the mere fact that a person has been
arrested in an unauthorized manner does not, generally, affect the
subsequent proceedings. (See, among others, Prebhu v Emperor-
AIR 1944 PC 73). At that time, distinction perbaps was not made
between arrest in violation of ordinary law and arrest in violation
of the Constitution. Thus. the mainstream of the English authority
had followed the rule regardless of the circumstances in which the
accused was brought before the court, the court's jurisdiction to try
him was not affected. This rule was departed from in the recent
Jandmark case- Bennett y Horsferry Road Magistrates (1993) 3 All
ER 138) in which the House of Lords extended the concept of
abuse of process and beld-
"That if the court is to have the power to
interfere with the prosecution in the
174
present circumstances it must be because
the judiciary accept a responsibility for
the maintenance of the rule of law that
embraces a willingness to oversee
executive action and to refuse to
countenance behaviour that threatens
either basic human rights or the rule of
law".
"I have no doubt", said Lord Griffiths, that-
"the judiciary should accept this
responsibility in the field of criminal
law. The great growth of administrative
law during the latter half of this century
has occurred because of the recognition
by the juridiciary and Parliament alike
that it is the function of the High Court
to ensure that executive action is
exercised responsibly and as Parliament
intended. So also should it be in the field
of criminal law and if it comes to the
attention of the court that there has been
a serious abuse of power it should, in my
view, express its disapproval by refusing
to act upon it.
The appellant in that case was a New Zealand citizen who was
wanted for criminal offences committed in connection with the
purchase of a helicopter in England in 1989. The English police
traced the appellant and the helicopter to South Africa. The English
police, after consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, decided
not to request the return of the applicant through extradition process.
Instead the English police colluded with the South African police to
have the appellant arrested in South Africa and forcibly returned to
England against his will. He was arrested by the South African
police and held in custody until he was placed on an airplane
Ostensibly to be deported to New Zealand via Taiper. From Taipei
175

Page 106
he was returned to South Africa and held in custody until he was
placed, handcuffed to the seat. on a flight from Johannesburg
arriving at Heathrow where he was arrested by the English Police.
He was then brought before a Magistrate for committal proceedings.
The Magistrate committed him for trial to the Crown Court. He
brought proceedings for judicial review to challenge the decision of
the Magistrate. In staying the trial proceedings and ordering the
release of the appellant, Lord Griffiths held:
"The courts, of course, have no power to
apply direct discipline to the police or
the prosecuting authorities, but they can
refuse to allow them to take advantage
of abuse of power by regarding their
behavior as an abuse of process and thus
preventing a prosecution",
And Lord Bridge after noticing cutses from South Africa, the US,
and England, wrote:
"Whatever differences there may be
between the legal systems of South
Africa, United States, New Zealand and
this country, many of the basic
principles to which they seek to give
effect stem from common roots. There
is, I think, no principle more basic to any
proper system of law than the
maintenance of the rule of law itself.
Since the prosecution could never have
been brought if the defendant had not
been illegally abducted, the whole
proceeding is tainted......"
In Manzoor Elahi case (PLD 1975 SC 66), the detenue, Ch. Zahoor
Elahi, was arrested in pursuance of a court warrant in Lahore in
connection with an offence to be tried in Kollu, a tribal area in
Balochistan. He was taken to Kohlu without being produced before
176
a Magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest. It was argued on behalf
of the State that the initial illegality in arrest was not material, for
he was being detained in Kohlu for trial on charges under the
Pakistan Penal Code. This contention was repelled by Yaqub Ali J:
"We are not concerned at this stage with the
legality of the trial of the prisoner which has not
yel commenced but we are dealing with the legality
of his arrest. If it is found to be illegal the prisoner
will be discharged though he may again be taken
into custody in accordance with law and placed for
trial before a court of competent jurisdiction".
Right to Counsel and Right against Self-incrimination:
Their relation:
This subject will be discussed later under Article 13(b)
of the Constitution.
PREVENTIVE DETENTION; CLAUSES (4) to (9) of
ARTICLE 10:
The Constitution of Pakistan treats "preventive
detention" as a category apart, so much so that the safeguards
provided by clauses (1) and (2) of Article 10, as to ordinary arrest
and detention, do not apply to preventive detention. This is
expressly provided by clause (3) of Article 10:
"Nothing in clauses (1) and (2) shall apply to any
person who is arrested or detained under any law
providing for preventive detention".
The expression "preventive detention" has not been
defined in the Constitution; it has also not acquired a technical
sense. It means "detention, the object of which is to prevent the
doing of an act. Whatever the circumstances under which detention
is ordered and whatever the act which is sought to be prevented, if
the detention is not a punishment for what the person concerned
177
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 107
has already done, but a means of preventing an act, it is preventive
detention". (The Government of East Pakistan v Rowshan Bijya
Shaukat Ali-PLD 1966 SC 286, 320).
The object in giving constitutional status to preventive
detention is to prevent anti-social and subversive elements from
imperiling the welfare of the State, and the safeguards provided by
Article 10 are intended-
"to mitigate its harshness and one of
them is that in case of detention for a
period of more than three months, the
sufficiency of the cause of detention has
To be reviewed by the Review Board and
also that law cannot authorize detention
beyond the maximum period. Thus,
when the Board has found that there are
not sufficient grounds for detention, a
fresh order or extension of an existing
order will be without lawful authority".
(Begum Nazir Abdul Hamid v Pakistan
-PLD 1974 Lab. 7, 16).
It is plain that preventive detention makes an inroad on
the personal liberty of a citizen without the safeguards in a formal
trial before a judicial tribunal and it must be jealously kept within
the bounds fixed for it by the Constitution and the relevant law
(Rowshan Bijya case). It is an exception to the general rule that a
person may not be detained without trial and without a judgment of
guilt, and therefore the law authorizing such detention must be
strictly construed, and in case of doubt, in favour of the detenue.
Article 10, by its clause (4), authorizes the making of
law providing for preventive detention to deal with persons acting
in a manner prejudicial to the integrity, security or defense of
Pakistan or external affairs of Pakistan, or public order, or
the maintenance of supplies or services, and no law shall authorize
178
the detention of a person for a period exceeding three months
unless the appropriate Review Board has after affording him an
opportunity of being heard in person, reviewed his case and
reported before the expiration of the said period, that there is, in its
opinion, sufficient cause for such detention...." (For a detailed
study of the subject and the meaning of various expressions used
here. please see the author's book "Judicial Review of Public
Actions, V-I).
ARTICLE 11-SLAVERY, FORCED LABOUR

compulsory service, whether by way of
punishment in a criminal case or required for
a public purpose, as against the general
protection provided by Article 14 for human
dignity.
ARTICLE 12-PROTECTION AGAINST
RETROSPECTIVE PUNISHMENT
The general rule is that the power to legislate includes
the power to legislate retrospectively having effect from a back
date. For example a law made in November 2007 can provide that
179

Page 108
it shall take effect from November 2006 and even from a date
farther back in the past.
Article 12 is addressed to the Legislature the
legislative organ of the State-and enacts an exception to the above
-stated general rule and hence a limitation upon the general
legislative power of the State. It is a species of law protective of
vested rights, and embodies the basic principle of criminal
jurisprudence, namely, there can be no crime or punishment unless
it is in accordance with law that is certain, unambiguous and not
retroactive. The rationale underlying this principle is clear:
"Law-abiding members of society
regulate their lives according to the law
as it exists at the time of their actions
and they expect the law to be steadfast
and reliable they assess and weigh
the consequences according to the
demands of existing law, including the
requirements implicit in the existing
system of law and are entitled to feel
cheated if the law later lets them down
by taking or reducing their rights, or
increasing their burdens". (Qadeeruddin
J. in Nabi Ahmad case PLD 1969 SC
599,610).
This is especially important in the criminal law, where
citizens are potentially liable to a deprivation of life, liberty and
property if their conduct is in conflict with the law, (Lamer J. in a
Canadian case (1990) 56 CCC(3)65).
Article 12 reads
1)
No law shall authorize the punishment of a
person-
2)
a)
b)
for an act or omission that was not
punishable by law at the time of the
act or omission; or
for an offence by a penalty greater
than, or of a kind different from,
the penalty prescribed by law for
that offence at the time the offence
was committed.
Nothing in clause (1) or in Article 270 shall
apply to any law making acts of abrogation
and subversion of a Constitution in force in
Pakistan, at any time since the twenty third
day of March, one thousand nine hundred and
fifty six, an offence".
The corresponding provision in the US Constitution is
Article 1, Section 10, which in its relevant part, reads:
"No State shall pass any ex post facto law ......"
In the leading case on the point, Calder v Bull (3 US (3
Dall.) 386; 1 L Ed 648, (1798), the US Supreme Court held that
this provision bars only retroactive penal legislation, that is,
legislation affecting an individual either by making something a
crime after the act was committed or heightening the penalty for an
existing offence after commissien of the crime, and not retroactive
state enactments which affect property interests or contractual
obligations.
Though Article 12 of the Constitution of Pakistan does
not use the expression retrospective' or 'ex post facto', or
retroactive, yet it seems to have adopted the meaning of the 'ex
post facto laws given to the expression in Calder v Bull.
180

It is to be noted that there is no fundamental difference
between 'retrospective law' and 'ex post fact law'. Only the former
expression is used in respect of civil matters and the latter in
respect of criminal matters, which by their nature are more serious
(Nabi Ahmad case; this statement has been borrowed from Corpus
Juris Secundum Vol 16A Art. 435).
An illustration of sub-clause (b) of clause (1) of Article
12 is provided by Abdul Rehman v State (1978 SCMR 292). The
accused was tried for murder, which was committed in 1964. He
was convicted and sentenced in 1970 to death. His appeal to the
High Court failed, but in the Supreme Court, his sentence was
reduced to life imprisonment. He filed a review petition praying
that his sentence be reduced to transportation for life (20 years)
because the sentence of life imprisonment (25 years) was
introduced by the Law Reforms Ordinance in 1972, and at the time
of the offence he could be sentenced to transportation for life only.
It was held that the 1972 law could not be applied retroactively;
accordingly, his sentence was reduced to transportation for life.
Obviously where the sentence awardable under the new
law is different in kind but beneficial to the convict, Article 12 will
not apply. This is the view taken in Calder V Bull, in an Indian
case (Rattan Lal v State of Punjab - AIR 1965 SC 444) as also in
Bhai Khan case (PLD 1992 SC 14, 24).
Clause (2) of Article 12 creates an exception to the
above stated right. It permits the making of a retroactive law, a law
having effect from a back date, where there is abrogation or
subversion of the Constitution. Suppose that the Constitution is
abrogated or subverted today, but there is no law treating such
abrogation or subversion an offence; a future legislature, a year, ten
or even a hundred years from today, can under this clause, make it
an offence and punishable as such without the fear of being hit by
the prohibition against retroactive punishment. The reason for this
exception seems to be that abrogation or subversion of the
Constitution is, under Article 6 of the Constitution, high treason
and treasons are not to be allowed to go unpunished even if you
have to have resort to retroactive laws.
This provision reminds one of the only time in the
British history when the constitutional system of government was
overturned. Oliver Cromwell, the author of the revolution, died in
1659 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. In 1661, after the
restoration of Charles II as King, Oliver Cromwell's body was
exhumed and was subjected to the ritual of a posthumous
execution; his body was hanged in chains and his head was not
buried till as recently as 1960. This was a kind of retroactive
punishment.
ARTICLE 13: PROTECTION AGAINST DOUBLE
PUNISHMENT AND SELF-INCRIMINATION.
It reads:
"No person.........
a)
b)
DOUBLE JEOPARDY
be
or
shall
prosecuted
punished for the same office
more than once; or
shall, when accused of an
office, be compelled to be a
witness against himself".
The corresponding provision in the US Constitution, S
Amendment, known as the double jeopardy clause, reads:
"Nor shall any person be subject for the same
office to be twice put in jeopardy of life and limb".
182
183

Page 110
And before its incorporation in the Constitution of Pakistan, the
right against double jeopardy was provided in section 403 Cr.P.C.
That section is still part of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898; it
will be sufficient to refer here to sub-section (1) of that section:
"403(1) Person once convicted or
acquitted not to be tried for same
offence: A person who has once been
tried by a court of competent jurisdiction
for an offence and convicted or acquitted
for such offence shall, while such
conviction or acquittal remains in force,
not be liable to be tried again for the
same offence, nor on the same facts for
any other offence for which a different
charge from the one made against him
might have been made under section 236
or for which he might have been
convicted under section 237".
The right against double jeopardy as provided in the US
Constitution had, it was observed in one of the leading American
cases-US v Scott (437 US 82), its origin in the three common-law
pleas of autre-fois acquit (formerly acquitted), autre-fois convict
(formerly convicted) and pardon. "These three pleas prevented the
retrial of a person who had previously been acquitted, convicted or
pardoned for the same offence". As was held in Benton (395 US
784 (1969), the clause provides three related protections: "It
protects against a second prosecution for the same offence after
acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same
offence after conviction. And it protects against multiple
punishments for the same offence after conviction". As was said in
Green v US (355 US 184):
"The underlying idea, one that is deeply
ingrained in at least the Anglo-American
system of jurisprudence, is that the state
184
with all its resources and power should
not be allowed to make repeated
attempts to convict an individual for an
alleged offence, thereby subjecting him.
to embarrassment, expense and ordeal
and compelling him to live in a
continuing state of anxiety and
insecurity, as well as enhancing the
possibility that even though innocent he
may be found guilty".
There are, it was said-
"two venerable principles of double
jeopardy jurisprudence. The successful
appeal of a judgment of conviction, on
any ground other than the insufficiency
of the evidence to support the verdict
(Burks v US-437 US 1; 57 LED 2d 1)
poses no bar to further prosecution on
the same charge. A judgment of acquittal
whether based on a jury verdict of not
guilty or on a ruling by the court that the
evidence is insufficient to convict, may
not be appealed and terminates the
prosecution when a second trial would
be necessitated by a reversal.... the
law attaches particular significance to an
acquittal. To permit a second trial after
an acquittal, however mistaken the
acquittal may have been, would present
an un-acceptably high risk that the
Government, with its vastly superior
resources, might wear down the
defendant so that even though innocent
he may be found guilty".
185

pros
As to what is an acquittal, it was held that a defendant is
acquitted only when the ruling of the Judge, whatever its label,
actually represents a resolution in the defendant's favour, correct or
not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offence charged.
In Burks v US (437 US 1:57 LED 2d I) it was held that:
"Since we hold today that the Double
Jeopardy clause precludes a second trial
once the reviewing court has found the
evidence legally insufficient, the only
just remedy available for that court is
the direction of a judgment of acquittal.
To the extent that our first decisions
suggest that by moving for a new trial, a
defendant waives his right to a judgment
of acquittal on the basis of evidentiary
insufficiency, those cases are overruled".
Also embodied in the US 5 Amendment guarantee
against double jeopardy is the "extremely important principle in
our adversary system of justice" namely, the principle of "collateral
estoppel" which simply means "that when an issue of ultimate fact
has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue
cannot again be agitated between the same parties in any future
lawsuit". Although first developed in civil litigation, collateral
estoppel has been "an established rule of federal criminal law since
this
decision more than 50 years ago in US v Oppenheimer
(242 US 85-1916)". A striking illustration of this principle is
Ashe v Swenson (397 US 436; 25 L Ed 2d 459-1970) which will
be noticed in the discussion below under the heading "Prosecuted
and Punished for the same Offence"
An enunciation of the common law doctrine of double jeopardy is
to be found in the speech of Lord Morris in the House of Lords
decision in Connelly v DPP (1964) 2 All ER 401).
Is the ambit and scope of the right conferred by Article
13(a) the same as has been described in the American cases noticed
above?
If the origin of the right is and there seems to be no
doubt that it is - in the common law pleas of autre-fois acquit and
autre-fois convict, then the right guaranteed by the American
Constitution, 5 Amendment, and the right guaranteed by Article
13(b) of the Constitution of Pakistan, have a common root. It
should follow therefore that guidance can be gleaned from the
American cases to determine the ambit of the right under Article
13(a).
In Alamdar Hussain Shah v Abdul Baseer Qureshi (PLD
1978 SC 121), the petitioner, a sub-inspector of police, and two
others, were accused of killing a person in police custody. The
petitioner was tried before a Special Military Court (it was a period
of Martial Law) under sections 330, 342 and 304 PPC. The trial
had almost concluded when the martial law was lifted. The case
was then tried by a magistrate under section 304 PPC. Prosecution
evidence was closed on 07.2.1976. But the trial under section 304
PPC was challenged and the court of revision held that the
petitioner was liable to be tried under section 302 PPC. This order
was challenged in the High Court on the ground that the
prosecution would be against Article 13(a). It was held that in none
of the forums was prosecution pursued to the end and it could not
be said that the petitioner's trial would be against Article 13(a) or
against the general principle of autre-fois acquit or autre-fois
convict. It is only if the prosecution has finally concluded and
ended either in acquittal or conviction that a fresh prosecution for
the same offence would be barred.

PROSECUTED AND PUNISHED FOR THE SAME
OFFENCE:
While the prohibition in Article 13(a) of the Constitution
of Pakistan is against being "prosecuted or punished for the same
offence more than once", in the US Constitution the prohibition is
that "no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice
put in jeopardy of life and limb".
Though the US Constitution does not use the
expressions "prosecution" and "punishment" in the Double
Jeopardy clause, yet, "the two bedrock elements of the clause are
the prohibitions against reprosecution for the same offence
following an acquittal or a conviction". This guarantee, so said
Justice Brennan in Ashe (397 US 436; 25 L Ed 2d 469) "is
expressed as a prohibition against multiple prosecution for the
same offence", and in the words of Justice Scalia in US v Dixon
(125 L Ed 2 556 (1993).
"This protection applies both to
successive punishments and to
successive prosecutions for the same
criminal offence".
And successive prosecutions are barred by the Fifth
Amendment, so said Justice O'Connor in Heath v Alabama (474
US 82, 88 L Ed 2d 387 (1985), only if the two offences for which
the defendant is prosecuted are the same for double jeopardy
purposes.
The term "offence" is defined in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898, section 4(o), to mean an 'act or omission made
punishable by the law for the time being in force....... The
General Clauses Act, 1897, section 3(37), uses the same definition.
Though, these definitions do not by their own force
apply to the Constitution, yet they do give a fair idea of what an
offence means. It means a criminal offence.
For the doctrine of autre-fois acquit or autre-fois
convict, so said Lord Devlin in the English case of Connelly.
(1964) 2 All ER 401). "it is necessary that the accused should have
been put in peril of conviction for the same offence as that with
which he is then charged. The word "offence' embraces both the
facts which constitute the crime and the legal characteristics which
make it an offence. For the doctrine to apply it must be the same
offence both in fact and in law".
Muhammad Ayub v Chairman Electricity Board (PLD
1987 SC 195) illustrates that 'offence' here means criminal
offence. The petitioner, a Sub-Divisional Officer, was tried under
section 161 PPC and section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act,
1947, for accepting illegal gratification but was acquitted.
Thereafter, he was proceeded again departmentally; he was found
guilty and was punished with compulsory retirement from service.
He challenged the penalty as being violative of Article 13(b). It
was held that while sometimes the word offence is used in various
senses, it-
"here implies a crime infringing public
as distinguished from mere private rights
and is punishable under the criminal law.
Indeed this provision is a protection
against double punishment and the
punishment contemplated under Article
13 is a punishment that has been
imposed upon a person as a result of
criminal prosecution".
In Ashe v Swenson (397 US 436; 25 L Ed 2d 469), six
men, including Donald Knight and Roberts, were playing poker in
a house when three or four masked men, armed with pistols and
guns, broke into the house and robbed each of the poker players of
188
189

Page 113
money and other belongings. The robbers then fled in a car
belonging to one of the victims of the robbery. Shortly thereafter
the stolen car was found in a field and later four persons were
arrested. They were charged with seven separate offenses - the
armed robbery of each of the poker players and the theft of the car,
The petitioner, Ashe, was tried for robbing Knight, the
main question being as to the identity of Ashe as one of the
robbers. The jury found the petitioner "not guilty due to
insufficient evidence".
Six weeks later, the petitioner was brought to trial again,
this time for robbing Roberts; this time, the jury found him guilty
and he was sentenced to 35 years in prison; the verdict being that
he was one of the robbers.
The question was whether the acquittal of the petitioner
in the first trial barred his second prosecution and punishment. In
the words of Justice Stewart, the question was not "whether he
could have received a total of six punishments if he had been
convicted in a single trial of robbing the six victims. It is simply
whether, after a jury determined by verdict that the petitioner was
not one of the robbers, the State could constitutionally hale him
before a new jury to litigate that issue again".
It was held that the principle of "collateral estoppel" is
part of the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy
and that the second prosecution resulting in conviction and
punishment was unconstitutional.
As to what is the precise meaning of the term "same
offence", Justice Brennan, in his concurring opinion, noticed that at
common law, the "same evidence" test was applied. This test, so
held Justice Brennan, "is not constitutionally required". Instead, in
his view --
"the double jeopardy clause requires the
prosecution, except in most limited
190
circumstances, to join at one trial, all the
charges against a defendant that grow
out of a simple criminal act, occurrence,
episode or transaction. This same
transaction test of 'same offence' not
only enforces the ancient prohibition
against vexatious multiple prosecutions
embodied in the double jeopardy clause,
but responds as well to the increasingly
that the
wide-spread recognition
consolidation in one law-suit of all
issues arising out of a single transaction
or occurrence best promotes justice,
economy and convenience".
The word 'prosecution' or 'prosecuted' has different
meanings when used in different relations and has a limited or
extended signification according to the intention of the law-maker
and the context in which it is used. In Muhammad Ashraf V State
(1995 SCMR 626), two sets of accused persons were prosecuted
for murder in two separate trials; the appellant, Muhammad Ashraf
alias Achu, was common to both the sets. The trial Judge convicted
and sentenced the first set. As regards the second set of the accused
persons, the trial Judge acquitted the accused persons other than the
appellant; as regards him the trial Judge said that he already stood
convicted and sentenced in the first trial. The plea raised was that
in one of the trials the appellant was acquitted and hence his
punishment was contrary to Article 13(a). It was held: -
"It will be seen that the protection given
by this Article is against prosecution and
double punishment. By prosecution is
meant a trial followed by judgment of
acquittal or punishment. It includes the
entire proceedings starting with taking
cognizance of an offence by the court,
followed by examination of evidence,
addressing of arguments and ending with
191

Page 114
pronouncement of judgment. It seems to
us that if as a result of prosecution for an
offence the trial ends in acquittal, Article
13(a) is not attracted. Constitutional
guarantee is available only if the accused
is convicted and punished. Thus, if the
first prosecution results in acquittal, so
far as this Article is concerned, the
second prosecution is not prohibited. It
is, however, open to the legislature to
enlarge the scope of constitutional
further extend the
guarantee and
protection envisaged by Article 13(a).
Such extension of rule of double
jeopardy is to be found in Section 403 of
the Criminal Procedure Code",
It is to be noticed, so observed the learned Judge, that
the constitutional guarantee is confined only to duplicate
punishment and is silent in so far as acquittal is concerned. Section
403(1) however prohibits the second trial for an offence during the
course of existence of conviction or acquittal of a person, as the
case may be, in consequence of final adjudication of such an
offence by a court of competent jurisdiction. "Thus, the rule against
autre-fois acquit finds place in Section 403(1) and the counterpart
of this rule autre-fois convict has received recognition in the
constitutional guarantee embodied in Article 13(a)".
COMMENT:
If we may say with great respect, on the facts of that
case, the decision was correct, but the reasoning that led to it is, it
is submitted, open to question. The view that, if as a result of
prosecution for an offence the trial ends in acquittal, Article 13(a)
is not attracted; that constitutional guarantee is available only if the
accused is convicted and punished and that, if the first prosecution
results in acquittal, so far as this Article is concerned, the second
prosecution is not prohibited, does not take into account the history
192
of the principle of double jeopardy, as traced in the English and
American cases noticed ahove namely "that the law attaches
particular significance to an acquittal. To permit a second trial after
an acquittal however mistaken the acquittal may have been, would
present an unacceptably high risk....." (Scott case). This view also
does not take account of the fact that its origin is in the common
law pleas of autre-fois acquit (former acquittal) and autre-fois
convict (former conviction); most of all, this view ignores the
important word "prosecuted" in Article 13(a). As was said in US v
Scott. "A detailed canvass of history of the double jeopardy
principle in US v Wilson (420 US 332 (1975) led us to conclude
that the double jeopardy clause was primarily directed at the threat
to multiple prosecutions". This, it is submitted, is the law laid
down in Alamdar Husain Shah v Abdul Bashir Quershi, namely,
that it is only if the prosecution has finally concluded and ended
either in acquittal or conviction that a fresh prosecution for the
same offence would be barred.
In defining the word "prosecution", in Muhammad
Ashraf case itself, it was observed that the word "prosecution"
means a trial followed by judgment of acquittal or punishment. "It
includes the entire proceedings starting with taking cognizance of
the offence by the court, followed by examination of
evidence and ending with the pronouncement of judgment".
On this view, if there is no prosecution or trial there can be no
conviction or acquittal. So, if a person has once been duly tried and
acquitted, he cannot be prosecuted again and if he cannot be
prosecuted again, there will be no occasion for putting him twice in
peril for the same offence. This way of looking at the matter, it is
submitted, will save the word 'prosecuted' from being rendered
surplusage. It is no part of the court's interpretative function to
render words, particularly those guaranteeing valuable rights
relating to life and liberty, redundant.
Apart from the fact that Muhammad Ashraf case does
not enunciate the law correctly, the observations, such as that if as
a result of prosecution for an offence, the trial ends in acquittal,
Article 13(a) is not attracted, were not necessary for the decision
193
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 115
of the case and were obiter dicta. This is because the Court itself
I noted that the judgment of conviction "in point of time was
rendered first" and that "the appellant's subsequent acquittal cannot
reflect upon his conviction and sentence".
It is submitted therefore that the decision in Muhammad
Ashraf case should be treated as an authority for its own facts, not
as enunciating a general principle of law within the meaning of
Article 189 of the Constitution.
In this view of the provisions of Article 13(a), the scope
of section 403, sub-section (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
it is submitted, is the same as that of Article 13(b).
Does "prosecution" Include investigation stage
We have seen that in conferring the right to counsel the
US Sixth Amendment uses the expression "prosecutions":
"In all criminal prosecutions, the
accused shall enjoy the right ... to
have the assistance of counsel for his
defence".
We have also seen that the right to counsel, read with the
right against self-incrimination, has been held in Miranda and other
American cases to be available at the investigation stage when
interrogation of an accused person begins at the police station or
any other place. An arrest, so observed Chief Justice Warren in
Terry (392 US 1), is the initial stage of a criminal prosecution.
Should this extended meaning of "prosecution" apply
also in the interpretation of Article 13(a)?
We have seen that the idea underlying the principle of
double jeopardy as incorporated in the American 5" Amendment
and Article 13(a) of the Constitution of Pakistan is to save a
person, who was duly tried and convicted or acquitted, from being
194
subjected again to the "embarrassment, expense and ordeal" of a
second prosecution. The criminal justice process, it ought be
remembered, starts, not with the commencement of trial but with
the investigation and interrogation by the police and all that it
entails. The atmosphere at the police station, we all know, is not
only coercive but also derogatory to human dignity. There is
therefore greater need for saving such a person from suffering that
ordeal all over again. These are, it is submitted, reasons enough for
giving the word "prosecuted" in Article 13(a) the extended
meaning, so that not only the second trial but also the second
investigation and interrogation are also barred.
Article 13 (b)
RIGHT TO COUNSEL AND RIGHT AGAINST SELF-
INCRIMINATION; THEIR RELALIONSHIP
There is an intimate connection between the right to
counsel and the right against self-incrimination. As we have seen,
that connection was established in the famous American case of
Miranda which has survived many an attempt, legislative as well as
judicial, at its reversal. Miranda treated both the rights together.
Originally, both these rights were viewed as primarily, if not
exclusively, concerned with the trial stage; it was also, at one time,
the view that as regards the right to counsel, only the person able to
hire a lawyer could utilize a lawyer's services. As we have seen, all
these views have changed.
The right to counsel, as we saw, is guaranteed by the
American Sixth Amendment: "In all criminal prosecutions, the
accused shall enjoy the right...... to have the assistance of
counsel for his defence".
In the Constitution of Pakistan, this right is conferred by
Article 10, Clause (1): "No person who is arrested shall be
detained nor shall he be denied the right to consult and be
defended by a legal practitioner of his choice".
195
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 116
The right against self-incrimination is guaranteed by the
American Fifth Amendment: "No person shall be...... compelled
in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.
In Pakistan, Article 13(b) provides: "No person shall,
when accused of an offence, be compelled to be a witness against
himself".
We have seen that the expressions "in any criminal case"
in US Amendment VI. according to the US Supreme Court
decisions e.g. Miranda v Arizona (386 US 436). Rhode Island v
Innis (46 US 291), Brewer v Williams (430 US 387), include the
investigation stage; the right to counsel and the right against self-
incrimination come into play as soon as a person is arrested and his
interrogation begins.
If the provisions in the US Constitution and the
Constitution of Pakistan are considered in juxtaposition, one cannot
fail to see the remarkable similarity between their language. Both
the Constitutions use the words "compelled to be a witness against
himself. If we read Article 13(b) with Article 10(1), as we must, it
would appear, inexorably in our opinion, that when a person is
arrested and is served with the grounds of arrest, he is being
accused of an offence within the meaning of Article 13(b). It
should follow logically therefore that the right under Article 13(b)
read with Article 10(1), is more plainly designed to apply to the
investigation stage than the right under the American Amendment
V, which uses the expression "in any criminal case". As to the right
to counsel, the context of Article 10(1) is 'arrest', and there could
not be a plainer indication than this of the availability of this right
at the police investigation and interrogation stage.
Then, the right under Article 10(1) is a two-fold right;
the right to ccnsult, and the right to be defended by, a legal
practitioner, and this is therefore a much wider right than the right
under the US Amendment VI. The words "to be defended" in
Article 10(1) of the Constitution of Pakistan, are obviously another
way of saying "for his defence" as does the US Constitution.
196
This view of Articles 10(1) and 13(b) is reinforced by
the provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution of Pakistan which
protects the dignity of man and privacy of home and also provides:
"No person shall be subjected to torture
for the purpose of extracting evidence"
Long detention in custody, and long interrogation by the
police in privacy and in the suffocating and humiliating atmosphere
of the police station, we have seen, may amount to both physical
and mental torture.
If this discussion has stimulated sufficient interest in this
branch of constitutional law, then hopefully a beginning has been
made for the development in Pakistan of the jurisprudence of the
right to counsel and the right against self incrimination in the light
of principles enunciated in the American cases. However, in
embarking upon that course, the participants in the process will do
well to bear in mind the word of caution articulated above.
By way of illustration: The way to the development of
that jurisprudence can be illustrated as follows. Suppose that A is
arrested on the complaint of B that A has stolen his buffalo. He is
informed of the grounds of arrest, and A is taken to the police
station, where he will undergo the ordeal of interrogation in an
interrogation cell. Here, it is plain that A is being accused of an
offence. The object of the interrogation will obviously be the
extraction of information from A as to the whereabouts of the
stolen buffalo. This information from A will obviously amount to
self-incrimination. This is how the right against self-incrimination
comes into play.
A's relatives approach a lawyer, C, and ask him to assist
A in the protection of his right against self-incrimination.
guaranteed by Article 13(b) of the Constitution of Pakistan. Can C
do this?
197

In view of what has been said above, he certainly can.
As we saw, the right to consult and be defended by a legal
practitioner occurs in Article 10(1), which provides safeguards as
to arrest and detention. An arrest and detention by the police is
invariably followed by interrogation to extract evidence from the
arrestee. The intention of Article 10(1) read with Article 13(b) is
thus clear, it is to provide safeguards, including the right to consult
a lawyer before and during interrogation, for protecting the right
against self-incrimination of the arrestee.
Right to counsel under Article 10(1) of the Constitution and
Section 340(1) Cr.P.C.
Both these provisions, Article 10(1) of the Constitution
of Pakistan and section 340, sub-section (1), of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1898, confer the right to counsel. But there are
significant differences between them:
(1)
the right conferred by Article 10(1),
i)
ii)
is a constitutional right; and
is wider in scope and application,
in that, it is a right to consult and be
defended by a legal practitioner of
one's choice. The right is not
confined to any particular stage of
prosecution. It is available not only
at the trial stage that is, in the
courtroom only, but also at the
investigation stage.
The right conferred by section 340. subsection
(2)
(1)-
i)
is a statutory right; and
ii)
is available at the trial stage only,
As we have seen, a statutory provision inconsistent with
a constitutional right is void. Thus in Bazal Ahmad (PLD 1957
198
Lah. 388), section 6(i)(g) of the Punjab Control of Gondas Act
1951 which permitted the exclusion of counsel at trial was held
unconstitutional and in Moslimuddin Sikdar v Chief Secretary
(PLD 1957 Dacca 101) a trial in which the prisoner was denied the
right to consult a lawyer and be represented by him was held to be
violative of the right to be defended by a legal practitioner.
Article 10(1) uses the expression "legal practitioner" and
section 340(1) uses the word "pleader". These and the expressions
"counsel", and "lawyer" and "legal practitioner" are all used
interchangeably, and have the same meaning.
Counsel for the poor
Neither Article 10(1) of the Constitution nor section
340(1) Cr.P.C. says, expressly or even impliedly, that the right to
counsel is available only to those who can afford to hire a lawyer
of their own. As we saw, the law in America is that the right to be
heard includes the right to be heard by counsel and that any person
haled in court who is too poor to hire a lawyer cannot be assured a
fair trial unless counsel is provided to him by the State. The
language of Article 10(1), "nor shall he be denied the right to
consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice" as
compared with the American Sixth Amendment; "shall enjoy the
right to have the assistance of counsel for his defence", does
not present any linguistic difficulty. The right conferred is the right
to consult and he defended in one case and the right to "have the
assistance of counsel for his defence" in the other, and both are
substantially the same; both confer the right to counsel. And if the
right to counsel is conceded, the words "of his choice" in Article
10(1) ought not to be allowed to defeat that right. Those who can
afford can hire counsel of their choice and those who cannot must
be content to have counsel of their choice from among those
provided by the State. This way of looking at the matter will save
not only the right to counsel but also the equality clause, Article 25
of the Constitution of Pakistan: "All citizens are equal before law
and are entitled to equal protection of law" from being defeated. As
was said by Justice Black in Griffin (351 US 12);
199

"There can be no equal justice where the
kind of trial a man gets depends on the
amount of money he has.......
To be fair to indigent accused persons and to place them
on an equal footing with the prosecution and those who can afford
their own lawyer, Chapter 24C of the High Court Rules and
Orders, V.III, provides that accused persons tried for capital
offences should have the assistance of a lawyer at State expense.
Similarly, the High Court Rules and Orders, Volume-III, Chapter
25E, makes provision for counsel to be provided at State expense
to the defendants in appeals against acquittals and appeals for the
enhancement of sentence.
It is submitted that the Constitution, Article 10(1), and
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, section 340(1), make as
regards the right to counsel no distinction between capital and non-
capital cases and the right should, therefore, be available to all
indigent defendants accused of any offence. All criminal offences,
when tried, can produce serious, severe, consequences; fine means
loss of property, imprisonment means loss of liberty as also a
stigma, as well as a reminder, that the convict is literally a social
outcast, and death means loss of life.
We propose therefore that in order to make the
constitutional right to counsel effective, the State should provide
counsel to all indigent and poor accused persons, irrespective of the
offence with which they are charged being a capital or non-capital
offer.ce, and that a law to that effect be enacted and the High Court
Rules and Orders be amended accordingly.
Similarly under Article 10(1), the right to be defended
includes the right to be defended by counsel (Bazal Ahmad at page
234) and that means the same thing as the right to be heard by
counsel.
ARTICLE 13(b)-RIGHT AGAINST SELF-
INCRIMINATION
The source of the US Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination is the ancient Latin maxim of the common law:
"nemo tenetur prodere seipsum"
(nobody is bound to accuse himself).
There is no constitutional or statutory declaration of the
privilege against self-incrimination in English law, but it has been
recognized judicially in R v Sang (1980) AC 402) in Lord
Diplock's speech:
"The underlying rationale is, in my view,
to be found in the maxim - nemo debet
prodere se ipsum no one can be
required to be his own betrayer".
The history of the right is sometimes traced back to
Christ, who refused to answer the questions of his accusers at his
trial. We have already referred to the Star Chambers and to the case
of John Lilburne, whose struggles in 1637 resulted in the abolition
of the Star Chambers and the establishment of the right against
self-incrimination. To this may be added another interesting
historical fact namely that in Europe from the mid-thirteenth
century to the mid-eighteenth century a system of judicial torture
lay at the heart of the continental criminal procedure. The
application of torture was a routine and judicially supervised
feature of the European criminal procedure. Under certain
circumstances, the law permitted the criminal courts to employ
physical torture to suspected criminals to force them to confess.

right was identified (Miranda).

Amendment (protection against unreasonable

established (Boyd).
the scope of the right against self-
incrimination has been determined (Miranda,
Schmerger, Innis, Brewer v Williams); and
The consequences which follow from the
violation of this right have been laid down
(Miranda and others).
SELF-INCRIMINATION THROUGH PRODUCTION OF
DOCUMENTS:
We have seen that there is a close relationship between
the US Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and
seizure and the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
In Boyd (116 US 616 (1886), it was held that "the seizure of a
man's private books and papers to be used in evidence against
him" is not "substantially different from compelling him to be a
witness against himself".
This and other American cases were considered in Alpha
Insurance Co. v United Insurance Co. (1996 SCMR 1668); there
the police issued notices to the appellant Insurance Companies
requiring them to produce certain record. The notice was sought to
be justified on the basis of section 94 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. It was held that the word 'person' in that section
includes a person accused, and that the right against self-
incrimination under Article 13(b) was available at the investigation
stage. It is a privilege of the accused. It can be exercised against the
whole world, its exercise can be waived as well. The question
whether the right was violated or not, was however not for the
police to decide; that question was for the court. As soon as the
right was claimed, the police had "to hold its hands"; "The police
therefore cannot take the coercive steps that are reserved for it
under Section 94 Cr.P.C for getting, through the accused, such
documents".
THE RIGHT APPLIES AT INVESTIGATION STAGE:
Alpha Insurance is thus also authority for the view that
the right against self-incrimination applies at investigation stage
and the cases which hold otherwise must be deemed to have been
overruled.
"PERSON" IN ARTICLE 13(b)
CORPORATION:
DOES IT INCLUDE
The question whether the protection against self-
incrimination as ensured by Article 13(b) is available only to
natural persons, or is also available to corporations, was also
considered in Alpha Insurance. In doing so, the Supreme Court
noticed, among others the Indian case of M P Sharma v Satish
Chandra (1954) SCR 1077), and some American cases, eg, Edwin
F. Hale (201 US 43), Christopher C. Wilson (221 US 361 (1910),
US v Jasper White (322 US 694 (1943) and Joseph Curcio (354 US
118).
In the Indian case, the Supreme Court held that the
protection was also available to corporations. in doing so, the
Indian Supreme Court took account of the significance of the
words "to be a witness". In the American cases noticed by the
Supreme Court in Alpha however the view taken was that the
protection was available to "natural individuals" and not to
corporations. The Supreme Court in Alpha followed the American
view and on a review of the case law from various jurisdictions
held that-
"the guarantee contained in Article 13(b)
of the Constitution is not available to
incorporated bodies but is restricted to
natural persons".
In reaching that conclusion, reference was made to Article 260 of
the Constitution, which defines "person" to include any body
politic or corporate, unless the context otherwise requires. In clause
202
203
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 120
(b) of Article 13, it was observed, "only those accused are granted
protection who can appear as a witness against themselves. The
protection is against appearing as a witness against oneself. The
court then posed the question-
"Can a company or an incorporate
entity appear as a witness?"
Reference was then made to Qanun-e-Shahadat, Article 3 (section
118 of the Evidence Act, 1872), which "provides the ........ test for
persons to be witnesses", and it was held that--
COMMENTS:
"This Article of the Qanun-e-Shahadat
as well as its predecessor envisage a
natural person and not an incorporated
entity".
If we may say so with great respect, the view in Alpha,
that the right conferred by Article 13(b) is not available to
corporations lays too much emphasis on the words "to be a
witness" and too little on what the right is about. For the meaning
of the words "to be a witness", that view depends entirely upon the
provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat which is a sub-constitutional law
and therefore subject to the Constitution, Article 13(b) in this case.
In other words, the view in Alpha has made the Fundamental Right
conferred by Article 13(b) subordinate to a sub-constitutional law.
That is plainly against the provisions of Article 8 of the
Constitution. To illustrate, suppose that the Supreme Court in
Alpha had held that Article 13(b) applies to corporations. That
would have become the law of the land and anything inconsistent
therewith in Article 3 of Qanun-e-Shahadat would have been void.
Then, a corporation can be accused as well as be guilty of an
offence like a natural person. When found guilty, its directors or
other functionaries - all natural persons can be punished. So,
when it comes to punishment e.g. imprisonment, it is the natural
persons constituting the corporation who suffer.
204
As regards the American cases, one distinction is that
the word "person" is not defined there as it is in the Constitution of
Pakistan: here a person includes a body politic or corporate.
The real context of Article 13(b), it is submitted, is that
it is a protection against self-incrimination; that protection ought to
be available both to natural persons and those who are in law
treated as persons, for both can be accused of offences and both
can be punished.
It is hoped that the decision in Alpha will be
reconsidered in an appropriate future case.
"ACCUSED OF AN OFFENCE":
It has been held that though the US Sixth Amendment
right to counsel generally attaches-only after formal proceedings
have commenced, "if the authorities take a person into custody in
order to interrogate him or to otherwise facilitate the process of
making a case against him then under the rationale of Escobedo,
Miranda and other cases, the person is sufficiently 'accused' to be
entitled to the protection of the Sixth Amendment". (US v Gonveia
-467 US 180 (1984).
This, as has been seen, is the position in Pakistan. When
a person is arrested on a particular criminal charge and is informed
of the grounds of his arrest under Article 10(2), he is being accused
of an offence within the meaning of Article, 13(b), and the right
against self-incrimination as well as the right to counsel comes into
play so that the suspect can refuse to speak without the assistance
of a counsel.

ARTICLE 14: INVIOLABILITY OF DIGNITY
OF MAN ETC
Article 14 reads-
1)
The dignity of man and, subject to law,
privacy of home, shall be inviolable;
2)
No person shall be tortured for the purpose of
extracting evidence.
While the right to dignity of man and woman and the
right against being tortured to extract evidence are couched in
absolute terms and seem therefore to be absolute rights, the right to
privacy of home is subject to law.
SUBJECT TO LAW:
Like Article 14, there are a number of Fundamental
Rights in the Constitution of Pakistan, e.g. the freedom to profess
religion (Article 20), the right to provide religious instructions
(Article 22(3), and right to establish institutions to preserve and
promote language, script or culture (Article 28) which are subject
to law. It is a very bold assertion to make, as it was made in
Jibandra Kishore (PLD 1957 S.C. (Pak), 9) that these rights are
subject to law, and may therefore be taken away by law, That
assertion was rejected in the following emphatic terms by
Muhammad Munir CJ:
"The very conception of a fundamental right is that
it being a right guaranteed by the Constitution.
cannot be taken away by the law and it is not only
technically inartistic but a fraud on the citizens for
the makers of a Constitution to say that a right is
fundamental but that it may be taken away by the
law"
In Jibandar Kishore, the Fundamental Right in question was the
right to profess, practice and propagate religion. The learned Chief
Justice observed:
"I am unable to attribute any such intent
to the makers of the Constitution who in
their anxiety to regulate the lives of the
Muslims of Pakistan in accordance with
the Holy Quran and Sunnah could not
possibly have intended to empower the
legislature to take away from the
Muslims the right to profess, practice
and propagate their religion...... If the
argument is sound, it would follow
... that the legislature may today
interdict the profession of Islam by the
citizens because the right to profess,
practice and propagate religion....... is
under the Article as much subject to the
law as the right to establish, maintain
and manage religious institutions......
it seems to me that what Article 18 (of
the 1956 Constitution) means is that
every citizen has the right to profess,
practice and propagate his religion and
every sect of a religious denomination
has the right to establish, maintain and
manage its religious institutions, though
the law may regulate the manner in
which religion is to be professed,
practiced and propagated... the
words... cannot and do not mean that
such institutions may be abolished
altogether by the law..........
When a Fundamental Right is subject to law, all that it
means, it was held in Tikamdas Hiranand (PLD 1968 Kar. 703.717
206
207
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 122
FB), is that the right has been made subject to restrictions and
exceptions that may be imposed by law.
If we may add, to tell a person that he has a
constitutionally entrenched Fundamental Right but that Right can
be taken away by an ordinary law is no more than a teasing illusion
like a munificent bequest in a pauper's will (see the author's book
"Judicial Review of Public Actions" Vol.1, page 662 onwards).
"SUBJECT TO LAW" IN THE CONTEXT OF CRIMINAL
PROCEDURE:
The wisdom underlying the right to privacy of home
being subject to law is evident. The right to privacy of home cannot
possibly extend to saving criminals from being brought to justice.
There is therefore an obvious need for the power in the legislature
to make law authorizing the law enforcing authorities to enter into
the premises of those accused or suspected of crimes or other
unlawful acts for the purpose of search and seizure of persons
(arrest) and property in the exercise of their investigative powers.
The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, is one such law.
RIGHTS GUARANTEED BY ARTICLE 14:
Article 14 guarantees protection against-
i)
ii)
iii)
violation of the dignity of man and woman;
violation of privacy of home; and
torture to extract evidence.
It may, broadly speaking, be said that in the "dignity of man (and
woman)", is embraced the right to privacy of home and the right
against torture. They are related concepts. As was said by Saleem
Akhtar J. in Benazir Bhutto case (PLD 1998 SC 388, 621) -
"The inviolability of privacy is directly
linked with the dignity of man. If a man
is to preserve his dignity, if he is to live
with honour and reputation, his privacy
208
whether in home or outside the home has
to be saved from invasion and protected
from illegal intrusion".
Similarly, torture, whether or not applied to extract
evidence, is related to the dignity of man and woman (see Begum
Shamim Afridi case PLD 1974 Lah. 120).
Yet, as the right to privacy of home and the right against
torture have been treated in Article 14 as independent Fundamental
Rights, it is appropriate to deal with them as rights related to, but
independent of, the right to dignity of man and woman.
RIGHT TO PRIVACY OF HOME:
The right to privacy or as the American describe it the
right to be let alone, has in the Anglo-American Law, its origin in
the "castle doctrine": "a man's home is his castle" - a phrase
coined by the great English Jurist, Sir Edward Coke, in the early
1600's. (In this connection, William Pitt is often quoted: "The
poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the
Crown. It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow
through it; the storm may enter, the rain may enter; but the King of
England cannot enter- all his forces dare not cross the threshold of
the ruined tenement").
In Islam, the right has divine origin; the Holy Quran, by
its S.24: 27-28, ordains:
"O ye who believe, enter not houses
other than your own until you have
asked permission and saluted those in
them.......
The command not to enter into another man's house
without permission becomes in law a prohibition against
unjustifiable entry and unreasonable searches and seizures.

PRIVACY IN ARTICLE 14 COMPARED WITH OTHER
CONSTITUTIONS:
As has been observed in the "Judicial Review of Public
Actions" (by Justice Fazal Karim at page 675). "Article 14 is not as
elaborate in the description of the rights intended to be embraced
by it as Amendment IV of the American Constitution and is
content to use such general expressions as "dignity of man",
"privacy of home" and "torture".
Amendment IV of the American Constitution reads:
"The right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers and effects
against unreasonable searches and
seizures, shall not be violated, and no
warrants shall issue, but upon probable
cause, supported by oath or affirmation,
and particularly describing the place to
be searched, and the persons or things to
be seized".
Article & of the European Convention for the Protection
of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is even more
elaborate: it reads:
"1.
2.
Everyone has the right to respect for his
private and family life, his home and his
correspondence.
There shall be no interference by a public
authority with the exercise of this right except
such as is in accordance with the law and is
necessary in a democratic society in the
interest of national security, public safety or
the economic well being of the country, far
the prevention of disorder or crime, for the
protection of health or morals or for the
210
protection of the rights and freedoms of
others".
We shall see that what, under the American
constitutional law, is protected by the Fourth Amendment's
mandate is "one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion" by the police
or other state functionaries "which is at the core of the Fourth
Amendment" and "is basic to a free society" (Wolf - 338 US 25).
One may ask, is this right wider in its sweep than the right to
"privacy of home" in Article 14?
This is a legitimate question and needs serious
consideration. But we shall be content to say that even if the right
to privacy as developed in the American constitutional law is wider
than the right to privacy of home in Article 14, the general right to
privacy is covered by the "dignity of man (and woman)"
guaranteed by Article 14. This was expressly held by Saleem
Akhtar J. in Benazir Bhutto case (PLD 1998 SC 388. 621). Thus.
the general right to privacy is as much guaranteed by Article 14 of
the Constitution of Pakistan as it is by the American constitutional
law.
This should, in our opinion, lead to the conclusion that
what is protected by the American Fourth Amendment namely
"one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion" and by the European
Convention's Article & right to respect for one's private and
family life, home and correspondence is also guaranteed by
Article 14 of the Constitution of Pakistan. Dignity of man and
woman and privacy of home run into each other. The expression
"privacy of home" in Article 14 of our Constitution is a wide
expression, comprehending all that is included in the US 4
Amendment. This will also establish the relevance of the cases
decided by the US Supreme Court and cases from other
jurisdictions.
We have noticed some of the leading American cases on
the Fourth Amendment, and the readers may read them for such
guidance as they afford. They establish the following principles:
211

Page 124
1)

3)
4)
5)
The Fourth Amendment protects people, not
places. What a person knowingly exposes to
the public, even in his own home or office, is
not a subject of Fourth Amendment
protection. But what he seeks to preserve as
private, even in an area accessible to the
public, may be constitutionally protected
(Katz (1969)-389 US 347).
Searches conducted outside the judicial
process, without prior approval by a Judge or
Magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the
Fourth Amendment, subject only
specifically established and well-delineated
exceptions. eg. the concept of exigent
circumstances (Katz (1969)-389 US 347).
to
By interposing a judicial officer a neutral
officer between the police and the suspect to
decide whether the probable cause and other
requirements have been satisfied, the purpose
is to afford the neutral judicial officer an
opportunity to refuse a warrant, even if the
application for warrant is supported by oath or
affirmation on the ground that a search and
seizure is unjustified in the circumstances
(Johnson v US (1948)-333 US 10).
When an arrest is made, it is reasonable for
the arresting officer to search the person
arrested in order to remove any
weapon. it is the fact of lawful arrest
which establishes the authority to search, and
this is an exception to the warrant requirement
(US v Robinson-414 US 218).
A search deprives the individual's interest in
privacy, a seizure deprives the individual of
212
6)
7)
dominion over his person or property (Horton
-406 US 128).
There is an intimate relation between the
Fourth Amendment (searches and seizures)
and the Fifth Amendment (right against self-
incrimination); searches and seizures are
almost always made for the purpose of
compelling a man to give evidence against
himself (Boyd (1886)-116 US 616).
b)
What the Fourth Amendment
guarantees is the right to privacy
free from unreasonable state
intrusion; and
in order to enforce that right, and to
preserve it inviolate, all evidence
obtained by searches and seizures
in violation of the Constitution is
inadmissible in a court (Mapp
(1961) 367 US 613; 6 L Ed 2d
1081).
In India, there is no provision protecting privacy such as
the American Fourth Amendment and Article 14 of the
Constitution of Pakistan. Yet, relying on Katz and other cases from
the American jurisdiction to show how the concept had developed
there, and basing itself upon the right to life and liberty, the Indian
Supreme Court has held in District Ragistrar v Canara Bank (AIR
2005 SC 186) that the right of privacy protects persons and not
places.
As regards Article 8 of the European Convention,
concept of privacy was, as was pointed out by Lord Hope in Qazi
((2003) 4 All ER 461), explained by Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice in his
dissenting opinion in Marckx (1979) 2 EHRR 330):

"It is abundantly clear
that the
main and not indeed the sole object and
intended sphere of application of Article
8 was that of what I will call the
"domiciliary protection" of the
individual. He and his family were no
longer to be subjected to the four o'
clock in the moming rat-a-tat on the
door, to domestic intrusions, searches
and questioning; examinations, delaying
and confiscation of correspondence to
the planting of listening devices
(bugging)........
Torture: Torture can be-
i)
ii)
for the purpose of extracting evidence; or
for any other purpose.
Torture for extracting evidence is expressly prohibited;
but that does not mean that torture for other purposes is permitted
and is not prohibited. Torture affects the dignity of man and
woman which is an absolute right and must be preserved inviolate;
torture for whatever purpose applied must be held unconstitutional.
Torture for extracting evidence may be applied to the
suspects and witnesses alike and is prohibited in either case.
ARTICLE 15; FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT ETC:
Article 15 of the Constitution of Pakistan reads:
"15. Every citizen shall have the right to remain in, and,
subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in
the public interest, enter and move freely throughout
Pakistan and to reside and settle in any part thereof.
214
The rights under this Article are available to citizens, as
distinguished from "persons", only. They are-
1)
the right to remain in Pakistan;
2)
the right to enter and move freely throughout
Pakistan; and
3)
the right to reside and settle in any part of
Pakistan. (For a detailed discussion, please
see the author's book "Judicial Review of
Public Actions", Vol-1, page-678......).
While the right to remain in Pakistan seems to be
absolute right which means that no citizen of Pakistan can be
compelled, by way of punishment or otherwise, to be sent out of
Pakistan, yet it has been held in Nasrullah Khan Henjra v
Government of Pakistan (PLD 1994 SC 23) that this right "was
never intended to afford protection against extradition to citizens
who are accused of serious crimes in other countries".
The right to reside anywhere in Pakistan, irrespective of
a citizen's property or financial status (Edward v California - 314
US 160) the right of a citizen to enter into, or return to, Pakistan
(Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif v Federation PLD 2004 SC 583)
and the right to travel abroad (Wajid Shamsul Hasan v Federation -
PLD 1997 Lah. 617; Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif case) are all
subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law, in the public
interest.
Indeed, the question of the reasonableness of the
restrictions, whether imposed by primary or subordinate
legislation, is for the courts. (Abul Ala Moudoodi V Govt. of West
Pakistan PLD 1964 SC 673). An unfettered absolute discretion to
impose restrictions is not a reasonable restriction. (Montgomery
Flour and General Mills v Director Food - PLD 1957 (WP) Lah.
914) and one test to determine reasonableness can be the doctrine
of proportionately whether the restriction is so disproportionate
that it amounts to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut - as
developed under the European Convention for the Human Rights.

Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Assembly and Freedom of
Association:
The Constitution of Pakistan confers-
1)
freedom of speech, by its Article 19:
"Every citizen shall have the right to freedom
of speech and expression and there shall be
freedom of the press, subject to any
reasonable restrictions...
2)
freedom of assembly, by its Article 16:
3)
"Every citizen shall have the right to assemble
peacefully and without arms, subject to any
reasonable restriction....
freedom of association, by its Article 17:
"(1) Every citizen shall have the right to form
associations or unions, subject to any
reasonable restriction......
(2) Every citizen, not being in the service of
Pakistan, shall have the right to form or be a
member of a political party........
The right granted by these Articles, it will be noted, are
for the citizens of Pakistan only; secondly they are not absolute
rights. (For a further treatment of these freedoms, please see the
author's book "Judicial Review of Public Actions").
The US Constitution, by its First Amendment, forbids
the Congress to make any law-
216
"abridging the freedom of speech, or of
the press, or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble and to petition the
Government for a redress of grievances".
Freedom of association is not expressly mentioned; yet, it has been
held, in NAACP V Alabama (357 US 449; 2 L Ed 2d 1488), to be
part of the freedom of expression protected by the First
Amendment,
Decided cases in America indicate that it is not
significant whether one is engaged in speech, association, assembly
or petition. All four are now considered to be elements of a broad
right to freedom of expression.
The American Sixth Amendment guarantees that "In all
criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy
and public trial
The relevance of these freedoms to the criminal justice
process is that they are directly related to the basic function of that
process, namely, the prevention of crime and maintenance of law
and order. For example, "Unlawful Assemblies and Maintenance of
Public Peace and Security" are specifically dealt with in the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1898, Chapter IX, Sections 127 to 132 and
these provisions and actions taken under them can be challenged on
the ground that the restrictions imposed are not reasonable
restrictions imposed by law in the interest of public order etc.
within the meaning of Articles 16, 17 and 19 of the Constitution of
Pakistan.
Fair Trial and Freedom of Electronic Media:
Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan and the US
First Amendment protect the freedom of "press", but that
expression includes other media of mass communication e.g. radio,
television (AG v Guardian (1997) 3 All ER 316, 375). In other
words, liberty of the press is not confined to newspapers and
217

Page 127
periodicals. As was observed in Chandla v Florida (449 US 560; 66
L Ed 2d 740) still photographic, radio and television coverage are
all covered by the guarantee.
Free speech and fair trial "are two of the most cherished
policies of our civilization, and it would be a trying task to choose
between them". (Justice Black in Bridges v California - 314 US
252 (1941). There are instances when potential conflicts arise
between the media's right to report and the accused's right to fair
trial. When the case is a sensational one, the accused's right to
impartial trial may be severely threatened and that may require the
making of a gag order', barring the publication of certain
information about the accused.
The right of the public and the press to attend criminal
trials is implicit in the guarantee of the First Amendment - the
guarantees of freedom of speech, of the freedom of the press and to
peaceably assemble. (Richmond Newspapers v Virginia-448 US
555 (1980)). In Richmond, in the leading opinion, Chief Justice
Burger observed that "the Bill of Rights was enacted against the
backdrop of the long history of trials being presumptively open"
and that "the First Amendment can be read as protecting the right
of everyone to attend trials.......... so as to give meaning" to the
explicit guarantees of freedom of speech and press. Justice Brennan
emphasized in that case that public access to trials is essential-
"to achieve the objective of maintaining
public confidence in the administration
of justice".
The judicial system, "and in particular our criminal justice courts,
play a vital part in a democratic state, and the public has a
legitimate interest in their operations". (Justice Kennedy in Gentile
v State Bar-501 US 1030; 115 L Ed 2d 888 (1991)). As was said
in Landmark Communications (435 US 829 (1978))-
"It would be difficult to single out any
aspect of government of higher concern
218
and importance to the people than the
manner in which criminal trials are
conducted......".
In Nixon v Warner Communications (435 US 589
(1978)) cited in Chandler V Florida (449 US 560; 66 L Ed 2d 740
(1981), it was held:
"In the first place, there is no
constitutional right to have live witness
testimony recorded and broadcast.
Second, while the guarantee of a public
trial, in the words of Justice Black is 'a
safeguard against any attempt to employ
our courts as instruments of persecution.
it confers no special benefit on the press.
Nor does the Sixth Amendment require
that the trial or any part of it - be
broadcast alive or on tape to the public.
The requirement of a public trial is
satisfied by the opportunity of members
of the public and the press to attend the
trial and to report what they have
observed".
As to whether "televised trials" are inherently a denial of due
process, Chief Justice Burger, in delivering the opinion of the
Court in Chandler, referred to Justice Harlan's opinion in Estes v
Texas (381 US 532 (1965)) who began by observing that the
question of the constitutional permissibility of televised trials was
one fraught with unusual difficulty:
has
"Permitting television in the courtroom
undeniably
mischievous
potentialities for intruding upon the
detached atmosphere which should
always surround the
judicial
process. My conclusion is that
219
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 128
there is no constitutional requirement
that television be allowed in the
courtroom, and, at least as to a notorious
criminal trial such this one, the
considerations against
allowing
television in the courtroom so outweigh
the countervailing factors advanced in its
support as to require a holding that what
was done in the case infringed the
fundamental right to a fair trial assured
by the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.
In the context of a trial of intense public
interest, there is certainly a strong
possibility that the timid or reluctant
witness, for whom a court appearance
even at its traditional best is a harrowing
affair, will become more timid or
reluctant when he finds he will also be
appearing before a hidden audience of
unknown but large dimensions. There is
certainly a possibility that the cocky"
witness having a thirst for the limelight
will become more cocky' under the
influence of television. And who can say
that the juror who is gratified by having
been chosen for a front-line case, an
ambitious prosecutor, a publicity minded
defence attorney, and even 2
conscientious judge will not stray, albeit
unconsciously, from doing what 'comes
naturally into pluming themselves for a
satisfactory television performance".
Despite these grave potentialities' for distorting the
integrity of the judicial process, it was held in Chandler that the
220
Constitution did not prohibit a State from "experimenting" with
televised trial, and that, as Justice Stewart put it, "televising
criminal trial is not inherently prejudicial even when carried out
ander properly controlled conditions.........
A defendant may however show that the media's
coverage of his case - printed or broadcast - compromised the
ability of the Judge or the Jury to judge him fairly or "that the
broadcast coverage of his case had an adverse impact on the trial
participants to constitute a denial of due process" (Chandler).
Thus, in Irvin v Dowd (366 US 717), a unanimous
Supreme Court for the first time struck down a conviction because
of the effect of pretrial publicity, and because "the build-up of
prejudice is clear and convincing"; Rideauv v Louisiana (373 US
723) is another case in which a conviction was overturned because
of adverse media publicity and prejudice.
In Ali Nawaz v Muhammad Yousaf (PLD 1963 SC
81,82) a case under sections 497 and 498 PPC, grievance was made
of the fact that "undue publicity" given to the proceedings of the
case in the press had resulted in "contributing to an atmosphere
charged with dramatic effect" causing "considerable
embarrassment to the accused, the lady and to other witnesses in
the case". The Supreme Court held that "the circumstances that a
high officer of Government, who also held military rank. was cited
as an accused person, by a private complainant, and this at a time
when the country lay under martial law, were compelling
considerations that favoured an open trial so that justice should not
only be done, but should manifestly be seen to be done".
Freedom of Expression and Terrorism:
In any civilized and law-abiding society, the defeat of
terrorism is a public interest of the first importance, and therefore
some restriction on the freedom of the terrorist and his supporters
to propagate his cause, e.g. prohibiting the broadcasting of direct
statements of representatives of proscribed terrorist organizations
21

may well be justified in the public interest. (Brind (1991) | All ER
720) and in the interest of integrity, security or defence of the
country.
Freedom of Expression and Contempt of Court:
The right to freedom of speech and expression and the
right to freedom of the press are subject, among others, to any
reasonable restriction imposed by law in relation to contempt of
court.
There is, then. Article 204 of the Constitution, which
codifies the law of the contempt of the superior courts the
Supreme Court and the High Courts.
The position of 'contempt of court is thus unique; not
only does the Constitution, by its Article 19, permit the making of
a law imposing reasonable restrictions in relation to contempt of
court, so that the rights of speech and expression will be subject to
that law, but also it empowers the superior courts by Article 204 to
punish those guilty of their contempt, on the grounds mentioned
therein, one of the grounds being that the accused "does anything
which tends to prejudice the determination of a matter pending
before the court". Thus "Article 19 of the Constitution is in a way
subject to Article 204......It (Article 204) contains, if we may say
so, constitutional safeguards against any attempt to scandalize the
court or undermine its dignity in public interest. (State v Sh.
Shaukat Ali, PLD 1976 Lah. 355, 364).
Thus, when an application is made to commit for
contempt of court a journalist or editor for the publication of
information relating to the proceedings of a court, freedom of
speech and the public nature of justice are at once put at risk. (Lood
Scarman in AG v Leveller Magazine (1979) 1 All ER 745,757).

case PLD 1953 FC 247; Sir Edward Snelson

The task is to strike the best balance between the
constitutionally guaranteed right of freedom of speech and
expression on the one hand and the constitutional power to punish
contempt of court. In this connection what Lord Denning said in R
v Metropolitan Police Commissioner (1968) 2 All ER 319), which
case, in the words of Dorab Patel, J. in Yousaf Ali Khan case (PLD
1977 SC 482, 490) "is a milestone in the development of law of
contempt", deserves to be quoted:
"This is the first case, so far as I know, when this Court
has been called on to consider an allegation of contempt
against itself. It is a jurisdiction which undoubtedly
belongs to us, but which we will most sparingly
exercise. Let me say at once that we will never use
this jurisdiction as a means to uphold our own dignity.
That must rest on surer foundations we do not
fear criticism, nor do we resent it. For there is something
more important at stake. It is no less than freedom of
speech itself. All we would ask is that those who
criticize us will remember that, from the nature of our
office, we cannot reply to their criticism. We cannot
enter into public controversy. Still less into political
controversy.......
And Justice Murphy of the US Supreme Court said in Conway v
Johan (331 US 361)-

instance
In sum, the task is to harmonize the two important constitutional
provisions Article 19, which guarantees the right to freedom of
expression, including the right to freedom of speech and press and
which at the same time makes those rights subject to reasonable
restrictions imposed by law in relation to contempt of court and
Article 204, which expressly preserves the superior court's power
to punish their contempt. In harmonizing these provisions, both
must be preserved inviolate, and a fair balance struck between
them.
Articles 23 and 24: Protection of Property.
By Article 23, every citizen has the right to acquire, hold
and dispose of property in any part of Pakistan, subject to the
Constitution and any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the
public interest and Article 24, so far as relevant, provides that "No
person shall be compulsorily deprived of his property save in
accordance with law".
Thus, the right under Article 23 is for the citizens only.
hut the right under Article 24 is available to all persons - citizens
and non-citizens alike.
Just as no person "shall be deprived of life or liberty
save in accordance with law" (Article 9 of the Constitution), so
also "No person shall he compulsorily deprived of his property
in accordance with law". (Article 24 of the Constitution).
Save
Thus, what the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution
accomplishes by providing: "No person shall be........ deprived of
life, liberty or property without due process of law", is
accomplished by Articles 9 and 24 of the Constitution of Pakistan,
read together.
The expression "save in accordance with law" is
common to both Articles 9 and 24, and for its discussion and
whether it means the same thing as "due process of law" in the US
Constitution, the reader is referred to the comments under Article
It suffices to say that just as the punishments of death
and imprisonment involve the loss of life and liberty within the
meaning of Article 9, so does the punishment of fine and forfeiture
involve the deprivation of property within the meaning of Article
24.
This establishes the relevance of criminal procedure to
Articles 23 and 24. The punishments of fine and forfeiture both
involve deprivation of property. They are provided by the criminal
law (e.g. the Pakistan Penal Code) and the power to impose them is
provided by the criminal procedure law (e.g. the Code of Criminal
Procedure). In other words, these are the laws which provide the
authority for the courts to deprive an accused person of his
property, by imposing fine and ordering forfeiture. And if they are
valid laws, the deprivation of property under them will be "in
accordance with law".
Article 25: Equality before law
Article 25 of the Constitution of Pakistan reads:
"(1)
All citizens are equal before law and are
entitled to equal protection of law.
224

(3)
There shall be no discrimination on the basis

Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State
from making any special provision for the
protection of women and children". (For a

Review of Public Actions" Volume-I, under
Article 25, may be referred to.
of these
This Article gives effect to the most powerful idea of
equality before the law and equal protection of the law. This and
Articles 2A, 4 and 18 "are designed, intended and directed to bring
about an egalitarian society based on Islamic concept of social
justice". (Mushtaq Ahmad Mohal case-1997 SCMR 1043).
The corresponding provision in the US Constitution is
Amendment XIV, which as was said by the Supreme Court of
America (163 US 537; 41 L. Ed 256), is "majestic in its sweep":
Nor shall any state....... deny
to any person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws".
It has been acknowledged in Jibendra Kishore case
(PLD 1957 SC (Pak) 9, 39) and Brig. F.B. Ali case (PLD 1975 SC
506, 528) that the expression "equal protection of law" as used in
our constitution has been borrowed and derived from the
Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. This affords
justification, as the decided cases demonstrate, for a liberal use of
decided cases from the American jurisdiction.
The right conferred by Article 25 is the right not to be
discriminated against; it is "one of the most significant
requirements of the protection provided by the rule of law". (Lord
Woolf in A v Secretary of State (2003). All ER 816, 827); it means,
what Thomas Fuller said some 300 years ago; "Be you never so
226
high, the law is above you". (Quoted by Lord Denning in Gouriet v
Union of Post Office Workers ((1977) I ALL ER 696, 718) and as
was tersely put by the Privy Council in Matadeen v Pointer (1998)
3 WLR 18, 26). "treating like cases alike and unlike cases
differently is a general axiom of rational behaviour".
The doctrine of classification has been judicially
accepted as an integral part of the equal protection clause. As
explained in I.A.Sharwani case (1991 SCMR 1041), the clause
does not envisage that every citizen is to be treated alike in all
circumstances; it contemplates that persons similarly situated or
similarly placed are to be treated alike and that reasonable
classification is permissible but it must be founded on reasonable
distinction or reasonable basis. In order for a classification to be
reasonable, it should be based-
(a)
(b)
Procedural aspects:
on
an intelligible differentia which
distinguishes persons or things that are
grouped together from those who have been
left out;
the differentia must have natural nexus to the
object sought to be achieved by such
classification.
The equal protection clause does not demand uniformity
of procedure and this has been consistently held by the American
courts; as was said in Brig. F.B. Ali case:
"The legislature may well classify
litigation and adopt one type of
procedure for one class and a different
type for another. The American Supreme
Court has even held that a State may
make different arrangements for trials
227
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 132
under different circumstances of even
the same class of offences......".
In F.B. Ali case, the appellants were retired army
officers. By an amendment in the Pakistan Army Act, 1952, they
were brought within the ambit of the Act. The argument was that
this deprived them of the nonmal safeguards of a criminal trial, and
this was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable. The argument was
dismissed:
in the field of criminal justice,
a classification may well be made on the
basis of the heinousness of the crime
committed or the necessity of preventing
certain anti-social effects of a particular
crime. Changes in procedure may
equally well be effected on the ground of
the security of the State, maintenance of
public order, removal of corruption from
amongst public servants or for the
meeting of an emergency.......
Thus, provided the classification is reasonable within the
meaning of the equal protection clause, nobody has a vested right
in any particular procedure. Nobody can therefore claim that be, for
example, must be tried under the Code of Criminal Procedure, and
not under a special law, providing a special procedure for the
offences for which he is being tried. This principle finds expression
also in section 1, sub-section (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure
itself:
"It extends to the whole of Pakistan but,
in the absence of any specific provision
to the contrary, nothing herein contained
shall affect any special or local law now
in force, or any special jurisdiction or
power conferred, or any special form of
procedure prescribed by any other law
for the time being in force".
The above observations, it needs to be pointed out, do
not apply where the question is of inconsistency between the
procedure provided by the Constitution and the one provided by an
ordinary law. Indeed in such a case, the constitutional procedure
will prevail, for the constitutional rights of procedural nature are
vested rights which cannot be taken away or abridged by an
ordinary law,
Relevance of Equality in Criminal Cases:
The contest in a criminal case is between the State, all
powerful and all resourceful, and an individual, who may not even
be in a position to hire a counsel of his own. Self-evidently, the
contest is unequal. This is the reason that in all civilized democratic
societies, great emphasis is now laid on "procedural and
substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before
impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before
the law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man
charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to
assist him". (Justice Black in Gideon v Wainwright 372 US 335;
9L Ed 2d 799). There can be no equal justice, said Justice Black in
Griffin (351 US 12), "when the kind of trial a man gets depends on
the amount of money he has ..........".
We have seen that the courts in America have held that
indigent defendants must be granted equal access to all aspects of
the criminal process which are basic to the fair determination of
their guilt or innocence (Smith v Bennett-365 US 708; 6 L Ed 2d
39) and the US Supreme Court has consistently held that the
govemment is not permitted to restrict the ability to engage in
fundamental constitutional rights on the basis of individual wealth.
This is called "wealth classification" and is treated to be suspect.
The procedural and substantive safeguards to ensure
faimess and equal justice referred to above are now part of almost
228
229
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 133
all the written constitutions of civilized and democratic countries of
the world. We have seen that the equality clauses in the Indian and
Pakistani Constitutions have been borrowed from the American
Constitution and therefore the constitutional law as developed in
America requiring that indigent defendants are entitled to the
assistance of counsel at all stages of the criminal justice process is
equally applicable to Pakistan.
The European courts have developed the "equality of
arms" principle of fairness under the European Convention which
has roots in both common law and civil law traditions. It is a
principle which affords every party to the proceedings a reasonable
opportunity to present his case in conditions that do not place him
at substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent.
If we may venture to quote from a non-legal source,
great philosopher Immanuel Kant, in presenting the principle of
just retribution poses the question: what kind and what degree of
punishment does public justice adopt as its principle and standard?
and answers: "None other than the principle of equality that
is, the principle of not treating one side more favourably than the
other.......
As all are equal before the law, the court will not
countenance the contention that since a particular accused is an
important personality, the court should or should not interfere.
Such an argument was raised in Brig. Imtiaz Ahmad case (1994
SCMR 2142), in which the petitioner had retired from the army as
Brigadier and was then employed on contract as Director,
Intelligence Bureau. The Supreme Court recalled, for the benefit of
all concerned, the following observations of Wilmot CJ. in Wilkes
v Wood (1769) 19 St. Tr. 1406):
"The law makes no distinction between great and
petty officers; thank God, they are all amenable to
justice".
230
Chapter 4
REMEDIES FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
Constitutional Remedies:
The Constitution of Pakistan is not content merely with
identifying and guaranteeing certain Fundamental Rights only. It
also provides, by its Articles 199 and 184(3), the remedies for the
enforcement of the Fundamental Rights so conferred. In doing so,
the Constitution gives effect to the well-known maxim - Ubi Jus
Ibi Remedium (there is no wrong without a remedy); for. "it is a
vain thing to imagine a right without a remedy, for want of right
and want of remedy are reciprocal". (per Holt CJ. in Ashby v
White 2 Raym. Ld. 938, 953 quoted in "Legal Maxims" by
Herbert Broom, 10" P118).
The Fundamental Rights, with one notable exception.
are all directed against the State and State functionaries. The
exception is the right to liberty, which can be, by Article 199,
Clause (1), sub-clause (b), enforced against the State and its
functionaries as also against private persons.
Article 7 of the Constitution defines the term "State".
and Article 8 establishes the supremacy and predominance of the
Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II of the
Constitution, by declaring by its clause (1), that any law or custom
or usage having the force of law "in so far as it is inconsistent with
the rights conferred by this Chapter shall to the extent of such
inconsistency, he void". At the same time, it forbids by its clause
(2), the making of any law "which takes away or abridges the
rights so conferred", and declares that "any law made in
contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of such
contravention, be void". Thus, existing (that is existing at the date
of the coming into force of the Constitution - Article 268, clause
(7) as well as future laws must conform to the Fundamental
Rights granted by Chapter 1 of Part II of the Constitution. (For a
231
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 134
somewhat elaborate discussion of this subject, the meaning of
"void" and other related topics, the reader may refer to the author's
book "Judicial Review of Public Actions", Vol-1, Chapter 5, pages
567 onwards).
Article 199, by its clause (1), sub-clause (c), of the
Constitution makes express provisions for the enforcement of the
Fundamental Rights; it empowers each High Court, if it is satisfied
that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, to-
"(e) on the application of any aggrieved
person, make an order giving such
directions to any person or authority.
including any Government, exercising
any power or performing any function
in, or in relation, to any territory within
the jurisdiction of that court as may be
appropriate for the enforcement of any
of the Fundamental Rights conferred by
Chapter 1 of Part II".
In view of the importance of the Fundamental Rights,
and in the interest of their speedy and effective enforcement, the
Supreme Court also, by Article 189, clause (3). has been conferred
original, albeit somewhat limited jurisdiction, to enforce those
rights, Article 184, clause (3) of the Constitution reads:
"(3) Without prejudice to the provisions
of Article 199, the Supreme Court shall,
if it considers that a question of public
importance with reference to the
enforcement of any of the Fundamental
Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II
is involved, have the power to make an
order of the nature mentioned in the said
Article".
Enforcement of Fundamental Rights:
Both Article 199, clause (1)(c), and Article 184, clause
(3), use the word 'enforcement'. The significance of that word is
this: when the Supreme Court or a High Court decides that a law or
an action is inconsistent with or is in contravention of a
Fundamental Right, what it is doing is that it is enforcing the
Fundamental Right. The Court also enforces a Fundamental Right,
if it declares a law or an action in contravention of that Right void
on the ground that the restriction imposed is unreasonable. In short,
declaring a law or an action to be void as being inconsistent with or
in violation of a Fundamental Right is enforcing that right. Also
the making of any order of the nature mentioned in Article 199 and
the giving of any appropriate direction to any Government or any
public authority is a way of enforcing that Right.
In the field of Constitutional law of evidence, what is
known as Exclusionary Rule the rule that requires evidence
obtained in contravention of Constitution is inadmissible -
provides the means to enforce the Fundamental Right in question.
Awarding damages:
Awarding money compensation for the contravention or
violation of a Fundamental Right is another means of enforcing it.
The leading authority on the point is the Privy Council case of
Maharaj v AG of Trinidad and Tobago (1978) I All ER 670); that
case is remarkable for two reasons: first, it provides a private law
remedy in public law and secondly, it arose out of an order of a
Judge of the High Court, that is, what the Judge had done in the
exercise of the Judicial Power of the State. In the view of the Privy
Council, awarding money compensation in such cases involves no
change in the rule that a Judge cannot be made personally liable for
what he has done when acting or purporting to act in judicial
capacity. The claim in such cases is against the State for what has
been done by the Judge in the exercise of the Judicial Power of the
State. This is not vicarious liability; it is a liability, in the public
232
233
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 135
law, of the State, not of the Judge himself, "which has been newly
created by the Constitution".
Such compensation, it was held in Maharaj, would
include any loss of earnings consequent on the imprisonment and
recompense for the inconvenience and distress suffered by the
person during his incarceration.
On the same analogy, compensation can be awarded
against the State where due to the contravention or violation of a
Fundamental Right committed by an executive authority, c.g.
Police, in the exercise of the Executive Power of the State, the
petitioner has suffered mentally, physically or financially.
This is also the law in England (R v Governor of
Brockhil Prison ((2000) 4 All ER 15), in America (Bivens - 403
US 388; 29 L Ed 2d 619), in India (Nilabati v State - AIR 1993 SC
1960 etc) and also in Pakistan (Mazharuddin v State - 1998 P Crl J
1035).
In Mazharuddin v State (1998 PCY LJ 1035), the
liability to pay such compensation was held to devalve jointly and
severally upon the State and the public officer concemed in the
violation of the Fundamental Right
Modes of Challenging Violation of Fundamental Rights:
Violation of a Fundamental Right may be challenged
I.
before the trial court;
2.
in direct proceedings such as appeal or
revision, if any, provided by law;
3.
in collateral proceedings e.g. by way of
judicial review under Articles 199 and 184(3)
of the Constitution.
As regards (1) and (2), that is, challenge before the trial,
appellate or revisional court or tribunal, the objections can be that
234
the law under which the accused is being held or tried is
constitutionally invalid, or that the court or the tribunal has not
been validly constituted or that there has been a violation of a
Fundamental Right. All these objections go to the vires of the
proceedings and as the trial courts or tribunals in our country are.
generally speaking, conceived of as courts of law as well as of fact,
they are competent to decide these objections. As was said in Sahir
Shah v Shad Muhammad Khan (PLD 1995 SC 66, 244), this view
can be safely based upon a rule of statutory construction vouched
by respectable authority (among others, Chief Adjudicating Officer
y Foster (1993) 1 All ER 705) namely, that included in the
questions of law that a tribunal or authority is empowered to decide
is the objection based on vires. An invalid law is incapable of
conferring jurisdiction and of creating rights and liabilities, civil or
criminal, and a tribunal which is not constituted or appointed
validly under a valid law is no tribunal at all. To be told to
approach another court (e.g. the High Court under Article 199) to
raise such an objection obviously involves "cumbrous duplicity of
proceedings" and considerable expense and in any case may
amount to reducing the right to be dealt with in accordance with
law, guaranteed by Articles 4 and 9 of the Constitution, to a mere
nothing. For, as has been observed in "Judicial Review of Public
Actions" (at page 432):
"Judicial review jurisdiction is a
discretionary jurisdiction and to require
a person to invoke that jurisdiction is to
throw him to a discretionary remedy.
and to deprive him of his constitutional
right to be dealt with in accordance with
law".
In the words of Lord Fraser in Winder (1984) 3 All ER 976, 981)-
"He puts forward his defence as a matter
of right, whereas in an application for
judicial review success would require an
235

exercise of the court's discretion in his
favour":
and discretionary remedies, so said Kaikaus I in Abul Ala
Maudoodi case (PLD 1964 SC 673, 761),
"are no substitute for remedies to which
a person has a right even though the
discretion be a judicial one".
So the courts have sufficiently moved away from the
doctrine that vires questions are exclusively for the courts
exercising judicial review jurisdiction. (The subject has been more
fully discussed in the author's book "Judicial Review of Public
Actions" at page 426 onwards).
Coming to the collateral challenge, by way of judicial
review, under Articles 199(1)(c) and 184(3), the power to grant
reliefs under Article 199(1)(c) is expressed in the widest possible
terms: 2 High Court may make an order giving such directions to
any person or authority including any Government...... "as may

remedy, in one important respect, is
that it is available not only against
governmental authorities but also
against private persons; this is
comparable to the English writ of
habeas corpus.
If the court is satisfied that the
detention is without lawful
authority or in an unlawful manner,
it can direct that the person in
custody be set at liberty. (Zafar
Iqbal PLD 1973 Kar. 383 and
Noor Hussain PLD 1988 Lah.

an order requiring a person to show

holding a public office. This is
comparable to the English writ or

orders under Article 199, the reader may have recourse to the
author's book "Judicial Review of Public Actions" Vol II page

PART III
PARTICIPANTS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS
There are four groups of persons primarily responsible
for the administration of the criminal justice process. They are:
the police and justices of the peace;
the prosecutors;
iii)
the defence counsel;
iv)
the judges and magistrates:
Here is a brief introduction of these groups and of some significant
aspects of the institutional settings within which they perform their
respective roles.
General Observations
Chapter 1
POLICE
An influential group of thinkers has argued that just as a
society must maintain armed forces to defend itself against foreign
aggression, so it must maintain a force of internal peace keeping to
defend itself against aggression from within. That force is Police.
In safeguarding our freedoms, so writes Lord Denning in his book
"The Due Process of Law", (at p 102,-
"the police play a vital role. Society for
its defence needs a well-led, well-trained
and well-disciplined force of police
whom it can trust: and enough of them to
be able to prevent crime before it
happens, or if it does happen, to detect it
and bring the accused to justice".
In searching for principles of policing, Michael S. Pike,
the author of that small but very useful book "The Principles of
238
Policing"-a post-Scarman Commentary on Policing (the reference
is to Lord Scarman's report on the Brixton Disorder, Comnd 8427
HMSO) observes: The police are the public and the public are the
police aptly describes the collective responsibility for law and
order which existed in Anglo-Saxon times. A crime was regarded
as an act contra pacem Domini (against the peace of the Lord King)
and was not merely a crime against the victim but also a crime
against the whole community. The responsibility for 'keeping the
peace was placed firmly on the male population and this prompted
a mutual participation of all the citizens.
Hence the principle of policing by consent' which
Lord Scarman emphasized in his Report:
"If the Police are to secure the assent of
the public for their actions they must
strike an acceptable balance between the
three elements of their functions".
The three elements referred to by Lord Scarman are those
identified by Sir Richard Mayne when drawing up the instructions
for the New Police of the Metropolis in 1829 namely the
prevention of crime, the protection of life and property and the
preservation of public tranquility. Lord Scarman emphasizes that
the primary duty of the police is to maintain the 'Queen's peace'
and that a police officer's first duty is to cooperate with others in
maintaining the normal state of society'. He considers that the
police officer's second duty is to enforce the law but if law
enforcement puts at risk public tranquility he will have to make a
difficult decision:
"Inevitably there will be situations in
which the public interest requires him to
test the wisdom of law enforcement by
its likely effect upon public order. Law
enforcement, involving as it must, the
possibility that force may have to be
used, can cause acute friction and
239

division in a community - particularly if
the community is tense and the cause of
the law-breaker not without support.
'Fiat Justitia; ruat caelum' (let justice be
done, though heavens collapse) may be
apt for a judge but it can lead a
policeman into tactics disruptive of the
very fabric of society".
Lord Scarman refers, in his Report, to "two well known
principles of policing a free society', as "consent and balance" and
"independence and accountability". Crucial to the principle of
policing by consent are police ethics, police discretion and
sensitive policing. The independence of the police from political or
other control, as has been observed in "The Principles of Policing
(at page-23), "Though not totally accepted, is well established but
this independence does not give the police the right to act
irresponsibly. They are accountable in many ways and....... one of
the most important regulating factor is that the police must secure
public approval for their actions". In other words, independence
does not mean irresponsibility.
Most importantly, the police are accountable to law.
Execution and administration of laws belong to the Executive
Organ of the State, to the Govemment, and it is an established
constitutional principle, in Great Britain (see Easter Trust Co case
- (1915) AC 750, 759; M. v Home Office (1993) 3 All ER 537,
541); in America (see US V Nixon 418 US 683, 41 L Ed 2d
1039) as well as in Pakistan (See Syed Sharif-ud-din Pirzada v
Federation PLD 1973 Kar. 132, 147; Mian Nawaz Sharif case
PLD 1993 SC 473, per Nasim Hassan Shah J and Muhammad
Bashir v SHO (PLD 2007 SC 539, 547) that the Executive has no
power except such as has been given to it by the constitution and
law. The police are an instrumentality of the Government, the
Executive organ of the State, and must work within the framework
of the law the Constitution and statutory law as interpreted by
the courts. For what they do, that is, are empowered to do, affects
the life. liberty and property of the citizens and by Articles 9 and
240
24 of the Constitution, no person "shall be deprived" of them "save
in accordance with law". In R v Met. Police Commissioner (1968)
2 WLR 893, what Lord Denning said of the duties of the Chief
Constable is worth repeating:
"I know it to be the duty
of
every Chief Constable to enforce the law
of the land........... he is not the servant
of any save of the law itself. The
responsibility of law enforcement lies on
him. He is answerable to the law and to
the law alone".
A police service, it has been said, is a reflection of the
society it serves. Thus the British Police and their capacity for
controlling incidents of disorder without resorting to extreme
measures of control "have been the envy of the world and they
have been regarded as a model on which policing in a democracy
can be based". (The Principles of Policing, p.ix). So much so, that
the British police did not, till recently, carry weapons beyond a
simple billy club'. Among some of the significant reasons for the
British reluctance to arm their police, one was the fact that the
British citizens are themselves unarined. The "right to bear arms"
is foreign to English law. Though it is upon the British model that
much of the early American policing was based (see Frank
Schmalleger's "Criminal Justice Today" 4" ed pp 160, 630), yet in
a tradition dating back to the days of the "wild west", American
law enforcement officers routinely carry guns and are, especially
on the federal level, routinely well armed.
There is a very low rate of crime in Japan and the one
thing which, more than any other, may account for it is "a sense of
personal honour and responsibility that makes up the Japanese
national character, Symptomatic of the interpersonal trust which
underlies social relationship in Japan is a police-run program that
allows anyone to go to a police station or police call box and
borrow money (usually $ 10-20) at any time on the honour
system. ...it surprises Americans (and Pakistanis also) to
241

("Criminal Justice Today" by Frank Schmalleger, 4" ed. p. 21).
learn that almost all the borrowed money is quickly returned
Position under the Constitution and Police Order
"Police" and "Law and Order" as legislative matters, do
not figure in the 'Federal List' or the 'Concurrent List' in the 4
Schedule to the Constitution of Pakistan. Under the Constitution.
therefore, these are matters in respect of which the Provincial
Legislatures have exclusive power to make laws, and to establish a
police force for that purpose. Indeed, there are matters on which
the Parliament has either the exclusive or the concurrent legislative
power to legislate. For example:-
a.
b.
Federal Intelligence Bureau; detention for
reasons of State (item 1 of the Federal
Legislative List, Part 1);
Offences against laws in respect of the matters
in Part 1 and Part II of the Federal Legislative
List (item 56 of Part I and item 6 of Part II of
that List).
It should be noted that the power to create offences includes the
power to have them investigated, and this brings in a law
enforcement agency, such as police.
C.
Preventive detention for reasons connected
with maintenance of public order etc, persons
subjected to such detention (items 14 and 15
of the Concurrent List).
At present, we have the Police Order 2002, which
provides the institutional setting in which the police operates in the
Provinces and the Islamabad Capital Territory. This Order repealed
the Police Act, 1861, which was a relic of the colonial period
consisting of strategies tailored to the needs of the colonial power.
The Police Order was an extra constitutional measure; a gift of the
military rule imposed in 1999. It has borrowed concepts and
practices from other countries, e.g. US, UK, and imposed them
upon Pakistan. It applies to the whole of Pakistan and the
legislative power to repeal, amend or alter it was subject to the
condition of previous sanction of the President accorded after
consultation with the Prime Minister. (Article 268(2) and items 35
of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution). By the proviso to clause
(5) of Article 268, "the laws mentioned at entry 35 in the
Sixth Schedule shall stand omitted after six years". This proviso
was enacted by the Constitution (17 Amdt) Act of 2003, and the
position now is that counting the period of six years from the date
of the coming into force of the 17th Amendment the condition of
previous sanction of the President ceased to apply somewhere in
2009, and the Police Order has required the status of a pure
provincial law, so far as the provincial territories are concerned.
In the Code of Criminal Procedure, two expressions
occur frequently namely 'officer in charge of a police station' and
'police officer. The former is defined in section 4(p) of the Code
of Criminal Procedure to include, when the officer in charge of the
police station is absent, the police officer present at the police
station who is next in rank to the officer in charge and is above the
rank of constable. Section 551 Cr.P.C. provides that a police officer
superior in rank to an officer in charge of a police station may
exercise the same powers as may be exercised by the officer in
charge of a police station.
In the Police Order, Article 2(1), clause (xviii), "police
officer" means a member of the police who is subject to the Police
Order. The expression "police station" means any post or place
declared to be a police station by the Provincial Government.
The objects of the Police Order, as stated in its
preamble, are:-
242
243

Page 140

iii.
to ensure that the police performs its functions
according to the Constitution, law and
democratic aspirations of the people;
to ensure that in the performance of its
functions, it is professional, service-oriented
and accountable to the people;
to re-define the police role, its duties and
responsibilities; and
iv.
to
reconstruct the police for efficient
prevention and detection of crime and
maintenance of law and order.
The principal job of the police is to deal with actual and
potential violations of the law. Actual violation means violation
which has already taken place and potential violation meats
prospective crimes. Although when we refer to the police we
generally mean the law enforcement officers yet enforcement of
the criminal law, that is, the investigation of crimes, and
apprehension of criminals with a view to bringing them to justice is
one of the several tasks allocated to the police. The professional
roles of the police also include the providing of basic social
services, the maintenance of order and the prevention of crime.
Thus, the police have multiple functions to perform.
Like the police laws in many other countries, one of the
objects of the Police Order is to humanize the police role. Thus, it
is, under Article 3 of the Police Order, the duty of every police
officer to behave with the public with due decorum and courtesy, to
promote amity, to guide and assist the poor, disabled, the
physically weak and the children and to help such individuals as
are in danger of physical harm. By clause (2) of Article 4 of the
Police Order the police are required to afford relief to these in
distress, such as victims of road accidents, their heirs and
dependants, and educate such victims etc to enable them to assert
and enforce their rights. These are the basic social services which it
244
is now the statutory and, therefore, the legal duty of the police to
provide.
Article 4, clause (1), of the Police Order enumerates the
duties of the police officers, which, among others, include the duty:
ii)
iB)
iv)
to ensure that the rights and privileges, under
the law, of a person taken in custody, are
protected;
to ensure that the information about the arrest
of a person is promptly communicated to a
person of his choice;
to prevent the commission of offences and
public nuisance;
to keep order at public places, and to prevent
harassment of women and children at such
places:
iii)
to detect crimes and bring offenders to justice;
iv)
to obey and promptly execute all lawful
orders.
Article 8 of the Police Order provides that the police
shall be organized on functional basis into branches, divisions etc.
which may include, among others, investigation branch, crime
against women branch, legal affairs branch.
Under Article 18 of the Police Order, the head of
Investigation in a general police area is an Additional Inspector
General, the head of investigation in a capital city district or city
district is a Senior Superintendent of Police and the head of
investigation in a district is a Superintendent of Police. The
Superintendent of Police investigation is responsible to his own
245

Page 141
investigation hierarchy and subject to the general control of the
District Police Officer. All registered cases are to be investigated
by the investigation staff in the district under the supervision of the
head of investigation. The District Police Officer cannot, clause (5)
of Article 18 expressly so provides, interfere with the process of
investigation", but shall provide full support to the head of
investigation in the performance of his duties. Investigation is
normally not to be changed from one police officer to another; it
can be changed only on the recommendation of a board of three
senior police officers. Article 33 of the Police Order establishes a
relationship between the district police and the district local
government. The head of the district police is responsible to the
Zila Nazim for police functions under the Police Order, but the
Nazim cannot interfere with any investigation or with the
prosecution of criminal cases. However, under Article 35 of the
Police Order, the Zila Nazim may direct the Head of District
Police, if he has reason to believe that any police official has
committed an act of neglect etc, to take action against such official,
This action may result in the registration of a criminal case and
arrest of the official.
The object sought to be achieved by a separate and
independent investigation branch scems to be to ensure
specialization and effectiveness of the investigation of crimes, and
the object can be achieved only if the investigation branch is not
involved in other unrelated activities.
Article 167 of the Police Order requires a register of
daily diary in prescribed form to be maintained at all police
stations; in that register are to be recorded the names of all
complainants, persons arrested, the offences charged against them,
the weapons or property taken into possession and the names of the
witnesses examined. The Sessions Judge may call for and inspect
such diary.
This provision is analogous to section 172 of the Code
of Criminal Procedures.
There are countries in which the key element of the
police structure is the fragmentation of the police authority among
a large number of separate units of government. For example, in
the United States at the federal level, the primary police agency is
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, at the State level, the key
general agency is the state police; but by far the most general
agencies are those found at the local government level. In those
countries, a centralized police force is viewed with deep suspicion,
for fear that it would be misused by politicians; decentralization of
police authority is considered a safeguard against such misuse and
subversion of democracy.
Under the Police Order, we have a highly centralized
general police force at all levels, with the Federal Government
playing the dominant role. For example, under Article 11 of the
Police Order, the Provincial Inspector General of Police is to be
appointed out of a panel of three police officers recommended by
the Federal Government.
The scheme of the Police Order seems to militate against
the principle of police autonomy which means, first, independence
of the police from the political forces in the community and from
the community in general; second, independence of the police
officer within the department. The scheme also seems to offend
against the doctrine of "constabulary independence" (Fisher-
(1930)2 KB 364) which regards the police constable as an
independent officer who cannot be instructed by a governmental
agency about how to exercise his powers. The constable is
accountable only to law.
Every member of the police on appointment is required
by Article 24 of the Police Order to take an oath that he shall inter
alia be faithful and bear true allegiance to Pakistan and to the
Constitution; that he shall honestly, impartially and truly serve the
people without fear, favour or affection, malice or ill-will; and
that he shall discharge his functions according to law and in such
manner as to protect the dignity and rights of the citizen. We may
presume that the vast majority of the men who take this oath do so
246
247
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 142
seriously and that they will and do perform their duties honestly.
Also, the police have wide discretionary powers, e.g. power to
arrest, search, seize; the power of stopping, questioning, frisking of
the so-called suspicious persons, of the use of informants and
undercover agents. These are great powers, and are liable to abuse.
As has been said. power corrupts and absolute power corrupts
absolutely. They are often abused and have rightly led the critics to
pose the rhetoric question: who will police the police? A
policeman, on the other hand, may, as does the author of the book
by a retired American police officer, titled "The Police" think, that
"Criminals are made public heroes, the
crooked politician is excused with well,
politics is a dirty game; the absconder
banker is punished by being made to
return the reminder of his loot; the
prostitute is explained away as being a
member of the oldest profession"
but there is no mercy for the policeman; he is a consistent target of
criticism and ridicule. The people are unforgiving, so far as the
policeman is concerned,
11 may be noted here that there are federal law
enforcement agencies such as the Federal Investigation Agency,
Pakistan Railway Police, Anti-Narcotic Force, Pakistan Motorway
and Highway Police, Islamabad Police, Frontier Constabulary.
They are statutory bodies and their functions are those described in
their respective statutes.
We shall have at appropriate places something to say as
to the relationship between the police and the prosecutor and that
between the police and the courts.
POLICE POWER IS DISCRETIONARY POWER
Powers of the police involve the exercise of wide
executive discretionary power; us was said by Lord Scarman in his
248
Report of Inquiry into Bixton Disorder (Comnd 1981 para 4:58).
the exercise of discretion lies at the heart of the policing function.
It is well recognized that successful policing depends on the
exercise of discretion in how the law is enforced. The good
reputation of the police depends upon the skill and judgment which
policemen display in the particular circumstances of the cases and
incidents which they are required to handle. Discretion is the art of
suiting action to particular circumstances. It is a policeman's daily
lask.
The lawfulness of the way in which the executive
discretion of the police is exercised in a particular case can be
questioned on the principles laid down in Wednesbury (1947) 2 All
ER 680) namely bad faith and irrationality, as the test of
reasonableness (Horgate Mohammad v Duke (1984) I All ER
1054, 1057),
ARMY AND THE POLICE FUNCTION OF LAW AND
ORDER
The Armed forces are a part of the executive organ of
the State and this is made plain by Articles 243, 244 and 245 of the
Constitution; they are, like the police, subject to the civilian
control. There is power in the Federal Government, under Article
245 of the Constitution, to call the armed forces "in aid of civil
power". As was held in Liaqat Hussain v Federation (PLD 1999
SC 504):
"It seems that the above expression (in
aid of civil power) presupposes that the
civil power is still there, it is neither
supplemented nor effaced. The civil
power is to be preserved and invigorated
through the employment of the armed
forces. The armed forces can be called in
aid under the above clause by the
Federal Government inter alia to
perform a police function for limited
249

purpose of suppressing riots
ос
preventing threatened disorder or for
maintaining law and order..........
Then, under sections 129, 130, 131 and 131-A Cr.P.C.
the armed forces may be required by the police officers or the
Provincial Governments to assist in maintaining law and order.
There is here an apparent conflict between Article 245 of the
Constitution and these sections, for if the Constitution empowers
the Federal Government to call the armed forces in aid of the civil
power, that power must be exercised by the Federal Government or
not at all. Its exercise by the Provincial Government is necessarily
excluded.
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE AND POLICE FUNCTIONS
Justice of the Peace' was in America the traditional title
for a Magistrate Court, but that title is now used primarily in rural
areas using non-lawyer Magistrates in courts not of record.
Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Provincial
Government may appoint a citizen of Pakistan as to whose integrity
and suitability the Government is satisfied to be a Justice of the
Peace for a local area. Under section 22A, a Justice of the Peace
has the same powers of arrest as a police officer under sections 54
and 55 Cr.P.C. The arrestee shall forthwith be taken before the
officer in charge of the police station with a report and the latter
shall re-arrest the arrestee. Also, a Justice of the Peace has under
that section power to call upon any policeman to aid him in the
prevention of crime generally or in the arrest or in preventing the
escape of any person.
Under sub-section (5) of section 22A, a Justice of the
Peace can exercise certain non-police powers e.g. issuing a
certificate as to the identity of any person, verifying any document
or attesting any such document. Under section 22B, a Justice of the
Peace shall perform the duties mentioned therein, namely:
i)
ii)
iii)
to make enquiries and make report to the
nearest Magistrate and the officer in charge of
the nearest police station into any incident
involving a breach of the peace or the
commission of an offence;
if the offence committed is a cognizable
offence, to prevent the removal of anything
from or the interference with the place of
оссттелсе:
when required by a police officer, to render all
assistance in making such an investigation
and to record any statement of a dying man in
respect of whom a crime is believed to have
been committed.
By virtue of their respective offices, section 25 Cr.P.C.
so provides. "the Sessions Judges and on nomination by them, the
Additional Sessions Judges, are Justices of the Peace within and for
the whole of the District of the Province in which they are
serving". These ex-officio Justices of the Peace have been, by sub-
section (6) of section 22A Cr.P.C.. given some supervisory and
disciplinary powers over the police. An ex-officio Justice of the
Peace may issue appropriate directions to the police authorities
concerned on a complaint regarding -
i)
ii)
iii)
non-registration of a criminal case;
transfer of investigation from one police
officer to another;
neglect, failure or excess committed by a
police authority in relation to its functions and
duties.
For a discussion of the remedy against non-registration of case and
on transfer of investigation, the reader may please refer to the topic

PRELIMINARY
Chapter 2
PROSECUTOR
A Prosecutor may be a public prosecutor or he may be a
private prosecutor.
The British Common Law tradition was one of private
prosecution, that is, the complainant hired private counsel to press
the prosecution. Until 1986, England was one of the only a few
countries which allowed the police to prosecute rather than hand
over this task to a state agency like the district attomey in the
United States. The Crown Prosecution Service was established by
the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1985, and the police now play no
part in prosecutions beyond the stage of charging the suspect.
The Americans had established an office of public
prosecutor even when America was still a British Colony. In some
States, there was the system of private prosecutions, but private
prosecution was eventually found impracticable, too often subject
to abuse.
The idea of public prosecution in the Anglo-American
system proceeds on the view that crimes are "acts against the
State" and not simply wrongs inflicted upon individual victims.
Law officers and their functions
Under the Constitution of Pakistan the highest law
officer, at the federation level, is the Attomey General of Pakistan.
who under Article 100, is appointed by the President, serves during
the pleasure of the President, advises the Federal Government upon
all legal matters and performs such legal functions as may be
referred to or assigned to him by the Federal Government and has
the right of audience in all courts and tribunals in Pakistan. At the
provincial level, there is an Advocate General in each Province,
who, under Article 140, is appointed by the Governor, serves
252
during the pleasure of the Governor, advises the Provincial
Govemment upon such legal matters and performs such other legal
functions as may be referred or assigned to him.
Under section 492 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898, the Provincial Government may appoint generally or for any
class of cases in any local area one or more Public Prosecutors. By
its sub-section (2), which was enacted in 2001, the officer in charge
of prosecution in a district may in the absence of a Public
Prosecutor, appoint any other person as public Prosecutor for the
purpose of any case.
Under section 493 Cr.P.C., the Public Prosecutor can
appear before any court in any case of which he has charge,
without any written authority; if a private person has engaged a
private counsel to prosecute any person in any such case, that is,
any case of which the Public Prosecutor has charge, the Public
Prosecutor shall conduct the prosecution and the private counsel
shall act in that case under the direction of the Public Prosecutor.
Under section 494 Cr.P.C., the Public Prosecutor has
power, with the consent of the court, before the final judgment, to
withdraw from the prosecution of any person either generally or in
respect of any one or more of the offences for which he is being
tried. The effect of such withdrawal is that if the withdrawal is
before the charge has been framed, the accused shall stand
discharged and if the withdrawal is after the charge, the accused
shall be acquitted.
Section 495 Cr.P.C. relates to cases being inquired into
ár tried by a Magistrate. The Magistrate may permit any person,
even a police officer provided he is not below the rank of an
officer prescribed by the Provincial Government and he has not
taken part in the investigation of the offence to conduct the
prosecution. The person so permitted can exercise the powers of
withdrawal under section 494.

Under section 265A of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
"In every trial before a Court of Session initiated upon a police
report, the prosecution shall be conducted by the Public
Prosecutor"
The reference here obviously is to the Public Prosecutor
appointed under the Code of Criminal Procedure.
There is no such provision as regards cases in the courts
of Magistrates, the intention perhaps being that such cases shall be
dealt with under section 495 of the Code.
In Noor Elahi v State (PLD 1966 SC 708), the question
was how to proceed with cases in which there is a police challan
and there is also a private complaint, arising out of the same
incident, each implicating a different set of accused persons. S A
Rehman J. speaking for the majority held that the trial court should
take up the complaint case first. "If that trial results in a conviction,
it will be for the Public Prosecutor to consider whether or not he
should withdraw from the prosecution, with the permission of the
court, under section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the
police challan case
In this behalf, it was noticed that there will be difficulty
in conducting the case on behalf of the complainant in the first
trial, i.e. the complaint case:
"Normally, of course, under the law the
Public Prosecutor is to be in charge of
the case even if the trial is based on a
private complaint. The Public
Prosecutor, however, in the special
circumstances, could
the
permit
complainant's counsel to conduct the
proceedings on his behalf under his
directions. Alteratively, and that may
meet the situation more adequately,
Govemment, in the interest of justice,
could notify the complainant's counsel
254
as a Special Public Prosecutor for the
conduct of that case alone.......
Kaikaus J, dissenting, was, however, of the view that the two cases
should be consolidated so that there would be a single hearing. He
noticed that under section 270 (now section 265A) of the Code,
every trial before the Sessions Court is to be by a Public
Prosecutor:
Comments
"It may be said that the Public
Prosecutor may
the
hand over
prosecution in such a case to the private
complainant. But we will again be trying
to get over a legal provision. The
Criminal Procedure Code does not refer
to handing over by the Public Prosecutor
of the prosecution to anybody else. At
the same time section 270 gives an
indication as to the mind of the
legislature. The law intends that all
prosecutions before the Sessions Judge
shall be by the Public Prosecutor so that
it is not envisaged that two versions of
the same incident should be put forward
in two different proceedings......
Section 265A (its predecessor was section 270) of the
Code requires, not that in every trial before a Court of Session, the
prosecution shall be conducted by the public prosecutor; what it
says is that in every trial before a Court of Session, initiated upon a
police report, the prosecution shall be conducted by the Public
Prosecutor. So, in a private complaint case, the prosecution of the
case is not the responsibility of the Public Prosecutor, it is, by
necessary implication, that of the complainant who will have to
engage a private counsel and that counsel may not act under the
directions of the Public Prosecutor.
255

Section 493 Cr.P.C. envisages a case "of which he (the
Public Prosecutor) has charge, and in which the complainant has
engaged his own private counsel. In such a case also, it is the
Public Prosecutor who "shall conduct the prosecution"; the role of
the private counsel is to act....... under his directions". But if we
read this provision with section 265-A. can it be said that a trial
initiated on a private complaint is a case of which the Public
Prosecutor has charge within the meaning of section 493 of the
Code. The answer seems to be in the negative. The result must
therefore be that with the cases initiated on private complaint, the
Public Prosecutor has no concern and these cases are not therefore
cases "of which he has charge".
Prosecution Service under Provincial Laws
Each Province has now established a Criminal
Prosecution Service with a view to having as, for example, the
preamble to the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service (Constitution,
Functions and Powers) Act, 2006, says, "an independent, effective
and efficient service for the prosecution of criminal cases, to ensure
prosecutorial independence, for better coordination in the criminal
justice system". The Service under the Punjab Act consists of the
Prosecutor General, Additional Prosecutors General, Deputy
Prosecutors General. District Public Prosecutors and Assistant
District Public Prosecutors.
The general superintendence of the Service vests in the
Provincial Goverment, and the administration of the Service vests
in the Prosecutor General, who is, as Section 6 of the Punjab Act
provides, removable from service by the Provincial Government on
grounds of misconduct or physical infirmity. The Prosecutor
General can represent the Government in all the courts.
Under section 9, of the Punjab Act, all prosecutions are
to be conducted by the Prosecutors of behalf of the Government. At
the district level, the head of prosecution agency is the District
Public Prosecutor, who is to distribute work among the
prosecutors.
Under section 9, sub-sections (4) and (5), a police report
under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, whether it
recommends the prosecution of the person accused, or cancellation
of a first information report or the discharge of an accused, shall be
submitted to the court through the Public Prosecutor, who may
return it to the investigation officer for the removal of any defect,
or if it is fit for submission, to file it in the competent court. Under
section 10, sub-section (2), the Prosecutor General or the District
Public Prosecutor may refer to the competent authority to initiate
disciplinary action against any investigating or prosecution officer.
The prosecutor also has power to summon any report or record
from a government department or law enforcement agency.
Need for a Public Prosecution Service
It is wrong for a person to be prosecuted if the evidence
is insufficient. "The essence of wrongness lies in the prosecution of
the innocent; if this principle is taken seriously, it should mean not
merely that innocent people are not convicted, but also that
innocent people should not be prosecuted. The reason for this may
he found in the dictum that 'the process is the punishment'; being
prosecuted is an inconvenience at least, often a source of profound
und sometimes a considerable expense, and it may also lead to an
element of stigma and loss of social esteem. The homely phrase
"no smoke without fire" might well be applied ("The Criminal
Process" by Andrew Ashworth, p.180). There are sound moral and
economic reasons for not prosecuting a person against whom the
evidence is insufficient or there is no realistic prospect of
conviction. It was for these reasons that the (English) Royal
Commission on Criminal Procedure recommended the introduction
of a Public Prosecution Service to provide independent review, to
examine not only that the evidence is sufficient to stand judicial
scrutiny but also, "even if a case satisfies the test of evidentiary
sufficiency, there may be strong reasons of public policy or, as it is
termed in England and Wales, public interest, in favour of dealing
with the case by means other than prosecution".

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICE AND PROSECUTOR
The prosecutor has no legal authority to direct the police
to engage or not to engage in certain investigation or investigative
practices. But the police may seek the legal advice of the
prosecutor and usually do follow it; they do so not because they are
legally required to do so, but because the interaction between the
police and the prosecutor makes cooperation necessary. The
Prosecutor General is however authorized by section 10 of the
Punjab Act to issue general guidelines to the prosecutors and
investigating officers for effective and efficient prosecution.
Although the principal concern of both the police and
the prosecutor is effective law enforcement, yet, their immediate
goals and interests tend to differ. While the police are primarily
concerned with the prevention and investigation of crime, the
prosecutor is the legal representative of the State, and his principal
job is to see that the case as prepared by the police is fit for
prosecution so that no one is subjected to the ordeal of trial unless
there is good case against him. This is the first step in what may be
called the process of scrutiny and screening. This involves the
determination of the question whether there is sufficient legal
evidence to support a prosecution. Even if the answer to this
question is in the affirmative, the prosecutor may not, as a matter of
enforcement policy, consider it in the public interest to prosecute.
When the prosecutor decides that the case should go to the court
for trial, it is, under section 9 of the 2006 Punjab Act, the
responsibility of the prosecutor to conduct the prosecution in the
court on behalf of the Government.
Thus, the prosecution agency is now institutionally
separate from the police; there is no client-lawyer relationship
between the police and the prosecutor, and the police are in no
position to give instructions to the prosecutor as to how to proceed.
Generally speaking, a prosecutor has traditionally exercised
considerable discretion in deciding whether to prosecute or not, and
258
this discretion is largely uncontrolled; and both in America and the
UK it has never been the rule that suspected criminal offences must
automatically be the subject of prosecution and trial.
This also now seems to be the law in Pakistan. Under
section 173 Cr.P.C., the police report (the challan) has to be filed in
court through the Public Prosecutor. That section makes no
provision for the scrutiny of the police report by the Public
Prosecutor, but under section 9, sub-section (4) of the 2006 Punjab
Act, a police report under section 173 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure has to be submitted to the court through the prosecutor
and if the prosecutor finds some defect, he may return the case to
the police for the removal of the defect; and if it is fit for
submission to the court for trial, he may file it in court. Though
there is no express provision in that Act saying that even if there is
sufficient legal evidence to proceed to trial, the prosecutor may
decide not to prosecute, yet, the word 'may' in the expression.
"The prosecutor shall scrutinize the report and may file it before
the court" seems to give him discretion not to submit the case to
the court for trial even in such a case. In other words, the power to
prosecute is an executive discretionary power and includes the
power not to prosecute. Indeed, in this matter as in all others, the
prosecutor must uct, as section 13, sub-section (9)(a) of the Punjab
Act says "fairly, honestly, with due diligence, in the public interest
and to uphold justice".
Section 12 of the 2006 Punjab Act requires the
investigating officer to:
ii,
immediately report to the District Prosecutor,
the registration of each criminal case by
sending a copy of the first information report;
send the police report under section 173 of the
Cr.P.C. to the concerned prosecutor within the
prescribed period; and
259
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 148
if the investigation has not been completed
within the prescribed time, record reasons and
send them to the prosecutor concemed.
However, this provision, read with the powers of the prosecutor
under section 9, sub-section (7), and section 13, sub-section (9)(b)
to scrutinize the police report under section 173 Cr.P.C., and the
power under section 10, sub-section (2) to report against an
investigating officer, does give the prosecutor a kind of supervisory
role over the police and the District Public Prosecutor may well be
described as the chief law enforcement officer in the district.
INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE TWO LAWS:
There are some apparent inconsistencies between the
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, section 265A, 492
to 495 and the provisions of the provincial enactments e.g. the
Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service......Act 2006. For example:
1.
Under section 265A of the Code in trials
initiated upon a police report (the reference
seems to be to the report under section 173 of
the Code), the prosecution is to be conducted
by the Public Prosecutor. Under section 9 of
the Punjab Act "The Prosecutors shall be
responsible for the conduct of prosecution on
behalf of the Government" (that is
Government of the Punjab - Section 2(1)(e)
of the Punjab Act).
Now, if prosecution "initiated upon a police
report" under section 265A of the Code and
"prosecution on behalf of the Provincial
Government" under section 9 of the Punjab
Act mean the same thing, then there is no
conflict, but if the two different expressions
mean two different things, then. an
inconsistency does arise.
260
2.
3.
4.
5.
The general power of appointment of Public
Prosecution both under the Code and the
Punjab Act is in the Provincial Government,
but under section 492, sub-section (2), the
officer in charge of prosecution (which
expression has not been defined) in the district
may appoint a Public Prosecutor "for the
purpose of any case". Under the Punjab Act,
there is no such power and hence an apparent
inconsistency.
Under section 493 of the Code, there is scope
for a private counsel to act under the direction
of a Public Prosecution in a case of which the
latter has charge. No such scope exists under
the Punjab Act.
In matters of withdrawal from prosecution,
the power under section 494 vests in the
Public Prosecutor, the only condition being
the consent of the court. Under section 10 of
the Punjab Act, the power to withdraw, with
the consent of the court, vests in the District
Public Prosecutor, the Prosecutor General as
well as in the Provincial Government.
Additionally, under section 10(3)(f) of the
Punjab Act, the Prosecutor General or any
Prosecutor specially authorized by him, may,
for reasons to be recorded, inform the court on
behalf of the Government that "the prosecutor
shall not prosecute the accused". No consent
of the court is required to the exercise of this
latter power. These are serious
inconsistencies.
It is not clear whether the withdrawal from
prosecution under section 494 of the Code and
261
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 149
section 10(3)(e) of the Punjab Act, and the
information under section 103)(f) of that Act
"that the Prosecutor shall not prosecute the
accused" mean the same thing, or two
different things. If they are the same thing,
then, another inconsistency arises. It is that
under section 494 Cr.P.C., when the
withdrawal from prosecution is before the
charge, the accused shall stand discharged.
but if it is after the charge, the accused shall
stand acquitted. Under section 10(3)(f) of the
Punjab Act, the Prosecutor General can act at
any stage of a trial, and when he acts, "all
proceedings against the accused shall be
stayed and he shall be discharged of and from
the same", and such "discharge shall not
amount to an acquittal unless the court directs
otherwise.
HOW TO RESOLVE THESE INCONSISTENCIES?
It is important to note that this is not a case of implied
repeal by a later enactment of an earlier enactment. That principle
applies where the repealing and the repealed laws are by the same
or an equal legislative authority. Here the Code of Criminal
Procedure is an existing law within the meaning of Article 268(7)
of the Constitution and the 2006 Act is a Provincial Law.
"Criminal Procedure" including all matters in the Code of Criminal
Procedure" is item 2 of the Concurrent Legislative List. And as
provisions relating to Public Prosecutors occur in sections 265A,
492 to 495 of the Criminal Procedure Code and the Provincial
Laws such as the 2006 Punjab Act also make provisions on the
same subject the repugnancy or the inconsistency falls to be
resolved with reference to Article 143 of the Constitution, which
declares that the "existing law shall prevail and the Act of the
Provincial Assembly shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be
void",
In view of this constitutional position, section 20 of the
2006 Act which says: "The provisions of this Act shall have effect
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time
being in force" is an exercise in sheer futility; no ordinary law can
override the Constitution.
CHALLENGE TO DECISION NOT TO PROSECUTE
Under the English Common Law tradition, there is a
very limited way in which the courts can control the exercise of
prosecutorial discretion. Lord Denning in Ex parte Blackburn
(1968) All ER 763) gave the example of a Chief Constable
issuing a directive to his men that no person should be prosecuted
for stealing goods worth less than 100 Pounds and said "I should
have thought the court could countermand it". In the leading case
on the subject-R v Inland Revenue (1993) 1 All ER 772), the
discretion of selective prosecution was upheld. The American
criminal justice system has followed the English Common Law
tradition and it has been held that the Government retains a broad
discretion as to whom to prosecute and for what. The leading case
on the subject is Wayte (470 US 598) which was a case in which
under what was called 'selective prosecution' of the offenders
similarly situated, some were prosecuted and others were not; it
was held:
"So long as the prosecutor has probable
cause to believe that the accused
committed an offence defined by statute,
the decision whether or not to prosecute
and what charge to file or bring..
generally rests entirely in his discretion".
But although the prosecutor's discretion is broad, it is
not unfettered. As was held in Wayte, selectivity in the
enforcement of criminal law is subject to constitutional restraints,
in particular that the decision to prosecute must not be based on
ground of race, religion or other arbitrary classification.

DUTIES OF PROSECUTOR GENERALLY:
We have seen that one of the duties of the prosecutor
under section 13, sub-section (9)(a) of the Punjab Act of 2006 is to
"perform his functions and exercise his powers fairly, honestly.
with due diligence, in the public interest and to uphold justice".
This assumes special importance in the context of the prosecutor's
function to determine, when the police report under section 173
Cr.P.C. is submitted to him for scrutiny and screening, whether the
case as made out by the police is fit to stand the test of trial and his
function to determine whether to withdraw from a prosecution.
In England, the prosecutors are "generally regarded as
having special ethical responsibilities in their capacity of ministers
of justice which defence counsel do not share. Whilst both parties
to criminal litigation are expected to develop their best
arguments..... in accordance with the adversary model of contest,
the prosecutor is expected to conduct his or her case with
temperance and restraint (encapsulated in the aphorism that
prosecutors should prosecute, not persecute), whereas defence
counsel is afforded greater leeway to press for acquittal by
engaging the passions and sympathies, of the Jury
Prosecutorial restraint has generally been viewed by lawyers as
promoting the interests of justice. It would be entirely
inappropriate, after all. for prosecutors to pursue the goal of
conviction at any cost, regardless of proper standards of decorum
and making no allowances for the fact that the accused is to be
treated as innocent unless and until proven otherwise" ("Criminal
Evidence" by Professors Paul Roberts and Adrain Zuckerman,
p.57).
The idea of 'minister of justice seems to have been
borrowed from the memorable judgement of Crompton J. in R. v
O'Connel (1844) 7 Ir. LR 261, 312). He said: "This court in which
we sit is a temple of justice, and the advocates at the bar, as well as
the Judge upon the Bench, are equally ministers in that temple".
Thus, an additional burden, essentially incidental to the
nature of his office. lies on the prosecutor. In the classic words of
Justice Sutherland in Berger (295 US, 78, 88), the prosecutor-
"is the representative of not an ordinary
party to a controversy, but of a
sovereignty whose obligation to govem
impartially is as compelling as its
obligation to govern at all; and whose
in a criminal
interest, therefore,
prosecution is not that it shall win a case
but that justice shall be done. As such,
he is in a peculiar and very definite sense
the servant of the law, the twofold aim
of which is that guilt shall not escape or
innocence suffer. He may prosecute with
earnestness and vigor-indeed, he should
do so. But while he may strike hard
blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul
ones. It is as much his duty to refrain
from improper methods calculated to
produce a wrongful conviction as it is to
use every legitimate means to bring
about a just one".
A public prosecutor must, in the performance of his
public duties, act in the public interest, regardless of considerations
of loyalty to Government; he is not and he must not act as the
megaphone of the Government in power. The example was set by
Lord Shawcross before Lynskey Tribunal in 1948. The task of this
tribunal was to enquire into allegations of corruption against
certain members of the Attlee Government and there were many in
the Labour Party who suggested that, as Attomey General of that
Government, Shawcross should not appear. He maintained the
position that it was his duty, however, personally unpleasant, to
represent the public interest with complete objectivity and
detachment, that is "the duty to be wholly detached, wholly
independent and to keep the implication of an obligation to protect
265
Paki
264

Page 151
what he conceives to be the public interest whatever the political
results may be".
To quote from the Code of Conduct adopted by the Bar
Council for the Bar of England and Wales, "The Prosecuting
Counsel should not attempt to obtain conviction by all means at his
command. He shall not regard himself as appearing for a party, he
should use his best endeavours to ensure that all evidence or
material that ought properly be made available is either presented
by the prosecution or disclosed to the defence".
Summary:
To sum up. the role of a Public Prosecutor a
government lawyer who instigates the prosecution of an accused
and represents the State at the trial-spans over the entire course of
criminal justice process. He may serve as police's "house counsel"
has, in theory at least, a discretion to choose whom to prosecute
and for what, represents the State at the hearing and the trial, and is
at the same time an officer of the court. He is a servant of the law
and not of the Government for the time being in power.
Chapter 3
DEFENCE COUNSEL:
Right to be heard by the Counsel
In all criminal cases, the right of the person accused to
be heard has come to mean the right "to be heard by counsel". For,
as was said in Johnson v Zerbst (304 US 458-1938), the right to
counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the American
Constitution embodies "the obvious truth that the average
defendant does not have the professional legal skill to protect
himself when brought before a tribunal" and that the Amendment
"withholds from.... courts, in all criminal proceedings, the power
and authority to deprive an accused of his life or liberty unless he
has or waives the assistance of counsel".
266
The right has sometimes been called "the most pervasive
right" or "the master key" to all rights, because it ensures the
reliability of the guilt-determining process. This right to counsel
has been extended to counsel at state expense for indigent
defendants - defendants who are too poor to afford to engage their
own counsel. As was held in Gideon (372 US 335; 9 L Ed 2d 799)
"in our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into
court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair
Irial, unless counsel is provided for him (by the State). This seems
to us to be an obvious truth".
One of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 10
of the Constitution of Pakistan is the right of an accused person 'to
be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice'. Then, section
340, sub-section (1), provides for a right to an accused person to be
defended by a pleader.
Like the American Constitution, the Constitution of
Pakistan, too, does not impose on the State any obligation to
provide for the defence of indigent persons accused of serious
criminal offences. Yet, this State obligation has been judicially
recognized in America, and is, and ought to be, recognized as a
constitutional right in Pakistan. Governments, both Federal and
Provincial, quite properly spend vast sums of money to establish
machinery to try the accused persons. Then, there are defendants
who can hire good lawyers at their own expense. This affords
strong indication that lawyers, both for the prosecution and the
defence, "are necessities, not luxuries". To be fair to the accused
persons who are too poor to engage their own lawyers, to preserve
some parity between the State and such accused persons and to
place them on an equal footing with the prosecution, it is. therefore.
necessary that there is a State machinery which enables the
indigent defendants to be defended at public expense. It is on this
principle that Chapter 24C of the High Court Rules and Orders
Vol. II requires that indigent defendants be provided with counsel
at Government expense at the sessions trials, and Chapter 25E of
the High Court Rules and Orders Vol. III requires counsel to be
provided at Government expense at appeal stage. The right needs
267

Page 152
to be extended to all indigent defendants accused of serious crimes
regardless of the tribunals in which they are tried,
FORENSIC DUTIES OF DEFENCE COUNSEL:
The right to the assistance of counsel under the US Sixth
Amendment has come to mean that "the right to counsel is the right
to effective assistance of counsel [McMann v Richardson-397 US
759), so much so that the convict can ask the conviction and
sentence to be set aside because counsel's assistance at the trial or
sentencing was ineffective. "the benchmark for judging any claim
of ineffectiveness" being "whether counsel's conduct so
undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that
the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result".
(Strickland v Washington-466 US 668; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984).
While "no particular set of detailed rules for counsel's
conduct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of
circumstances faced by defence counsel or the range of legitimate
decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant" yet
"Representation of a criminal defendant
entails certain basic duties. Counsel's
function is to assist the defendant, and
hence counsel owes the client a duty of
loyalty, a duty to avoid conflicts of
interest. From Counsel's function as
assistant to the defendant derive the
overarching duty to advocate, the
defendant's cause and the more
particular duties to consult with the
defendant on important decisions and to
keep the defendant informed of
important developments in the course of
the prosecution. Counsel also has a duty
to bring to bear such skill and
knowledge as will render the trial a
268
reliable adversarial testing process"
(Justice O'Conner in Strickland).
One of the best statements on the subject of forensic
duties (we often say forensic fact-finding. forensic duties, the word
"forensic" is derived from the Roman forum: forensic literally
means pertaining to legal proceedings) of defence counsel is to be
found in the oft-quoted and memorable words of Crompton J. in
O'Connel (1844) Ir. LR 312):
"This Court in which we sit is a temple
of justice; and the advocates at the Bar
as well as the Judge upon the Bench are
equally ministers in the temple. The
object of all equally should be the
attainment of justice...through the
ascertainment of the truth..... I would
say to the advocates upon this subject:
Let your zeal be as warm as your heart's
blood, but let it be tempered with
discretion and with self respect; let your
independence be firm, but let it be
chastened by personal humility; let your
love of liberty amount to a passion, but
let it not appear to be a cloak for
maliciousness".
To the suggested doctrine that counsel was the mere
mouthpiece of his client, Crompton J. said;
"Such. I do conceive, is not the office of
an advocate. His office is a higher one.
To consider him in that light is to
degrade him. I would say of him..... He
is a representative, but not a delegate. He
gives to his client the benefit of his
learning, his talents and his judgment;
but all through he never forgets what he
269
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 153
owes to himself and to others. He will
not knowingly misstate the law, though
it be to gain the cause for his client, He
will ever bear in mind that if he be the
advocate of an individual and retained
and remunerated for his valuable
services, yet he has a prior and perpetual
retainer on behalf of truth and
justice...."
And, in the words of Gibson CJ in Rush (2 Pa.187) (1845) -
"It is a popular, but gross mistake, to
suppose that a lawyer owes no fidelity to
any one except his client; and that the
latter is the keeper of his professional
conscience",
A lawyer is, Gibson CJ continued, "bound by those obligations
which, without oaths, rest upon all men. The high and honourable
office of a counsel would be degraded to that of a mercenary, were
he compelled to do the biddings of his clients against the dictates of
his conscience".
In short, in the words of the "Standard for Criminal
Justice" by the American Bar Association:
i)
ii)
the defence lawyer has no duty to execute any
direction of the accused which does not
comport with law...... The defence lawyer is
the professional representative of the accused,
not the accused's alter ego; and
it is unprofessional conduct for a lawyer
intentionally to misrepresent matters of fact or
law to the court.
Sometimes, it may so happen that when a counsel is
approached to defend an accused person, he is reluctant to do so.
The reluctance may be due to the fact that the accused is a known
scoundrel, having been involved in a variety of crimes. He is hated
by the public. Or, it may be due to the nature of the crime, you feel
repelled by the cruel, inhuman and barbaric manner in which it was
committed. Should you refuse the brief in such a
a case?
The answer is "no", and here is a little lesson in civics.
Under the constitutions and the laws of all civilized countries every
person is entitled to a fair trial, every person is presumed to be
innocent until proved guilty and every person is entitled to be
represented by counsel.
John Adams was one of the founding fathers of
America. He was the first Vice President of independent America.
and the second President of America.
In 1870, John Adams was in the forefront of the
American independence movement, when on March 5, in what is
known as the Boston massacre, five colonials lay dead or dying, six
others wounded as a result of shots by the British soldiers, captain
Preston and his redcoats, who became the most vilified men in
America. Nobody was ready to represent captain Preston. The
captain sent a request from jail to Johan Adam to represent him,
and this was what Johan Adam said:
"I had no hesitation in answering that
counsel ought to be the very last thing
that an accused should want in a free
country, that the bar ought, in my
opinion, to be independent and impartial
at all times, and in every circumstance,
and that the persons whose lives were at
stake ought to have counsel they
preferred"

He took the case. Boston was stunned and this very nearly cost him
his political career.
Gerry Spence, the famed American lawyer, who had
spent his life representing ordinary poor people against the
corporate giants, was also once in a similar fix. He was asked to
represent one Leyland, son of a millionaire, who had shot his girl
friend, Maria, innocent, decent, loving, without any reason. The
bullet slashed the spinal cord of Maria's neck. At the hearing Maria
was still clinging to life and was able to testify with great
difficulty. Spence felt uneasy about representing Leyland; the facts
repelled him. Yet, he argued away his misgivings. Would not a
doctor worth his salt do his best to save a seriously wounded
heinous murderer brought to him. No body would condemn the
doctor. Why then should lawyers be called to task for protecting
the rights of the accused under the Constitution. Is not the highest
calling of a lawyer to defend the damned? So, he accepted the
brief. (See Gerry Spence in his "With Justice for None" pp 9-10).
Chapter 4
JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES
In talking about the Judges and Magistrates, as
participants in the criminal justice system, we are in the realm of
"Judicial Power", a constitutional concept, itself a part of the larger
constitutional concept, namely, that a State acts by its legislative,
its executive and its judicial authorities. (Exparte Virginia - 100
US 339; 25 L Ed 2d 676; also Cooper v Aaron-358 US 1:31 Ed
2d 5).
Part VII of the Constitution of Pakistan is titled "The
Judicature" and keeping in view the organizational scheme of the
Constitution, it is the constitutional concept of "Judicial Power"
with which this Part deals (Registrar v Wali Muhammad - 1997
SCMR 141, 155); that Power is inherent in the judiciary as an
independent and co-ordinate branch of government (with a small
"g"; the term "govemment" compendiously describes and includes
the Legislative, the Executive and the Judicial branches of
. 272
'government' as distinguished from 'Government' with a capital
"G" which expression is sometimes used to describe the Executive
Organ of the State) as contrasted with the Legislative and
Executive Power of the State. (For a detailed treatment of the
subject and related matters, see the author's book "Judicial Review
of Public Actions" Part III, Chapters 1-4).
The term "Judicial Power" is not capable of a precise
definition, but one of the best definitions of the term is that given
by Griffith CJ. In Huddard Parker and Co. v Moorehead (8 CLR
330, 357) where he says that the term means:
"the power which every sovereign
authority must, of necessity, have to
decide controversies between its
subjects, or between itself and its
subjects, whether the rights relate to life.
liberty or property".
ESTABLISHMENT AND JURISDICTION OF COURTS:
Chapter 1 of Part VII of the Constitution is a one-
Article Chapter, but its importance is self-evident. It reads:
Establishment and jurisdiction of courts.
"175.
(1)
There shall be a Supreme Court of Pakistan, a
High Court for each Province and such other
courts as may be established by law.
No court shall have any jurisdiction save as is
or may be conferred on it by the Constitution
or by or under any law.
(2)
(3)
The Judiciary shall be separated progressively
from the Executive within fourteen years from
the commencing day".

Page 155
There is a general proposition that the power to make laws includes
the power to establish courts to enforce them (Mirza Gulzar Beg v
SHO-PLD 1977 Lah. 435. cited with approval in Abdul Hafeez v
State-PLD 1981 SC 352. 356). But clause (1) of Article 175 does
not leave the power to establish courts to be derived by implication.
Thus, besides providing for the establishment of a Supreme Court
and a High Court for each Province, it also expressly empowers the
Legislature to establish other courts by law.
When a court or a tribunal has been set up then it
becomes a question of policy as to what jurisdiction should be
conferred on it. The combined effect of clauses (1) & (2) of Article
175 is that the Supreme Court and the High Courts have been
established by the Constitution; that the Supreme Court and the
High Courts have such jurisdiction as has been conferred upon
them by the Constitution; that the Supreme Court and the High
Courts have also such other jurisdiction as is or may be conferred
upon them by or under any law and that when other courts are
established, they have such jurisdiction as may be conferred upon
them by or under the law establishing them.
MEANING OF LAW IN ARTICLE 175:
The expression 'law' here has been used to distinguish it
from the Constitution', which is higher in authority, in other
words. the expression 'law' here means any ordinary or
sub-constitutional law made in exercise of the powers granted by
the Constitution (Brothers Steel Mills v Ilyas Miraj - PLD 1996 SC
543, 569). It means positive law, that is to say, a formal
pronouncement of the will of a competent law giver. Thus 'law' in
this Article means statute law or enacted law (Federation v United
Sugar Mills-PLD 1977 SC 397, 405).
Meaning of 'by or under law':
It is note-worthy that while under clause (1), 'other
courts' may be established by law, by clause (2) jurisdiction may
be conferred by or under any law. Obviously, the expression 'by
274
law' means the law made by primary legislation and the expression
'under any law' means law made by subordinate legislation. Thus
clause (2) makes distinction between primary and subordinate
legislation. In other words, while a court can be established only by
primary legislation, jurisdiction may be conferred upon a court so
established both by the primary legislation and by subordinate
legislation.
PROPOSITIONS EMERGING FROM ARTICLE 175:
Three propositions are firmly established-
i)
ii)
Under a written Constitution, a court has only
such jurisdiction as is conferred on it by the
Constitution or by or under law (Shahnaz
Begum case PLD 1971 SC 677, 687;
Muhammad Khan v Border Allotment
Committee-PLD 1965 SC 623. 633).
The jurisdiction of a court is never established
by the court itself, but by some authority
external to it either in a statute or the
Constitution.
It is for the Constitution, and subject to the
Constitution, for the law to determine the
nature and extent of the jurisdiction, and the
forum upon which it will be conferred
(Constitutional Interpretation by Craig R.
Ducat and Harold W. Chase S ed p.5;
Brothers Steel Mills v Ilyas Miraj - PLD 1996
SC 543, 569). The courts are creatures of the
Constitution; they derive their powers and
jurisdiction from the Constitution and must
confine themselves within the limits set by the
Constitution (Chief Justice Hamood-ur-
Rehman in Federation of Pakistan v Saeed
Ahmed- PLD 1974 SC 151, 165).
275

COURTS IN WHICH THE JUDICIAL POWER OF THE
STATE VESTS:
The Judicial Power of the State is exercised through
judges appointed by the State. As was said in State v Zia-ur-
Rehman (PLD 1973 SC 49) "in a system where there is a
trichotomy of sovereign power then ex necessitate rei-from the
very nature of things - the judicial power must be vested in the
judiciary".
Articles 175, 202 and 203 of the Constitution provide
the framework of judiciary in Pakistan. Article 175 has already
been reproduced; Articles 202 and 203 read:
of
"202. Rules of procedure. - Subject to the Constitution
and law, a High Court may make rules regulating the
practice and procedure of the Court or of any court
subordinate to it".
"203. High Court to superintendent subordinate courts, -
Each High Court shall supervise and control all courts
subordinate to it".
The word 'law' has been, as has been noticed above, used in
Article 175 to distinguish it from the Constitution and means an
ordinary or a sub-constitutional law made in the exercise of the
legislative power granted by the Constitution (Brothers Steel Mills
v Ilyas Miraj-PLD 1996 SC 543, 569). This means that the source
power for the legislature to establish courts in which shall vest
the Judicial Power of the State is Article 175, unless the
Constitution itself, by another Article, permits the establishment of
other courts or tribunals (Mehram Ali v Federation of Pakistan -
PLD 1998 SC 1445, 1447). It follows inevitably that the
Constitution recognizes only such other specific courts and
tribunals to share the Judicial Power with the courts expressly
mentioned in Article 175 as have been specifically provided by the
Constitution itself. The distinction thus is between the courts
established by the Constitution itself (the constitutional courts) and
other courts established by law (the legislative courts).
276
other constitutional courts and tribunals are:
Besides the Supreme Court and the High Courts, the
i)
The Federal Shariat Court established under
Part VII, Chapter 3-A, of the Constitution;
ii)
Tribunals under Article 212; and
iii)
Election Tribunals under Article 225.
CHARACTERISTICS OF 'COURT' AND 'JUDICIAL
PROCESS':
The power of the Legislature to establish courts by or
under law conferred by Article 175, that is, the courts in whom
shall also vest the judicial power of the State, is not an unlimited
power. The limitation upon this power has its source in the fact that
the tribunal which it by law establishes is a 'court'. Some of the
basic ideas which go with the notion of a court are that it is the
characteristic of courts to decide and not merely to advise, that a
court must have the independence of judgment in cases before it
and the cases and the controversies which it is required to handle
must be fit for them (Nasrullah Khan v Member Election
Commission PLD 1066 Lah. 850; 873; also see the article
"Power of Congress - a Study in Separation of Power" by Professor
(as he then was) Frankfurter and Professor Landis (1923-24)
Harvard Law Review 1010, 1020-1). For example, courts do not
decide abstract, hypothetical or contingent questions or give mere
declaration in the air (Chief Justice Muhammad Munir in Md.
Mehdi Ali Khan case PLD SC (Pak) 387, 407), nor are they
concerned with questions which are in their nature academic rather
than judicial ((1986) AC 348 PC). The essential steps of a judicial
process are the ascertainment of facts, determination of the law
applicable to the facts found or admitted, an inference as to the
existence or otherwise of a right or obligation from the
determination of the law and a decision as to the final order to be
made in respect of such right or obligation. Since the ultimate
277
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 157
object of such process is the enforcement of a right or obligation,
every step of the process has a necessary reference to and is limited
by that object (Chief Justice Muhammad Munir in Md. Mehdi Ali
Khan case-PLD 1959 SC (Pak) 387).
LABEL 'COURT' OR 'TRIBUNAL' IS NOT DECISIVE:
There are many tribunals or bodies with the label 'court'
attached to them which have many of the trappings of a court and
which are required to act judicially, yet they are not courts of
judicature or courts of law within the meaning of Article 175. A
court may be identified as a court of judicature if it has been
established to exercise, either generally or subject to defined limits,
the judicial power of the State. "If the body under review is
established for a purely legislative or administrative purpose, it is
part of the legislative or administrative system of the State, even
though it has to perform duties which are judicial in character"
(Lord Scarman in AG v BBC (1980) 3 All ER 161). Thus, a
tribunal is not necessarily a court in this strict sense-
i)
ii)
iii)
iv)
v)
vi)
33
because it gives a final decision;
nor because it hears witnesses on cath;
nor because two or more contending parties
appear before it between whom it has to
decide;
nor because it gives decisions which affect the
right of subjects:
nor because there is an appeal to a court;
nor because it is a body to whom a matter is
referred by another body (Lord Sankey LC in
Shell Company of Australia v Federal
Commissioner (1930) All ER 671).
A distinction has, therefore, to be made between courts
of law which form part of the judicial system of the country, on the
one hand, and courts which are to resolve problems which arise in
the course of administration of the government of the country and
the test is not whether the forum is described as a court or tribunal,
278
for 'tribunal' is a generic term which includes a court, and often
these terms are used inter-changeably (Muhammad Gul, J. in
Zahoor Elahi v State PLD 1977 SC 273, 357), nor whether the
authority under review is required to act judicially, that is to say, to
act with such fairness and impartiality as characterize proceedings
in courts of justice that being a duty common to all State or public
power (Bahadur v State - PLD 1985 SC 62, 68).
OTHER
COURTS' IN
SUBORDINATE COURTS:
ARTICLE 175 MEAN
The expression 'other courts' in clause (1) of Article 175
"is relatable to the subordinate courts referred to in Article 202 and
203 of the Constitution" (Mehram Ali v Federation of Pakistan -
PLD 1998 SC 1445, 1469). What the Constitution contemplates.
therefore, is not a batch of unconnected courts but a judiciary
composed of the superior courts and the subordinate courts. The
subordinate courts are, therefore, an integral part of the judiciary
and the judicial system of Pakistan (Muhammad Mansha v State -
PLD 1996 SC 229, 233).
The civil courts established by enactments such as the
Civil Courts Ordinance read with the Code of Civil Procedure 1908
and the criminal courts established under the Code of Criminal
Procedure 1898 are examples of the subordinate courts, which
exercise the judicial power of the State within the meaning of
Article 175.
SPECIAL COURTS:
But it frequently happens that the Legislatures, from
time to time, carve out special matters out of the general
jurisdiction of the ordinary civil and criminal courts and in the
interest of economy, speed or expertise, give the jurisdiction to deal
with them to special courts or tribunals especially created for the
purpose. Similarly, there is power in the legislature to create new
rights and liabilities and to create special courts to try those rights
and liabilities and to prescribe special procedure for that purpose
279

Page 158
(Brothers Steel Mills v Ilyas Miraj - PLD 1996 SC 543, 569). This
legal position is reflected in so far as civil matters are concerned, in
the words "excepting suits of which their cognizance is either
expressly or impliedly barred" in section 9 of the Code of Civil
Procedure as also by section 4 thereof which reads:
"4.(1)
(2)
In the absence of any specific provision to the
contrary, nothing in this Code shall be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any
special or local law now in force or any
special jurisdiction or power conferred, or any
special form of procedure prescribed, by or
under any other law for the time being in
force.
In particular and without prejudice to the
generality of the proposition contained in
subsection (1), nothing in this Code shall be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any
remedy which a land-holder or landlord may
have under any law for the time being in force
for the recovery of rent of agricultural land
from the produce of such land".
Similarly, section 1, subsection (2), of the Code of
Criminal Procedure provides: "... Nothing herein contained
shall affect any special or local law now in force, or any special
jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special form of procedure
prescribed, by any other law for the time being in force".
Examples of special courts vested with the judicial
power of the State in civil matters are the Courts established under
the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001.
the
Revenue Courts under the Punjab Tenancy
Act...established to decide cases arising out of the
relationship of landlord and tenant of agricultural land and the
Family Courts under the Family Courts Act 1964; and the
examples of special courts vested with the judicial power of the
State in criminal matters are the courts established under the
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1947, Pakistan Criminal Law
(Amendment) Act 1958, Suppression of "Terrorist Activities
(Special Courts) Act, 1975 and the National Accountability Bureau
Ordinance, 1999.
THE PLACE AND IMPORTANCE OF SUBORDINATE
COURTS:
It is necessary to emphasis the importance of the place
the subordinate courts, primarily in their capacity of trial courts,
occupy in the hierarchy of courts and in the criminal judicial
system. The subordinate courts include, under the Code of
Criminal Procedure, the Courts of Sessions Judges, Additional
Sessions Judges and Magistrates.
These courts have, as trial courts at the District and
Tehsil levels, the greatest public contact, and as the bulk of
litigation, touching the life, liberty and property of the common
man, is handled by them, they present the image of justice to the
people and the opinion held of them reflect the respect in which the
judiciary as an institution is held. The judge, says Lord Denning.
"who tries the case is the judge who is
seen by the people. It is on his good
administration that law and order
ultimately depend".
Woodrow Wilson, later President of America, while still a
Professor at Princeton University, said:
"So far as the individual is concerned, a
constitutional government is as good as
its courts, no better, no worse. Its laws
are only its professions. It keeps its
promises, or does not keep them, in its
courts".
280
281

Page 159
While these observations apply to the judiciary, as a whole, they
are more particularly true of the subordinate judiciary.
Sometimes, and in some jurisdictions, these courts are
also described as "inferior courts" (See, for example, section 435 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure). This description is a categorizing
and not a derogatory description. Such courts or tribunals, says
Lord Denning in AG v BBC (1979) All ER 45, cited in
Muhammad Mansha case (PLD 1996 SC 229,233),
"are not inferior in the doing of justice,
nor in the judges who man them nor in
the advocates who plead in them".
TREATMENT THAT SUBORDINATE COURTS DESERVE:
It has been said of the subordinate courts in America
that, historically, such courts have been the most significant, yet,
typically the most neglected of all courts. Charles Evans Hughes,
later Chief Justice of America, commented in 1919 in his address
to the members of New York Bar Association:
Pakistan.
"The Supreme Court of the United States
and the Courts of Appeals will take care
of themselves. Look after the courts of
the poor, who stand most in the need of
justice. The security of the Republic will
be found in the treatment of the poor and
the ignorant, in indifference to their
misery and helplessness lies disaster".
This applies equally to the subordinate courts in
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY:
Independence of judiciary is one of the basic general
principles of the Constitution of Pakistan. Its preamble declares
282
that it is "the will of the people of Pakistan to establish an order"
wherein, among others.

"the independence of the judiciary shall be fully
And lest there be any doubt about it, the same words are repeated
as substantive part of the Constitution in Article 2A, read with its
Annex.
So important is the judicial independence, which is
defined in terms of the relationship of the courts to others.
particularly the Executive branch of the government, that it has
been recognized as a universal human right. (See, for example, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, art. 10, and the European
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms, 1959, art. 6).
Generally speaking. a court or tribunal which is not
independent is not an impartial court or tribunal. We have seen that
"bias" is synonymous with partiality, so that when we say that a
Judge or Magistrate was biased, it means that he was partial; it
means "that he was motivated by a desire unfairly to favour one
side or disfavour the other" (See the discussion under the heading
"Bias" in an earlier part of this book).
The rule that nobody can be a judge in his own cause has
received legislative recognition in section 556 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure which prohibits a Judge or Magistrate - "to try
any case to or in which he is a party or personally interested"
except "with the permission of the court to which an appeal lies
from his court".
This later part of section 556 namely that a biased Judge
or Magistrate may try a case in which he is interested with the
permission of his appellate court, is unfortunate and, if challenged.
will be, in view of the recent developments in the law, difficult to
sustain.

JUDGES, MAGISTRATES, THEIR APPOINTMENT AND
POWERS:
As section 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
provides, there are, besides the High Court, the following classes of
Criminal Courts, that is, the courts which hear and decide criminal
case, namely,
i)
Courts of Session;
ii)
Courts of Magistrates; and
iii)
Courts constituted under any law other than
the Code of Criminal Procedure.
We have seen that the High Courts are constitutional
courts, constituted by and under Article 175 of the Constitution of
Pakistan. As is provided by Article 175, clause (2), a High Court
exercises such jurisdiction as is conferred on it by the Constitution;
it also has such jurisdiction as may be conferred on it by or under
any law. The latter may conveniently be called the statutory
jurisdiction of the High Court. For example, under Section 410 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, the High Court has jurisdiction to
hear appeals against the decisions of the Courts of Session.
Court of Session: A Court of Session, so provides section 9 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, consists of a Sessions Judge.
Additional Sessions Judge or Judges and Assistant Sessions Judge
or Judges appointed by the Provincial Government to exercise
jurisdiction in a Sessions division.
There are three classes
Courts of Magistrate:
Magistrates;
i.
Magistrates of the first Class;
iii.
Magistrates of the second Class;
Magistrates of the third Class.
of
A Magistrate means, so says section 4, sub-section (1),
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, "a Judicial Magistrate and
includes a special Judicial Magistrate appointed under sections 12
and 14 of the Code"
The power to appoint Magistrate vests, under section 12
of the Code, in the Provincial Government.
Subordination of Sessions Judges and Magistrates: For the
purposes of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Sessions Judges
and the Additional Sessions Judge are subordinate to the High
Court and the Assistant Sessions Judges and all Magistrates are
subordinate to the Sessions Judge and the High Court. This is so
provided by Section 17 of the Code.
POWERS OF COURTS
Powers of the courts to try offences:
Any offence under the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) may
be tried (a) by the High Court or (b) by the Court of Session, or (c)
by any other court by which such offence is shown in the eighth
column of the Second Schedule of the Code of Criminal Procedure
to be triable. (Section 28 Cr.P.C). As regards an offence under a
law other than PPC, it can be tried by the court mentioned in that
other law, but if no such other court is mentioned in that law, then
by the courts under the Code of Criminal Procedure. (Section 29
Cr.P.C).
Sentences which the High Courts and Sessions Judges may
pass:
This is governed by section 31 Cr.P.C. A High Court
may pass any sentence authorized by law. In other words, there is
no limit upon its sentencing power.
A Sessions Judge and an Additional Sessions Judge may
pass any sentence authorized by law subject to the condition that a
284
285

Page 161
sentence of death passed by any such Judge is subject to
confirmation by the High Court.
An Assistant Sessions Judge may pass any sentence
authorized by law, except a sentence of death or of imprisonment
for a term exceeding seven years.
Sentences which a Magistrate may pass:
Section 32 Cr.P.C. provides that Courts of Magistrates
may pass the following sentences namely -
a)
b)
Courts of Magistrates of the First Class-
Imprisonment for a term not exceeding three
years including such solitary confinement as
is authorized by law, fine not exceeding forty
five thousand rupees; arsh, daman, whipping.
Courts of Magistrates of the Second Class-
Imprisonment for a term not exceeding one
year, including such solitary confinement as is
authorized by law, fine not exceeding fifteen
thousand rupees.
Courts of Magistrates of the Third Class-
Imprisonment for a term not exceeding one
month, fine not exceeding three thousand
rupees.
This is to be read with section 30 Cr.P.C. which
empowers the Provincial Government to vest any Magistrate of the
First Class with power to try as a Magistrate all offences not
punishable with death. When so empowered, a court of Magistrate
may pass any sentence authorized by law except a sentence of
death or imprisonment exceeding seven years.
Under section 30, sub-section (2), the court of any
Magistrate may pass any lawful sentence, combining any of the
sentences which he is authorized by law to pass.
286
Ordinary and Additional Powers under Cr.P.C.
Besides the powers which are conferred upon the
Magistrates under the Code of Criminal Procedure and specified in
the 3d schedule thereof, which are called ordinary powers, a
Magistrate may be invested with any of the additional powers
specified in the 4th schedule of the Code. The powers to so invest
are in the Provincial Government on the recommendation of the
High Court. (Section 37, Cr.P.C.).

PART IV
STAGES OF CRIMINAL PROCESS
Criminal process can broadly be divided into two stages,
the administrative stage; and
the judicial stage.
Chapter 1
The Administrative Stage
The power to prosecute someone for an offence is the
power to execute and enforce the laws and is a part of the
Executive Power of the State. But before the stage of prosecution is
reached, there is the duty and power to investigate into suspected
offences with a view to identifying the perpetrators of them and
obtaining sufficient evidence admissible in a court of law. This
involves the exercise of the power of the police - the power to
arrest, the power to seize and search etc and that too is
necessarily a part of the Executive Power. Hence the label
'administrative stage'. Thus, the State. through its Executive
Organ, is not only the principal prosecutor, but also the primary
investigator of serious crimes.
In the criminal process, there are, so observed Geoffrey
Lane LJ in Norwest Holst (1978) 3 All ER 280, 296) cited in Brig.
Imtiaz Ahmad (1994 SCMR 2142, 2153), three different phases.
First of all, the administrative phase, next the judicial phase and
finally, the execution phase, when the orders of the court or
tribunal are, if necessary, executed or promulgated. Quite plainly.
faimess to the suspect....... demands that he should be given a
chance of stating his case before the final period: the
execution........... Equally fairness demands that the suspect shall
be given a chance of putting his side of the case before the judicial
enquiry is over. But on the other side, and the other side are
entitled to fairness just as the subject is, fairness to the inquirer (or
the investigator) demands that during the administrative period he
should be able to investigate without having at every stage to
enquire from the suspect what his side of the matter may be. Of
course, it may be difficult to find out the particular point at which
the administrative phase ends and the judicial phase
begins. Requirement of natural justice, such as preliminary
notice of the accusation, opportunity to be heard, do not therefore
apply at that stage. Nor does the presumption of innocence apply at
the administrative stage, for the police are not to decide; they are to
investigate and report.
In Wiseman (1969) 3 All ER 275, Lord Reid said:
"Every public officer who has to decide
hether to prosecute or raise proceedings
ought first to decide whether there is a
prima facie case but no one supposes
that justice requires that he should first
seek the comments of the accused or the
defendant on the material before him. So
there is nothing inherently unjust in
reaching such a decision in the absence
of the other party".
We are here concerned with the administrative and
judicial phases only.
into.
The administrative stage may further be sub-divided
Investigation and prosecution. We have already dealt with this
subject.
An important distinction which needs to be made at the outset is
that the pre-trial administrative stage, particularly the investigation

part of it, is, by its nature, inquisitorial, followed by the judicial
part of the criminal procedure namely the trial, which, by its nature,
is adversarial. This mixed model is being followed in the Anglo-
American systems as also in the modern European system of
criminal procedure. This is also the position in Pakistan.
Chapter 2
Ways to set the Law in Motion:
The machinery of criminal justice under the Code of
Criminal Procedure may be set in motion in the following ways:
208
(1)
(2)
(3)
by an information received by the police;
by a complaint to the court;
upon information received by a Magistrate
from a person other than a police officer or
upon his own knowledge or suspicion that an
offence of which he can take cognizance has
been committed.
Information to the Police
The law is set in motion in cognizable cases, when an
information relating to a cognizable offence is given to the police
officer in charge of the police station concerned whether orally or
in writing. Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires
that every such oral information shall be reduced to writing by the
officer in charge of the police station concerned and shall be read
over to the informant. Both the oral information when so reduced
to writing and the written information shall be signed by the
informant and shall be entered in the register of FIRS.
Under section 155 of the Code, in cases relating to non-
cognizable offences also, information may be given to the officer
in charge of the police station concerned, who shall enter it in the
prescribed register.
Then, there may be cases in which an officer in charge
of a police station receives secret information, from a police
informant or has otherwise reason to suspect the commission of a
cognizable offence. In such cases, section 157 of the Code requires
the police officer to forthwith send a report of such information or
suspicion to the concerned Magistrate and to proceed to the spot
and investigate the facts and circumstances of the case.
As was held in Emperor v Khawaja Nazir Ahmad (AIR 1945 PC
18).
"...the receipt and recording of an
information report is not a condition
precedent to the setting in motion of a
criminal investigation. No doubt in great
majority of cases, criminal prosecutions
are undertaken as a result of information.
received and recorded in this way, but
their Lordships see no reason why the
police, if in possession through their
own knowledge or by means of credible
though informal intelligence which
"genuinely leads them to the belief that a
cognizable offence has been committed,
should not of their own motion
undertake an investigation into the truth
of the matters alleged. Section 157
Cr.P.C., when directing that a police
officer, who has reason to suspect from
information or otherwise that an offence
which he is empowered to investigate
under section 156 has been committed
shall proceed to investigate the facts and
circumstances, supports this view. In
truth, the provision as to information
3 first
report (commonly called
information report) are enacted for other
reasons".

These views have been reiterated in Muhammad Bashir
SHO (PLD 2007 SC 539).
Object of FIR
The object of a first information report is to obtain early
information of alleged criminal activity, to record the
circumstances before there is time for them to be forgotten or
embellished; the first information report, it has to be remembered,
can be put in evidence when the informant is examined if it is
desired to do so. (Khawaja Nazir Ahmad case). An FIR is, "only a
mode of recording or preserving an information and is one of the
means to set the machinery of criminal law into motion. Otherwise
we know that presence or existence of an FIR did not confer any
extra or additional powers on a police officer nor did the non-
existence of the same withhold or take away any power vesting in
him (Muhammad Bashir v SHO-PLD 2007 SC $39).
Investigation or enquiry before recording FIR
When the police receive information about the
commission of an offence, they are expected first to find out
whether the offence disclosed falls into the category of cognizable
offence or is one which is non-cognizable. If the offence appears to
be cognizable, the police 'shall' record it, as is required by section
154 Cr.P.C., in the First Information Report Register; if it is non-
cognizable, the police shall, as is required by section 155 Cr.P.C.,
record it in the Diary. Sections 154 and 155 do not visualize or
authorize the holding of an enquiry to assess the correctness or the
falsity of the information before recording the information in the
manner provided by those sections. If such an enquiry is made
before the recording of the information, the FIR would be hit by
the provisions of section 162 and the FIR would be inadmissible at
the trial. (Muhammad Bashir v SHO-PLD 2007 SC 539).
Distinction between Cognizable and Non-Cognizable Offences
For the purposes of investigation, there is a distinction
between a cognizable offence and a non-cognizable offence, and a
292
cognizable case and a non-cognizable case. These expressions are
defined in section 4, sub-section (1) clauses (f) and (n) Cr.P.C. By
clause () 'cognizable offence', means an offence for which, and
'cognizable case' means a case in which, a police officer may, in
accordance with the 2 Schedule to the Code or under any other
law, arrest without warrant. By clause (n) 'non-cognizable offence'
means an offence for which, and 'non-cognizable case" means a
case in which a police officer may not arrest without warrant.
It appears that what is a "cognizable offence", under the
Code is an "arrestable offence" in the English Law.
The broad distinction between a cognizable offence and
a non-cognizable offence, so far as the powers of police officers are
concerned, is that a police officer (i) may arrest a person accused of
a cognizable office without warrant and (ii) may investigate such
offence without the authority of a Magistrate, but may not arrest a
person accused of a non-cognizable offence without warrant and.
as section 155 Cr.P.C. says, "no police officer shall investigate a
non-cognizable case" without the order of the competent
Magistrate.
But when a police officer receives the order of the
competent Magistrate to investigate a non-cognizable offence he
may exercise all the powers that he has while investigating a
cognizable office except that he cannot arrest without warrant.
Cognizable or Non-Cognizable-what is the test
No set principle has been followed in making the
distinction between cognizable and non-cognizable offences. The
criterion of heinousness of the offence may at first sight appear to
be the determining factor but a closer examination of the two
categories of offence would reveal that there is quite a long list of
offences, the heinousness of which can hardly be doubted, as for
instance, the offence of sedition, waging war against the State and
treason, which are not cognizable offences. On the other hand,
some minor offences and even those which are punishable with
fine only, as for instance, the offence of causing danger.
293
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 165
obstruction or injury in any public way under section 283 PPC is
punishable with a fine of Rs.200, are cognizable offences. The
other criteria may be the quantum of sentence provided for the
offence. But this too does not appear to be the determining factor
because the offence of waging or attempting to wage war against
the State under section 121 PPC is punishable with death though it
is not a cognizable offence. Similarly, giving or fabricating false
evidence which results in the conviction and execution of an
innocent person is punishable with death but it is not a cognizable
offence.
Remedies against non-registration:
Under section 154 Cr.P.C. "Every information relating
to the commission of a cognizable offence if given orally to an
officer in charge of a police station shall be reduced to
writing.... and under section 155 Cr.P.C., "when
information is given to an officer in charge of a police station, of
the commission.......... of a non-cognizable offence, he shall
enter in a book to be kept.......the substance of such information
and refer the informant to the Magistrate".
But what is the informant to do if the information that he
conveys to the SHO relates to the commission of a cognizable
offence but the SHO does not reduce it to writing, or as it is
commonly known, register an FIR. The informant may complain to
the higher police authorities, or he may invoke the High Court's
jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution. There is now
another remedy under section 22A, sub-section (6) Cr.P.C.; under
it the informant may approach the Sessions Judge of his district,
who, in his capacity of ex-officio Justice of the Peace, may himself
entertain the complaint or may make over the complaint to an
Additional Sessions Judge nominated by him for disposal. The ex-
officio Justice of the Peace may issue appropriate directions to the
police officer concerned regarding "non-registration of criminal
case".
294
Thus. "these provisions create a new forum to rectify a
wrong done by an officer in charge of police station by refusing to
register a criminal case i.e. not recording an FIR...........Undoing
this wrong of non-registration of a criminal case could mean only
an order to the SHO to register the case. The provisions of sub-
section (6) of section 22A Cr.P.C. confer no additional powers on
an ex-officio Justice of the Peace to hold an enquiry to assess the
credibility of such an information communicated for the purpose in
question nor do the said provisions give any extra authority to the
said ex-officio Justice of the Peace to refuse registration or order
non-registration of an FIR in violation of or beyond the mandatory
requirement of section 154 Cr.P.C.". (Muhammad Bashir v SHO -
PLD 2007 SC 539).
Chapter 3
Power of Magistrate or Court to direct investigation:
Besides the power of a Magistrate to order investigation
in non-cognizable cases, there are at least two other cases in which
a Magistrate or a Court may direct investigation by the police:
(1)
(2)
We shall see that under section 190, Cr.P.C.
which provides for the manner in which a
Magistrate may take cognizance of an
offence, a Magistrate may, inter-alia, take
cognizance of an offence "upon information
received from any person other than a police
officer or upon his own knowledge or
suspicion that such offence has been
committed". Section 156, sub-section (3).
Cr.P.C. empowers the Magistrate to order
police investigation in such a case.
Under section 202, sub-section (1) Cr.P.C.,
any court, on receipt of a complaint of an
offence of which it is authorized to take
cognizance, may, before the issue of process
295

Page 166
Preliminary
to the person accused, either inquire into the
case itself or direct an enquiry or investigation
to be made by a Justice of the Peace, by a
Police Officer or by any other person for
ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the
complaint; sub-section (3) of that section
provides that a Court of Session may, instead
of directing an investigation under sub-section
(1), direct the complaint to be investigated by
a Magistrate or Justice of the Peace.
Chapter 4
Investigation of Offences
Before dealing with the investigation of offences, it is
necessary to be familiar with certain, expressions. The term
"offence" is defined in section 4(1), clause (o) Cr.P.C. to mean any
act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in
force...
Thus, no act or omission is an offence unless it is so
declared by a competent law-making authority. There is, therefore,
in Pakistan, no such thing as a common law offence. The principal
law of Pakistan which creates offences and provides for their
punishment is the Pakistan Penal Code. Other important laws are
the Hadood Laws, which not only codify a part of the Islamic law
of crimes, but also make some procedural provisions applicable at
investigation and trial stages of Hadood cases.
It is also necessary to understand clearly that an
investigating officer exercises only the powers expressly conferred
on him by law. There is no such thing as inherent powers of the
police. As has been succinctly put in Muhammad Bashir v SHO
(PLD 2007 SC 539, 547)-
296
"The powers enjoyed by the members of
the police force are limited to the
authority conferred on them by law".
The general idea of 'investigation' is, first, to find out.
what happened, and, secondly, to report on the matter to some
ather authority, often with a recommendation that certain action
should be taken. It is an administrative process, and like many.an
administrative process need not end in a decision.
The object of investigation is to ensure that no one is put
on trial unless there is a good case against him; it is "to enquire into
the allegations of offence... and to find out if the allegations.
are true or not". (Muhammad Nawaz Khan v Noor Muhammad-
PLD 1967 Lah. 176). The situation is not that of a detective fiction.
The investigator's duty, it must be emphasized, is to collect all
evidence. He is not to wear blinkers so as to proceed on a priori
notion that a particular suspect is guilty. He must collect all
evidence including that which favours the suspect "Merely.
because an FIR has been recorded need not necessarily lead to
investigation or arrest of the person alleged to have committed the
offence". As has been said in Muhammad Bashir v SHO (PLD
2007 SC 539, 550)-
"Nor was there any provision in any law
which commanded or even envisaged
that whenever an FIR got recorded, a
police officer was obliged to go through
the entire length of investigation as he
was permitted by section 157(1)(6) of
the Cr.P.C. to refuse to investigate a
case".
In the context of criminal law, investigation is a process
whereby the administrative expertness, primarily that of the police
and the prosecutor, ascertains the truth or falsehood of the
information or complaint, reaches an early determination of
probable innocence or probable guilt of the person suspected of the
297
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 167
crime. Thus, those who are probably innocent are screened out and
those who are probably guilty are to face the adjudicative part of
the criminal process.
In that context, investigation means investigation by the
police. This notion is reflected in the definition of 'investigation' in
section 4(1)(e) Cr.P.C; it says that 'investigation" "includes all the
proceedings under this Code for the collection of evidence
conducted by a police officer or by any person (other than a
Magistrate) who is authorized by a Magistrate in this behalf.
But, this definition is not exhaustive; also, as section 4
itself says, the words defined in the section have meanings
assigned to them in the section, unless a different intention appears
from the subject or context. For example, under section 202
Cr.P.C., à court, on receipt of a complaint of an offence, may
postpone the issue of process to the person accused and either
enquire into the case itself or direct an enquiry or investigation to
be made by a Justice of the Peace or by a police officer or even by
a private person; and a Court of Session may direct an investigation
to be made by any Magistrate or Justice of the Peace for the
purpose of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint.
Thus, investigation under the Code of Criminal
Procedure does not mean investigation by the police only. The
police are of course the principal agency to investigate offences,
yet, there can be investigation by a Magistrate, by a Justice of the
Peace and even by a private person.
The change under the Police Order 2002:
The Police Order, 2002, by its Article 8, establishes and
organizes the police on "functional basis" into branches, divisions,
bureaus and sections, including "investigation", "crime prevention"
and "crime against women". Thus, investigation is now a
recognizably independent branch of the police. This is made plain
hy Article 18 of the Order, which, among others, provides for the
posting of an Additional Inspector General of Police as the head of
298
investigation in a General Police Area, of a Senior Superintendent
of Police as head of investigation in a Capital City District or City
District and a Superintendent of Police as head of investigation in a
District. That Article requires that "the Investigation Wing shall be
located within the Police Station and shall be responsible to its
hierarchy in the District under the general control of officer in
charge of the police station". Clause (4) of Article 18 lays down
that-
shall be
"All registered cases
investigated by the investigating staff in
the District under the supervision of the
head of investigation".
However, the Government may, by a special or general order.
entrust investigation of offences under local or special laws as
defined in the Pakistan Penal Code and punishable with
imprisonment for a term not exceeding three yeas with or without
any other punishment to the police station staff.
Clause (5) of Article 18 of the Order is important.
Although the head of investigation in a District is, as clause (3) of
Article 18 provides, "subject to the general control of the District
Police Offices", yet the latter "shall not interfere with the process
of investigation". The relationship between the investigation head
and the District Police Officer, so provides clause (5) read with the
Explanation at the end of Article 8, is that "the head of
investigation shall....keep the District Police Officer
informed of the progress of all cases which have a bearing on
public order. The District Police Officer shall provide full support
to the head of investigation in the performance of his duties".
That the investigation is free from interference by the
local government administration is ensured by Article 33 of the
Police Order. Subject to the provisions of the Order, the head of
District Police shall, so provides Article 33, "be responsible to the
Zila Nazim for police functions under this Order but this shall not
include administration of the district police, investigation of
299
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 168
criminal cases and police functions relating to prosecution, which
shall rest with the police". It is important to note that the District
Nazim writes "the Annual Performance Report" of the head of
District Police, but this power to write the Annual Performance
Report does not seem to include the power to write such a report on
the work of the investigation branch. The Zila Nazim may however
visit a police station to find out if any person is under unlawful
detention and make an appropriate order in accordance with law.
Change of Investigation under the Police Order:
Article 18, clause (6) of the Police Order provides for
the procedure to be observed when investigation by one officer is
required to be changed and entrusted to another:
"Investigation shall not be changed
except after due deliberations and
recommendations by a board headed by
an officer not below the rank of Senior
Superintendent of Police and two
Superintendents of Police, one being in
charge of the investigation of the
concerned District".
The final order for the change of investigation "shall be passed by
head of investigation....... who shall record reasons for change of
such investigation", but if it is second change of investigation, it
can be allowed only "with the approval of Provincial Police
Officer, or the Capital City Police Officer, as the case may be".
This topic has also been discussed under the general
heading "Change or transfer of Investigation" in a later part of this
book.
Inconsistencies between the Code of Criminal Procedure and
the Police Order.
The Supreme Court, in Muhammad Bashir case (PLD
2007 SC 539, 559) observed:
"Section 18 and some other provisions
of the Police Order of 2002....
certain
carry
provisions regarding
investigation of criminal cases which
are, at least prima facie, not reconcilable
with the special and the parent
provisions on the subject ie. the
provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure and if it be so then what
would be the effect of such like illegal
investigation on the trials that
followed?"
The question of inconsistency or need to reconcile can arise
because the Code of Criminal Procedure is an "existing law" within
the meaning of Article 143 read with the definition of that
expression in Article 168(7) of the Constitution and the Police
Order 2002, although a legacy of martial law, is a Provincial Law.
The Code of Criminal Procedure is, under the Constitution, a
concurrent subject. The conflict or inconsistency, if any, will
therefore have to be resolved with reference to Article 143, which
provides that if a Provincial Law is repegnant to an existing law,
the existing law will prevail and the Provincial Law shall, to the
extent of repugnancy, be void.
The Supreme Court did not, in Muhammad Bashir case,
identify the provisions in Article 18 of the Police Order which are
"not reconcilable with the special and parent provisions on the
subject i.e. the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure"
because that question was not directly in issue before the Supreme
Court. When such a question is raised in the facts of a particular
case, and the answer returned is that the provisions of the Code will
prevail, then the further question namely what is the effect of
"such-like illegal investigation on the trials that followed" will turn
on the provisions of the Code itself and some well-known general
principles. For example, section 156 of the Code, by its sub-section
(2) provides:
300
301
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 169
"No proceedings of a police officer in
any such case (i.e. investigation into
cognizable cases) shall at any stage be
called in question on the ground that the
case was one which such officer was not
empowered under this section to
investigate".
It may be stated here that so far the courts do not seem to
have been confronted with such a constitutional question. In some
cases, the questions raised were as to the competence of the police
to investigate cases and of changing investigations and the courts
seem to have assumed that the governing law is the Police Order,
2002. Thus, in Aziz Ahmad v Provincial Police Officer (PLD 2005
Lah. 185), it was held that "the spirit of Article 18(6) of the Police
Order 2002 is to discourage re-investigations. That is why re-
investigation has been made difficult and a clear procedure has
been provided"; in Imran Shaukat v Incharge Investigation (2006
MLD 501) that view was re-iterated and in Muhamamd Farooq
Khan v State (2007 PCr.L J. 89), the SHO had entrusted the
investigation to one of his subordinates presumably under section
57(1) Cr.P.C. This was held to "be in clear violation of Article
18(4) of the Police Order, 2002". This violation, it was held
further, "may not have the effect of vitiating the trial, it will
certainly damage the fairness of the investigation, one of the main
objects sought to be achieved by the Police Order..........".
Basic Functions of investigation:
As to what are the basic functions of 'investigation', we
may again emphasize that the definition of the term is not
exhaustive; it is inclusive and all that it says, as regards the
investigative functions, is that it "includes all the proceedings
under this Code (of Criminal Procedure) for the collection of
evidence conducted by a police officer......... ". That necessarily
means that collection of evidence, though one of the primary
functions, is not the only investigative function of the police.
302
Besides the collection of evidence, the other basic investigative
functions that need to be identified are -
i)
iii)
iv)
determining whether the alleged crime has
been committed;
detecting the possible offender;
apprehending that person;
formation of a prima facie opinion on the
basis of the evidence collected and other
matters as to the truth or falsehood of the
information and the probable guilt or
innocence of the suspect.
Reference in this behalf may usefully be made to section
157(1) Cr.P.C.. which provides that if from information received or
otherwise, the officer in charge of the police station has reason to
suspect the commission of a cognizable offence, he or an officer
deputed by him shall proceed to the spot "to investigate the facts
and circumstances of the case and if necessary to take measures for
the discovery and arrest of the offender".
There are however some observations in Muhammad
Bashir case (PLD 2007 SC 539, 548. 557) which need to be
considered. In the context of investigation, the learned Judge
wrote:
"And "investigation' as defined in
section 4(1)(b) of the said Code means
only the collection of evidence and no
more".
As if to leave no doubt as to what the learned Judge intended to
hold, he added-
"Therefore, in any criminal proceedings.
the job of a police officer only is to
collect evidence and to place the same
along with the information before the
303
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 170
and that-
competent Magistrate in the form of a
report in terms of section 173 Cr.P.C",
"Needless to say that determination of
guilt or innocence of accused persons
would be a futile desire if no evidence
was available with the Courts of that
purpose. The Code of Criminal
Procedure, therefore,
devised
mechanism for collection of evidence
and gave it the name of investigation".
The conclusion that "investigation" means "only the collection of
evidence, and no more" is, it is submitted, supportable if, and only
if, the word 'includes' in section 4(1)(1) is read as 'means", so as to
make the definition exhaustive. There seems to be no compelling
reason to do so. The only other way out of the difficulty seems to
be to confine those observations to the facts of that case only.
Discretion not to investigate:
There is under section 157(1), proviso (b), discretion in
the police not to investigate a case, even through an FIR disclosing
the commission of a cognizable case has been registered "if it
appears to the officer in charge of a police station that there is no
sufficient ground for entering on an investigation". Thus, while
there is no power in the police officer to refuse to record an FIR
provided the information conveyed to him disclosed the
commission of a cognizable offence, the provisions of section 157
Cr. P. C. "equip a police officer only with a discretion to refuse to
investigate a case"; nor does -
"the recording of an FIR mean that the
SHO or a police officer deputed by him
was obliged to investigate the case or to
go through the whole length of
304
investigation of the case mentioned
therein or that any accused person
nominated
be
therein
must
arrested." (Muhammad Bashir v
SHO-PLD 2007 SC 539, 550, 552).
Investigation and Women:
Under section 156B Cr.P.C no police officer below the
rank of Superintendent of Police shall investigate an offence of
Zina under the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hadood)
Ordinance 1979; nor shall a woman accused be arrested without the
permission of the court. This provision is obviously for the
protection of women.
Then, section 48 Cr.P.C. provides for a situation in
which the police needs entry into a place for the arrest of a person
and the place is occupied by a woman. The police shall before
forcing its entry into such a place "give notice to such woman that
she is at liberty to withdraw and shall afford her every reasonable
facility for withdrawing and may then break open the apartment
and enter it".
Section 51 Cr.P.C. empowers the police to search the
person of an arrestee, but when the arrestee is a woman, section 52
Cr.P.C. requires that "the search shall be made by another woman
with strict regard to decency".
Section 167, sub-section (5), forbids remand to police
custody of a woman during investigation except in cases of dacoity
and gatl, and that too for reasons to be recorded in writing.
Investigation of such female accused can be in the prison in the
presence of an officer of jail and a female police officer.
Investigation of offence under Section 295C PPC:
An offence against section 295C PPC (Defiling of the
sacred name of the Holy Prophet) can be, section 156A Cr.P.C. so
305
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 171
provides, investigated by a police officer not below the rank of
Superintendent of Police.
Pre-arrest investigation:
What usually happens is that a possible crime comes to
the attention of the police after it has been committed. But it may
happen, e.g. in victimless crimes, such as gambling and narcotics,
that the police initiates investigation of a crime even before it is
completed. In such cases, the police often use under-cover agents
and other investigative information aimed at trapping potential
offenders.
Then, there is pre-arrest investigation aimed primarily at
determining (i) whether the crime actually was committed; and (ii)
if it was committed, whether there is sufficient material as to the
guilt of a particular person to justify his arrest.
Arrest:
Chapter 5
Arrest and Custody
The term 'arrest' has various definitions; a commonly
accepted meaning is the taking of a person into custody for the
purpose of charging him with a crime. This ordinarily involves the
officer's exercise of physical control over the suspect. The general
principle is that to make an arrest the officer must have reasonable
grounds or probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested
is the offender. The authority for this general principle is to be
found in Article 10 of the Constitution. That Article among others,
requires that the person arrested must be informed, as soon as may
be, "of the grounds for such arrest". Grounds for the arrest must
therefore exist before the arrest takes place, Then, the grounds must
be reasonable grounds, that is, grounds upon which a reasonable
man can act, or otherwise the arrest will be illegal. As was pointed
out in Muhammad Bashir case (PLD 2007 SC 539, at 550) the
power to arrest is subject to the conditions prescribed in section 54
Cr PC:
"...irrespective of the fact whether
an FIR did or did not stand recorded and
also irrespective of the fact whether
person did or did not stand nominated as
an accused person, a police officer could
arrest a person only after the conditions
prescribed therefore, by the said section
54 stood satisfied.
It must, therefore, be kept in mind that
mere registration of an FIR could bring
no harm to a person against whom it had
been recorded. No one, consequently,
need fear a fake FIR. And if a police
officer arrested a person in the absence
of the requisite material justifying the
same and only on the pretext of such a
person being mentioned in the FIR then
such would be an abuse of power by him
and the remedy for such a misuse of
power would not be to permit another
abuse of law by allowing an unlawful
exercise of collection of evidence to
assess the veracity of allegations leveled
through the information conveyed to a
SHO before recording of an FR. The
remedy lies elsewhere".
'Arrest' is a public act that may seriously interfere with
the defendant's liberty, whether he is free on bail or not, drain his
financial resources, curtail his associations, subject him to public
obloquy (abuse, censure) and create anxiety in him, his family and
his friends. (Marion, 404 US 307 (1971).
As used in criminal statutes, the word "arrest' is a term
of art; it is constituted by a physical seizure or touching of the
arrested person's body, with a view to his being taken into custody
in connection with a criminal charge but there may be arrest by
306
307

Page 172
mere words. According to Lord Denning (The Due Process of
Law" p. 103) "when a police constable says to a man 'come along
with me, I am taking you to the station, that is an arrest". It should
be noted that 'arrest' is a continuing act; it starts with the arrester
taking a person into custody (by action or words restraining him
from moving anywhere beyond the arrester's control) and it
continues until the person so restrained is either released from
custody or having been brought before a Magistrate, is remanded in
custody by the Magistrate's judicial act. In practice, since the
creation of organized police forces an arrested person, on being
taking into custody, is brought to a police station and it is there that
he is detained until he is either brought before a Magistrate or
released on bail. In modem conditions any other way of dealing
with an arrested person would be impracticable; provisions for buil
by the police are drafted on the assumption that this will be done".
(Holgate-Mohammad v Duke-(1984) 1 All ER 1054, 1056).
Section 46 Cr.P.C. provides that in making an arrest, the
police officer or other person shall actually touch or confine the
body of the person to be arrested, unless there be a submission to
the custody by word or action. If there is resistance or attempt to
evade arrest, the police officer or other person may use all means
necessary to effect the arrest. The words "all means" are very wide;
they include the act of pursuing the offender and the taking of
assistance from others in effecting the arrest. Under section 59 read
with section 46 Cr. P. C., a person who affords assistance, even
though the crime had not been committed within his view, is as
much protected as the person within whose view the crime had
been committed. (Sultan Ahmad v State PLD 1990 SC 206, 211).
Sections 47 to 53 Cr.P.C. authorize police officers to
enter into any place to arrest the required person, even to break into
any such place, to search the person of the arrestee and to seize any
weapon from him.
Persons who may be arrested and by whom:
There are two categories of persons who may be arrested
without warrant: Section 54 Cr.P.C. enumerates one category of
persons and the power to arrest here is in "any police officer", and
section 55 enumerates the second category of persons and the
power to arrest under it is in "any officer in charge of a police
station". Included in the first category are-
1)
2)
3)
4)
any person "who has been concerned in any
cognizable offence or against whom a
reasonable complaint has been made or
credible information has been received or a
reasonable suspicion exists of his having been
so concerned";
any person "having in his possession without
lawful excuse, the burden of proving which
shall lie on such person, any implement of
house-breaking":
any proclaimed offender,
any person found in possession of property
reasonably suspected to be stolen property:
5)
any person who obstructs a police officer in
the execution of his duty or escapes or
attempts to escape, from lawful custody;
6)
a deserter from armed forces;
7)
8)
any person who has been concerned or is
reasonably suspected to have been concerned
in the commission of an offence outside
Pakistan;
any released convict who has committed a
breach of any rule made under section 565(3)
Cr.P.C; and
308

9)
any person for whose arrest a requisition has
been received from another police officer.
The second category of persons who may be arrested
without warrant under Section 55 Cr.P.C. include-
b)
c)
any person found taking precautions to
conceal his presence under the circumstances
which afford reason to believe that he is doing
so for the purpose of committing a cognizable
offence;
any person "who has no ostensible means of
subsistence or who cannot give a satisfactory
account of himself;
any person who is reputed to be an habitual
robber, house-breaker or thief etc.
We have seen that the power to arrest seriously affects
the most cherished right to liberty of citizens, guaranteed by no less
an authority than the Constitution itself and must therefore be
construed strictly, that is, every doubt must be resolved in favour of
the citizen. To repeat what the Supreme Court has said in
Muhammad Bashir case, the power to arrest under these sections is
subject to the fulfillment of the conditions mentioned therein; those
conditions provide the justification for arrest without warrant, non-
fulfillment whereof is abuse of power.
With these prefatory remarks, we proceed to consider
some of those provisions, which deserve special treatment.
Arrest in Cognizable Cases:
We have noticed that the general principle is that to
make an arrest the police must have reasonable ground or probable
cause to believe that the person to be arrested is the offender. In the
310
words of Section 54, the police officer must be satisfied that the
person to be arrested has been concerned in the commission of the
offence or is reasonably suspected to be so concerned. Merely
because a person is named in the FIR is not a sufficient justification
to arrest.
Arrest for possession of house-breaking implement:
This gives a very wide power to the police. No definition
of "house-breaking implement" has been given, and this makes the
power all the more awful. There, thus, seems to be no basis in law
for depriving a citizen of his liberty, or to leave him at the mercy
and unguided discretion of the police.
These are serious considerations for the removal of this
provision from the Statute Book.
Arrest under Section 55 Cr.P.C:
While arrest under clause (a) of section 55 Cr.P.C. read
with Section 109, clause (a), is understandable, there seems to be
no basis in law for the arrest of a person covered by clause (b) or
(c) of section 55. An unemployed or jobless person may well be, in
the opinion of a police officer, a person "who has no ostensible
means of subsistence". And why should a citizen be required to
give a satisfactory account of himself? Is it not sufficient that he is
a citizen of Pakistan? Clause (c) punishes status, and that too based
on reputation-one who is reputed to be a habitual robber, house-
breaker or thief etc- and not an act, and the question is, does the
Constitution permit the imprisonment of a person for a mere
reputation or for what is a man's status or condition and not an act?
Item 46 of the Concurrent Legislative List authorizes the
Legislature to create "offences against laws with respect to any of
the matters in this List", and an offence is an act or omission made
punishable by law. Mere intention or a bare desire is not an
offence, and nobody can be imprisoned for it. If one can be
imprisoned and deprived of his liberty for having the reputation of
being a thief, robber etc, he may as well be imprisoned for being
311

Page 174
mentally ill or for having a common cold. The power given by
section 55, clauses (b) and (c), therefore seems to exceed the
authority that the Legislature may exercise in enacting its criminal
law.
In Lawrence Robinson v California (370 US 660; 8 L Ed
2d 758), it was an offence to be addicted to the use of narcotics.
This was held by the US Supreme Court to amount to punishing
status and the conviction was set aside on various grounds,
including that such a punishment will be cruel and that it would
amount to treating the man as something less human.
Arrest by persons other than Police:
A Justice of the Peace for any local area has, under
section 22A Cr.P.C., the power to make arrest and to exercise for
that purpose the powers of police officers under sections 54 and 55
Cr.P.C.
Even a private person has power under section 59
Cr.P.C. "to arrest ay person who in his view commits a non-
bailable and cognizable offence, or any proclaimed
offender...........
The procedure as to how further to deal with an arrestee
under section 22A is that the Justice of the Peace shall take or
cause to be taken the arrestee to the officer in charge of the nearest
police station and furnish a report of the circumstances of the arrest
and the said officer shall then re-arrest the person, and under
section 59 is that the private person shall, without unnecessary
delay, make over the arrestee to a police officer or take or cause the
arrestee to be taken to the nearest police station. The police officer
shall, if there is reason to believe that the arrestee comes under the
provisions of section 54, re-arrest him.
Important questions can arise when the person sought to
be arrested resists his arrest or tries to escape, is given a chase and
causes hurt or death.
In Sultan Ahmad v State (PLD 1970 SC 206), Sultan
Ahmad accused armed with a pistol and Rafiq accused armed with
a rifle went to the house of Nazir Ahmad PW, knocked at the door.
which was opened by Rabia deceased. Both the accused fired and
killed Rabia. Nazar Hussain and Talib Hussain PWs saw the killing
and ran after the accused. On the way, others, including Ali
Muhammad deceased, joined in the chase. The accused fired at the
pursuers, who remained undeterred and continued the chase.
Ultimately, Ali Muhammad deceased overtook Sultan Ahmad
accused and tried to catch hold of him. Sultan Ahmad accused told
him to desist and when Ali Muhammad did not, Sultan fired at and
killed Ali Muhammad.
On behalf of Sultan Ahmad accused, the plea taken was
that he had killed Ali Muhammad in self defence, for under section
59 Cr.P.C. a private person's right to arrest was limited to only a
culprit who had committed a cognizable and non-bailable offence
within his view, and Rabia's murder had not been committed
within the view of Ali Muhammad deceased, and he had therefore
no legal right to pursue or arrest him. It was held:
"While section 59 Cr.P.C. provides for
the circumstances in which a private
person may arrest an offender, section
46 lays down how is that arrest to be
effected and authorizes the use of all
means necessary to execute that purpose.
the protection under section 59 Cr.P.C.
afforded to a private person for the
apprehension of an offender who
commits a cognizable and non-bailable
offence in his presence would be
available to him if he can establish his
connection with the crime either by sight
or sound, that is to say, not only if he
312
313
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 175
personally witnesses the crime but also if
he comes to know of it from what he
hears about it from persons concerned in
the crime immediately after the
commission of that crime".
The Supreme Court went on to hold that -
to
section 59 should not be
construed so as to burden the legislature
with the intention that in providing the
shield to private individuals
apprehend the culprits who commit
cognizable and non-bailable offences in
their presence, it had intended that this
shield is to be limited only for those
individuals who actually see the
commission of the crime by their own
eyes and is not available to those who
come to their assistance on their outcry
for help. Such a restricted view, in our
opinion, would destroy the much wanted
but rarely displayed public spirit on the
part of the neighbours and others who
might come to the rescue of the victims
of dastardly crimes and help them in
bringing the culprits to book.........
It was therefore held that Sultan Ahmad accused was not justified
in killing Ali Muhammad.
Custody:
The word 'custody' has occurred in section 46 Cr.P.C..
as also in the definition of 'arrest'. The essence of custody is that
"there should be lack of freedom to move about where and when
one pleases, coupled with a physical power immediately available
to prevent an attempt at breaking the restrictions imposed to
314
distinguish from the power subsequently to punish for the breach
of those restrictions; and if a person is told that he must not go
beyond certain boundaries and he sees or is told that if he did.
physical force would be available to prevent him from doing so,
there would then be no difference in kind between his confinement
or custody and that of a person confined in jail. Thus, an order
confining a person to the limits of his house will be confinement in
custody. (Muhammad Anwar case PLD 1963 Lah. 109; Begum
Nazir Abdul Hamid-PLD 1974 Lah. 7, 16-17).
The person arrested will, after his arrest, be taken to the.
police station which usually has a jail or lock-up or similar police
facility. There he is 'booked', a clerical process by which an
administrative record is made of the arrest. Thus, Art. 167 of the
Police Order, 2002, requires a prescribed daily diary to be
maintained at every police station and names of all complainants,
persons arrested and offences charged, the weapons or property
taken to be recorded therein.
Safeguards as to arrest and detention:
This topic has received a somewhat detailed treatment
under the "Constitutional Criminal Procedure" part of this book
under Article 10 of the Constitution. There, besides discussing the
scope and reach of Article 10 with the aid of corresponding
provisions in the US Constitution and the Indian Constitution, there
is a discussion on "arrest". "custody", "custodial interrogation" and
as to how the constitutional protection provided by Article 10 has
affected sections 60, 61 and 81 Cr.P.C. Reference in that
connection has been made to the Indian case of Ajaib Singh (AIR
1953 SC 10) where the view taken was that the protection given by
Article 22(1) of the Indian Constitution (Article 10 of our
Constitution) applies to arrest without warrants only, and to Bazal
Ahmad (PLD 1957 (WP) Lah. 398), where a different view has
been taken and it has been held that the protection applies both to
arrests with or without warrant. This latter view goes to the validity
of sections 60, 61 and 81 Cr.P.C., for the Constitution prevails over
an ordinary law.
315

Page 176
It may be noted here that in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, as re-enacted in India in 1973, the view that the
protection is available even when the arrest is in pursuance of
warrant has been adopted. (Sections 50,55,75 of the India Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973).
Chapter 6
Remand to custody during Investigation:
Both under Article 10(2) of the Constitution and section
61 Cr.P.C., an arrestee cannot be kept in custody, for more than 24
hours, in the language of Article 10(2). "without the authority of a
Magistrate" and in the language of section 61 Cr.P.C, "in the
absence of a special order of a Magistrate under section 167"
Cr.P.C.
Section 167 Cr.P.C. provides that if the investigation
cannot be completed within 24 hours and there are grounds for
believing that the accusation or information is well founded, the
investigating officer shall forthwith transmit to the nearest
Magistrate a copy of the entries prescribed by section 172 Cr.P.C.
relating to the case and shall at the same time forward the accused
to such Magistrate, who may "from time to time, authorize the
detention of the accused in such custody as such Magistrate thinks
fit". If such Magistrate "has no jurisdiction to try the case or send it
for trial and considers further detention unnecessary, he may order
the accused to be forwarded to a Magistrate having such
jurisdiction". The Magistrate may authorize the detention of the
accused in such custody. police or judicial, for a term not
exceeding 15 days in the whole. Section 167, by its sub-section (5).
makes special provisions for the protection of women.
A remand can be (i) remand to police custody; (ii)
remand to judicial custody and (iii) remand on bail. Here we shall
deal with the first two; remand on bail will be dealt with later.
Section 167 provides for a situation when the
investigation cannot be completed within 24 hours. This section is
in the nature of an exception to section 61 Cr.P.C. which provides
that a police officer shall not detain an arrested person for a longer
period than under all the circumstances of the case is reasonable,
and such period shall not in the absence of a special order of a
Magistrate under section 167 exceed 24 hours. These two sections
contemplate that an investigation is to be completed within 24
hours of the arrest of a person but if the investigation cannot be
completed within that period, then the police officer shall forward
the accused to the nearest Magistrate (not necessarily the trial
Magistrate), along with a copy of the entries in the diary
maintained under section 172 of the Cr.P.C. (Muhammad Siddiq v
Province of Sindh - PLD 1992 Kar. 538). The Magistrate to whom
the accused is so forwarded may authorize detention of the accused
for such custody as such Magistrates thinks fit for a term not
exceeding 15 days in the whole. If the Magistrate is not the trial
Magistrate, and he thinks that further detention is unnecessary_he...
may order the accused to be forwarded to the trial Magistrate.
Remand to police custody and judicial custody - distinction
It will be noticed that the power of the Magistrate to
whom the accused is forwarded under this section is to authorize
the detention of the accused in such custody as the Magistrate
thinks fit. The custody can be police custody or judicial custody
and this is a very important distinction.
The power given by section 167 cannot be exercised by
a Magistrate of 3d class at all; it cannot also be exercised by a
Magistrate of the 2nd class unless he is specially empowered in that
behalf.
Further, the Magistrate authorizing detention in the
custody of police must record his reason for so doing and send a
copy of his order with his reasons for making it to the Sessions
Judge. As was held in Muhammad Siddiq case (PLD 1992 Kar.
538), the Magistrate before whom the accused is produced is
317
316

Page 177
expected to put specific questions on all aspects to ensure that the
police does not commit illegal acts.
Instructions which must guide the remand to police
custody are contained in Chapter 11-B of Volume 111 of the High
Court Rules and Orders; in that Chapter will also be found the
principles laid down for the guidance of the Magistrates in the
matter of granting remand. The propositions to be high-lighted in
view of the principles laid down in the High Court Rules and
Orders Volume III and some of the decided cases (inter- alia see
Nazir Ahmad v State-PLD 1978 SC 236; J.C. Shah v Ramswami
- AIR 1969 S.C. 1014; Ghulam Sarwar v State-1984 P. Cr. L. J.
2588 noticed in Khan Asfandyarwali v Federation - PLD 2001
S.C. 607, 608, 609; Muhammad Siddiq v Province of Sind - PLD
1992 Kar. 358; Azmat Ali v State PLD 1999 Pesh. 39) may be
stated as follows:
(1)
(2)
The provisions of sections 61 and 167
Cr.P.C. affect the liberty of a person and
must therefore be strictly construed, i.e.
if there is any doubt, that will be
resolved in favour of the arrested person;
Remands, remands to police custody in
particular, are not to be given as a matter
of routine. This is clear from the fact that
the police officer forwarding the accused
persons to the Magistrate is required also
to transmit to the Magistrate a copy of
the entries in the diary maintained under
section 172 Cr.P.C. The object of the
requirement that the accused person
should be present at the time the
Magistrate makes the order of remand
and the presence of the police diary
before him is to enable an independent
judicial authority to apply its mind to the
facts of the case and also to provide to
318
3)
4)
the arrested person an opportunity to
complain as to excesses, if any, of the
police during his detention in their
custody.
It should be obvious from a bare reading
of the provisions of section 167 that the
function of the Magistrate under this
section is a judicial function. He must
record reasons for sending the accused
back to the police custody and to ensure
that the reasons are good reasons, he
must send a copy of his order to the
Sessions Judge.
It necessarily implies from the power to
refuse remand to either custody that
further detention is unnecessary and that
the arrested person should be released on
bail. Released on bail means remanded
on bail
Chapter 7
Liberty and vigilance
The power to authorize the detention of an arrestee must
be guided by the inspired saying that "the condition upon which
God hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance which condition
if he break, servitude is at once the consequence of his crime, and
the punishment of his guilt. "(John Philpot Curran, quoted in
Manzoor Ahmad v Malik Yaqoob PLD 1988 Lah. 627, 632).
Vigilance in the context of this power means vigilance not only on
the part of the arrestee but also on the part of the Magistrates and
the Sessions Judges who have been, by these provisions.
constituted the guardians of this "most cherished right" to liberty. It
is, said Justice Bradley in that landmark opinion in Boyd (116 US
616 (1886)) "the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional
319
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 178
rights of the citizen and against any stealthy encroachments
thereon. The motto should be obsta principiis", (which means resist
the first approaches or encroachments). The Sessions Judges have
an important supervisory role to play over the Magistrate's remand
power. Under Section 167(3) Cr.P.C. the Magistrate must give
reasons for remand to police custody and sub-section (4) thereof
requires that the order containing such reasons shall be forwarded
to the Sessions Judge. Remand to police custody is a serious matter
and the object is to ensure that the Magistrate applies his judicial
mind and the Sessions Judge keeps a vigilant eye on the exercise of
that power by examining the reasons for remand sent to him under
section 167(4) Cr.P.C.
Chapter 8
Post-arrest investigation: Sections 160 to 162 Cr.P.C.
Post-arrest investigation varies with the fact situation.
There will be little post-arrest investigation where the arrestee has
been caught red-handed. In other cases, investigative activities may
consist of witness interviews, inspection of the scene of occurrence
and taking into possession of things relevant to the crime, search of
the suspect's home.
Post-arrest investigation offers one additional source of
information, namely, the person of the arrestee. If there is a
question of identity, there can be an identification parade or
identification test; that is, the arrestee may be placed in a line-up
where he can be viewed by the witnesses for the purpose of
connecting him with the crime. He can be required to provide
hand-writing or other samples. During the course of investigation,
the Investigating Officer has power under sections 160 and 161
Cr.P.C. to require the attendance of any person who may be
acquainted with the circumstances of the case and may examine
such person orally. Statements made orally under sections 160 and
161 Cr.P.C. may be reduced into writing. No such statement will
be signed by the person making it; nor shall it be, as section 162
Cr.P.C. provides, used for any purpose, at an enquiry or trial in
320
respect of any offence under investigation, except for the purpose
of contradicting such person when he appears as a witness. In other
words, statement of a witness before the police cannot be used as
evidence at the trial; the only way to use it is that when he appears
as witness to testify at the trial, he may be cross-examined to bring
out inconsistencies between his police statement and the statement
at the trial,
In enjoining that "no statement by any person
.......shall, if reduced into writing, be signed by the person making
it", the intention is to provide a statutory safeguard against
improper police practices (Zahiruddin v Emperor - AIR 1947 PC
75; to encourage the free disclosure of information or to protect the
person making the statement from a supposed unreliability of
police testimony as to alleged statements or both (Pakala Narayana
Swami v Emperor AIR 1939 PC 46, 51). Sub-section (2) of this
section provides that "Nothing in this section shall be deemed to
apply to any statement falling within the provisions of Article 46(1)
or to affect the provisions of Article 40 of the Qanoon-e-Shahdat
1984",
Proviso to Section 162(1) stands partly repealed:
The first Proviso to subsection (1) of section 162, in so
far as it provides that "when any witness is called in such inquiry
or trial whose statement has been reduced into writing as aforesaid
(that is, under section 161 Cr.P.C) the court shall, on the request of
the accused, refer to such writing and direct that the accused be
furnished with a copy thereof......." stands impliedly repealed by
sections 241A and 265C Cr.P.C, which provide that in all cases
instituted upon a police report, copies of the statements under
section 161 Cr.P.C. shall be supplied, free of cost to the accused,
not later than seven days before the commencement of the trial.
Copies of such statements "must now be supplied by the State
seven days before the commencement of the trial and it is not
necessary to wait till the witness is called by the prosecution or the
321

Page 179
accused asks for them" (Z A Bhutto case PLD 1979 SC 53, para
276 of the Judgment of Anwar-ul-Haq, C.J).
Even an entry in the diary u/s 172 Cr.P.C. may be treated as
statement u/s 161:
By section 161(3) Cr.P.C. where a statement has been
made to the police by a person during investigation, the police
officer, "shall make a separate record of the statement.......
Where however the police officer does not do so, but proceeds to
incorporate it in the case diary kept under section 172 Cr.P.C, the
said statement should be construed as a statement under section
161 Cr.P.C., provided of course it is in substance and essence a
statement of the witness and not merely a statement of the
circumstances ascertained through investigation. Thus, it is, so
wrote Anwar-ul-Haq, CJ. in Z A Bhutto case (Para 278 of his
Judgment):
"the nature of the statement and not the
label given to it which will determine its
real character. The provisions of section
265C are salutary and enacted for the
benefit of the accused, conferring as they
do a valuable right in his favour of his
being apprised of the case set up against
him. This right cannot be taken away or
evaded by allowing the investigating
officer misusing his authority by
incorporating in the case diary the
statements recorded by him during
investigation which though in spirit and
essence fall within the purview of
section 161 Cr.P.C. but are erroneously
or mischievously embodied by him in
the case diaries.......
Chapter 9
Interrogation:
Interrogation of the suspect or the person accused, when
he is in police custody, is an investigative tool for obtaining
evidence, like a search or a blood test. It is a low visibility area and
most of the sins against constitutional and legal rights are
committed during interrogation by investigation agencies.
The power to investigate is implicit in section 161(1)
Cr.P.C: the heading of that section "Examination of witnesses by
police" is misleading, for power, under section 161(1), is to
examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the
facts and circumstances of the case". The power to examine is
therefore not limited to witnesses only. The section is drawn in a
general way relating to "any person". That "the words in their
ordinary meaning would include any person though he may
thereafter be accused seems plain. Investigation into crime often
includes the examination of a number of persons none of whom
may or all of whom may be suspected at the time..." (Pakala
Narayana Swami v Emperor AIR 1939 PC 46, 51)
Custodial interrogation means "questioning initiated by
law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody
or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant
way (Chief Justice Warren in Miranda 384 US 436; 16 L Ed 2d
694-1966). The term 'interrogation' refers not only to express
questioning but also to its functional equivalent, "to any words or
actions on the part of the police (other than those normally
attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are
reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the
suspect. This latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon
the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the
police. A practice that the police should know is reasonably
likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect thus
322
323
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 180
amounts to interrogation". (Rhode Island v Innis-446 US 291,64
L Ed 2d 297 (1980).
It was held in Ashcraft (322 US 143; 88 L Ed 1192) that
the detention and questioning of a suspect for a long period of time
say for thirty six hours and even for one hour is "inherently
coercive". As Chief Justice Warren stressed in Miranda, "the
modem practice of in-custody interrogations is psychological
rather than physically oriented...... Interrogations still take place in
privacy. Privacy results in secrecy and this in turn results in a gap
in our knowledge as to what in fact goes on in the interrogation
rooms. Thus, 'coercion' or 'torture" can be physical as
well as psychological, or as was said in Begum Shamim Afridi case
(PLD 1974 Lah. 120) it can be mental as well as physical.
The procedural safeguards deemed necessary to
neutralize the compulsion and pressure inherent in the interrogation
atmosphere and the evils it can bring are now the familiar
"Miranda Warnings". They have already been discussed in the
Constitutional Criminal Procedure part of this book. There, the
relevance and applicability of these safeguards to investigations
and interrogations in Pakistan have also been discussed.
Chapter 10
Searches and Seizures:
To search persons and premises, and to seize
incriminating evidence, as part of the power to investigate, intimate
relationship between searches and seizures and the right against
self-incrimination and the relevance of the law as developed in
other jurisdictions to our jurisprudence, particularly to the right to
privacy as guaranteed by Article 14(1) of the Constitution of
Pakistan, are topics which have already been treated in the
Constitutional Criminal Procedure part of this book. Suffice it to
say here that the protection against unreasonable searches and
seizures is in fact protection against the violation of the privacy of
324
a person's home and property which is guaranteed by the
Constitution of Pakistan, Article 14 the dignity of man and,
subject to law, privacy of home, shall be inviolable - and that the
relationship between this right and the right against self-
incrimination guaranteed by Article 13(a) of the Constitution of
Pakistan is that searches and seizures are almost always made for
the purpose of compelling a man to provide evidence against him.
Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, sections 47, 48,
49 and 50 provide for the search of places and premises for
effecting an arrest. Section 51 authorises the arrester to search the
person of the arrestee. But when the arrestee is a woman, then.
under section 52, the search shall be made by another woman, with
strict regard to decency. The arrester may, under section 53, "take
from the person arrested any offensive weapons which he has about
his person... Under section 94 any court may issue summons or
an officer in charge of a police station may issue a written order, to
the person in whose possession or power a document or thing is
believed to be requiring him to attend and produce it, if such court
or officer considers that the protection of any document or other
thing is necessary or desirable for the purpose of any investigation.
inquiry, trial, or other proceedings. Section 95 CrPC empowers any
Magistrate, High Court or Court of Session to summon letters.
telegrams etc.
Section 96 CrPC provides that when any court has
reason to believe that a person to whom a summons or order under
sections 94 and 95(1) has been or might be addressed, will not or
would not produce such document or thing or where any document
or thing is not known to the court to be in the possession of any
person, or where the court considers that the purposes of any
enquiry, trial or other proceedings under the Code will be served by
a general search or inspection, "it may issue a search warrant and
the person to whom such warrant is directed may search or inspect
in accordance therewith and the provisions hereinafter contained".
Section 97 empowers the court, if it thinks fit, to specify in the
warrant the particular place or part thereof to which only the search
325
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 181
or inspection shall extend and the person charged with the
execution of such warrant shall then search or inspect only the
place or part so specified. Section 98 empowers a Magistrate of the
1st class to authorize by his warrant any police officer to search
houses suspected to contain stolen property, forged documents etc,
Under section 165 CrPC, if the officer incharge of the
police station or a police officer making an investigation, who has
reasonable grounds for believing that "anything necessary for the
purpose of investigation into any offence...
may be found
in any place and such thing cannot in his opinion he
otherwise obtained without undue delay", he shall record in writing
the grounds of his belief and specify in such writing, so far as
possible, the thing for which search is to be made before he makes
the search or causes it to be made.
The proviso to sub-section (1) of section 165 Cr.P.C.
forbids the search for anything which is in the custody of a bank or
banker as defined in the Banker's Book Evidence Act, 1891, and
relates, or might disclose any information which relates, to the
bank account of any person, except-
(i)
(ii)
for the purpose of investigating an offence
under sections 403, 406, 408, 409 and
sections 421 to 424, and sections 465 and
477A PPC with the permission in writing of a
Sessions Judge:; and
in other cases, with the prior permission in
writing of the High Court concerned.
By subsection (4) of section 165, "The provisions of this Code as
to search warrants and the general provisions as to searches
contained in section 102 and section 103 shall, so far as may be.
apply to a search made under this section"
326
The general provisions as to searches are contained in
sections 102 and 103 Cr.P.C. Section 102 requires the person
residing in or in charge of the place to be searched, to allow ingress
on the demand of the person or officer executing the warrant and if
ingress is not allowed, to proceed in accordance with section 48
Cr.P.C.. that is, use such force as is mentioned therein.
Section 103 Cr.P.C. applies to all searches under
Chapter VII of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It lays down that
before making a search, the officer or other person shall "call upon
two or more respectable inhabitants of the locality in which the
place to be searched is situate to attend and witness the search and
may issue an order in writing to them to do so". Sub-section (2) of
section 103 requires that-
"The search shall be made in their
presence, and a list of all things seized in
the course of such search and of the
places in which they are respectively
found shall be prepared by such officer
or other person and signed by such
witnesses.....
The search witnesses may, subsection (2) of section 103 provides
further, be summoned to give evidence at the trial. The occupant of
the place searched or somebody on his behalf shall always be
permitted to attend the search and be provided with the list
prepared under this section. A person who refuses or neglects to
attend and witness a search under this section commits an offence
against section 187 PPC.
The application of section 103 Cr.P.C. to different fact
situations, whether it is mandatory or not, and what is the effect of
its violation, are questions which have been considered in a large
number of cases. The section fell for interpretation and
consideration in Mushtaq Ahmad v State (PLD 1996 SC 574) and
the principles deducible from decided cases have been succinctly
summarized in it as follows:-
327

(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
that section 103, Cr.P.C. relates to a
search of a place situate in a locality and
not to a search of a person;
that the requirement of section 103,
Cr.P.C. that the officer or the other
person who is about to make search of a
place under Chapter VII Cr.P.C. shall
call upon two or more respectable
inhabitants of the locality in which the
place to be searched is situate, to attend
and witness the search, though is
procedural but is mandatory in nature. It
is designed and intended to guard against
any possible chicanery and concoction;
that if, in spite of the best efforts on the
part of the officer or the other person
who made the search, two or more
respectable inhabitants had not attended
and witnessed the search and if there
was nothing on record to caste doubt
about the bona fides of the officer or the
other person, the above search would not
be vitiated and the testimony of the
officer concerned could be relied upon;
that there is a marked distinction
between a case in which compliance of
section 103, Cr.P.C. is made and a case
in which no efforts to comply with the
same are made and the police personnel
are made Mashirs to the recovery. In the
former case, failure to produce two-
respectable inhabitants as witnesses in
the court for a justifiable reason free
from any doubt would justify the
(V)
3
(vi)
acceptance of his or their testimony.
whereas in the latter case, the search
would lose its credibility particularly
when the testimony of such Mashirs is
challenged by the defence in the cross-
examination;
that likewise there is a marked
distinction between a case in which the
offence charged with is the recovery of
the article itself like recovery of an
unlicensed Kalashnikov and a case in
which the article recovered, e.g. a crime
weapon, is to be used as a corroborative
piece of evidence. In the former case if
the witnesses to the recovery were police
personnel, though it was possible to have
two Mashirs from the locality where
recovery was made, the testimony in the
absence of other reliable pieces of
evidence would not warrant conviction
whereas in the latter ease, if other pieces
of evidence on record are free from
doubt, the testimony of the police
personnel, if otherwise free from any
legal infirmity, may be accepted:
that there is also a marked distinction
between a case in which a police officer
is an eye-witness to the commission of
an offence like a murder on a road where
he is on duty and a case in which he is
an Investigating Officer and as such
becomes a Mashir to the recovery of a
crime weapon. In the former case, his
testimony is as good as of any other
witness from the public, but in the latter
case, in the absence of any justifiable
329
328
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 183
(vii)
reason not to make two or more
respectable inhabitants of the locality as
witnesses to the recovery, implicit
reliance cannot be placed on the
recovery if the same is challenged by the
defence in cross-examination;
that the question, whether testimony of a
police official as a Mashir to the
recovery of an offending article is to be
accepted or not besides testing on the
touchstone of the above legal principles,
depends on the facts of each case, the
court will have to discern inter-alia, as to
whether such witness bore any animus
against the accused involved or was he
over-zealous Investigating
not
Officer/witness.
In Mushtaq Ahmad, at the time of search, people from
the locality had gathered, yet none of them was associated with the
search and the witnesses to the search were police officials only.
Non-compliance with the requirements of Section 103 Cr.P.C., it
was held. "was not warranted and justified" and the conviction for
the alleged possession of a Kalashnikov and hand grenades was set
aside.
Section 103 Cr.P.C. and Article 40 of Qanun-e-Shahadat
1984 are to be read together. If the accused voluntarily leads to
some discovery, section 103 does not apply. In such a case, the
police officials are as good witnesses as any other person. The
weight to be attached to their evidence is a question of fact (Mir
Ahmed case 1995 SCMR 614)
Constitutional aspects of searches and seizures
We have seen that what is protected by the American 4
Amendment, namely, the right to one's privacy against arbitrary
330
intrusion by the police or other governmental authorities, is
protected by 'dignity of man' and 'privacy of home' rights
guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution of Pakistan. It follows
that in order to preserve the Constitution inviolate and in the
interest of integrity of the courts, all laws and governmental actions
must conform to the Constitution, Article 14, or they are void. For
example, the evil of a 'general warrant was that, the arbitrary
power it granted by leaving it to officials conducting the search to
decide who, where, when and what to search, and thereby placing
the liberty and privacy of every man in the hands of the police. In
England. notorious abuse of this power had. by the mid-1700.
resulted in its abolition; and it is well-known that the American 4"
Amendment was, inter-alia, aimed at that. The power under section
96 Cr.P.C to issue a warrant authorizing 'a general search or
inspection' will therefore be hit by Article 14's protection against
privacy.
Then, the court can always be called upon to determine,
in the facts of a case, whether a search and seizure had violated the
right to privacy guaranteed by Article 14 and, if there be a
violation, invite it to hold that the evidence obtained by such
violation is inadmissible. The argument can be that the scheme
underlying the above mentioned provisions of the Code read with
the Article 14's right of privacy is that ostensibly there should be
no search by the police without a warrant issued by a court or
Magistrate and that a search without such warrant, except in cases
of emergency, is prima facie inadmissible. For example under
section 165 CrPC, the power of an investigating officer to search a
place is subject to the conditions that there are reasonable grounds
for believing that something relevant to the offence may be found
in a place and that such thing cannot in his opinion be otherwise
obtained without more delay. Reasons are always for the court, and
absence of "reasonable grounds for believing" will make the search
unreasonable; and the fact that the search can brook delay, shows
that the legislative intention, conformable with the constitutional
protection provided by Article 14, is that only in exigent
circumstances can there be a search and seizure without warrant.
Indeed, both these questions will ultimately be for the court trying
331
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 184
the offence to decide; and if it holds that the evidence sought to be
produced was obtained in violation of the accused's right
guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution, the court may in the
performance of its duty to preserve the Constitution inviolate, hold
that the evidence is inadmissible.
Chapter 11
Confession during Investigation:
Besides the evidence collected by the police, such as
statements of witnesses, recovery of incriminatory articles etc, an
accused person may voluntarily offer to confess his guilt during the
course of investigation. The police may record such a confession
but it will not be admissible at the trial, for Articles 38 and 39 of
Qanun-e-Shahadat forbid their admission, the presumption being
that such confessions are involuntary and inherently unreliable.
Under Article 39, "no confession made by any person whilst he is
in the custody of the police unless it be made in the immediate
presence of a Magistrate shall be proved as against such person".
The procedure for the recording of such a confession is provided
by sections 164 and 364 Cr.P.C. Such a confession can be recorded
only by a Magistrate of the 1st class or a specially empowered
Magistrate of the 2nd class. The Magistrate shall ensure that the
confession is made voluntarily, and shall explain to the accused
that he is not bound to make it and that if he does, it may be used as
evidence against him. Such a confession shall be recorded and
signed in the manner provided in Section 364 Cr.P.C, and shall
bear the Magistrate's certificate in terms stated in section 164
Cr.P.C.
and 170 seem to apply to cases in which investigation has been
completed within 24 hours. Under section 169, if the investigating
officer finds that there is no sufficient evidence or reasonable
ground for suspicion to justify the forwarding of the accused to a
Magistrate for an order of remand under section 167, he shall
release the accused on his executing a bond, with or without
sureties, and may direct him to appear, if and when so required.
before the Ilaga Magistrate. But if there is sufficient evidence or
reasonable ground for suspicion to justify the forwarding of the
accused to a Magistrate, the investigating officer shall, as is
provided in section 170, forward the accused to the Ilaqa
Magistrate or if the offence is bailable the investigating officer
shall take security from him to appear before the said Magistrate.
The investigating officer shall, in such cases, also send any weapon
or other articles recovered during investigation to the Magistrate
and also require the complainant and the witnesses to execute a
bond to appear before the Magistrate and "prosecute or give
evidence in the matter of the charge against the accused".
Section 171 Cr.P.C. forbids the complainant or
witnesses to be required to accompany a police officer to the court
or otherwise to be subjected to unnecessary restraint or
inconvenience for their attendance at the trial. But if the
complainant or a witness refuses to attend or to execute a bond
under section 170, then the investigation officer may forward him
in custody to the Magistrate "who may detain him in custody until
he executes such bond or until the hearing of the case is
completed"
Chapter 12
POLICE ACTION UNDER SECTIONS 169 AND 170 Cr.P.C.
Sections 61 and 167 Cr.P.C. relate to the power of the
Magistrates to remand to custody, police or judicial, when
investigation cannot be completed within 24 hours. Sections 169

Chapter 13
POLICE REPORT OR CHALLAN UNDER SECTION 173
Cr.P.C.
Section 173 Cr.P.C. mandates that the investigation
"shall be completed without unnecessary delay" ad requires that as
soon as it is completed, the officer in charge of the police station
333
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 185
(even if he 1.
..e investigated the case at all) shall, through
the Public Prosecutor, forward to the Ilaqa Magistrate a police
report in the prescribed form. This is commonly known as the
challan; in the UK and USA the most common titles used for such
a document are the complaint, the information and the indictment.
This is the formal initiation of criminal prosecution by means of a
charging document before a court, a document containing the basic
statement of the charge.
Where the investigation has not been completed within
14 days of the First Information Report under section 154 Cr.P.C.
the section requires an interim report to be filed in the prescribed
form. The court may commence the trial on the basis of the interim
report.
A copy of the report filed under this section shall, on his
application, be supplied to the accused.
The report under section 173 is to be in the form
prescribed by the Provincial Government; that form has seven
columns namely,
Column No.1:
Column No.2:
Column No.3:
Column No.4:
Column No.5:
Column No.6:
Column No.7:
Name of the informant;
Names of the persons who have
not been challaned, including the
names of the persons absconding.
Names of the accused persons who
have been challaned and are in
custody;
Names of persons who have been
challaned but are on bail;
Details of the property recovered
during investigation.
Names and addresses of the
prosecution witnesses;
A statement of the facts of the case
along with opinion of the
investigating officer and the
offences which in the
opinion of the investigating officer
have been committed.
A report under Section 173 may be to the effect:
i)
ii)
that the case is false and should be cancelled;
that the accused persons mentioned in column
Nos.3 and 4 may be tried;
iii)
that the persons mentioned in column No.2
have not been challaned and may not be
proceeded against.
Opinion of Investigation Officer is not binding on court
What is contained in the report under section 173 as to
the guilt or innocence of an accused person is a mere opinion of the
investigating officer; it is not evidence and is not binding upon the
court (Falak Sher v State - PLD 1967 SC 425, Muhammad Bashir
v SHO-PLD 2007 SC 539,548)
Cancellation of a case:
Cancellation of a case on a report under section 173, it
has been held, is an administrative, and not a judicial, act (Bahadur
v State PLD 1985 SC 62; Mohammad Alam v Secretary - PLD
1987 SC 103). In other words, in cancelling a case on the police
report under section 173 or what is described as cancellation of FIR
in Rule 24.7 of the Police Rules, 1934, the Magistrate acts in
executive and not in his judicial capacity so much so that the order
is not revisable under sections 435, 439 Cr.P.C. This does not.
however, mean that the superior courts are powerless to rectify any
injustice. For example, if the court reaches a positive conclusion
that an order cancelling a case amounts to abuse of the process of
the court within the meaning of section 561A, the High Court may
334
335
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 186
intervene (Arif Ali Khan v State 1993 SCMR 187). Further,
cancellation of a case does not amount to acquittal of the accused
person so as to create res judicata (Waqar-ul-Hassan v State-PLD
1988 Lah. 336; 1988 SCMR 1428). Also, the cancellation of a case
does not render the Magistrate functus officio. He may later lake
cognizance of the same offence on a private complaint (Bahadur v
State PLD 1985 SC 62) and the trial court may summon the
accused who was discharged by the Magistrate on a report under
section 173 (Bahadur v State - PLD 1985 SC 62 and Wagar-ul-
Hassan v State-PLD 1988 Lah. 336).
It is now settled law that though section 173(3) Cr.P.C.
does not say so, yet the power to cancel a case on police report "is
inherent in section 173 read with section 190 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure". (Wazir v The State - PLD 1962 (WP) Lah
405 FB).
It is submitted that as the power to cancel is derived
from section 173(3) Cr.P.C. what the learned Judges intended to
convey by the word 'inherent' is that the power is implied, that is,
the Magistrate has the power to cancel under section 173(3) by
necessary implication.
The law is also now settled that once the Magistrate has
taken cognizance of the offence under section 190 Cr.P.C, there
can be no cancellation of a case on a second report by the police.
What amounts to taking cognizance of the offence "would
generally be a question of fact". As was said in Wazir v the State,
"the police report by itself, when received by the Magistrate, does
not constitute the taking of cognizance"; it would "appear more
sensible if he was supposed to take cognizance by a conscious act
leading to the trial"; it is "reasonable to expect that something more
will be done to show that the Magistrate intends to start the
proceeding". This view of the law seems to have been approved by
the Supreme Court in Muhammad Alam v Addl. Secretary (PLD
1987 SC 103).
336
This view seems to proceed on the basis that the taking
of cognizance by the Magistrate brings an end to the administrative
phase of the criminal process under the Code of Criminal
Procedure.
Does the above view need re-consideration
Does the addition of clause (ma) in section 4(1) of the
Code of Criminal Procedure defining 'Magistrate' to mean "a
Judicial Magistrate", in any way, affect the view in Bahadur and
Muhammad Alam cases referred to above namely that an order of
cancellation of a case is an administrative order and is not revisable
under sections 435 and 439 Cr.P.C? Does this change require a
reconsideration of the view in those cases?
The definition of 'Magistrate' in clause (ma) of section
4(1) Cr.P.C. was inserted in 2001; this was part of the process
giving effect to the mandate in Article 175, clause (3). of the
Constitution that "The Judiciary shall be separated progressively
from the Executive.....
As is well known, before this separation of the
magistracy from the Executive, the Magistrates who tried criminal
cases were part of the Executive. So, when a Magistrate made an
order cancelling a case, he acted in an executive or administrative
capacity in the same way as the police acted. in matters of
investigation, as an agency or instrumentality of the Executive.
Now that the Magistrate has only one capacity, and that is a
judicial capacity, can it be said that a cancellation order continues
to remain immune from being interfered with under sections 435
and 439 Cr.P.C?
In considering this question, it is important to point out
that section 561A Cr.P.C. applies only when the order in question
was made by a court; the power under that section is "to prevent an
abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of
justice" The "ends of justice", it was held in Shahnaz Begum case
(PLD 11971 SC 677, 693). 'necessarily means justice as
337
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 187
administered by the courts and not justice in the abstract sense or
justice administered by agencies other than courts".
Yet, it has been held that the High Court may, under
Section 561A Cr.P.C, interfere, if it reaches a positive conclusion
that an order cancelling a case amounts to abuse of the process of
the court. Here, the order cancelling a case has been treated as a
judicial order an order of court as distinguished from an
administrative order. This may logically lead to the conclusion that
as an order cancelling a case attracts the provisions of section
561A, it ought also to attract the jurisdiction under sections 435
and 439 Cr.P.C.
Magistrate, not Court of Session, can cancel
It is also important to note that the power to cancel a
case, even though it be a case triable exclusively by the Court of
Session, is in the Magistrate. The Court of Session has no such
power.
Intention is speedy investigation and to safeguard liberty
"
The combined effect of the provisions of sections 60, 61,
167, and 173 is that a person charged with the commission of an
offence should not remain in police custody or in judicial lock-up
without trial a moment longer than the period that is absolutely
necessary. The words "whenever any person is arrested and
detained in custody and it appears that the investigation cannot be
completed within a period of 24 hours fixed by section.
61.
in section 167 indicate that the law contemplates
that at least in some cases investigation can be completed within 24
hours. If, however, it is not possible to complete the investigation
within 24 hours, the police can ask for remand under section 167
up to a maximum period of 15 days. If the investigation is not
completed within this period, the accused cannot be remanded to
police custody. He can be sent only to the judicial lock-up. The
intention made clearer by the recently added proviso to sub-section
(1) of section 173 Cr.P.C. is that the investigation must be
completed within fourteen days of the FIR and if this cannot be
done, and a final report under section 173 cannot be filed, then an
interim report must be filed within three days of the expiry of the
period of fourteen days. leaving it to the court, in its judicial
discretion, to commence the trial on the basis of the interim report
or not. The provisions of section 173 are mandatory and must be
strictly complied with (Mumtaz Ahmad v State PLD 2002 SC
590, 596).
Chapter 14
Change or Transfer of Investigation:
Till the investigation stage ends, there may be
investigation by one or more investigating officers within the
hierarchy of the investigation branch under the Police Order, 2002.
Article 18. by its clause (4) of that Order, requires that "All
registered cases shall be investigated by the investigating staff in
the district under the supervision of the head of investigation", but
the Provincial Government may, by a special or general order,
entrust investigation of offences under local or special laws as
defined in the Pakistan Penal Code and punishable with
imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years with or without
any other punishment, to the police station staff. Thus, the Police
Order makes distinction between the investigation staff and the
police station staff; ordinarily, the power to investigate vests in the
investigation staff, but for local or special law offences mentioned
above, the Provincial Government may make a special or general
order authorizing their investigation by the police station staff.
At present, there are two provisions relating to transfer
ar change of investigation, that is, section 22A of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, which was enacted in 2002, and Article 18,
clause (6), of the Police Order 2002.
Before the enactment of section 22A of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, there was, as was pointed out in Muhammad
Bashir v SHO (PLD 2007 S.C. 539, 557, 558) no provision in the
339
338
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 188
Code "which talked of any concept of transfer of investigation of
criminal cases":
"The said Code, as would be evident.
inter alia, from its provisions contained
in sections 156 and 157, thought that it
could trust a police officer of the status
of an officer in charge of a police station
for the purpose and consequently
entrusted him with the said task. But
then realizing that in times to come, the
rising number of criminal cases
registered in a given police station could
make it impossible or at least difficult
for him to investigate all the cases
himself, the framers of the Cr.P.C.,
through sub-section (1) of section 157,
allowed him even to depute his
subordinates to carry out any or some of
the investigation required to be
conducted by him. Generally, the SHO
started to use these provisions of section
157(1) Cr.P.C. more or less like a toy.
He would assign a case to one of his
subordinates in his police station, then
withdraw the investigation from him and
depute another subordinate for the
purpose and this process then continued
with no end. This was not all as the
police officers who were superior in rank
to an officer incharge of a police station
and who, by virtue of the provisions of
section 551 Cr.P.C., could exercise the
same powers throughout the local areas
to which they were appointed, which a
SHO could exercise within the limits of
his police station, also entered the arena.
The result was that an investigation then
340
became a rolling stock not only within
the police station to which it belonged
but throughout the district at the instance
of the SP, the range at the instance of the
then DIG and even throughout the
Province at the intervention of the
Inspector General of Police. This tossing
around of the investigation acquired the
name of transfer of investigations and in
turn also acquired notoriety as the same
caused inordinate delays in the
conclusion of investigations, resulted in
contradictory opinions of different
investigating officers and in collection of
pieces of evidence which were
irreconcilable and also because motives
also started to be attributed to orders
leading to such transfers....
The Supreme Court went on to add:
"Needless to add that such like.
investigation had devastating effects on
the quality of trials that followed. And it
was for these reasons that the superior
courts of the country never approved of
the said so-called transfer of
investigation and always deprecated the
same"
It was in this background that section 22A, sub-section
(6). Cr.P.C. which, in the words of the Supreme Court in
Muhammad Bashir case was "an unwelcome and laboured
deviation of the provisions of section 157(1) of the Cr.P.C" was
enacted and "this hithertofore alien institution of transfer of
investigation got introduced into the system".
341

Page 189
Section 22A Cr.P.C, read with section 25, as amended,
also in 2002, provides that an ex officio Justice of the Peace
namely a Sessions Judge and an Additional Sessions Judge so
nominated by the Sessions Judge may issue appropriate directions
to the police authorities concerned on a complaint regarding.
among others,
"(ii) transfer of investigation
from one police officer to another".
While this power to transfer investigation from one
police officer to another seems to be of a quasi-judicial nature, the
power under section 157, sub-section (1). Cr.P.C, which has been
allowed to remain unamended, and the power under Article 18,
clause (6), of the Police Order, seem to be powers of administrative
nature, vesting in the hierarchy of the police.
The crux of Article 18, clause (6), of the Police Order is
that there is now an independent investigation agency in each
district. Clause (6) reads:
"Investigation shall not be changed
except after due deliberation and
recommendations by a board headed by
an officer not below the rank of Senior
Superintendent of Police and two
Superintendents of Police, one being in
charge of the investigation of the
concerned district:
Provided that the final order for the
change of investigation shall be passed
by head of investigation in the general
police area who shall record reasons for
change of such investigation;
Provided further that the second change
of investigation may only be allowed
342
with the approval of the Provincial
Police Officer, or the Capital City Police
Officer, as the case may be".
We have already commented upon the powers of the ex-
officio Justices of the Peace in the context of section 22A Cr.P.C.
and the powers of the Police under the Police Order. We have
noticed that the superior courts have, for reasons noticed in
Muhammad Bashir case, never approved of the transfer of
investigation from one police officer to another.
It has been held that "Article 18(6) of the Police Order
specifies the only manner in which investigation of a criminal case
can be changed. There is no other law authorizing or empowering
any other police officer or authority to change the investigation of a
criminal case. Any change or transfer of investigation of a criminal
case by any officer or authority other than those mentioned in
Article 18(6) of the Police Order. 2002, is to be void and nullity
(PLD 2005 lah. 470).
The above-noted view does not take into account the
provisions of section 157(1) Cr.P.C. It may well be that Article
18(6) of the Police Order has impliedly repealed section 157(1) in
so far as it empowers the SHO to transfer or change investigation
from one of his subordinates to another. But that question will turn
upon the provisions of Article 143 of the Constitution, and upon
the determination of the question as to which of the two laws, the
Code of Criminal Procedure or the Police Order, will prevail, and
the guidance to be gained from the observations of the Supreme
Court in Muhammad Bashir v SHO.
As regards the power of the ex-officio Justice of the
Peace, it has been held in PLD 2005 Lah. 470 that "if the
complaining person has not yet even applied before the competent
authorities under Article 18(6) of the Police Order, 2002, seeking
change of investigation then his complaint under section 22A(6)
Cr.P.C, is not to be entertained by an ex-officio Justice of the Peace
as no occasion has so far arisen for interference in the matter by an
ex-officio Justice of the Peace". And if the competent authorities
343

under Article 18(6)..
...have, it was held, "already
attended to the request of the complaining person regarding
transfer of investigation and have not found the case to be a fit case
for transfer of investigation then too an ex-officio Justice of the
Peace cannot interfere in the matter as the competent authorities
have already consciously attended to the matter and there is
nothing left for the ex-officio Justice of the Peace to get activated
or initiated. An ex-officio Justice of the Peace is not to assume the
role of an appellate, revisional or supervisory authority in this
respect. An ex-officio Justice of the Peace, like any judicial or
other authority outside the police hierarchy, should be extremely
slow in directly interfering with the matter of transfer of
investigation and in an appropriate case he may interfere only
where the authorities mentioned in Article 18(6) of the Police
Order, 2002, have already been approached by the complaining
person but such authorities have failed to attend to his grievance
and the application of the complaining person is lying unattended
to Even in such a case, a Justice of the Peace may refuse to
interfere in the matter unless it is established to his satisfaction that
some specific and particular material pieces of evidence had been
missed out by the investigating officer and the same remain to be
collected by the police..... While attending to such a
complaint an ex-officio Justice of the Peace cannot issue a
direction changing the investigation of a criminal case on his
own....
These views proceed on the basis that the spirit
underlying Article 18(6) is to discourage re-investigation (PLD
2005 lah, 1851. and that Article 18(6) of the Police Order and
section 22A Cr.P.C. are constitutionally valid and can stand
together. Their validity or as to which of them prevails does not so
far appear to have been tested on the touchstone of Article 143 of
the Constitution. Assuming that both are valid and of equal status,
they need to be harmonized so that the legislative intent in vesting
the power to change investigations in the ex-officio Justice of the
Peace. the highest judicial officer in the district, is not frustrated.
Chapter 15
Culminating point of Investigation:
We have seen that the basic object of investigation is to
enquire into the allegations of offence and to find out if the
allegations are true or not and thus to ensure that no one is
subjected to the ordeal of trial unless there is good case against
him. To attain that end, there may be more than one investigation
by more than one investigating officer in the police hierarchy.
subject indeed to the provisions of law discussed above. The
question is - is there a culminating point to investigation or is there
no end to it?
To start with section 173 Cr.P.C, it provides, by its sub-
section (1):
3)
"Every investigation under this Chapter
(Chapter XIV, Part V) shall be
completed without unnecessary delay.
and as soon as it is completed, the
officer in charge of the police station
shall, through the Public Prosecutor.
forward to a Magistrate empowered to
take cognizance of the offence on a
police report, a report in the form
by the
prescribed
Provincial
Government........
The words 'a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the
offence" have reference to section 190 Cr.P.C. That section is
headed: "Cognizance of offences by Magistrates" and provides.
inter-alia, that a Magistrate of the first class may take cognizance
of any offence....
(b)
upon a report in writing of such facts by
any police officer.
344
345

Page 191
The scheme of the Code seems to be that where investigation is not
completed within fourteen days of the FIR, the SHO shall file an
interim police report but after the investigation is completed, there
shall be a final report. This is clear from the words "and as soon as
it (the investigation) is completed, the SHO shall through the
Public Prosecutor, forward to a Magistrate.....
in the form prescribed...
a report
One view therefore can be that the submission of the
challan to the court, through the Public Prosecutor, is the last step
in the investigation process. It is only after the investigation is
completed, that the final police report under section 173 Cr.P.C. is
submitted. But the law, as it now stands, gives a role to the Public
Prosecutor and he, instead of agreeing with the police report and
forwarding it to the Magistrate, may send it back to the police for
something more to be done. (See the discussion under the heading
"Public Prosecutor" in an earlier part of this book). Thus, the
investigation phase may continue till the final police report reaches
the Magistrate through the Public Prosecutor, to enable the
Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence under section 190
Cr.P.C. It was held in the Full Bench case of Wazir v the State
(PLD 1962 (WP) Lah. 405) - a strong Full Bench comprising M.
R. Kayani C.J., Shabir Ahmad and S.A. Mahmood JJ-that.
...the police report by itself, when
received by the Magistrate, does not
constitute the taking of cognizance and it
is reasonable to expect that something
more will be done to show that the
Magistrate intends
start the
proceedings.....".
So, if the Magistrate has not yet taken cognizance of the offence.
and a second police report, as a result of further investigation.
recommending the cancellation of the case is received, the
Magistrate may act upon the second report and cancel the case.
346
On this view, therefore, the culmination point of
investigation by the police is the point at which a competent
Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence under section 190
Cr.P.C. on the police report under section 173 Cr.P.C.
The view taken in Wazir v State was approved by the
Supreme Court in Muhammad Alam v Addl. Secretary (PLD 1987
SC 103).
While decided cases have disapproved, at times in strong
language, the practice of reinvestigation, a clear line separating the
administrative phase from the judicial phase of the criminal justice
system is not discernible. Thus,
(i)
(ii)
in Aftab Ahmad v Hussain Arshad (PLD
1987 SC 13), it was held that subsequent
investigation after submission of first report
under section 173 Cr.P.C. to competent court
is not prohibited; nor is there anything in the
Code to prevent the investigating officer from
in
report
submitting his subsequent
suppression of his earlier report and the
number of investigations into a crime by
Police Officers is not limited by law and when
one has been completed, another may be
commenced on further information received
and this is also possible even after the
submission of the challans and when the couri
has already taken cognizance of the case;
in Riaz Hussain v State (1986 SCMR 1934. it
was noticed that the system of reinvestigation
in criminal cases is a recent innovation which
is always taken up at the instance of
influential people and favourable reports are
obtained which in no way assist the courts in
coming to a correct conclusion but have
created more complications for the courts.
347

(iii)
Such investigations, it was said, retard the
administration of justice.
Bahadur Khan v Muhammad Azam (2006
SCMR 373) has been described by the
Supreme Court as "a classical example" of the
abuse of this power. There a second challan,
as a result of reinvestigation was submitted
after the High Court had already decided the
appeals in the first challan, and the accused
was tried on the basis of the second challan. It
was held:
"It is well settled proposition
of the law as also held
consistently in the reported
judgments of this Court
in view of the
provisions of section 173
Cr.P.C. that no legal bar
existed for reinvestigation of a
criminal case even after
submission of final report
under section 173 Cr.P.C. and
the police could carry out the
fresh investigation and submit
its report to the court but this
would not mean that in a case
in which earlier, after
completion of investigation
challan was submitted for trial
of the offence on which an
accused/accused persons have
been tried and the case finally
decided up to the level of the
High Court and by this Court,
as the case may be, to
entertain the subsequent

challan submitted as the result
of reinvestigation / further
investigation of the case by
the police on the happening of
a subsequent incident......":
in Muhammad Nasir Cheema v Mazher
Javaid (PLD 2007 SC 31) the Supreme Court
held that a reinvestigation after the
commencement of trial and after the filing of
a section 173 report was "unsustainable in
law";
in Khizar Hayat case (PLD 2005 Lah. 470), a
Full Bench of the Lahore High Court held:
"We cannot appreciate or approve the
trend of getting a fresh investigation of a
criminal case conducted after submission
of a challan and taking cognizance of the
trial court. In the absence of any
particular material piece of evidence
shown to have been missed out by the
investigating officer and yet to be
collected by the police there can hardly
be any occasion for holding a fresh
investigation at such a stage...
an FIR cannot be cancelled or an
accused person discharged at such a
stage for the reason that after taking of
cognizance of the case by the trial court
the question of the guilt or innocence of
an accused person or the matter of his
release can be determined by the court
and none else".
If we may say with great respect, while this "disapproval" is an
important step in the development of this branch of the law, it is
349

Page 193
time that the confusion surrounding it is cleared, and it is held, as
binding law, that the police power to investigate ceases at the point
of time the competent court takes cognizance of the offence. As to
the observation of the Full Bench of the Lahore High Court in
Khizar Hayat case that investigation process may continue where
any material piece of evidence is shown to have been "missed out"
and remains to be collected, this too, it is submitted, should not be
a ground for allowing the process of investigation to continue after
the court has taken cognizance of the offence. The prosecution can
always apply to the court for permission to produce such evidence
under section 540 Cr.P.C.
Chapter 16
Relationship between the Police and the Courts:
From the above survey of the powers of the police to
prevent, detect, and investigate crimes and the role of vigilance that
the courts as guardians of the life and liberty of the citizens are
mandated to play, the position that emerges as to the relationship of
the police and the courts can be stated as follows.
The Magistrate is neither associated with the
investigation nor does he supervise it; yet, the Magistrates and the
Sessions Judges have important statutory functions to perform. The
concerned Magistrate is to be kept informed about the various
stages of investigation. As soon as the first information report is
registered, its copy is to be sent to him. The accused is to be
produced before him within 24 hours of his arrest, the object being
to enable the Magistrate to apply his neutral judicial mind to the
facts of the case at that early stage of the criminal process. With the
help of the police diary, the Magistrate will determine whether to
grant remand to custody, judicial or police, or whether there will be
remand to custody at all. Under Section 344 Cr.P.C. the accused
cannot be remanded to judicial custody for more than 15 days at a
time, and that too, if it appears to the Magistrate that sufficient
evidence has been obtained to raise a suspicion that the accused
may have committed the offence and that further evidence may be
350
obtained by a remand; in other words, as the explanation to section
344 Cr.P.C. says, there must be a reasonable cause for remand.
Thus, at every stage of investigation, the Constitution and the Code
of Criminal Procedure provide safeguards against delays and
violations of the constitutional and statutory rights to life and
liberty of individuals and this enhances the degree of importance of
the role of the courts, the courts of Magistrates in particular, and
their responsibility in the maintenance of the rule of law.
Interference with Investigation:
We have seen that though the District Public Prosecutor
can well be described as the chief law enforcement officer in the
district, yet his functions do not include interference with the police
investigation.
As regards powers of courts, the question assumes an
acute form when the jurisdiction of the courts other than that of the
criminal court whose function is to try the offence is invoked
immediately after the registration of a criminal case with a view to
preventing the investigation of the case by the police, e.g. of the
High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution or of the civil
courts, seeking a declaration that the alleged facts do not constitute
an offence. In Imperial Tobacco case (1980) I All ER 866), the
plaintiffs were tobacco manufacturers. They started a 'spot cash'
advertising scheme and inserted some 260 million 'spot cash' cards
into cigarette packets which were then sold at the same price as
before the scheme started. The Director Public Prosecutions
thought that the scheme was a lottery and was a statutory offence.
The plaintiffs brought an action claiming a declaration that the
scheme was lawful and was not an offence. The Court of Appeal
granted the declaration. The House of Lords reversed holding that
the decision of the Court of Appeal amounted to usurpation by the
civil courts of the functions of the criminal courts; in any case, "the
administration of justice would become chaotic if, after the start of
a prosecution, declarations of innocence could be obtained from the
civil courts".
351

The law has developed on the same lines in Pakistan. In
Brigadier Imtiaz Ahmad case (1994 SCMR 2142), the petitioner
I was a retired Brigadier and had then worked, on contract, as
Director, Intelligence Bureau. An enquiry was held and fearing that
he would be involved in criminal cases, he brought a petition under
Article 199 seeking various declarations. The petition was
dismissed and it was held that the High Court could not assume the
role of investigator "for the authority to register and investigate a
criminal case in law vests in the police and not in court",
It is well settled that the High Court has no power of
supervision or control either under the Constitution or the Letters
Patent or the Code of Criminal Procedure to interfere in any
manner with the conduct of an investigation already taken in hand
by competent agencies under the law. (Shahnaz Begum case - PLD
1971 SC 677)
The classical words of caution to the courts in the matter
of interference with the police investigation are to be found in the
Privy Council case of Khawaja Nazir Ahmad (AIR 1945 PC 18);
the Privy Council treated such interference with the duties of the
police as a serious matter and observed:
"Just as it is essential that every one
accused of a crime should have free
access to justice so that he may be duly
acquitted if found not guilty of the
offence with which he is charged, so it is
of the utmost importance that the
judiciary should not interfere with the
police in matters which are within their
province and into which the law imposes
upon them the duty of enquiry.......
There is a statutory right on the part of
the police 10. investigate the
circumstances of an alleged cognizable
crime without requiring any authority
352
be,
from the judicial authorities and it would
an unfortunate result if it
should be held possible to interfere with
those statutory rights by an exercise of
the inherent jurisdiction of the court. The
functions of the judiciary and the police
are complementary not overlapping and
the combination of individual liberty
with a due observance of law and order
is only to be obtained by leaving each to
exercise its own function always of
course subject to the right of the court to
intervene in an appropriate case when
moved under section 491 Criminal
Procedure Code to give direction in the
nature of habeas corpus. In such a case
as the present, however, the court's
function begins when a charge is
preferred before it and not until then.
No doubt, if no cognizable
offence is disclosed and still more if no
offence of any kind is disclosed, the
police would have no authority to
undertake an investigation..........
The law laid down in Khawaja Nazir Ahmad case was
applied in Shahnaz Begum (PLD 1971 SC 677)) and again in
Malik Shaukat Ali Dogar v Ghulam Qadir (PLD 1994 SC 281).
In Shahnaz Begum case, the High Court suo motu
assumed jurisdiction (i) to examine if the conduct of the
investigation had been fair and impartial; (ii), whether the ends of
justice required that further investigation of the case should be
entrusted to another officer or court: and (iii) to examine whether
any officer who had taken part in the conduct of investigation, at
any stage, had been guilty of any act of commission or omission.
These questions, it was held, lay outwith the jurisdiction of the
High Court, either under the Constitution, the Letters Patent or the
353
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 195
Code of Criminal Procedure and the High Court had no power of
superintendence, to enable it to interfere in or control the conduct
of investigation by a competent investigation agency.
In Malik Shaukat Ali Dogar case two petitions under
Article 199 of the Constitution were filed in the High Court
seeking registration of criminal cases against Malik Shaukat Ali,
On these petitions, a Judge of the High Court directed not only the
registration of a criminal case, but also directed that its
investigation be conducted by a particular officer and weekly
reports be submitted to the High Court. The Supreme Court held
that this kind of "continued control over the investigation exercised
by the court as in this case was prejudicial to the accused and
detrimental to the faimess of the procedure apart from being
without jurisdiction".
Chapter 17
The role of Public Prosecutor:
We have already discussed the role of the Public
Prosecutor as one of the participants in the criminal justice process.
The importance of the place that he occupies and the role that he is
required by law to play is that he is concemed with the process
both at the administrative and judicial phases. At the administrative
stage, he may have, during investigation, sometimes to act as legal
advisor to the police and then he has the very responsible duty to
ensure not only that no innocent man or woman is prosecuted but
also that no man or woman is prosecuted on insufficient evidence.
At the judicial phase, he is to act as prosecutor, as the
representative of not an ordinary party but of the society and in that
capacity his duty is to uphold a very high standard of faimess and
impartiality.
PART V
ENQUIRIES
The reason why we deal with 'inquiries' here is that
depending upon its nature, an inquiry may belong to the judicial or
the administrative phase.
The expression "enquiry" is defined in section 4(1)(k)
Cr.P.C. to include every enquiry other than trial conducted by a
Magistrate or court.
The definition is not exhaustive; but it does indicate that
there is a distinction between inquiry and trial.
An inquiry may be made by a Magistrate or any other
person; it may be in respect of a matter which is an offence or in
respect of a matter which is not an offence. Examples of inquiries
into a matter which is an offence are provided by sections 159 and
202 Cr.P.C. Examples of inquiries into matters which are not
offences are provided by the proceedings for security for keeping
the peace under section 107 and security for good behaviour under
sections 108, 109 and 111 Cr.P.C. The mode of inquiry into these
matters is provided in section 117 Cr.P.C. and the power of the
Magistrate to order the giving of security is provided in section
118. Proceedings under these sections involve detention in police
custody and provisions of Article 10 of the Constitution and
section 61 etc., of the Code of Criminal Procedure are equally
applicable to them. Other examples are inquiry under section 133
Cr.P.C. for removing a public nuisance and obstruction, inquiry
relating to disputes concerning land under section 145 and inquiry
into suicide etc., under sections 174 and 176. Of them, enquiries
under section 145 Cr.P.C. and sections 174, 176 Cr.P.C. need
special consideration.
354

Inquiries under Section 145
When a Magistrate of the First Class is satisfied from a
police report or other information that a dispute likely to cause a
breach of the peace exists concerning any land or water he may
proceed under Chapter XII, Sections 145 to 148. He shall summon
the parties to the dispute and require them to file written statements
of their respective claims as respects the fact of actual possession
of the subject matter of dispute. If the Magistrate finds that none of
the parties was in possession or he is unable to decide as to which
of them was in actual possession of the subject of dispute, he may
under section 146 attach it until the competent court has
determined the rights of the parties. The object of these
proceedings is to maintain status quo to enable the parties to obtain
a final decision from the civil court. The elements for the
foundation of jurisdiction under this section of which the
Magistrate must be satisfied are (a) that a dispute likely to cause
breach of the peace exists; (b) that the dispute relates to land or
water or boundaries thereof and (c) that such land or water is
situated within the limits of his territorial jurisdiction.
The proceedings under section 145 Cr.P.C. are
subordinate to a decree or order of a civil court in respect of the
property in dispute; the primary concern of the proceedings under
this section being to prevent breach of the peace arising out of a
dispute concerning land or water, these proceedings are not
concerned with the adjudication of the parties' rights in the
property, which is a matter exclusively in the realm of civil courts.
Thus the orders passed by a Magistrate for attachment of the
subject matter of dispute are of a transitory nature. Section 145,
therefore, proceeds on the premises that the Magistrate will cease
to deal with the possession of land or water in dispute as soon as a
civil court is seized of the matter and has passed a decree declaring
the rights of parties or has passed an order regulating the
possession of the subject matter (Shah Muhammad v Haq Nawaz -
PLD 1970 SC 470). Where the possession of the property has been
regulated by civil court even through a temporary injunction, the
matter falls outside the jurisdiction of the Magistrate under Section
145 (Mehr Muhammad Sarwar v State-PLJ 1985 SC 540).
356
Inquiries under Sections 174, 174A, 176
Under section 174 when a police officer receives
information that a person (a) has committed suicide; (b) has been
killed by another person or by accident etc.; or (c) has died under
circumstances raising a reasonable suspicion that some other
person has committed an offence, he shall give intimation of the
fact to the nearest Magistrate and proceed to the spot, make an
investigation and draw up a report as to the cause of death. He shall
then have the dead body medically examined. The police officer is
then to forward his report to the Magistrate concerned for inquest.
All Magistrates of the First Class are empowered to hold inquest
under this section. Under section 176, when a person dies while in
the custody of the Police, a Magistrate of the First Class may hold
an inquiry into the cause of the death and for that purpose he shall
have the powers which he would have in holding an inquiry into an
offence. He shall record the evidence and may make an
examination of the dead body of any person who has been already
interred in order to discover the cause of his death. The Magistrate
may cause the body to be disinterred and examined. By the recently
enacted section 174A Cr.P.C. special provision has been made for
cases in which a person is grievously injured through fire, kerosene
oil, acid etc. The medical officer to whom such a person is
reported, or the SHO to whom such a case is reported, shall give
intimation of the incident to the nearest Magistrate.
The Medical officer shall immediately record the
statement of the injured person; and if the injured is in a position to
make a statement, the Magistrate shall also record his statement.
The object is to ascertain the circumstances and cause of the burn
injuries and to preserve the evidence in the form of the injured
person's statement, which may in some cases serve as dying
declaration. This, it appears, became necessary because of
numerous cases reported in papers of women suffering burn
injuries at the hands of their husbands or their relatives, so that
persons guilty of such crimes are brought to justice,

PART VI
THE JUDICIAL PHASE
Chapter 1
Does the filing of challan raise a presumption of guilt?
The answer is an emphatic 'no'.
The investigation process is a screening process,
whereby the police and the prosecutor, as experts in their fields,
reach an early determination of the probable innocence or guilt of
the persons accused reflected in the police report under section 173
Cr. P. C. Those who are probably innocent are screened out and
those who are probably guilty are sent up for trial.
"Probably guilty" does not mean "presumed to be
guilty". "Presumed to be guilty" is not, and has never been, a rule
of law. The presumption of guilt would mean that the
determination of the police is final, which it is not. If it were final,
there would be no need for trial. It would also mean that the only
object of a trial is to give the accused an opportunity to prove that
he is innocent.
The rule of law is the presumption of innocence which is
the polestar of the criminal process and occupies an important
place in the due process of law. To take an example, a murderer
shoots his victim in the plain view of a large number of people.
When the police arrive, he hands them his gun and says: "I did it
and I am glad". The people who saw the shooting testify to his
guilt. He is arrested. Here it will be absurd to maintain that he is
innocent of the offence. The presumption of innocence here means
that until there has been an adjudication of guilt by a competent
court, "the suspect is to be treated......... as if his guilt is an open
question". It also means that the general burden to prove his guilt is
on the prosecution. (There is an interesting and illuminating
358
discussion on "Due Process Model" and "Crime Control Model" in
the "The Limits of the Criminal Sanction" by Herbert L. Packer
reprinted in "Constitutional Interpretation" by Craig R. Ducar and
Harold W. Chase, 5th ed at p. 673 and we acknowledge our debt of
gratitude to that book).
So, despite the fact that according to police investigation
by however high in that hierarchy, a man is guilty, he will be, for
the purposes of trial, presumed to be innocent, and the general
burden to prove his guilt will remain on the prosecution. For, it
must be remembered, the opinion of the investigating police officer
as to the guilt or innocence of an accused person is inadmissible in..
evidence. (Muhammad Iqbal v Muhammad Akram - 1996 SCMR
908, 918; Muhammad Bashir v SHO-PLD 2007 SC 539, 548).
To quote Lord Denning from Jones (1957) 2 QB 55).
"There is one thing to which everyone in
this country is entitled and that is a fair
trial at which he can put his case
properly before the judge. No
cause is lost until the judge has found it
so; and he cannot find it without a fair
trial".
So, nobody is guilty until the judge has found him so; and the
judge cannot so find without a fair trial.
Chapter 2
TRIAL
The general pro cedure for the trial of offences is
contained in Part VI, titled "Proceedings in Prosecutions", of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. It is important to mention that
this procedure applies to cases governed by the Code of Criminal
Procedure; as is provided by section 1, subsection (2) of the Code,
".....nothing herein contained shall affect any special or local law
now in force, or any special jurisdiction or power conferred, or any
359
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 198
special form of procedure by any other law for the time being in
force". Section 5 of the Code makes the position clearer. That
section, by its subsection (1), provides that "...All offences under
the Pakistan Penal Code shall be investigated, inquired into, tried,
and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions hereinafter
contained". But as regards offences under other laws, subsection
(2) provides:
Trial, its meaning:
"All offences under any other law shall
be investigated, inquired into, tried and
otherwise dealt with according to the
same provisions (that is, according to the
provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure), but subject to any enactment
for the time being in force regulating the
manner or place of investigating.
inquiring into, trying or otherwise
dealing with such offences."
The Code of Criminal Procedure uses the expressions
"try" (e.g. in sections 198(5) and 260) and trial (e.g. in sections
228, 241 and chapter XXII-A), but does not define them. The
definition of "inquiry" in section 4(1), clause (k), of the Code
shows that there is a distinction between an inquiry and trial. In the
Code of Criminal Procedure of 1872, the word 'trial' was defined
as "the proceedings taken in court after a charge has been drawn up
and includes the punishment of the offender". The omission of the
definition in the present Code perhaps manifests an intention that
the expression has no fixed meaning.
Older dictionaries define 'try' as 'to examine' or 'to
examine as a judge', (S. Johnson, "A Dictionary of the English
Language" 1785). In more modern usage the term has various
meanings. For example. 'try' can mean 'to examine or investigate
judicially, to conduct the trial of, or to put to the test by
experiment, investigation or trial". In T. Sheridan's "Dictionary of
the English Language", "try" means "to examine as a Judge; to
bring before a Judicial Tribunal". These definitions were referred
to in Nixon (113 S.Ct.732) (1993), where the provision under
consideration was Art.I, S.3, Clause 6, of the US Constitution.
which provides: "The Senate shall have the sole power to try all
impeachments". It was argued by the petitioner that the word "try"
in that provision "imposes by implication an additional requirement
on the Senate in that the proceedings must be in the nature of a
judicial trial". It was held that "the framers did not intend to
impose additional limitations on the form of the Senate.
proceedings by the use of the word 'try'...
So, the words "try" and "trial" are not terms of art, and
their meaning depends upon the context in which they are used. For
example in Piare Dusadh v Emperor (AIR 1944 FC 1), the section
under consideration was section 4 of the Special Criminal Courts
(Repealed) Ordinance 1943 which purported to deal with cases of
which the trials before special courts had not 'concluded'. The trial
could be said to have concluded when the court pronounced its
judgment or it could be said to have concluded as soon as the case
became ripe for judgment. It was held that the meaning of the
trial largely depends on the context and the scheme of the
enactment in which it occurs. Though the word may sometimes
mean only the recording of evidence it was obvious that in the
context of the Ordinance it comprised all stages including the
imposition of the sentence.
The context and the scheme of the Code of Criminal
Procedure also lead to the conclusion that "trial" under the Code
comprises all stages including the imposition of the sentence. Part
VI of the Code which is titled "Proceedings in Prosecutions"
consists of chapters XV to XXX; they include provisions
prescribing conditions for initiation of criminal proceedings,
provisions for the commencement of proceedings, for summary
trials, for regular trials, and not only provisions for the mode of
taking evidence but also provisions relating to judgments and
imposition of sentences.

Object of trial
The memorable words of Crompton J. in O'Connel
(1844) Ir. LR 312) provide perhaps the best statement on the point.
He said:
seks on
"This Court in which we sit is a temple
of justice. The object of all
equally should be the attainment of
justice; now justice is only to be reached
through the ascertainment of the truth
and the instrument which our law
brepresents to us for the ascertainment of
the truth or falsehood of a criminal
charge is by trial... the trial is the
about the truth".
process by which we endeavour to find
The object of the trial therefore must be the attainment of justice
through the ascertainment of truth; in the words of Prime Minister
of England, Benjaman Disraeli, "Justice is truth in action".
The trial has traditionally been viewed as the capstone
(coping, coping stone) of the criminal justice, the 'crown jewel',
that reflects most of the basic elements of the criminal process. It is
not surprising, therefore, that many of the Human and Fundamental
Rights guaranteed by the Written Constitutions and international
charters and treaties relating to the criminal justice process refer
specifically to trial."
A trial thus is a necessary precondition for holding a
person guilty of an offence and for the imposition of a formal
criminal sanction or punishment and is therefore the center-piece of
the criminal process; it is the means and machinery provided by
law for bringing the alleged offender to justice.
What is fairness in a criminal trial
The two-fold aim of criminal justice is that guilt shall
not escape or innocence suffer, (Berger-295 US 78) and the
ultimate object of any procedure is, or ought to be, to ensure a fair
trial according to law. For an accused, fair trial means that he
should have-
E)
ii)
iii)
vi)
full information as to the offence he is
charged with;
the opportunity to be confronted with the
witnesses, which includes the right to be
present at the trial and the right to cross-
examine those who depose against him;
the opportunity to explain the circumstances
disclosed in the evidence against him; and
the opportunity to produce his evidence in
defence, which includes the right to have his
witnesses summoned through the court.
But fairness of a trial is not all one-sided; it requires that those who
are undoubtedly guilty should be convicted as well as those about
whose guilt there is any reasonable doubt should be acquitted.
(Sang-(1979) 2 All ER 1222, 1230).
Chapter 3
Parties to a Criminal Case
'Party' is a technical word having a precise meaning in
legal parlance; it refers to those by or against whom a legal suit is
brought, whether in law or in equity, the party plaintiff or
defendant, whether composed of one or more individuals and
whether natural or legal persons. All others who may be affected
by the suit, indirectly or consequently, are persons interested but
not parties. A party to an action is a person whose name is
designated on record as plaintiff or defendant. The term in general
362

Page 200
means one having right to control proceedings, to make defence, to
adduce and cross-examine witnesses and to appeal from judgment.
(See Black's Law Dictionary based on some American cases).
While civil law is private law, criminal law is an aspect
of public law in which the State, as the representative of the
society, acts positively to enforce the criminal law. Thus, criminal
cases are brought by the State. A crime is, as an American author
puts it, in theory, a public wrong, a wrong against some victim, to
be sure, but also something that hurts the society which is why the
society, that is the State, takes over the job of punishing. In Fazal
Elahi case (PLD 1953 FC 35), the High Court thought that besides
the Crown (the State) and the accused, there was a third party
namely the society. The Federal Court in disagreeing with that
view, referred to the statement of the law in Halsbury's Laws of
England, namely that "A crime is an unlawful act or default which
is an offence against the public.....
....while a crime is
often also an injury to a private person, it is as an act or default
contrary to the order, peace and well-being of society that a crime
is punishable by the state. Legal punishment is punishment
awarded in a process which is instituted at the suit of the Crown,
standing forward as prosecutor on behalf of the subject on public
grounds".
The Federal Court added:
"When therefore the Crown stands
forward as the prosecutor and asks for
punishment of a criminal before a
court through a prosecutor, the
action is taken on behalf of the State, as
constituted by the people thereof, and it
is in the same sense that the Crown
claims authority to punish a
crime..
The conclusion thus was that a criminal proceeding for the trial of
an accused is a proceeding between the State, representing the
364
society, and the person accused. Some indication of this legal
position is provided by the provisions of Chapter XXII of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, which proceed on the basis that in cases
initiated upon police reports, that is, challan cases, the parties are
the State represented by the Public Prosecutor and the accused and
in complaint cases the parties are the complainant and the accused.
Thus, section 265F provides, by its sub-section (2), that the court
shall ascertain from the Public Prosecutor, or as the case may be,
from the complainant, the names of the witnesses.
In the Anglo-American system of criminal justice
therefore one of the parties is the State, which prosecutes in the
name of the political community, conventionally designated in
England as e.g. Regina v Arthur, in the US, e.g. the People v
Arthur and in Pakistan e.g. State v Zahid.
This has been the legal position in Pakistan, particularly
in cases initiated on police report. Section 265A of the Code of
Criminal Procedure says: "In every trial before a Court of Session
initiated upon a police report (under section 173 Cr.P.C. or other
such provision), the prosecution shall be conducted by the Public
Prosecutor". Similarly, by the recently enacted Provincial Laws,
such as the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service (Constitution,
Functions and Powers) Act 2006, section 9(1), "The Prosecutors
shall be responsible for the conduct of prosecution on behalf of the
Government". The term 'Government' here is not a happy choice
for it is the State, not the Government, that is a party in a criminal
case.
Thus, there are two parties to a criminal case and; this clearly
envisages adversarial litigation.
Under the Islamic Criminal Justice System
Has the introduction of the Islamic concept of the law of
crimes, and criminal procedure, as regards cases involving offences
against human body such as Qatl and hurt, made any difference? In
Gul Hassan case (PLD 1989 SC 633), certain provisions of the
365
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 201
Pakistan Penal Code, c.g. Sections 299 to 338, and certain
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, e.g. Sections 345,
381, were declared to be repugnant to the Injunctions of Islam
Justice Muhammad Taqi Usmani, a Member of the Shariat
Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court, carried out a comparative
survey of the Anglo-American or Anglo-Saxon Jurisprudence and
the Injunctions of Islam as contained in the Holy Quran and the
Sunnah of the Holy Prophet and pointed out that one fundamental
difference between the two systems is that whereas under the
Anglo-American system an offence is an act against the State only
and the victim or his heirs have nothing to do with it, under the
Quran and the Sunnah and the Islamic Jurisprudence, the offences
of murder and hurt have two elements; first, they are considered as
acts violating the rights of the victim or his heirs, and secondly,
they are acts against the State. In Islam, the first element
predominates. In the words of Shafi-ur-Rehman, J. in the same case
"Under
Islam....
the
Injunctions of
the individual victim
or his heirs retain from the beginning to
the end entire control over the matter
including the crime and the criminal,
They may not report it. They may not
prosecute the offender. They may
abandon prosecution of their free will.
They may pardon the criminal at any
stage before the execution of the
sentence. They may accept monetary or
other compensation to purge the crime
and the criminal. They may compromise.
They may accept Qisas from the
criminal. The State cannot impede, but
must, to its best, assist them in achieving
their object and in appropriately
exercising their rights".
366
Accordingly, necessary changes were made both in the Pakistan
Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure; in the latter.
sections 345 and 333 etc. have been amended so that even murder
is now a compoundable offence and the State cannot now grant
pardon without the consent of the victim or his heirs.
Even before the influence of the Islamic Jurisprudence
and its introduction as part of the criminal procedure, the victim or
his heirs were not rank outsiders. This is sufficiently illustrated by
sections 250 and 544A Cr.P.C. which provide a kind of civil law
remedy in criminal proceedings.
Under section 250 Cr. P. C. when a Magistrate acquits
an accused after trial, and is "of opinion that the
accusation.... ...was false and either frivolous or vexatious,
the Magistrate may by his order of acquittal" call upon the person
upon whose complaint or information the accusation was made to
show cause why he should not pay compensation to the acquitted
accused; and if the Magistrate is so satisfied, he may order such
person to pay compensation to the accused, to the extent of the
amount mentioned in the section.
Section 544A provides that the Court, convicting an
accused of an offence in the commission whereof the death of, or
hurt, injury or mental anguish or psychological damage to any
person is caused, or damage to or loss or destruction of any
property is caused, shall, that is, must, unless for reasons to be
recorded in writing it otherwise directs, order the convict to pay to
the victim or as the case may be the heirs of the victim "such
compensation as the court may determine having regard to the
circumstances of the case". The compensation so ordered to be
paid, if not paid, shall render the convict liable to simple
imprisonment mentioned in the section.
The compensation payable both under section 250 and
section 544A is recoverable as arrears of land revenue, and does
not exempt the person directed to pay compensation from other
civil or criminal liability, but if there is a subsequent civil action in
367
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 202
tort, the civil court shall, in awarding damages, take into account
the amount of compensation pad under section 250 ur section
544A Cr.P.C.
So, the complainant, the victim and his heirs as well as
the acquitted and convicted accused have all to be watchful of their
interests to ensure that they are duly compensated for the loss or
injury suffered by them. This will also serve, in many cases, to
save the parties from another round of litigation in civil courts,
It is plain that if sections 250 and 544A are to fulfill the
object underlying their enactment, the victim, his heirs, the
accused, have all to play an important role. None of them can
therefore afford to be silent spectators at the trial; they have to
vigilantly guard their interest.
It appears, therefore, that in order to be a party to a
criminal case, one has to be designated as a party on record. Thus,
in a criminal case initiated on police report, the parties are the State
on one side and the accused on the other. In a complaint case, the
parties are the complainant on one side and the accused on the
other. An heir or heirs of the deceased person in a murder case and
the person injured in a hurt case may not be necessarily the
complainant. The heirs of the deceased person and the person
injured have, in the new scheme of things, been assigned many an
important role and the matters in which their participation is
required by law must be done in the prescribed way or not at all,
yet, the victims or their heirs are technically not parties to the
proceedings. In cases in which the State is a party, the State has, by
assuming the role of the prosecutor, taken upon itself a double role,
that of the representative of the society and also that of the
representative of the victim or his heirs. The latter role of the
representative of the victim has the great advantage of relieving the
victim and his heirs of the very heavy financial and other burdens
that the prosecution of a criminal case necessarily entails.
Two kinds of trials:
The Code of Criminal Procedure provides for -
(1)
summary trials; and
368
(2)
regular trials.
Chapter 4
Summary trials
Under the English law, crimes are. for procedural
purposes, classified as indictable and summary offences. This
classification broadly reflects a distinction between serious and
minor offences.
Chapter XXII. sections 260 to 265 Cr. P. C.. provide for
the trial of offences summarily by any Magistrate of the First Class
specially empowered in that behalf by the Provincial Government
and any bench of Magistrates invested with powers of a Magistrate
of the First Class specially empowered in this behalf by the
Provincial Govemment. Such a Magistrate or bench of Magistrates
has a discretion, if he or they think fit, to try in a summary way all
or any of the offences mentioned in section 260. Under section
261. the Provincial Government may on the recommendation of the
High Court confer on any bench of Magistrates invested with the
powers of Magistrate of the Second Class or Third Class, power to
try summarily all or any of the offences mentioned in that section.
The object of summary procedure contained in Chapter
XXII is speedy disposal of cases involving cases of comparatively
lesser gravity. Summary trial should be restricted to simple cases; it
should not be resorted to in complicated and serious cases.
Even where a Magistrate exercises the initial discretion
to try a case summarily, he may find, as the case progresses, that
the case is one which should not be so tried. He can then have
resort to the regular procedure provided by Chapter XX.
The procedure applicable to summary cases is the same
as is provided in Chapter XX for regular trials subject to the
following exceptions:-
369

(4)
Pre-trial Steps
No sentence of imprisonment exceeding three
months can be passed in a summary case
(section 262(2));
In cases where no appeal lies, evidence of the
witnesses need not be recorded, a formal
charge may not be framed and it will be
sufficient if the summary court enters the
particulars mentioned in section 263 in such
form as the Provincial Government may
prescribe:
But in appealable cases, the court shall record
the substance of the evidence and also
particulars mentioned in section 263 and shall
before passing any sentence record
judgment in the case.
Chapter 5
Regular trial
a
Before a regular trial can commence, the following pre-
trial steps are necessary to be taken: -
determination of the place of trial;
cognizance of offence by court;
issue of processes to procure the attendance of
the persons accused;
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
other matters, such as
supplying copies;
accused's counsel;
fixing dates of hearing;
trial of complaint and police cases
arising out of the same offence.
Place of trial
Chapter XV(A) Cr.P.C., sections 177 to 189, provide for
the place of trial. The general rule is that all crimes are local and a
court's jurisdiction to try a person for an offence depends upon the
crime having been committed within its territorial jurisdiction.
Sections 178 to 187 provide for the determination of the place of
trial. Section 188 permits an offence committed abroad to be tried
in Pakistan and deserves special notice. It provides that-
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
when a citizen of Pakistan commits an offence
at any place without and beyond the limits of
Pakistan: or
when a servant of the State whether a citizen
of Pakistan or not commits an offence in a
tribal area; or
when any person commits an offence on any
ship or aircraft registered in Pakistan
wherever it maybe,
he may be dealt with in respect of such offence as if the offence
had been committed at any place within Pakistan at which he may
be found.
The phrase "dealt with" appears to include all the stages,
administrative and judicial, and appears to mean that the offences
by the abive mentioned persons may be investigated, inquired into
and tried at the place where the accused is found. But "no charge as
to any such offence shall be enquired within Pakistan" unless the
Political Agent if any of the place where the offence was allegedly
committed certifies that the offence ought to be enquired into in
Pakistan and if there is no Political Agent, the Federal Government
grants sanction for such enquiry.
This is an exception to the general rule that all crimes
are local. To the same effect is section 4 PPC. Thus, to enable an
offender who had committed an offence outside Pakistan to be tried
in Pakistan, the law creates a fiction namely that the crime, though
not committed in Pakistan, is fictionally deemed to have been
committed at the place in Pakistan where he is found.

Section 531 Cr.P.C. saves a finding, sentence or order
from being set aside merely on the ground that the trial took place
at the wrong place, unless the error in fact occasioned a failure of
justice.
Cognizance of offences by courts:
Chapter XV(B) Cr.P.C. is titled "Conditions requisite for
initiation of proceedings". This chapter consists of sections 190 to
1998. Besides providing for the cases in which the courts may take
cognizance of offences, it provides also for the cases in which
cognizance cannot be taken without fulfillment of certain
conditions.
Section 190 provides for cognizance of offences by
Magistrates; by its sub-section (1) all Magistrates of the First Class
or any other Magistrate especially empowered by the Provincial
Government on the recommendation of the High Court may take
cognizance of any offence-
(a)
(b)
(c)
upon receiving a complaint of facts which
constitute such offence;
upon a report in writing of such facts made by
any police officer:
upon information received from any person
other than a police officer, or upon his own
knowledge or suspicion that such offence has
been committed which he may try or send to
the Court of Session for trial.
Sub-section (2) of section 190 requires a Magistrate
taking cognizance under sub-section (1) of an offence triable
exclusively by a Court of Session to send the case to the Court of
Session for trial, without recording any evidence. Section 193
provides that a Court of Session shall not take cognizance of an
offence unless the case has been sent to it under section 190(2) Cr.
P.C.
Upon receiving a complaint
This relates to private prosecutions as distinguished from
State prosecutions e.g. those mentioned in clause (b) of section
190, sub-section (1), Cr. P.C.
In Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers (1977) 3 All
ER 70). Lord Wilberforce recognized the right to bring a private
prosecution as a valuable constitutional safeguard against inertia or
partiality on the part of authority and Lord Diplock desenbed that
right as "a useful constitutional safeguard against capricious.
corrupt or biased failure or refusal of those authorities to prosecute
offenders against the criminal law"
We have seen that under Article 9 of the Constitution,
access to justice is a constitutionally protected right and the right to
initiate private criminal proceedings against criminal offenders is
directly relatable to that right.
There may be a case in which a State functionary has
extended an assurance to an accused person that he will not be
prosecuted. In such a case, a private prosecution may be barred.
Jones v Whalley (2006) 4 All ER 113) is an illustration of such a
case.
The provision in section 190 empowering a Magistrate
to take cognizance of an offence upon receiving a complaint of
facts which constitute such offence is to be read with Chapter XVI
which consists of sections 200 to 203. The expression "complaint"
is defined in section 4(1), clause (h), to mean "the allegations made
orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to his taking action
under this Code that some person, whether known or unknown, has
committed an offence, but it does not include the report of a police
officer". Section 200 requires that a Magistrate taking cognizance
of an offence on complaint shall at once examine the complainant
upon cath and the substance of the examination shall be reduced to
writing and shall be signed by the complainant and also by the
373
372
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 205
Magistrate. The proviso to the section provides for cases in which
it is not necessary for the examination of the complainant. Section
201 says that if the complaint has been made in writing to a
Magistrate who is not competent to take cognizance of the case, he
shall return the complaint for presentation to the proper court with
an endorsement to that effect. Section 202 authorizes any court on
receipt of a complaint to postpone the issue of process for
compelling the attendance of the accused person and to enquire
into the case itself or direct an inquiry or investigation to be made
by any Justice of the Peace or by a police officer. A Court of
Session may direct the investigation to be made by a Magistrate
subordinate to it for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or
falsehood of the complaint. Section 203 empowers the court before
whom the complaint is made, or to whom it has been transferred or
sent, to dismiss the complaint if after considering the material
before it, there is in its judgment no sufficient ground for
proceeding. The court shall briefly record its reasons for so doing.
For complaints in Hadood cases, the recently enacted
sections 203A, 203B and 203C provide a special procedure. No
court shall take cognizance of an offence under section 5 of the
Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hadood) Ordinance, 1979, or in
case of Qazf under section 6 of the Offence of Qazaf (Enforcement
of Hadood) Ordinance, 1979, or of an offence under section 496B
of the Pakistan Penal Code, except on a complaint lodged in a court
of competent jurisdiction. A common feature of all these new
provisions is that the court taking cognizance of the offences
mentioned therein shall at once examine the complainant and the
witnesses produced or required to be produced, reduce the
substance of their examination to writing and have them signed by
the complainant and the witnesses. In cases of Zina and Qazf, the
witnesses must undergo the test of tazkiyah-al-shahood that they
are truthful persons and abstain from major sins, the meaning of
tazkiyah-al-shahood being the mode of enquiry adopted by the
court to satisfy itself as to the credibility of a witness. (See e.g. the
explanation to subsection (2) of Section 203A Cr. P. C. For the
concept of tazkiyah-al-shahood generally please see Sanaullah v
State - PLD 1991 FSC 186). If in the opinion of the court there is
374
sufficient ground for proceeding, the court shall issue summons for
the personal attendance of the accused to face trial; but the court
may for reasons to be recorded dismiss the complaint if, after
considering the statements on oath of the complainant and the
witnesses, there is, in its judgment, no sufficient ground for
proceeding, that is, for summoning the accused.
The combined effect of the provisions of subsections (4)
and (5) of sections 203A, 203B and 203C seems to be to altogether
exclude the police and police investigation in these cases. The
opinion of the court as to the sufficiency of ground for proceeding
further and the judgment of the court that there is no sufficient
ground for proceeding must be based on the statements on cath of
the complainant and the witnesses. For the purpose of proceeding
or not proceeding further, sections 203A, 203B and 203C seem to
be self-contained and it may well be that by necessary implication.
the application of section 202 stands excluded.
Upon a police report
The report contemplated by sub-section (1), clause (b).
of section 190 is the police report (the Challan) under section 173
Cr. P. C.
Upon personal information of the Magistrate
When the Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence
under clause (c) of sub-section (1) of section 190, that is upon
information received from any person other than a police officer or
upon his knowledge or suspicion that such offence has been
committed, the accused person has under section 191 a right to be
informed that he is entitled to have the case tried by another court,
and if the accused objects to his being tried by such Magistrate, the
case shall instead of being tried by such Magistrate, be sent to the
Sessions Judge for transfer to another Magistrate.

Cognizance of offence by Court of Session
Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Code of
Criminal Procedure or by any other law for the time being in force.
no Court of Session can take cognizance of any offence as court of
original jurisdiction unless the case has been sent to it under
section 190, sub-section (3). For example, section 198A Cr. P. C.
provides that a Court of Session "may take cognizance of such
offence, without the accused being committed to it for trial, upon a
complaint in writing made by the Public Prosecutor. The
expression "such offence" has reference to "any offence falling.
under Chapter XVI of the Pakistan Penal Code".
The word 'committed' does not fit in the new scheme of
things, for there are now no commitment proceedings. It must be
read as 'sent'.
Cognizance of offences by High Court
The High Court may take cognizance of an offence in
the manner provided by the Code of Criminal Procedure.
One way of taking cognizance of an offence by the High
Court is to withdraw a case for trial from a subordinate criminal
court to itself under section 526 Cr. P. C. When the High Court so
withdraws a case, it shall observe in such trial the same procedure-
as the subordinate court would have observed if the case had not
been so withdrawn.
Position as to cognizance of offences summed up
Having noticed the relevant provisions of the Code on
"cognizance of offences", the position, as it emerges from decided
cases, may be stated as follows:
The word 'cognizance' is a term of art
implying application of judicial mind to the
facts of a case in order to determine whether
the facts disclosed constitute an offence (Raja
Khushbakhat-ur-Rehman v State 1985
376
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
SCMR 1314). The expression "take
cognizance of any offence" has to be
understood accordingly.
The occasion for such determination does not
arise in a case under clause (b) of section 190
unless the police submit the report under
Section 173 (Muhammad Nawaz v Noor
Muhammad PLD 1967 Lah. 176, 179). As
was held in Mehr Khan v Yaqub Khan (1981
SCMR 267), in cases under section 190
clauses (a) and (b), the Magistrate cannot take
cognizance unless there is a complete or
incomplete challan, or a complaint is before
the Magistrate.
The court takes cognizance of the case as a
whole not qua only some of the accused found
by the police to be implicated in the case.
Cognizance can be taken even if the offenders
be unknown. On taking cognizance of the
offence, the court acquires jurisdiction over
all the persons involved and not only over
persons against whom the challan is submitted
(Khushbakhat-ur-Rehman case (1985 SCMR
1314).
Under section 190, a Magistrate may take
cognizance of an offence-
a)
for the purpose of trying it himself;
or
b)
for the purpose of sending it to the
Court of Session.
As was held in Mehr Khan v Yaqub Khan
(1981 SCMR 267, 272), the position in view
of abolition of the commitment proceedings
and the consequent changes in section 190,
377
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 207
subsection (3), now subsection (2), and other
provisions is as follows:-
a)
before he can 'send' a case for trial
to the Court of Session, a
Magistrate must, first, have taken
cognizance of a case, under any of
the three clauses of subsection (1)
of section 190 Cr.P.C. In other
words, he must either have received
a private complaint under clause
(a), or a police report under section
173 Cr.P.C. as envisaged in clause
(b), or he should be acting on any
information received by him, as
mentioned in clause (c). It is,
therefore, evident that he cannot act
under subsection (2) without
having received
private
complaint, or a police report (ie. a
challan either complete or
incomplete) or some information
from any other source;
b) although, now a Magistrate is not
required to hold an 'enquiry' under the
repealed Chapter XVIII (that is,
commitment proceedings) but that does
not mean that he is to act merely as a
post office and automatically 'send' the
case for trial to a Court of Session
simply because a section relating to an
offence exclusively triable by a Count
of Session has been mentioned by the
police or the complainant...... He is, in
fact, required on having taken
cognizance of such a matter to enquire
into the case and to apply his mind to
378
iv)
v)
c)
whatever material is placed before him
by the police or the complainant in
order to determine whether the
allegations made in the police report.
private complaint or information
received by him, make out a prima
facie case triable by a Court of Session:
and
in the changed circumstances, this
application of his judicial mind by
the Magistrate for the purpose of
determining whether the allegations
disclose an offence triable
exclusively by the Court of Session
would now constitute an "enquiry"
within the meaning of the word as
defined in clause (k) of section 4(1)
and section 344(1) Cr.P.C.
Once the Magistrate has taken cognizance of
the offence exclusively triable by a Court of
Session, he has to send the case to that court
and it is not open for him to send the case
only qua those of the accused who are placed
in column 3 of the challan.
Similarly, the Court of Session takes
cognizance of the offence and not of the case
qua a particular accused. The Court of Session
is, therefore, competent to summon a person
whose name occurs in column 2 of the challan
(Khushbakhat-ur-Rehman case 1985 SCMR
1314). The Court of Session can summon
even an accused in respect of whom an order
of Magistrate discharging him under section
173 Cr.P.C. had been obtained (Waqar-ul-Haq
v State PLD 1988 Lah 336).

Cases in which prior sanction is required
Ordinarily anyone may prefer a complaint but sections
195 to 199 are exceptions to this general rule (Jagdesh v Joy
Narayan PLD 1963 Dacca 357). Owing to the character of certain
offences as affecting the lawful authority of public servants or
public justice, the right to prosecute has been restricted and the
courts are prohibited from taking cognizance of the offences
mentioned therein unless and until the public servants or the courts
directly concerned or their superiors make the complaint.
Of these sections, section 197 needs to be particularly
noticed. It saved a Judge, a Magistrate or any public servant who
was accused of any offence alleged to have been committed by him
while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official
duties from being prosecuted except with the previous sanction of
the authorities mentioned therein.
This section has been declared to be repugnant to the
Injunctions of Islam and, therefore, void (Zafar Awan case - PLD
1992 SC 72), and in terms of Article 203D of the Constitution it
has long ceased to have effect. In the same case namely Federation
of Pakistan v Zafar Awan, section 6(5) of the Pakistan Criminal
Law (Amendment) Act 1958 was also declared to be repugnant to
the Injunctions of Islam. The consequence is that for the offences
mentioned in section 197 prior sanction of the authorities
mentioned therein for prosecuting the offender and for the courts to
take cognizance of those offences is no more necessary.
Processes to procure the attendance of accused persons
The first procedural question concerns the attendance of
the accused at trial. If in custody, the accused is brought to the
count from prison; if on bail, the accused is informed of the time
and date of trial and required to attend.
Chapter XVII Cr.P.C. is titled "Of the commencement of
proceedings before court". It has two sections namely sections 204
and 205. Section 204 provides that if in the opinion of the court
taking cognizance of an offence there is sufficient ground for
proceeding and the case appears to be one in which according to
the 4 column of the Second Schedule to the Code a summons
should issue in the first instance, it shall issue summons for the
attendance of the accused and if the case appears to be one in
which according to that column a warrant should issue in the first
instance, it may issue a warrant, or if it thinks fit, a summons for
causing the accused to be brought or to appear at a certain time
before such court. This section in so far as it relates to cases in
which according to the 4h column of the Second Schedule of the
Code a summons should issue in the first instance, is to be read
with section 90 which empowers the court. for reasons to be
recorded in writing, to issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused
person-
a)
when the court sees reason to believe that the
accused has absconded or will not obey the
summons; or
b)
if the summons had been served and the
accused person failed to appear without
offering any reasonable excuse.
Process to procure attendance generally
As to the processes to procure the attendance of persons.
accused as well as witnesses, the relevant provisions are to be
found in Chapter VI Cr.P.C. titled "Of processes to compel
appearance". That chapter consists of, so far as service of summons
is concerned, of sections 68 to 73, and so far as service of warrants
of arrest is concerned, of sections 75 to 86A.
A duly signed and sealed summons is to be served.
section 69 so provides, on a natural person by delivering or
tendering to him personally a duplicate of the summons, and on a
380
381
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 209
body corporate through its secretary etc, or by registered post
When the person summoned cannot by the exercise of due
diligence be found, resort may be had to substituted service, hy, as
is provided in sections 70 and 71, leaving a copy of the summons
with an adult member of his family and obtaining his signature on
the back of the duplicate: if service in these modes is not possible.
the serving officer shall affix a copy of the summons at some
conspicuous part of the ordinary place of residence of the person to
be served. Service of summons on a person in the service of the
State or a statutory body or company will be effected, as provided
in section 72 Cr.P.C., by sending the summons in duplicate to the
head of the office, who shall cause it to be served on the person
concerned in the manner provided in section 69.
When the person to be served resides outside the court's
territorial jurisdiction, a summons in duplicate shall under section
73 Cr.P.C. go to a Magistrate in whose jurisdiction the person to be
served resides for service upon that person.
A warrant of arrest shall always be in writing, and shall
be duly signed and sealed within the meaning of section 75 Cr.P.C.
It may direct that if the person to be arrested executes a bond with
sufficient sureties for his attendance before the issuing court, he
shall be released on furnishing such security. The serving officer
shall send the security bond to the court. A warrant shall ordinarily
be directed to a police officer, but if its immediate execution is
necessary and no police officer is available, it may be directed to
any other person, even a private person. The warrant shall be an
authority for such officer or person to arrest the named person. A
Magistrate of the First Class may direct a warrant for the arrest of a
non-bailable offence to a landholder or a manager of land within
his territorial jurisdiction.
A warrant of arrest is also an authority, section 82 so
provides, for its execution anywhere in Pakistan. When it is to be
executed beyond the local limits of the issuing court, the executing
police officer shall have it endorsed by a Magistrate or the officer
in charge of a police station within whose limits it is to be
382
executed. This will be sufficient authority to the executing police
officer to execute it within those limits. But if the obtaining of such
endorsement is reasonably believed to prevent the execution of the
warrant, the executing officer may not obtain it.
Under section 83 Cr.P.C. when a warrant is to be
executed outside the issuing court's jurisdiction. "such court may
instead of directing such warrant to a police officer. forward the
same by post or otherwise to any Magistrate or District
Superintendent of Police within the local limits of whose
jurisdiction it is to be executed". Such Magistrate or District
Superintendent of Police "shall endorse his name thereon and if
practicable cause it to be executed in manner hereinbefore provided
within the local limited of his jurisdiction".
Under section 80 Cr.P.C.. the person executing a warrant
must notify its substance to the person to be arrested, and if so
required must show the warrant to him.
When the warrant is executed outside the limits of
issuing court's jurisdiction, then, section 85 Cr.P.C. requires that
"the person arrested shall, unless the court which issued the
warrant is within twenty miles of the place of arrest or is nearer
than the Magistrate or District Superintendent of Police within the
local limits of whose jurisdiction the arrest was made or unless
security is taken under section 76, be taken to such Magistrate or
District Superintendent of Police".
Section 86 provides for the manner in which persons
arrested under sections 83 and 85, that is persons arrested outside
the issuring court's territorial jurisdiction, are to be dealt with. The
Magistrate or the District Superintendent of Police shall if the
person arrested appears to be the person intended by the issuing
court direct his removal in custody to such court. Provided that if
the offence is a bailable offence or the issuing court has under
section 76 endorsed a direction that he be released on furnishing
security or bail, such Magistrate or Superintendent of Police "shall
383
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 210
take such bail or security
which issued the warrant".
, and forward the hond to the court
But if the case is not one falling under the above proviso
to section 86, that is, if the offence is a non-bailable offence or
there is no direction under section 76, the Sessions Judge of the
place of arrest may, subject to the provisions of section 497 Cr.P.C
and for sufficient reasons, "release the person on interim bail on
such bond or security as the Sessions Judge thinks fit and direct the
person to appear by a specified date before the court which issued
the warrant and forward the bond to that court".
Section 86A Cr.P.C. provides for the manner in which a
person arrested under section 85 Cr.P.C. is to be removed in
custody to a place in the Tribal Areas. Such a person shall be
produced before a Magistrate of the place of arrest and "such
Magistrate in directing the removal shall hear the case in the same
manner and have the same jurisdiction and powers, as nearly as
may be, including the power to order the production of evidence, as
if the person arrested were charged with an offence committed
within the jurisdiction of such Magistrate; and such Magistrate
shall direct the removal of the arrested person in custody if he is
satisfied that the evidence produced before him raises a strong or
probable presumption that the person arrested committed the
offence mentioned in the warrant".
Protection against unlawful arrest:
The above-noted provisions contain some protections
against unlawful arrest. Yet, they fall short of the safeguards
provided by the Constitution, Articles 9 and 10, which have been
dealt with in the Constitutional Criminal Procedure part of this
book. For example, the person arrested must be produced before a
Magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest; this applies equally to
arrests in pursuance of court warrants. As was held in the leading
case on the subject, Manzoor Elahi v Federation of Pakistan (PLD
1975 SC 66), an arrest which is in violation of Article 10 is
unlawful, e.g. if the person arrested is not produced before a
384
Magistrate within 24 hours. Thus production of the arrestec before
a Superintendent of Police will not satisfy the requirements of
Article 10. To this extent, the above-noted provisions are violative
of Article 10 of the Constitution and are void.
Persons arrested in a settled area e.g. Lahore or Karachi
for removal to a tribal area are a category apart and have, in
addition to the benefits of the provisions of section 86 Cr.P.C., e.g.
bail by the Sessions Court of the place of arrest, also the protection
of section 86A, which requires the Magistrate before whom he is
produced to hold an enquiry to examine that the warrant of arrest
issued by an authority in tribal area is not a mere pretext to deprive
him of the protections of the Constitution and ordinary laws of the
land, but there is a genuine strong prima facie case against him to
allow him to be removed to the tribal area. The intention of the
law, in according this special treatment to arrestees to be removed
to tribal areas, is clear. It is to make it doubly sure that such
persons are treated fairly in accordance with the Constitution and
law before they are handed over to the tribal authorities.
Exemption from personal attendance
Section 205 authorizes a Magistrate, when he issues
summons to an accused person, if he sees reason so to do, to
dispense with the personal attendance of the accused and permit
him to appear by his Pleader.
This power to exempt personal appearance applies when
a summons is issued "in the first instance". It does not apply where
a warrant is issued in the first instance. As regards presence of the
accused during the course of trial, that is to say, after the stage of
charge, the relevant provisions are to be found in sections 428, 509.
510, 512 and 540A Cr.P.C., which will be dealt with later.
Other matters
(a)
Supplying copies
After the court has procured the attendance of an
385
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 211
accused person, the first step in the trial of cases, before the
Magistrate as well as before the High Court and the Court of
Session, is the supply of certain statements and documents to the
accused. When the trial is by Magistrate, the statements and
documents required to be supplied to the accused persons are those
mentioned in section 241A and when the trial is before the High
Court and Court of Session, the statements and documents to be
supplied to the accused persons are those mentioned in Section
265C.
It is note-worthy that there are two classes of case triable
before Magistrates, namely, those triable summarily under Chapter
XXII and those triable under Chapter XX. The relevance of this
distinction is that the statements and documents mentioned in
section 241A are to be supplied to the accused persons only in
cases which are tried under Chapter XX, that is, in regular trials.
The statements and documents to be supplied under
sections 241A and 265C are to be supplied free of cost "not less
than seven days before the commencement of the trial",
Included in the copies to be supplied to the accused
person under sections 241A and 265C Cr.P.C. are the statements of
witnesses recorded during investigation under sections 161 and 164
Cr.P.C. A statement recorded by a police officer under section 161.
if reduced into writing, is not to be signed by the person making it:
such a statement cannot be used at any inquiry or trial except for
the purpose of contradicting that person in the witness box in the
manner provided by Article 140 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order
1984. A statement of a witness recorded by a Magistrate under
section 164 Cr.P.C. may be recorded in the presence of the accused
and the accused may be given an opportunity of cross-examining
the witness making the statement. Such a statement has to be
recorded in the manner provided in section 364 and is, like a
statement recorded under section 161, a previous statement within
the meaning of Article 140 of the 1984 Order.
Effect of non-supplying copies
Suppose that a statement recorded under section 161 or
164 Cr.P.C. is not supplied to the accused. This will be a
contravention of the provisions of sections 241A and 265C Cr.P.C.
The question is, what is the effect of this contravention? It was held
by the Privy Council in Pulukuri Kotayya v King (74 IA 65) that
the right given to an accused person by section 162 is a very
valuable one and often provides important material for cross-
examination of the prosecution witnesses. "However slender the
material for cross-examination may seem to be, it is difficult to
gauge its possible effect. Minor inconsistencies in his several
statements may not embarrass a truthful witness but may cause an
untruthful witness to prevaricate, and may lead to an ultimate
breakdown of the whole of his evidence......... Their Lordships
would, however, observe that where...........the statements were
never made available to the accused an inference, which is almost
irresistible, arises of prejudice to the accused".
In Faiz Ahmad v State (PLD 1960 SC 8), the
investigating officer had incorporated the substance of the
statement made by the approver in the police diary. At the trial,
when the defence asked for a copy of the statement, it was said that
that was not a statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. and a copy was
not supplied. The appellant was convicted on the basis of the
approver's testimony at the trial supported by some circumstantial
evidence. On appeal to the High Court, when non-supply of the
copy of the approver's statement during investigation was urged as
a ground, a copy of the statement was offered but was refused. The
High Court found that there were two contradictions between the
approver's statement during investigation and the one at the trial
but found an explanation for both. The Supreme Court discussed
the possible courses open to the High Court in such circumstances;
it could order a retrial, or if the irregularity had occasioned a failure
of justice, could recall the approver, supply a copy of his statement
to the defence and direct him to cross-examine the approver or it
could exclude the evidence of the approver from consideration.

Section 162 Cr.P.C. stands partly repealed
In Z. A Bhutto case (PLD 1979 SC 53) the question was
as to the effect of the failure of the prosecution to supply to the
accused copies of the statements of two approvers and a witness
recorded by the police during investigation. In order to properly
appreciate the legal position, so observed Anwar-ul-Haq, C.J. (Para
261 of the Judgment), it was necessary to consider the relevant
portions of the provisions of sections 161, 162, 172, 265C and 537
Cr.P.C. and section 145 of the Evidence Act, 1872 (Now Article
140 of Qanun-e-Shahadat). After tracing the legislative history of
some of these provisions, sections 162 and 537 in particular, and
observing that "section 265C (and 241A) Cr.P.C. have brought
significant changes in the law consequent upon the abolition of
commitment proceedings in the trial of serious offences", the
learned Chief Justice noticed that under section 265C Cr.P.C. "in
all cases instituted upon a police report, copies of statements under
section 161 Cr.P.C. shall be supplied free of cost to the accused,
not later than seven days before the commencement of the trial".
This provision, it was held,
"impliedly repeals the provisions of section 162 Cr.P.C.
to the extent that the copies of the statements must now
be supplied by the State seven days before the
commencement of the trial"
and it is not necessary to wait, as the first proviso to subsection (1)
of section 162 Cr.P.C. provides, till the witness is called by the
prosecution or the accused asks for them.
When the statements are in police diaries
In Z A Bhutto case, the statements of the above-named
witnesses were embodied in the case diaries kept under section 172
Cr.P.C., and this raised the question whether they could be treated
as statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. for the purposes of section
265C Cr.P.C. It was held (Para 278 of the Judgment):
388
"Where a statement has been made to
the police by a person during
investigation, the police officer should
record it separately in terms of section
161(3) Cr.P.C. Where, however, he does
not do so, but proceeds to incorporate it
in the case diary, the said statement
should be construed as a statement under
section 161 Cr.P.C. provided of course it
is in substance and essence a statement
of the witness. Thus it is the
nature of the statement and not the label
given to it which will determine its real
character. The provisions of section
265C are salutary and enacted for the
benefit of the accused, conferring as they
do a valuable right in his favour of being
apprised of the case set up against him.
This right cannot be taken away or
evaded by allowing the investigating
officer to misuse his authority by
incorporating in the case diary the
statements recorded by him during
investigation which, though in spirit and
essence fall within the purview of
section 161 Cr.P.C. but are erroneously
or mischievously embodied by him in
the case diaries. This safeguard has
become all the more necessary as
commitment proceedings have been
abolished........ Hence, it is necessary to
construe the provisions of section 265C
(and of section 241) liberally and in the
spirit in which they have been
enacted.......
389
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 213
Accordingly, the statements in question, though incorporated in
police diaries kept under section 172 Cr.P.C., were treated in
essence and substance statements falling under section 161(3)
Cr.P.C; it was held that those statements ought to have been
supplied to the accused persons under section 265C Cr.P.C.
To sum up-
(i)
(ii)
section 265C impliedly repealed section 162,
subsection (1), first proviso, to this extent that
the copies of the statements under section 161
Cr.P.C. must now be supplied to the accused
seven days before the trial; the said proviso in
so far as it provided that such a statement be
supplied to the accused when the witness,
whose statement it was, appeared in the
witness box, is no more part of the law; and
the statement, though incorporated in a police
diary maintained under section 172 Cr.P.C.,
may be treated as one under section 161
Cr.P.C. if in essence it was a statement under
section 161 Cr.P.C.
b)
supplied to the accused should be supplied to
him and the said statement considered in
juxtaposition with any other previous
statement of the witness which had been
supplied, along with the statement made by
him in court including his cross-examination,
to ascertain whether any prejudice has in fact
been caused to the accused. If after such
comparison it appears that no prejudice has
been caused the irregularity in not supplying
the copies of the statement in question to the
accused as required under the law would stand
cured under section 537 Cr.P.C. and no
further action shall be called for.
If on making the comparison, referred to
above, it transpires that the non-supply of the
copies has resulted in prejudice, then any of
the following courses may be followed
depending on the facts of each case-
the statement of the witness at the
trial can be excluded;
(i)
(ii)
the witness recalled and allowed to
be cross-examined on the basis of
the statement supplied; or
How to resolve the Controversy
As to the consequences of the failure to supply these
copies, it was held in ZA Bhutto case that "the situation that has
arisen in this case is in many ways similar to that which arose in
Faiz Ahmad's case and therefore the precedent case can usefully be
followed. As however some observations occurring therein are
susceptible to different interpretations", the learned Chief Justice
laid down the following procedure to be followed in such cases
(Para 284 of the Judgment) at the appeal stage:
(a)
Copy of the statement under section 161
Cr.P.C. of the witness which had not been
(iii)
a retrial ordered.
An inspection note recorded by an investigating officer
on his first visit to the place of occurrence and the note recorded by
him on recoveries made are not substantive evidence; they can be
used only to contradict or discredit the witnesses when they appear
into the witness box (Taj Muhammad v Muhammad Yousaf - PLD
1976 SC 234, 239). The question as to the effect of the failure or
omission to supply their copies to the accused will also, it seems,
fall to be dealt with in accordance with the above-stated principles.

Accused's Counsel
the
This important preliminary step before
commencement of the trial is to ensure that the accused's right to
consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice
guaranteed by Article 10 of the Constitution which has been
discussed earlier in the Constitutional Criminal Procedure part of
this book is not denied. This right to be defended by counsel
proceeds on the view that "all but the most gifted and exceptional
defendants are ill-equipped to defend themselves in a criminal
prosecution. A maze of procedures and technicalities which govern
the criminal justice process has long been recognized as demanding
the skills of a trained lawyer to preserve some parity between the
State and the individual so that the defendant can be given a
meaningful chance to tell his side of the story. Giving the
defendant 'his day in court' is of the essence of due process of law"
(Please see "Constitutional Interpretation" by Craig R. Ducat and
Harold W. Chase, 5 ed. p. 629).
Most of the documents supplied to the accused under
sections 241A and 265C Cr.P.C. are technical documents and to
understand them and to make proper use of them there is need for
the assistance of a technical man namely lawyer. Therefore, this is
the most appropriate point of trial at which the court's duty to
ensure, that this fundamental right is not denied, arises.
Besides Article 10 of the Constitution, section 340,
sub-section (1), Cr.P.C. provides for a right to a person accused of
an offence before a criminal court or against whom proceedings are
initiated under the Code to be defended by a pleader.
The accused person must be given a reasonable
opportunity to engage counsel and the counsel engaged must be
given a reasonable opportunity to defend him. It has been held that
where this right is denied, the trial is vitiated and a law which
denies this right is void (Moslimuddin Sikdar v Chief Secretary-
392
PLD 1957 Dacca 101; Mrs. Rowshan Bijaya Shaukat v
Government PLD 1965 Dacca 241).
Counsel for Indigent persons at government expense
Though the Constitution gives to the accused person the
right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner yet it does
not impose on the State any obligation to provide counsel for the
defence of indigent persons accused of capital offences. But to be
fair to the accused, that is, to place him on an equal footing with
the prosecution, Chapter 24C of High Court Rules and Orders,
Volume IX, provides that accused persons tried for capital offences
should have the assistance of a lawyer. It reads:
Presiding Officer to report whether accused
can afford to engage counsel. If the accused is
unrepresented in a sessions case and cannot afford to
engage a counsel, the Sessions Judge shall make
arrangement to employ a counsel at Government
expense. Counsel in such cases should be appointed well
in time to enable him to study the documents mentioned
in section 265C of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
2.
Counsel for accused to be provided by Sessions
Judge. When the accused is a woman prisoner who is
unable to afford a counsel the presiding officer on an
application made by her shall make arrangements to
employ a counsel at Government expense to defend her
in all offences except those triable in a summary way
under chapter XXII of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
3.
Fees of Counsel. The legal practitioner thus
engaged by the Court trying the case shall receive the
same fees as private practitioners engaged under the note
to rule X (2) of the rules regulating the conduct of
business in the Law Department, and the fees shall be
entered in the same register and drawn in the same
manner as is prescribed for such practitioners".

Similarly Chapter 25-E of Volume III of the High Court
Rules and Orders, which is headed, "APPEALS FROM ORDERS
OF ACQUITTAL", provides:
"3.
Legal assistance to the accused. - With the
same object in view, namely, to give every reasonable
protection to the defence, a reasonable fee to enable him
to engage counsel, if such is the intention, shall be paid
by the Government to the accused in all such cases.
whatever may be the result of the appeal and whether he
is or is not in attendance when the appeal is heard. He
would be at liberty to supplement this himself in order to
obtain counsel of superior calibre, should he so desire.
The payments of the fee herein referred to shall be
arranged and paid by the District Magistrate in
consultation with the Solicitor to Goverment, Punjab,
in the form of a letter of credit which the accused
person's counsel can cash after actual appearance in the
High Court.
4.
Legal assistance in cases of enhancement of
sentence. In the case of an application for
enhancement of sentence made by the Provincial
Government the same procedure should be followed in
the matter of provision of counsel for the accused as is
prescribed in paragraph 3 above".
(c)
hearing
Consultation for, and Fixing dates of
For the expeditious disposal of sessions cases
instructions are to be found in the High Court Rules and Orders,
Vol. 3 chapter 24-B. Sessions Judges should reserve for each
sessions case several days for trial, preferably in consultation with
the prosecutor and the defence counsel. The trial of a sessions case
shall, as a rule, be held from day to day and unless there be
compelling reasons for adjournment, there should be no
adjournment.
Day to day hearing is the rule
The rule that the trial of sessions cases must proceed
from day to day and there should be no adjournment used to be
strictly observed. The result was that the trial invariably concluded
within the days reserved for it; prosecution evidence was recorded.
defence evidence was recorded, arguments were heard and as soon
as the arguments were concluded, the Sessions Judge was able to
pronounce judgment. The advantages of this course are too
apparent to need emphasis. The evidence of the witnesses was
fresh in the mind of the Judge and so was the demeanour of the
witnesses and those are advantages which an appellate court does
not have. Hence the rule that the appellate court would not
ordinarily interfere with the trial court's opinion as to the
credibility of a witness. To strictly comply with this rule the
practice of the Sessions Judges used to be not to take up the trial of
another sessions case till the conclusion of the trial of the case
already in hand. Unfortunately, this rule of day to day hearing is
now observed more in its breach. In the High Court Rules, referred
to above, notice has been taken of this "flagrant disregard of the
day to day hearing rule"; in some cases sessions trials have, after
their commencement, taken months and in some cases years to
conclude. Taking a very serious view of this practice, the High
Court has required:
i)
ii)
explanation to be furnished in monthly
sessions statements of any cases pending over
six months; and
explanation for every case in which trial has
commenced but has not concluded during the
days reserved for them; this explanation shall
mention the date of the commencement of the
trial and reason for each adjournment.
What has been said above about the sessions cases
should apply equally to the trial of cases before the Magistrates.

Procedure for the trial of complaint and
police cases arising out of the same offence
It has been seen that under section 190, a Magistrate
may take cognizance of an offence (a) upon receiving a complaint;
(b) upon a police report under section 173 Cr.P.C. and (c) upon
information received by the Magistrate. As regards the cases
exclusively triable by the Court of Session, the Magistrate is.
whether it is a complaint case or a police case, to send the case for
trial to the Court of Session without recording any evidence.
Now, in respect of an offence, there may be a police case
only or there may be a complaint case only. But there may be cases
in which out of an offence arise two cases, one being a police case
and the other being a complaint case. For example, the firs
informant in a police case names three persons A, B & C as culprits
of a murder in the FIR. The police after investigation finds that the
offence was committed by A and B only and that C was innocent
of the offence. Dissatisfied with the police investigation, the first
informant or any other heir of the victim may file a complaint
against A. B and C. In this way, there will be two cases before the
court arising out of the same incident.
This is the stage when the court is confronted with the
question how to proceed with the trial of such cases as to cause no
prejudice to either party. The leading authority on this point is Nur
Elahi v State (PLD 1966 SC 708); it was held:
"After considering all aspects of the
matter, we hold that a fair procedure
would be for the learned trial Judge to
take up the complaint case first for trial.
During that case the learned trial Judge
may call the witnesses mentioned in the
police challan, if they were not already
examined, on behalf of the complainant
as court witnesses under section 540 of
the Criminal Procedure Code, so that
396
a
they can be cross-examined by both the
parties. This will enable the court to
have the whole relevant evidence
included in one trial and a decision could
be arrived at after a proper consideration
of the entire material relied on by the
parties. The accused persons would in
addition obviously have the right to
adduce defence evidence if they so
choose. If that trial results in
conviction, it will be for the Public
Prosecutor to consider whether or not he
should withdraw from the prosecution,
with the permission of the court, under
section 494 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, in police challan case. It
would be easy for him to take such a
decision after the whole evidence has
been thrashed out in the first trial. If the
first case ends in an acquittal, he might
still have to consider whether the police
case has not been so seriously damaged
by what has been brought out in the first
trial, as to justify withdrawal of the
prosecution. Otherwise the second trial
would be allowed to proceed to its
normal conclusion and the parties would
have the advantage of utilizing the
material placed on the record of the
earlier trial, by way of cross-examination
of the relevant witnesses as permitted by
law.
This procedure is being suggested to
avoid a difficulty that might otherwise
confront the complainant. If the police
challan is taken up first for trial, the
complainant would be under a handicap
397

in so far as he would not be in a position
to cross-examine the witnesses for the
prosecution.
Another difficulty may arise in respect
of conducting the case on behalf of the
complainant in the first trial. Normally,
of course, under the law, the Public
Prosecutor is to be in charge of the case,
even if the trial is based on a private
complaint. The Public Prosecutor,
however, in the special circumstances of
the case, could permit the complainant's
counsel to conduct the proceedings on
his behalf under
his directions.
Alternatively and that may meet the
situation more adequately, Government
in the interest of justice, could notify the
complainant's counsel, as a special
Public Prosecutor, for the conduct of that
case alone. This would ensure full
justice to the complainant and he would
not be left with any sense of grievance".
In that case, Kaikaus J. wrote a dissent; in his view the
two proceedings should be consolidated and there should be a
single hearing so that the whole of the evidence is produced before
the court and then a decision recorded.
The rule in Nur Ellahi does not however lay down an
invariable rule that the complaint case is always to be tried first,
Where the version and the accused are practically the same in both
the complaint and the challan cases, a separate trial may not be
necessary. As was held in Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto v State (PLD 1979
SC 53) there is no necessity for a separate trial of the two cases
when technically speaking there are neither two sets of accused nor
different versions nor any additional evidence is being examined
by the complainant. It was only to avoid prejudice to the
398
complainant that a particular procedure was devised in Nur Ellahi
case but to say that invariably it should be followed even if the
facts are distinguishable is not correct. This view was followed in...
Raja Khushbakht-ur-Rehman v State (1985 SCMR 1314).
The ratio in Nur Ellahi case was considered in
Muhammad Bohra v State (PLD 1989 Lahore 18), where it was
observed: "If I may venture to say, the procedure which
commended itself to Kaikaus J. has this advantage that both the
sets of accused persons will be before the Court, and both will have
the opportunity to cross-examine all the witnesses that are
proposed to be produced in the complaint case and the police
challan case",
In Muhammad Bohra v State, for the murder of one
Barkat Ali, three persons were named as culprits in the F.I.R. They
were Muhammad Bohra. Muhammad Hussain and Muhammad
Ashiq. The last named was killed before trial. As a result of
investigation, the police however found that the above-named three
persons were innocent of the offence and the persons responsible
for killing Barkat were Mansha and Mushi Muhammad.
Accordingly in the final report under section 173 Cr.P.C. the names
of Mansha and Khushi Muhammad were placed in column 3 and
those of Muhammad Bohra and Muhammad Hussain in column 2
of the challan. The first informant filed a private complaint against
Muhammad Bohra, Muhammad Hussain and Muhammad Ashiq. It
was in these facts observed in Muhammad Bohra v State: "Taking
this case as an example, suppose that in the trial of the complaint
case the P.Ws. in the challan case had been called and examined as
court witnesses, and the trial had resulted in the acquittal of the
appellants. It is obvious that in recording the acquittal, the Court
would have considered all the evidence, including the evidence of
the court witnesses, who the sccused persons in the challan case.
Mansha and Khushi Muhammad, had had no opportunity to cross-
examine. As the second trial, that is the trial of the challan case,
I would be by the same Judge. Mansha and Khushi Muhammad
would, not unnaturally, go to their trial with a feeling that probably
399

their fate has, by the verdict in the complaint case, been already
sealed".
Chapter 6
COMMENCEMENT OF TRIAL
Screening during Judicial Phase
We have already dealt with the screening process during
the administrative phase, that is, by the Public Prosecutor to
safeguard against unwarranted prosecutions.
In America, screening may either be by the "Grand
Jury" to decide whether to indict or it may be by the Magistrate
who must determine at a preliminary hearing whether the
prosecution has a prima facie case there is sufficient evidence
supporting the charge - "the standard test for testing the sufficiency
of the evidence is one of the probable cause, considerably less than
the burden the prosecution must bear in establishing guilt at trial".
The Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution provides
that "no person shall be held to answer for a capital or
otherwise infamous case unless on presentment or indictment of a
Grant Jury". "Infamous offence" has been held to include all felony
offences. Thus, the Fifth Amendment interposes the Grand Jury
between the prosecutor and the prospective defendant. The classic
description of the Grant Jury's function is to be found in Wood v
Georgia (370 US 375 (1962):
"Historically, this body (the Grand Jury) has been
regarded as a primary security to the innocent
against hasty, malicious and oppressive
prosecution; it serves the invaluable function in our
society of standing between the accuser and the
accused, ......to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill
will".
A Grand Jury's proceedings may be secret and even in the absence
of the accused.
Though, no such body as a grant jury is recognized in
the laws of Pakistan, yet, it appears that there are provisions in the
Code of Criminal Procedure which are designed to ensure
screening before a man is put to the agony of trial.
Thus, section 190 Cr.P.C., which empowers the
Magistrates of the First Class or any other Magistrate especially
empowered to take cognizance of offences, provides that the
Magistrate 'may take cognizance of an offence upon a complaint.
upon a police report or upon his own information. "May" gives
discretion: the Magistrate may or may not take cognizance. The
discretion here given is "judicial discretion", and requires that the
Magistrate will determine, before taking cognizance, that it will be
lawful to do so. The term 'cognizance' has been held to be a term
of art implying application of judicial mind to the facts of the case
in order to determine whether the facts disclosed do or do not
constitute an offence (Raja Khushbakhat-ur-Rehman -1998
SCMR 1314). Even in cases in which the Magistrate is required to
send the case to the Court of Session for trial, he is not to act as a
mere post office; he is to apply his judicial mind to the facts to
ascertain as to whether the case is really one which is triable
exclusively by the Court of Session or whether it is one which he
can proceed to try himself. Thus, section 204 Cr.P.C. provides that
"if in the opinion of a court taking cognizance of an offence, there
is sufficient ground for proceeding", he may summon the accused.
Existence of "sufficient ground for proceeding" is therefore a
condition precedent for summoning the accused to stand trial. The
Magistrate is thus required to play the neutral role of a judicial
officer to see, at this early stage, that at least a prima facie case - a
case supported by sufficient evidence supporting the charge-exits
to justify the summoning of the accused to undergo the ordeal of
trial.

Page 219
So concerned is the law with protecting the innocent
from the ordeal of trial that in serious cases triable by the Court of
Session or the High Court, section 265-D requires the count, before
framing a formal charge against the accused, to peruse the police
report or the complaint and all other documents and statements
filed by the prosecution and to form an opinion that "there is
ground for proceeding with the trial of the accused".
Open Court
Let her (the truth) and falsehood grapple; who ever saw
the truth put to the worse, in a free and open encounter. (John
Milton in Areopagitica).
said:
In Scott v Scott (1913) AC 417, 463), Lord Atkinson
"The hearing of a case in public may be,
and often is...... painful, humiliating or
deterrent both to parties and witnesses,
and in many cases, those of a criminal
nature, the details may be so indecent as
to tend to injure public morals, but all is
tolerated and endured, because it is felt
that in public trial is to be found, on the
whole, the best security for the pure.
impartial and efficient administration of
justice, the best means of winning for it
public confidence and respect".
The right to a public hearing has been neatly
encapsulated in the Amnesty International Fair Trials Manual,
Chapter 14, as being "an essential safeguard of the fairness and
independence of the judicial process, and means of protecting
public confidence in the justice system". This statement is founded,
among others, upon Article 10 of the Universal Declaration, Article
6(1) of the European Convention and Article XXVI of the
American Declaration. However, open trial means an orderly trial
and not a disorderly one. (Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto case - PLD 1979 SC
53 at p 143); and public trial concept has never been viewed as
imposing a rigid, inflexible straight jacket on the courts and it is
generally conceded that the right to have the general public present
at a trial is subject to some limitations. The trial Judge has
discretion to close to the public, even without the consent of
accused where there is good cause for such action (Z A Bhutto
case, PLD 1979 SC 53 at p 178).
In Ali Nawaz Gardezi (PLD 1963 SC 51, 83) a
complaint case in which the accused, a highly placed bureaucrat,
posted as Commissioner of a Division at the relevant time was tried
for the offence of adultery, the learned trial Judge found no special
features as would have justified departure from the normal rule
enacted by section 352 Cr.P.C. that the hearing of a case should be
in open court. In the opinion of the Supreme Court, "the
circumstances that a higher officer of Government, who also held
military rank, was cited as an accused person, by a private
complainant, and this at a time when the country lay under the
martial law, were compelling considerations that favoured an open
trial so that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly
be seen to be done".
By Section 352, the place in which any criminal court is
held for the purpose of inquiring into or trying any offence is an
open court, to which the public generally may have access, so far
as the same can conveniently contain them. The proviso to this
section empowers the Judge or Magistrate, if he thinks fit, to order
at any stage of inquiry or trial that the public generally or any
particular person shall not have access to, or be or remain in, the
room or building used by the court.
The first part embodies the essential and salutary
principle of administration of justice that justice must not only be
done but should also appear to be done. This necessarily carries
with it the right to an open trial in the full gaze of the public.
including the press. This in tum leads to a healthy, fair and
403
402
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 220
objective administration of justice calculated to promote public
confidence in the court and is conducive to dispel all misgivings
about it (Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto v State - PLD 1979 SC 53; cited in
Khan Isfandyar Wali v Federation of Pakistan - PLD 201 SC 607,
924). The proviso to section 352 shows that the rule is not rigid and
inflexible and it should not be pressed to a breaking point so as to
defeat the very ends of justice. Therefore, the Judge or the
Magistrate has power to forbid access of the public generally or of
any particular person for sufficient reasons in the interest of
administration of justice. In this behalf paragraph 3 of Chapter 1 of
the High Courts Rules and Orders Vol. 3 is also relevant.
This section, however, does not give any right to be tried
at a particular place, and so long as the right to a fair trial is
ensured, the accused may be tried even in jail if that is necessary
for safe administration of justice (State v Islamuddin - 1984
Pakistan Crl. L.J. 273).
Speedy trial and adjournments
This is also the stage for a very important reminder that
the policy of the criminal law is to bring the accused to justice as
speedily as possible, so that if found guilty he is punished ad if
innocent he is acquitted or discharged. This is recognized by the
Constitution, Article 37(d), as one of the Principles of Policy: The
State shall....ensure inexpensive and expeditious justice. The
State can ensure it through its judicial organ, namely, the Judiciary:
as Article 29 of the Constitution enjoins, "it is the responsibility of
the State and of each person performing functions on behalf of an
organ or authority of the State, to act in accordance with those
Principles. As was said in Muhammad Hussain v State
(PLD 1959 (WP) Lah 322, 329) the intention of the law is that a
criminal case must be expeditiously disposed of without
unnecessary delay. Day to day hearing is the rule and adjournment
to a date beyond the day reserved for the trial is an exception. This.
as has been already pointed out, is the object of prior consultation
with the public prosecutor and the defence counsel for fixing dates
of hearing.
This is the point of trial therefore when one must have a
closer look at the provisions of section 344 Cr.P.C. This section
reads:
"344. Power to postpone or adjourn proceedings.... (1)
If, from the absence of a witness, or any other
reasonable cause, it becomes necessary or advisable to
postpone the commencement of, or adjoum any inquiry
or trial, the court may, if it thinks fit, by order in writing,
stating the reasons therefore, from time to time,
postpone or adjourn the same on such terms as it thinks
fit for such time as it considers reasonable, and may by a
warrant remand the accused if in custody:
Remand. Provided that no Magistrate shall remand an
accused person to custody under this section for a term
exceeding fifteen days at a time".
Power to adjourn is judicial discretion
This section empowers the 'court', which term includes
the court of a Magistrate, to postpone the commencement of an
inquiry or trial or to adjourn an inquiry or trial. The power is
discretionary. It must however be remembered that the discretion is
a judicial discretion and that the guidance for the exercise of
discretion is provided by the section itself. There can be
adjournment if, and only if, "from the absence of a witness or other
reasonable cause it becomes necessary or advisable to
.......adjourn any inquiry or trial". That is not all. To prevent
adjournment of cases as a matter of routine, the section requires the
court to record an order in writing, stating the reasons for
adjournment. In a case in which the accused is in custody.
adjournment without reasonable cause is a very serious matter, so
serious indeed, that it may involve violation of the basic principle
of criminal jurisprudence namely expeditious trial and may give
rise to an action for damages against the State.
404
405

Page 221
The section provides that adjournment can be made for
absence of a witness or any other reasonable cause. Any cause
other than the absence of a witness may be a cause necessitating or
justifying an adjournment on reasonable grounds. What is a
reasonable ground is a question of fact in each case. The court must
apply its mind to its reasonableness and should not grant an
adjournment mechanically and without good cause. The recording
of reasons is as necessary a condition as the reasonableness of the
cause for which adjournment is granted (Muhammad Hussain v
State-PLD 1959 (WP) Lah 322, 329).
Adjournment for an indefinite period
The power under section 344 is to postpone or adjourn
"from time to time" and "for such time as it considers reasonable".
There was a controversy as to whether the expressions "from time
to time" and "for such time as it considers reasonable" give the
power to adjourn a case sine die, that is, for an indefinite period.
This controversy was set at rest in Shadi Khan v Muhammad
Saleem (PLD 1978 SC 38). It was held that these expressions
should not be given a rigid meaning "for in doing so it would lead
to an impossible situation necessitating the production of a number
of accused in court and thereby causing hindrance to the trial of the
cases. On this view of the matter, there is no occasion for
postponing the commencement of the trial now and again".
Therefore even if the period was not specified still the interregnum
must be regarded as reasonable and a sufficient compliance of the
words "for such time". The result is that cases such as Saif-ur-
Rehman v State (PLD 1978 Lah 314) and Sajjad Hussain v State
(PLD 1978 Lah 922) and the cases relied upon in those cases stand
over-ruled
Shadi Khan v Muhammad Saleem arose out of a
sessions case; that is to say, it concerned the power of the Sessions
Court to adjourn a case sine die. In this behalf, it is significant to
note that while subsection (1) of section 344 uses the general
expression "count", its proviso deals with the power of Magistrates.
Now when an accused is in custody, the question of adjourning a
406
case is closely linked with remanding the accused to jail. That is
why subsection (1), when it gives the power to adjourn, also gives
the power to remand the accused in custody. The combined effect
of subsection (1) of section 344 and its proviso seems to be that
while the Court of Session and a High Court may adjourn a case
for an indefinite period and may also remand an accused to custody.
for an indefinite period or sine die, the power of a Magistrate to
remand an accused to custody is subject to the condition that the
remand shall not exceed 15 days at a time.
Duty of court in case of abuse or delay
It remains to consider the difficult question - what is the
duty of the court in a situation where the prosecution persistently
fails without reasonable cause to produce its evidence and seeks
adjournments unjustifiably? The court may in such a case proceed
to judgment immediately. Justice delayed is justice denied. For the
defence of the accused must suffer by lapse of time and the
prosecution may also suffer likewise. A fair and speedy trial is the
essence and essential of judicial administration in a civilized
country. Protracted proceedings are a mockery of the law and must
be deemed to be an abuse of process of courts. (Muhammad
Hussain v State-PLD 1959 WP Lah 322, 330).
Delaying tactics may amount to abuse of process of court
On abuse of the process of court or process of law, cases
from the English jurisdiction provide an instructive study. The
reason why this power to prevent abuse of process of law or
process of court exists was stated by Lord Denning MR in
Goldsmith v Sperrings Ltd [(1977) 2 All ER 566, 574 cited in Sh.
Muhammad Shafiq v Abdul Hamid-1992 P Cr. LJ 229)]:
"In a civilized society, legal process is the machinery for
keeping order and doing justice. It can be used properly
or it can be abused. It is used properly when it is invoked
for the vindication of men's rights or the enforcement of
just claims. It is abused when it is diverted from its true
407
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 222
course so as to serve extortion or oppression; or to exert
pressure so as to achieve an improper end. When it is so
abused, it is a tort, a wrong known to the law. The
Judges can and will intervene to stop it. They will stay
the legal process, if they can, before any harm is done. If
they cannot stop it in time, and harm is done, they will
give damages against the wrongdoer".
Abuse elaborated
A characteristic case for the exercise of stopping the
proceedings or procceding to judgment immediately occurs where
substantial delay has been caused either by a deliberate act of the
prosecution, for example, some improper or malafide use of the
procedure of the court, or by inefficiency on the part of the
prosecution or even something having gone wrong with the system.
The power of Magistrates to decline to proceed with the case has
been recognized in such cases, though the power has been held to
be "very strictly confined". The power to stop a prosecution, it has
been held, arises only when it is an abuse of the process of the
court. It may be an abuse of process if either (a) prosecution have
manipulated or misused the process of the court so as to deprive the
defendant of the protection provided by the law or to take unfair
advantage of a technicality, or (b) on the balance of probability, the
defendant has been, or will be, prejudiced in the preparation or
conduct of his defence by delay on the part of prosecution which is
unjustifiable. The ultimate object of this discretionary power is to
ensure that there should be a fair trial according to law, which
involves fairness both to the defendant and the prosecution for as
Lord Diplock said in Sang case (1979) 2 All ER 1222, 1230). "The
fairness of a trial is not all one-sided; it requires that those who are
undoubtedly guilty should be convicted as well as that those about
whose guilt there is any reasonable doubt should be acquitted".
Where as a result of the delay the defendant has suffered
considerable hardship, for instance, where the proceedings have
been hanging over his head for a long time, this can be a ground for
stopping the proceedings and to proceed to judgment immediately
408
(See R V Derby Crown Court ex. p. Brooks [(1985) 80 Cr. APP. R.
164].
In the English law, there is power in the court in cases of
miscarriage of justice, to stay the proceedings; its effect is to
terminate the case against the accused.
Adjournment on payment of costs
Instead of refusing adjournment, and taking the extreme
step of proceeding to judgment immediately, the court may adjourn
the case by penalizing the party at fault. The words 'on such terms
as it thinks fit' seem to empower the court to grant adjournment
conditionally on payment of costs. The courts have been exercising
this power (See for example Bishambar v Ramchand AIR 1926
Lah 407; Sh. Abdul Haq v Crown PLD 1955 FC 401, 409 and
Dr. Manzoor Hussain v State, 1969 P Cr. LJ 336) and this should
dispel the notion that costs are a special feature of civil litigation
and have no role to play in criminal cases. Costs are awarded to
compensate the party who suffers by an unnecessary or
unjustifiable adjournment and should therefore not be
disproportionate to the loss suffered; nor should the power be so
exercised as to put obstacles in the way of the accused defending
himself properly (Dr. Manzoor Hussain v State, 1969 P Cr. LJ
336).
Costs awarded under this section are, as section 547 Cr.
P. C. provides, recoverable as fine.
Other cases of sine die adjournment, e.g. pendency of
a civil suit
There are cases in which the court may have to adjourn
the trial of a criminal case pending the decision of a civil suit. A
Magistrate has power under section 249 Cr. P. C. to stop the
proceedings of a criminal case at any stage and "without
pronouncing any judgment either of acquittal or conviction". There
409
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 223
is no such provision in Chapter XXIIA giving a similar power to
the Court of Session. But there can be no doubt that an
adjournment sine die in such cases will be covered by the
expression "any other reasonable cause" in section 344 Cr. P. C.
For example, in Muhammad Akbar v State (PLD 1968 SC 281).
the dispute in a case under sections 411 and 379 PPC pending
before a Magistrate concemed the ownership of a bus. The same
question was also pending decision in a civil suit. The High Court
in exercise of its inherent powers under section 561A stayed the
criminal proceeding. It was held that "normally it is true that
criminal proceedings should not be postponed pending the disposal
of civil litigation connected with the same subject matter but where
it is clear that the criminal liability is dependent upon the result of
the civil litigation or is so intimately connected with it that there is
a danger of grave injustice being done in the case if there be a
conflict of decision......" the criminal proceedings may be stayed."
In Muhammad Azam v Muhammad Iqbal (PLD 1984 SC 95) the
power in the court to adjourn the criminal proceedings under the
Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hadood) Ordinance 1979 sine die
till the decision of the question of marriage by the Family Court
under the Family Courts Ordinance 1964 was recognized. The
accused had pleaded valid Nikah as his defence against the charge
of Zina-bil-Jabar and as the Family Court had the exclusive
jurisdiction to determine the question of marriage, and the question
of the guilt or innocence of the accused depended upon the
decision of the Family Court, the criminal court, it was held,
"should stay the proceedings and await the result of the contest on
issue of Nikah before the Family Court........
Charge
The first important step in the trial of criminal cases is
the framing of a formal charge. As regards trials before
Magistrates, section 242 provides that "when the accused appears
or is brought before the Magistrate a formal charge shall be framed
relating to the offence of which he is accused and he shall be asked
whether he admits that he has committed the offence with which he
is charged". As regards trials before the High Court and the Court
of Session, section 265D provides that "if, after perusing the police
report, or as the case may be, the complaint, and all other
documents and statements filed by the prosecution, the Court is of
the opinion that there is ground for proceeding with the trial of the
accused it shall frame in writing a charge against the accused".
The provisions as to what is a charge, the form of
charges, their language. joinder of charges and other related
matters are to be found in Chapter XIX, sections 221 to 240
Cr.P.C. We may well pause here to notice some of its provisions to
highlight the place which a charge has in the trial of a criminal
case.
A charge is a statement of the offence, that is, a
description of the offence, and the particulars of the offence, a brief
statement of the essential facts which constitute the offence. The
object of framing a charge is to give reasonable information and
notice as to the matter with which the accused is charged and
which he is called upon to defend. The basic requirement in every
criminal trial is that the charge must be framed so as to give the
accused a fairly reasonable idea as to the case which he is to face,
and the validity of the charge must in each case be determined by
the application of the test viz had the accused a reasonably
sufficient notice of the matter with which he was charged?
(Chittarajan v State - AIR 1963 SC 1696; M. Younis Habib v State
-PLD 2006 SC 155).
This is expressly so provided in Chapter XIX Cr. P.C.
Section 221 says that every charge shall state the offence with
which the accused is charged. If the law which creates the offence
gives it any specific name, the offence may be described in the
charge by that name only. But if the law which creates the offence
does not give it any specific name, so much of the definition of the
offence must be stated as to give the accused notice of the matter
with which he is charged. The law and section of the law against
which the offence is said to have been committed shall be
410
411
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 224
mentioned in the charge. The fact that the charge is made is
equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by law
to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular
case. The illustrations to section 221 can be greatly helpful in
understanding these legal requirements. Section 222 requires that
the charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of
the alleged offence and the person against whom or the thing in
respect of which it was committed as are reasonably sufficient to
give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged,
Separate and joint charge
The general rule as enacted in section 233 Cr. P. C. is
that for every distinct offence of which any person is accused there
shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried
separately. The cases mentioned in sections 234, 235, 236 and 239
Cr. P. C. which sections are exceptions to the general rule enable a
plurality of offences to be dealt with in the same trial (Babulal case
-AIR 1938 P. C. 130). A joint trial is under these provisions by no
means compulsory. Nor can it be said that if several accused
charged for committing the same offence in the same transaction
are tried separately then the trial will irrespective of any question
of prejudice be illegal. The provisions of sections 234 to 239 Cr. P.
C. are merely enabling provisions and do not make it incumbent
upon the criminal courts to hold a joint trial in every case
(Shahadat Khan v Home Secretary - PLD 1969 SC 158; Nadir
Shah v State 1980 SCMR 402). The general rule in section 233
Cr.P.C. is based on a salutary principle that when each charge is
tried separately, there is much less apprehension of prejudice to the
accused as compared to a trial wherein several offences are
combined together (Nadir Shah v State 1980 SCMR 402).
Section 239 enumerates the categories of persons who
may be charged jointly. For example, persons accused of the same
offence committed in the same transaction, and persons accused of
an offence and a person accused of abetment or of an attempt to
commit such offence may be charged and tried jointly. In truth.
there are powerful public reasons why joint offences should be
tried jointly. As was held in R v Hayter (2005) 2 All ER 209, 212)
"while considerations of the avoidance
of delay, costs, and convenience, can be
cited in favour of joint trials this is not
the prime basis of the practice. Instead it
is founded principally on the perception
that a just outcome is more likely to be
established in a joint trial than in
separate trials...... Subject to a judge's
discretion to order otherwise, joint trials
of those involved in a joint criminal case
are in the public interest and are the
norm".
Conviction for offence not charged:
Sections 237 and 238 Cr.P.C. provide for an accused to
be convicted of an offence although he had not been charged with
that offence. Section 237 applies where the accused was charged
with one offence but it appears in evidence that he committed a
different offence and section 238 where a person is charged with an
offence consisting of several particulars, a combination of some
only of which constitutes a complete minor offence and such.
combination is proved, he may be convicted of the minor offence
though he was not charged with it..
Errors in the charges
Sections 225 and 232 need special treatment. Section
225 provides that no error in stating either the offence or the
particulars required in the charge and no omission to state the
offence or those particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the
case as material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such
error or omission and it has occasioned a failure of justice.

A is charged with cheating B, and the manner

manner of the cheating is not material.

and offered no defence. The Court may infer
from such facts that the omission to set out
the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a
material error.
A is charged with the murder of Khoda
Bakhsh on the 21" January, 1982. In fact, the
murdered person's name was Haider Bakhsh,
and the date of the murder was the 20"
January, 1982. A was never charged with any
murder but one, and had heard the trial which
referred exclusively to the case of Haider
Bakhsh. The Court may infer from these facts
that A was not misled, and that the error in
charge was immaterial.
A was charged with murdering Haider Bakhsh
on the 20 January, 1982 and Khoda Bakhsh
who tried to arrest him for that murder on the
414
21 January, 1982. When charged for the
murder of Haider Bakhsh, he was tried for the
murder of Khoda Baksh. The witnesses
present in his defence were witnesses in the
case of Haider Bakhsh. The Court may infer
from this that A was misled, and that the error
was material.
Error in charge - when may a new trial be ordered
Section 322 enacts that if an appellate or revisional court
is of opinion that any person convicted of an offence was misled in
his defence by the absence of a charge or by any error in the
charge, it shall direct a new trial to be held, upon a charge framed
in whatever manner it thinks fit. In view of these provisions, at one
time, distinction was made between an illegality and irregularity.
The leading case on the subject was Subrahmania Ayyar v King
[(1902) ILR Madras 61, 67] where the appellant had been charged
with no less than 41 acts, extending over a period of two years in
contravention of section 234 Cr.P.C. which prescribes that a person
can only be tried for three offences of the same kind if committed
within a period of two years. It was held that disobedience to an
express provision as to a mode of trial could not be regarded as a
mere irregularity; such a phrase as irregularity' was not
appropriate to the illegality of trying an accused person for many
different offences at the same time and those offences being spread
over a longer period than by law could have been tried together in
one indictment. However this case was later considered in another
Privy Council case (Abdul Rehman case - AIR 1927 PC 44) and it
was held that the bare fact of failure to comply with the mandatory
provisions of a section in that case it was section 360 Cr.P.C.-
unaccompanied by a failure of justice is not enough to viuate the
proceedings which may be cured by sections 535 and 537 Cr. P. C.
However that may be, sections $35 and 537 as amended
in 1964 and 1972 seem to have done away with this distinction and
it seems that even a contravention of section 234 is now a curable

irregularity. The controversy that has raged around the true
meaning of Subrahmania case ought now to have been set at rest.
(Z A Bhutto case, para 176 per Anwar-ul-Haq CJ). Section 535
provides that no finding or sentence shall be deemed invalid merely
on the ground that no charge was framed unless in the opinion of
the court of appeal or revision a failure of justice had in fact been
occasioned thereby. Section 537 provides that no finding or
sentence passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be
reversed or altered by an appellate or revisional court on account-
b)
of any error, omission or irregularity in the
complaint, report by police-officer under
section 173, summons, warrant, charge,
proclamation, order, judgment or other
proceedings before or during trial or in any
inquiry or other proceedings under this Code,
ог
of any error, omission or irregularity in the
mode of trial, including any mis-joinder of
charges,
unless such error, omission or irregularity has in fact occasioned a
failure of justice.
As to what may occasion a failure of justice, section 537
itself provides one test. It is that in determining whether any error,
omission or irregularity in any proceeding under this Code has
occasioned a failure of justice, the court shall have regard to the
fact whether the objection could and should have been raised at an
earlier stage in the proceedings. (M. Younis Habib v State - PLD
2006 SC 155).
Effect of admission or denial of charge
After a formal charge has been framed, the accused is to
be called upon to plead guilty or not guilty. When the trial is by a
Magistrate and the accused admits that he has committed the
offence, his admission shall be recorded as nearly as possible in his
own words and if he shows no sufficient cause why he should not
be convicted, the Magistrate may, section 243 Cr. P.C. provides,
convict him accordingly. If the trial is before a High Court or a
Court of Session and the accused pleads guilty, the court shall
record the plea and may, as section 265E provides, in its discretion,
convict him thereon.
It is obvious that the admission by the accused of the
commission of the offence or the admission that he is guilty and
has no defence to make, followed by a conviction thereon, puts an
end to the trial.
But where the accused does not plead guilty or does not
admit the commission of the offence, the hearing of the case
commences. This is the point of the trial where issues such as
double jeopardy and jurisdiction of the court to try etc. may
appropriately be raised.
Pleas such as to jurisdiction and double
jeopardy are preliminary
As to the plea of double jeopardy, the relevant
provisions of law are Article 13 of the Constitution, section 403 Cr.
P. C. and section 26 of the General Clauses Act 1897. These
provisions have been noticed and discussed under Article 13 of the
Constitution in the Constitutional Criminal Procedure part of this
book. Suffice it to say here that these provisions expressly give
effect to the common law rule that a man must not be put twice in
peril for the same offence and that to every prosecution, a plea of
autrefois acquit or autrefois convict is a good defence.
The questions, if raised, will go to the competence of the
court to proceed with the trial of the case. They should ordinarily
be treated as preliminary issues and should be resolved before any

Chapter 7
PROCEDURE FOR TRIALS
We have noticed that under the Code of Criminal
Procedure, trials are of two kinds: (1) summary trials, that is, trials
of minor offences, with which we have already dealt; and (2)
regular trials, that is, trials of serious offences.
Regular trials may be sub-divided into trials by Courts of
Magistrates, and trials by Courts of Session, or High Courts.
Trials by Magistrates:
The procedure for the trial of cases by Magistrates is
provided by Chapter XX, sections 241 to 250A, of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. The provisions of Chapter XX have to be read
with the provisions of Chapter XXIV, which chapter makes
"general provisions as to inquiries and trials".
We have seen that section 241A requires that copies of
certain documents shall be supplied to the accused. We have also
seen what those documents shall be, what the object of supplying
those copies is and what the effect of their non-supply is.
While section 265A Cr.P.C. expressly provides that in
trials before the Court of Session, initiated upon a police report
under section 173 Cr.P.C, the prosecution shall be conducted by
the Public Prosecutor, there is no such provision in the Code of
Criminal Procedure for trials before Magistrates. In the recently
enacted Provincial Laws, e.g. The Punjab Criminal Prosecution
Service (Constitution, Functions and Powers) Act 2006, there are
provisions which require that prosecutions in the Courts of
Magistrates shall also be conducted by the Public Prosecutors. For
example, section 9(1) of the Punjab Act reads:
418
"The Prosecutors shall be responsible for
the conduct of prosecution on behalf of
the Government".
Subject to any constitutional objection under Article 143
of the Constitution, this provision in the Provincial Laws has
modified the provisions of section 495 Cr. P. C. which section.
inter-alia, provides that "any Magistrate inquiring into or trying any
case may permit the prosecution to be conducted by any person
other than an officer of police below the rank to be prescribed by
the Provincial Government in this behalf.........
The need and the occasion for trial arise when, as section
244 Cr. P. C. provides, the accused admits the charge, but the
Magistrate does not convict him, or when he does not admit the
charge and thereby challenges the prosecution to prove it. In these
cases, the Magistrate "shall proceed to hear the complainant, if any.
and take all such evidence as may be produced in support of the
prosecution, and also hear the accused and take all such evidence
as he produces in his defence". Under subsection (2) of section
244, the Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, on the application of the
complainant or accused, issue summons to any witness to attend or
to produce any document or any other thing, and may require that
the witness's reasonable expenses be deposited in court, but when
the offence under trial is punishable with imprisonment exceeding
six months, the accused shall not be required to deposit such
expenses. The power to summon a witness includes the power to
summon a person whose name does not appear in the calendar of
witnesses and even a person whose statement was not recorded
during investigation under section 161 or section 364 Cr.P.C
(Shahbaz Masih v State - 2007 SCMR 1631).
The use of the word 'complainant' in sub-section (2) of
section 244 is not a happy choice. The section applies to trials
initiated both on police reports and private complaints. Obviously.
in cases initiated on police reports, the State is the prosecutor and it
will be on the State's application that the witnesses will be
419

Page 228
summoned. This position is correctly reflected in section 265F
subsection (2) Cr. P. C. which reads:
"The court shall ascertain from the
Public Prosecutor or, as the case may be,
from the complainant,
names...
the
Under section 245 Cr. P. C. if on taking the evidence
and examining the accused, the Magistrate finds the accused not
guilty, he "shall record an order of acquittal", and if he finds him
guilty, "pass sentence according to law".
Section 245A Cr. P. C. provides procedure for cases in
which the accused has had a previous conviction but denies that
fact.
Section 247 Cr.P.C. applies to cases initiated on
complaint only; it provides that if on a date of hearing the
complainant does not appear, then the Magistrate shall,
notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained (in the Code),
acquit the accused unless for some reason he thinks not to do so
and adjourns the hearing. This provision does not apply -
(i)
(ii)
in a case where the complainant is a public
servant, his personal attendance is not
required and the Magistrate dispenses with his
attendance and proceeds with the case; and
in a case where the offence with which the
accused stands charged is either cognizable or
non-compoundable.
Section 248 Cr. P. C. permits the complainant to withdraw the
complaint with the permission of the Magistrate; the withdrawal
shall result in the acquittal of the accused.
Section 250A Cr. P. C. is a special provision applicable
to offences punishable with fine only. The Provincial Government
may authorize a Magistrate to, except for reasons to be recorded in
writing, issue a summons to the accused requiring him either to
appear before him on a specified date in person or by an advocate,
or, if he desires to plead guilty to the charge, without appearing
before the Magistrate, to transmit to the Magistrate before the
specified date, by registered post or through a messenger, the said
plea in writing and the amount of fine specified in the summons or.
if he desires to appear by an advocate through such advocate to
plead guilty to the charge on his behalf and to pay the fine.
The amount of fine to be specified in the summons
"shall not be less than twenty five per cent, nor more than fifty per
cent, of the maximum fine provided for the offence".
Trials before High Courts and Courts of Session:
Section 265A Cr.P.C. enacts that "in every trial before a
Court of Session, initiated upon a police report, the prosecution
shall be conducted by the Public Prosecutor".
The procedure to be followed in trials by the High
Courts and the Courts of Session has been laid down in Chapter
XXII-A, sections 265C to 265N, Cr.P.C.
After the attendance of the accused has been procured,
copies of statements and documents mentioned in section 265C
have been supplied, a charge has been framed under section 265D,
and read over and explained to the accused, he shall, section 265E
so requires, be asked whether he is guilty or has any defence to
make. If the accused pleads guilty, the court shall record the plea
"and may, in its discretion, convict him thereon".
But if the accused does not plead guilty, or if he pleads
guilty but the court, in its discretion, does not convict him on his
plea, the procedure under section 265F Cr.P.C. starts to operate.
420
421

Page 229
The court shall summon the witnesses whose names
have been ascertained from the public prosecutor or as the case
may be, the complainant. examine those witnesses, examine the
accused and ask him if he means to produce defence evidence. The
court may summon a person whose name does not occur in the
calendar of witnesses as also a person whose statement was not
recorded during investigation under section 161 or 364 Cr.P.C
(Shahbaz Masih v State - 2007 SCMR 1631). If the accused says
he means to adduce evidence, the court shall call on the accused to
enter on his defence and produce his evidence. For that purpose,
the accused may produce his witnesses or may apply to the court
"to issue any process for compelling the attendance of any witness
or the production of any document or other thing" and the court-
"shall issue process unless it considers
that the application is made for the
purpose of vexation or delay or defeating
the ends of justice. Such ground shall be
recorded by the court in writing".
Chapter XL, sections 503 to 508A, make provisions for
the recording of evidence on commission. Under section 503 Cr.
P.C. if it appears to a Court of Session or the High Court that the
examination of a witness is necessary for the ends of justice and
that the evidence of such witness cannot be procured without an
amount of delay, expense or inconvenience which, under the
circumstances of the case, would be unreasonable, such court may
dispense with such attendance and may issue a commission to a
Magistrate of the First Class of the local area to take evidence of
such witness. Subsections (2A) and (2B) provide for a case in
which the witness resides in a foreign country.
If there be such a witness and the trial Magistrate thinks
that his evidence should be recorded on commission, the
Magistrate shall, under section 506 Cr.P.C., apply to the Sessions
Judge, who "may either issue a commission in the manner
hereinbefore provided or reject the application".
Section 509 Cr.P.C. provides that "the parties to any
in which a commission is issued. may
proceeding
respectively forward any interrogatories in writing which the
Magistrate or court directing the commission may think relevant to
the issue" and the witness shall be examined "upon such
interrogatories".
The evidence recorded in the manner provided in these
provisions shall, section 507(1) Cr.P.C. so enacts, "be read in
evidence in the case by either party, and shall form part of the
record", and under section 507(2). "may also be received in
evidence at any subsequent stage of the case before another court".
Examination of Witnesses - General Provisions:
Mode of recording evidence: In regular trials under
Chapter XX as well as in summary trials under Chapter XXII
Cr.PC. by a Magistrate of the First or Second Class, the Magistrate
shall, section 355 Cr.P.C. so provides, "make a memorandum of
the substance of the evidence of each witness as the examination of
witness proceeds". Such memorandum shall be written and signed
by the Magistrate with his own hand, and shall form part of the
record. If the Magistrate is unable to write the evidence with his
own hand, he shall record the reason of his inability and shall
dictate such memorandum in open court and shall sign the same.
Section 356 Cr.P.C. provides that in trials before the Courts of
Session and in inquiries under Chapter XII (disputes as to
immoveable property) the evidence of each witness shall be taken
down in the language of the court by the Magistrate or Sessions
Judge, or in his presence and hearing and under his personal
direction and superintendence and shall be signed by the
Magistrate or Sessions Judge. In such cases when the evidence is
not taken down by the Magistrate or Sessions Judge, "he shall, as
the examination of each witness proceeds, make a memorandum of
the substance of what such witness deposes; and such
memorandum shall be written and signed by the Magistrate or
Sessions Judge with his own hand. If the Magistrate or
422
423
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 230
Sessions Judge is prevented from making the required
memorandum, he shall record the reason of his inability,
Section 356 also makes provision for cases in which the
evidence is given in any language other than the court language
and section 357 empowers the Provincial Government to direct that
in any district or part of a district or in proceedings before any
Court of Session or before any Magistrate the evidence of each
witness shall, in cases referred to in section 356, be taken down by
the Sessions Judge or Magistrate with his own hand and in his
mother-tongue.
Section 359 Cr.P.C. provides that evidence recorded
under sections 356 and 357 shall not ordinarily be taken down in
the form of question and answer but in the form of a narrative but
the court may, in its discretion, take down or cause to be taken
down any particular question and answer. Under section 360, when
the evidence of each witness is completed, it shall be read over to
him in the presence of the accused or as the case may be, his
counsel, and shall, if necessary be corrected. If the witness denies
the correctness of any part of the evidence when the same is read
over to him, the court may, instead of correcting the evidence.
make a memorandum thereon of the objection made to it by the
witness and shall add such remarks as he thinks necessary. The
object of reading over the evidence to the witness is to obtain an
accurate record of what the witness really meant to say and to give
him an opportunity of correcting the words taken down. It is not to
enable him or his counsel to suggest corrections, or to change his
story. (Abdur Rehman v King - AIR 1927 PC 44; and AIR 1952
SC 214). The witness is entitled to be sure that the evidence has
been read over and the witness has had an opportunity of correcting
the written record. But he is not necessarily entitled to the
opportunity of suggesting corrections (Abdur Rehman v King -
AIR 1927 PC 44).
Demeanour and Credibility of Witness: The trial court
has the great advantage, which the appellate court does not have, of
seeing and observing the witness in the witness box; therefore
424
appreciation of evidence by the trial court is ordinarily given full
weight by the appellate court. And if the appellate court is to take a
different view as to the credibility of a witness from that taken by
the trial court, it must give cogent reasons for so doing. As was
said by Lord Shaw in Clarke v Edinburgh Tramways (1919) SC
HL 35, 36), "when a Judge hears and sees witnesses and makes a
conclusion or inference with regard to what is the weight on
balance of their evidence, that judgment is entitled to great respect
quite irrespective of whether the Judge makes any observation with
regard to credibility or not". This principle was recognized and
applied in Allah Ditta v State (PLD 1958 SC (Pak) 290) State v
Farman Hussain (PLD 1995 SCT, 29), and Muhammad Amir v
Khan Bahadur (PLD 1996 SC 267,273).
Credibility of a witness is not a matter of law; it is a
matter of simple human judgment. The usual aids to belief or
disbelief, so said Cornelius, C.J. in Abdul Razik v State (PLD 1865
SC 151)-
"as to the credibility of a witness are the
appearance of the face of witness as he
makes his statement, the manner in
which he receives a question, considers
his reply and states it, the manner in
which he faces cross examination and
meets objections affecting his veracity
and such other factors by which the
human judgment is assisted".
This is the description of demeanour and all this shows its
importance in credit-worthiness of a witness. That is the reason that
section 363 Cr.P.C. provides that-
"when a Sessions Judge or Magistrate
has recorded the evidence of a witness,
he shall also record such remarks, if any,
as he thinks material respecting the
425
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 231
demeanour of such witness whilst under
examination".
He shall record such remarks about demeanour for his own benefit,
for the benefit of his successor in case he ceases for any reason to
be the trial judge before the stage of judgment and of course for the
benefit of the appellate court.
Court's power to ask questions, call witness etc:
Under section 340 Cr.P.C. a court may, that is, it has
discretion to, at any stage of inquiry, trial or other proceeding.
summon any person as a witness. or examine any person in
attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or recall and re-
examine any person already examined; and the court shall, that is,
it must, "summon and examine or recall or re-examine any such
person if his evidence appears to it essential to the just decision of
the case". Thus, once the court holds that the evidence of such a
person is essential to the just decision of the case, it has no
discretion to refuse to summon or as the case may be, examine,
recall or re-examine such a person (Shahbaz Masih v State-2007
SCMR 1631; Muhammad Azam v Muhammad Iqbal PLD 1984 SC
95, 118, 123).
Article 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat 1984 empowers the
judge, in order to discover the truth or to obtain proper proof of
relevant facts, to ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any
time, of any witness or of the parties about any fact relevant or
even irrelevant, and to order the production of any document or
thing. It provides also that the parties shall not be entitled to make
any objection to any such question or order, nor, without the leave
of the court, to cross examine any witness upon any question given
in reply to any such question. This power does not, however,
extend to authorizing any judge to compel any witness to answer
any question or to produce any document which such witness
would be entitled to refuse to answer or to produce under Articles 4
to 14 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat.
The power given by Article 161 is a very wide power
but in exercising it, it should be remembered, first, that there is no
such thing as 'judicial advocacy' and secondly, that it is 'trite law
that a judge's role is to hold the ring fairly between the prosecution
and defence, and this cannot be done properly if the judge enters
into the arena by appearing to take one side or the other. Questions
which might suggest this should be avoided. Often the best course
for a judge is to remain silent until counsel has had opportunity to
deal with the matter (R v Tueget (2002) 2 All ER 872, 888; Jones v
National Coal Board (1957) 2 QB 55). In short, the judge must
not assume the role of a prosecutor or defence counsel and in
elucidating the relevant facts of the case, he must hold the balance
equally between the parties (S.A. Rehman, J. in Ali Nawaz Gardezi
v Lt. Colonel Muhammad Yousaf - PLD 1963 SC 51, 86). But if
the asking of questions is essential to the just decision of the case,
objection such as that the court should not fill gaps in the
prosecution or defence should not deter the court to exercise the
power (Muhammad Azam v Muhammad Iqbal - PLD 1984 SC 95.
123).
The power to proceed under the second part of section
540 Cr.P.C. may be exercised suo motu or on the application of a
party and may be exercised at any stage of the enquiry or trial
(State v Moulvi Muhammad Jamil - PLD 1965 SC 681); it may be
exercised even after both the parties have closed their evidence and
the case has been adjourned for judgment for till then the case is
still pending (Rashid Ahmad v State - PLD 1971 SC 709). What is
for the just decision of the case will depend upon the
circumstances of each case. The object of section 540 is to defend
the interest of justice and not to defeat it (Muhammad Amjad v
State-PLD 2003 SC 704,716).
Thus, the power under section 540 Cr.P.C. and the one
conferred by Article 161 of the Qanun are complementary to each
other and it is not proper to assume any artificial limitation on the
exercise of the court's power under these provisions (Muhammad
Azam v Muhammad Iqbal - PLD 1984 SC 95, 122, 124).

Proof of previous conviction or acquittal
Section 265-I Cr.P.C. provides, as does section 245A
Cr.P.C, for cases in which previous conviction is a relevant factor.
Section 511 Cr.P.C. provides for the manner in which a previous
conviction or acquittal may be proved. This is in addition to any
other mode for proving it provided by any other law.
Power of Advocate General to withdraw prosecution
Section 265L Cr.P.C. empowers the Advocate General,
at any stage of any trial before the High Court, "to inform the court
on behalf of the Government that he will not prosecute the accused
upon the charge; and thereupon all proceedings against the accused
shall be stayed, and he shall be discharged of and from the same.
But such discharge shall not amount to an acquittal unless the
presiding Judge otherwise directs".
Preliminary
Chapter 8
CRIMINAL EVIDENCE
The crux of a trial is the presentation of evidence; and
"criminal evidence" means that part of the law of evidence which
governs the process of proof in criminal cases. Thus, the context of
evidence is a trial which means a hearing in a suit or proceeding in
a court or tribunal at which evidence is introduced. The law of
evidence, therefore, is the lex fori, that is, the law of forum or
court.
The principal law of evidence in Pakistan is the Qanun-
e-Shahadat, 1984 (the Qanun). Its ancestor was the Evidence Act,
1872, which codified the common law rules of evidence, lying
scattered in innumerable English decided cases, and applied them
to India. The common law model was adversarial, which was
transported through conquest and colonialism to North America.
428
Australia. Indian sub-continent and significant parts of Africa. In
comparing this adversarial system with the inquisitorial system.
reference is often made to the French model of criminal procedure
which derives originally from Napoleon's Criminal Procedure
Code of 1808 and "still defines the basic contours of French
Criminal Procedure today". The Napoleonic system "was
transported in France's nineteenth and early twentieth century
colonial caravan and implanted in countries as near as Belgium and
the Netherlands and as far afield as Ivory Coast, Cameron, Niger,
Cambodia and Vietnam". (For this information, we gratefully
acknowledge our debt to the book "Criminal Evidence" by Paul
Roberts and Andrian Zuckerman - Oxford pp 42-44).
The avowed object of the enactment of Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984, and the repeal of the Evidence Act, 1872, was, as
its preamble says, to "revise, amend and consolidate the law of
evidence so as to bring it in conformity with the Injunctions of
Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah", in compliance
with Article 227, clause (1), of the Constitution. That clause in its
relevant part reads:
"All existing laws shall be brought in
conformity with the Injunctions of Islam
as laid down in the Holy Quran and
Sunnah, in this Part referred to as the
Injunctions of Islam and no law shall be
enacted which is repugnant to such
Injunctions".
Proceedings to which Qanun-e-Shahadat applies:
The law of evidence applies to forensic, as distinguished
from non-forensic, fact-finding process: (The word 'forensic' is
derived from the Roman 'forum' where legal and other business
was transacted and 'forensic' literally means 'pertaining to legal
proceedings), that is fact-finding in legal proceedings. Doctors,
scientists, journalists, detectives and historians are daily engaged in

To determine the scope of the application of the Qanun-

Judicial Proceedings
Judicial proceedings' is not defined in the Qanun-e-
Shahadat; it is defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure, section
4(1)(m), but not exhaustively; under that section. judicial
proceedings includes any proceeding in the course of which
evidence is or may be legally taken on oath. For one, that definition
is for the purposes of the Code only. Secondly, it being not
exhaustive, it leaves its ordinary meaning or if it has acquired a
technical meaning, that meaning, intact.
In its dictionary meaning, judicial proceeding" is a
generic term for proceedings relating to, practiced in, or proceeding
from, a court of justice; a proceeding in a legally constituted court.
(See Black's Law Dictionary). The word judicial has two
meanings; it may refer to the discharge of duties exercisable_by_a_
judge or it may refer to administrative duties which need not be
performed in court, but in respect of which it is necessary to bring
to bear a judicial mind, that is a mind to determine what is fair and
just in respect of the matters under consideration (Fauj Din v
Akhtar Mehmood-PLD 1988 Lah. 352).
430
Court
The term 'court' is defined in the Qanun-e-Shahadat.
Article 2(a), but again not exhaustively; it includes all Judges and
Magistrates and all persons, except arbitrators, legally authorized to
take evidence. That takes us to the ordinary or technical, if any,
meaning of the term.
Clause (2) of Article 1 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat also
uses the term 'tribunal' but does not define it.
There is a wide variety of courts; so there is of tribunals.
While every court is a tribunal, the converse is not true, that is,
every tribunal is not necessarily a court. "There are many tribunals
which are not courts despite the fact that they are charged with
certain matters and have features in common with courts".
(Viscount Dilhorne in Attorney General v BBC - (1980) 3 All ER
161; also see Zahoor Elahi v State
Muhammad Gul J. who said: ".
term which includes a court and
interchangeably").

The distinction is between courts of law, which exercise
the judicial power of the State-Courts of Judicature, that is, courts
of law which form part of the judicial system of the country and
courts or tribunals which are to resolve problems arising in the
course of administration.
There are many tribunals with the label "court' attached
to them, which have many of the trappings of a court or which are
required to act judicially, yet they are not courts of law in the
above-stated sense. Thus, a tribunal is not a court of law merely
because-
(1)
it is called a court; or
(2)
(3)

it performs its functions sitting in public; or
it has power to administer oath and hear
evidence on oath.

Nor is it the test that the tribunal or body in question is
required to act judicially, that is to say, with such fairness and
impartiality as characterize proceedings in courts of justice that

in AG v BBC (1980) 3 All ER 161, the
question was whether the local valuation court
established under the (English) Local
Government Act 1948 was a court exercising
the Judicial Power of the State. It was held
that that court was not a court of law
exercising the Judicial Power of the State; it
was established to exercise administrative
powers of the local government;
in AG v Reginam (1957) 2 All ER 45), the
question was whether the Commonwealth.
Conciliation and Arbitration Court established
to settle industrial disputes was a court of law.
It was held that the function performed by the
court was outside the realm of Judicial Power;
in Bahadur Khan v State (PLD 1985 SC 62)
the question was whether a Magistrate
concurring with the police report under
section 173 Cr.P.C. discharging an accused
and cancelling a police case acted as a court.
It was held that this function was an executive
or administrative function and in performing
it the Magistrate did not act as a court;
In Fauj Din v Akhtar Mahmood (PLD 1988
Lah. 352) the question was whether the
Courts Martial:
District Magistrate acting under section 337
Cr.P.C. which empowered him to tender
pardon to an accused acted as a court. The
answer was that he did not; he acted in an
administrative capacity.
Courts Martial, as distinguished from Martial Law
Courts mean courts established under the Army, Navy or Air Force
Acts to deal with matters relating to the armed forces personnel.
Martial Law Courts refer to courts established by the Commander
of the Army which has conquered an enemy's territory and
imposes martial law. (Muhammad Nawaz case PLD 1951 FC
73).
Quasi-Judicial:
"Quasi is a Latin word; it means as if; almost as it were;
analogous to. This term is used in legal phraseology to indicate that
one subject resembles another with which it is compared, in certain
characteristics, but there are intrinsic and material differences
between them. 'Quasi-judicial' is a term applied to the action,
discretion etc of public administrative officers or bodies; and a
'quasi-judicial act means a judicial act performed by one not a
judge. (These definitions have been gratefully borrowed from
Black's Law Dictionary).
In Engineers Workers Union v Devanayagam (1967) 2
All ER 367, Lord Guest and Lord Devlin discussed the term
'quasi-judicial' with reference to the concept of "Judicial Power":
"It is true that Judicial Power' can be
entrusted to someone who is not a
judicial officer and the person so
432
433

Page 235
entrusted is then generally spoken of as
acting quasi-judicially".
In the words of Chief Justice Muhammad Monir in Tariq
Transport (PLD 1958 SC (Pak) 437)-
"The word 'quasi' as prefixed to the word
judicial' may either indicate that the
tribunal is not acting
administratively or that it is acting in a
purely
manner in which a judicial tribunal is
expected to act".
Court and tribunal:
Article 1, clause (2), of the Qanun, uses both the term
'court' and the term 'tribunal'. The idea is to distinguish between
the courts of law exercising the Judicial Power of the State and
tribunals which have been established for other purposes, c.g.
administrative and legislative purposes. We have seen, that though
the two terms are often used interchangeably, yet every court is a
tribunal but every tribunal is not a court. (See AG v BBC, per
Visconnt Dilhomme and Zahoor Elahi v State, per Muhammad Gul
J.).
The term 'court' is defined in Article 2(a) of the Qanun;
the definition is not exhaustive. It includes all Judges and
Magistrates and all persons, except arbitrators, legally authorized to
take evidence. This has reference to Judges and Magistrates
appointed by the State to exercise the Judicial Power of the State in
civil, criminal, commercial matters, that is all matters concerning
the life, liberty and property of its citizens.
Arbitrator:
We have seen that under Article 1, clause (2), the
Quanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, does not apply to arbitrators. Also,
under Article 2(a), the term 'court' does not include arbitrators.
434
The reason is the distinction between the state-appointed
functionaries to exercise the legislative, executive and judicial
powers of the State and the privately appointed functionaries. For
example, the Judicial Power of the State is exercised by the courts
established in accordance with Article 175 through Judges and
Magistrates appointed by the State. An arbitrator is appointed by
the parties to the dispute and not by the State. Hence he is not a
court.
Evidence:
In discussing the Constitutional Criminal Procedure in
an earlier part of this book, we have noticed the development of the
constitutional rule in America namely that all evidence obtained in.
violation of the Constitution is inadmissible. The rationale of that
exclusionary rule of evidence is two-fold (1) exclusion of such
evidence is the only effective means of protecting the constitutional
rights and preserving the Constitution inviolate; (2) the interest in
judicial integrity requires that the courts should not be parties to a
constitutional violation. We have argued that in view of the
similarity of the provisions guaranteeing such rights as right
against self-incrimination, right to counsel and right to privacy in
the two constitutions, the American Constitution and the
Constitution of Pakistan, there is no linguistic difficulty in adopting
in Pakistan the law as it has developed in America and that that
law, particularly the exclusionary rule, ought to be applied here.
There is, thus, a constitutional law of evidence; its
predominant position was brought into sharp focus in a recent
English case - A v Secretary of State for Home (2006) 2 AC 221).
where, as a result of the enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998.
legislative provisions are now liable to be declared incompatible
with the European Convention Rights. The question in that case
was whether a tribunal was entitled to rely on evidence obtained by
agents of a foreign government by means of torture. The evidence
was held inadmissible. One of the Law Lords said:
435
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 236
"It trivializes the issue....
....to treat
it as an argument about the law of
evidence. The issue is one of the
constitutional principle, whether
evidence obtained by torturing another
human being may lawfully be admitted
against a party to a proceeding in a
British court. irrespective of where, or
by whom, or on whose authority, the
torture was inflicted. To that question I
would give a very clear negative
answer".
The word 'evidence' is defined in the Qanun, Article
2(1), clause (c), to include-
(i)
(ii)
all statements which the court permits or
requires to be made before it by witnesses in
relation to matters of fact under inquiry; such
statements are called oral evidence; and
all documents produced for the inspection of
the court; such documents are called
documentary evidence.
In short, 'evidence' includes oral and documentary evidence.
It falls to be observed that in the Evidence Act, 1872, the
definition of 'evidence' used both the expressions 'means and
includes', not a very elegant drafting device, yet, it served the
purpose of expressing the legislative intent, namely, that the
definition was exhaustive. The reason why the word 'means' was
omitted in clause (c) of Article 4(1) of the Qanun is not apparent
and is difficult to conceive. However, that may be, it appears that
the definition is as exhaustive as it was in the 1872 Act; it was so
treated in Jameel Ahmad v Saifuddin (PLD 1994 SC 501, 504).
436
As Monir, in his great work on "The Law of Evidence".
says, there is nothing technical or legal about 'evidence'; in its
original sense, it signifies the state of being evident, plain or
apparent.
Evidence is information. The Arabic word for evidence
is Shahadat, the root word being Shahd. As was observed in
Rashida Patel case (PLD 1989 FSC 95, 109), information based
upon one's observations and knowledge is Shahadat (evidence).
Thus, what is merely conjecture or guess or surmise is not
evidence. In technical terms, evidence in Islam means true
information about a thing or event provided to the court.
Shahadat', so says, Fida Muhammad Khan, J, in Rashida Patel is
one of the pillars supporting the system of Adl (justice) in Islam.
As Professor Edward M. Morgan of the Harvard Law
School in his Foreword to the American Law Institute's Model
Code of Evidence has observed, a Code of Evidence is designed to
make a trial a rational proceeding for the settlement of a dispute
between the litigants. Thus, when A asserts that an event occurred
in a certain way but B, his adversary, asserts that it occurred in
altogether a different way, the court's function is one of "truth-
finding" through the medium of witnesses, documents etc. Wills on
"Circumstantial Evidence", 7th ed. p 2, thinks that 'evidence'
denotes 'the means by which any alleged matter of fact, the truth of
which is submitted to investigation, is established or disproved".
The law of evidence comprises the legal rules regulating those
means.
In Jameel Ahmed v Saifuddin (PLD 1994 SC 501, 504),
Monir's well known work on the Law of Evidence was referred to
with approval to determine the meaning of 'evidence' in Article
2(1), clause (c). Monir referred to Stephen, according to whom -
"the word "evidence" as generally employed is
ambiguous: (a) it sometimes means the words uttered
and things exhibited by witnesses before a Court of
437
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 237
Justice: (b) at other times, it means the facts proved to
exist by those words or things and regarded as the
groundwork of inferences as to other facts not so proved;
(c) again it is sometimes used as meaning to assert that a
particular fact is relevant to the matter under enquiry".
In the opinion of Monir, "the word in this Act (now the Qanun) is
used in the sense of the first clause. As thus used, it signifies only
the instruments by means of which relevant facts are brought
before the court (viz witnesses and documents) and by means of
which the court is convinced of those facts".
The Supreme Court held:
"Evidence is a comprehensive word
which includes statements of witnesses,
parties and documents which are
produced in a court or judicial forum to
prove or disprove the case".
The law of evidence in Pakistan has not kept up with the
changing times as it has in some jurisdictions e.g. UK and USA.
Yet there is no denying that it has come a very long way from the
so-called 'pure justice' practices to the civilizing hand of the
modern law; from the barbaric myths of the 'dark past' to the
scientific methods of the enlightened age; from "that popular sport
known as jumping to conclusions") to the informed decision-
making, that is, informed by evidence, regulated by law, the
ultimate object being the promotion of legitimacy of adjudication.
Evidence and Proof:
'Evidence' and 'proof are sometimes used
synonymously but they are not the same thing. This is clearly
demonstrated by the definitions of the words "proved" and
'disproved' in clauses (4) and (5) respectively of Article 2 of the
Qanun;
"(4) A fact is said to be proved when, after considering
the matters before it, the court either believes it to exist.
or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man
ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to
act upon the supposition that it exists.
(5) A fact is said to be disproved when, after
considering the matters before it. the court either
believes that it does not exist, or considers its non-
existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under
the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the
supposition that it does not exist".
We shall return to these definitions when discussing the concept of
"Standard of Proof". For the purposes of the distinction between
'proof and 'evidence', it is to be noted that in these definitions, the
word used is matters' and not evidence: they say, "after
considering the matters before it", and not "after considering the
evidence before it". "Matters" is obviously wider than 'evidence':
matters includes 'evidence' and 'evidence' means oral and
documentary evidence. As was said by Muhammad Afzal Zullah J.
in State v Habibur Rehman (PLD 1983 SC 286). "matters" carries a
wider connotation; wider than 'evidence', its statements and the
documents. The learned Judge referred to Monir's Law of
Evidence, where the learned author says: "The court is, therefore,
not bound to look for its findings on the 'evidence' alone as is
defined in the Evidence Act but has to see to the high probability
regarding the existence or non-existence of a fact after considering
the matters before it
Included in 'matters", besides 'evidence' are -
1)
presumptions, e.g. presumptions as
documents under Articles 90 to 100, and
presumptions as to existence of certain facts
under Article 129 of the Qanan;
to

Page 238
2)
3)
4)
facts of which the court will take judicial
notice under Articles 11 and 112 of The
Qanun;
inspection of spot or place of incident by the court;
remarks
demeanour of witnesses. e.g.
recorded by a Sessions Judge or a Magistrate,
when recording the evidence of a witness,
respecting the demeanour of such witness
while under examination, under section 363
Cr.P.C.
Thus, if we read the definition of 'evidence' in Article 2(1), clause
(c), and that of "proof" in clauses (4) and (5) of that Article,
together, as we must, it becomes plain that "evidence" is a species
of proof through the medium of witnesses and documents.
So, proof is the result of a consideration of the matters
before the court, and as evidence is one of those matters, evidence
differs from proof as cause from effect, for strictly proof marks the
effect of evidence, and other matters
Burden of Proof;
The expressions 'burden of proof has several meanings.
but there is an agreement among the authorities that it has two
primary meanings:
i)
the legal burden of proof; and
ii)
the evidential burden of proof.
Legal burden of proof:
'Legal burden of proof, also called 'onus of proof.
'onus probandi' or 'probative burden' (as it was called in the
House of Lords case, DPP v Morgan (1976) AC 182) means the
burden of persuasion, an obligation to persuade the court, to a
specified standard of proof [generally speaking. proof_on_balance
of probabilities in civil cases, and proof beyond reasonable doubt,
in criminal cases; see Lord Pearson's speech in Nimmo v
Alexander Cowan and sons (1967) 3 All ER 187); also see
Zakaulla v Muhammad Aslam-1991 SCMR 2126] that the fact in
issue (which is a question of substantive law and the parties'
pleadings e.g. statement of facts in a challan or in a private
complaint in a criminal case) is true. There may be several facts in
issue in a case and the legal burden of proof of different issues may
be on one party or the other. In short, it is the obligation to prove
your case according to the applicable standard. It is the ultimate
burden of proof which if placed by statute upon the prosecution is
discharged on proof beyond reasonable doubt and if placed upon
the accused is discharged on balance of probabilities. (Lord Ackner
in R v Hunt-(1987) 1 All ER 1, 19).
Evidential burden of proof:
It is a misnomer to describe evidential burden as a
burden of proof. As Lord Bingham said in Sheldrake v DPP (2005)
1 All ER 237, 243)-
"An evidential burden is not a burden of
proof. It is a burder of raising, on the
evidence in the case, an issue as to the
matter in question fit for consideration
by the tribunal of fact. If an issue is
properly raised, it is for the prosecutor to
prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that
that ground of exoneration does not avail
the defendant".
440

Page 239
An evidential burden, so said Lord Ackner in R v Hunt (1987) 1
All ER 1, 18), is-
"an obligation to establish through
evidence from the prosecution and/or
evidence from the defence that there is
material which raises such a defence, so
that it becomes a live issue in the case".
Though, evidential burden may not be a burden of proof,
yet, the question whether a statutory burden is or is not a burden of
proof in the strict sense and whether it is merely an evidential
burden, assumes importance when the statutory provision in
question is tested on the touchstone of the right to be presumed
innocent, such as the one under Article 6(2) of European
Convention and the one under the 'due process clause' of the
American Constitution. Some of the relevant cases will be
discussed below.
Burden of proof in criminal cases:
The governing principle of the English Criminal Law,
memorably affirmed by Viscount Sankey LC in Woolmington v
DDP (1935) AC 462, 481: (1935) All ER 1, 8) is that the onus lies
upon the prosecution in a criminal trial to prove all the elements of
the offence with which the accused is charged. This principle has
been regarded as supremely important but not as absolute. Viscount
Sankey in Woolmington acknowledged the authority of
M'Naghten's case (1843-60) All ER 229) which had definitely and
exceptionally placed an onus on the accused to establish a defence
of insanity. He further acknowledged that his statement of principle
was 'subject also to any statutory exception'. (Lord Bingham in
Sheldrake v DDP-(2005) 1 All ER 237, 244).
The Woolmington case was concerned with the
constituent elements of the crime of murder. The facts were
unusual. The appellant went to his mother-in-law's house where his
442
wife, following a quarrel with him, had gone to stay. He went there
to persuade her to return but he killed her with a shot from a gun
which he had fastened with a wire under his coat. He claimed that
he had carried the gun with a view to threatening to commit suicide
and that as he tried to use it for this purpose it went off accidentally
and killed his wife. In the classic words of Viscount Sankey LC:
"If it is proved that the conscious act of
the prisoner killed a man and nothing
else appears in the case, there is
evidence upon which the jury may, not
must, find him guilty of murder. It is
difficult to conceive so bare and meager
a case, but that does not mean that the
is
the
not still on
..it is not till
prosecution...
onus
the end of the evidence that a verdict can
properly be found and that at the end of
the evidence it is not for the prisoner to
establish his innocence but for the
prosecution to establish his guilt. Just as
there is evidence on behalf of the
prosecution, so there may be evidence
on behalf of the prisoner which may
cause a doubt as to his guilt. In either
case, he is entitled to the benefit of the
doubt. But while the prosecution must
prove the guilt of the prisoner, there is
no such burden laid on the prisoner to
prove his innocence and it is sufficient
for him to raise a doubt as to his guilt; he
is not bound to satisfy the jury of his
innocence.
443

Page 240
Throughout the web of the English
criminal law one golden thread is always
to be seen that it is the duty of the
prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt
subject to what I have already said as to
the defence of insanity and subject also
to any statutory exception. If, at the end
of and on the whole of the case, there is
a reasonable doubt, created by the
evidence given by either the prosecution
or the prisoner, as to whether the
prisoner killed the deceased with a
malicious intention, the prosecution has
not made out the case and the prisoner is
entitled to an acquittal. No matter what
the charge or where the trial, the
principle that the prosecution must prove
the guilt of the prisoner is part of the
common law of England and no attempt
to whittle it down can be
entertained...
As was held in R v Edwards (1974) 2 All ER 1085), there are
according to Woolmington two exceptions to the fundamental rule
of the English criminal law that the prosecution must prove every
element of the alleged offence. The first relates to insanity and the
second to those cases in which a statute expressly imposes a burden
of proof upon an accused. Woolmington was not concerned to
consider the nature of a statutory defence or on whom the burden
of proving it might lie; it did not lay down a rule that the burden of
proving a statutory defence only lay on the defendant if the statute
specifically so provided. (Lord Griffith in R'v Hunt (1987) ! All
ER 1, 7, 10).
Cases in which the burden is placed on the defendant
and not, as ordinarily in criminal proceedings, on the prosecutor.
are called cases of 'reverse burden'. (Lord Bingham in Sheldrake v
DPP-(2005) | All ER 237, 243).
In R v Edwards (1974) 2 All ER 1085), the defendant
was accused of selling by retail intoxicating liquor without holding
a justices' license authorizing such a sale contrary to section
160(1)(b) of the Licensing Act 1964, and the question was whether
the section placed the burden of proof, by necessary implication.
upon the defendant that he held the necessary license, and was that
burden legal or evidential only. Lawton LJ held that there was a
line of authority establishing -
"that over the centuries the common law,
as a result of experience and the need to
ensure that justice is done both to the
community and to defendants, has
evolved an exception to the fundamental
rule of our criminal law that the
prosecution must prove every element of
the offence charged. The exception, like
so much else in the common law, was
hammered out on the anvil of pleading.
It is limited to offences arising under
enactments which prohibit the doing of
an act save in specified circumstances or
by persons of specified classes or with
specified qualifications or with the
license or permission of specified
authorities.......... In our judgment
its application does not depend upon
either the fact or the presumption that
the defendant has peculiar knowledge
enabling him to prove the positive of any
negative averment
The conclusion reached was that-
444
445

Page 241
"Two consequences follow from the
view we have taken as to the evolution
and nature of this exception. First, as it
comes into operation upon an enactment,
being construed in a particular way,
there is no need for the prosecution to
prove a prima facie case of lack of
excuse, qualification or the like; and
secondly, what shifts is the onus: it is for
the defendant to prove that he was
entitled to do the prohibited act. What
rests on him is the legal or as it is
sometimes called the persuasive burden
of proof. It is not the evidential burden",
R v Edwards was approved in the House of Lords
decision in R v Hunt (1987) 1 All ER 1, 11). In Hunt, as in
Edwards, the legislature had made no express provision as to the
burden of proof, and the court had to construe the relevant
provision to find on whom the legal burden was intended to lie.
Lord Ackner said:
"It is of course axiomatic that a statute
may impose on the accused the burden
of proof of a particular defence to a
statutory offence and may do so either
expressly or by necessary implication.
Whichever method Parliament uses it
has created a 'statutory exception' and
there is no difference in the quality or
status of such an exception....
In rejecting, the contention that the burden in such cases should be
an evidential burden only, Lord Ackner (at pp 18, 19) gave the
following reasons:
and
"(i) It is accepted that, when Parliament
by express words provides that the proof
of the excuse shall lie on the accused,
the legal burden of proof, that is to say.
the ultimate burden of proof, is placed
on the defendant and that is discharged
on the balance of probabilities. It cannot
logically follow that if, ex hypothesi,
Parliament has, by necessary
implication, placed the burden on the
accused the weight of that burden would
be quite different. (ii) The hypothesis is
that by necessary implication Parliament
has provided in a statute that proof of a
particular exculpatory matter shall lie on
the accused. However, the discharge of
an evidential burden proves nothing: it
merely raises an issue. Accordingly, the
mere raising of an issue by the defence
would not satisfy the obligation which
Parliament has imposed.....
In Sheldrake v DPP (2005) 1 All ER 237, two
provisions, (i) section 5(2) of the (English) Road Traffic Act, 1988,
(ii) section 11(1) of the (English) Terrorism Act, 2000,
were under consideration. Both imposed the burden of proof on the
accused and the question was whether having regard to the
presumption of innocence in Article 6(2) of the European
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms, 1950, as set out in the (English) Human Rights Act,
1998, those provisions should be read down so as to hold that the
burden was not the legal burden of proof but evidential burden
only. In other words, the legal burden of proof infringed the
presumption of innocence right of the accused. It was held that as
regard the burden under section 5(2) of the Road Traffic Act, the
burden was a legal burden of proof to be discharged on balance of
probabilities, but that the one under the Terrorism Act was an
evidential burden only. To quote Lord Bingham:

the
"The right to a fair trial has long been
recognized in England and Wales,
although the conditions necessary to
achieve faimess have evolved, in some
Iways quite radically, over the years and
continue to evolve. The presumption of
innocence has also been recognized
since at least the early nineteenth
century, although...
presumption has not been uniformly
treated by Parliament as absolute and
unqualified. There can be no doubt that
the underlying rationale of
presumption in domestic law and the
the
convention is an essentially simple one,
that it is repugnant to ordinary notions of
faimess for a prosecutor to accuse a
defendant of crime and for the defendant
to be then required to disprove the
accusation on pain of conviction and
punishment if he fails to do so. The
closer a legislative provision approaches
to that situation, the more objectionable
it is likely to be
it has
been repeatedly recognized that the
presumption of innocence is one of the
elements of the fair criminal trial
required by Article 6(1)...
In that behalf, reference was made to the European Court of
Human Rights' decision in Salabiaku v France (1988) 13 EH RR
379) for the indications it gives of the correct approach in
principle:
Presumptions of fact and law

the Convention does not prohibit such
the
presumptions in principle...
object and purpose of Article 6, which,
by protecting the right to a fair trial and
in particular the right to be presumed
innocent, is intended to enshrine the
fundamental principle of the rule of law.
Article 6(2) does not therefore regard
presumptions of fact or of law provided
in the criminal law with indifference".
Presumption of Innocence
As to what does the principle of the presumption of innocence
require, reference was made to another European Court case.
Barbera v Spain (1989) 11 EH RR 360, 387) -
"Paragraph 2 embodies the principle of
the presumption of innocence. It
requires, inter alia, that when carrying
out their duties, the members of a court
should not start with the preconceived
idea that the accused has committed the
offence charged; the burden of proof is
on the prosecution, and any doubt should
benefit the accused. It also follows that it
is for the prosecution to inform the
accused of the case that will be made
against him, so that he may prepare and
present his defence accordingly, and to
adduce evidence sufficient to convict
him".
We have seen in the Constitutional Criminal Procedure
Part of this book that the US Supreme Court has described the
'presumption of innocence as the bedrock axiomatic and
elementary principle whose enforcement lies at the foundation of
the administration of justice. (See, among others, Re Winship
449
448

397 US 358-1970); the burden of proof, it was held, lies on the
prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
As in the UK and the USA, the governing principle in
Pakistan also is that the accused is presumed to be innocent and
that the onus lies upon the prosecution to prove all the elements of
the offence with which the accused is charged. This principle is
supremely important but is not an absolute principle. (See, among
others, Ghulam Muhammad v State 1980 P Cri J 1039; State v
Farman-PLD 1995 SC 1. 11; Abdul Mateen case - PLD 2006 SC
538).
In Safdar Ali v Crown (PLD 1953 FC 93) Shahabuddin
J. held that-
"It is the main principle of criminal law
that an accused person must be
presumed to be innocent unless and until
it is established by the prosecution
beyond reasonable doubt that he or she,
as the case may be, is guilty".
Provisions in the Qanun:
The provisions bearing on "burden of proof are to be
found in Chapter IX, Articles 117 to 129, of the Qanun.
Article 117, clause (2), defines the "burden of proof":
"When a person is bound to prove the
existence of any fact, it is said that the
burden of proof lies on that person".
Articles 117(1), 118 and 119 enact, as Monir in his "Law of
Evidence" observes different aspects of the same rule as to on
whom the burden of proof lies.
450
By Article 117(1)-
"Whoever desires any court to give
judgment as to any legal right or liability
dependent on the existence of facts
which he asserts, must prove that those
facts exist".
This is well explained by illustration (a) to Article 117. A desires a
court to give judgment that B should be punished for a crime which
A asserts B has committed; A must prove that B has committed the
crime.
The reference in Article 117 to "legal right or liability"
is obviously a reference to the substantive law, that is, the rights
and liabilities including criminal liabilities created by the
substantive law.
Thus, under Article 117, burden of proof means the
obligation to persuade as a matter of (i) substantive law, that is to
say, the ingredients of the offence under the law which defines and
punishes it, must be established, and (ii) the pleadings, in a
criminal case for example the facts alleged in the challan or the
complaint.
In the words of Comelius J. in Safdar Ali. "it is
undeniable that finally the burden lies upon the prosecution to
prove each ingredient of the offence charged", and "the burden of
the general issue is on the prosecution from beginning to end
..". Thus, the onus to prove the guilt of an accused is
always on the prosecution because the accused is presumed to be
innocent. (State v Farman PLD 1995 SC 1. 11: Rab Nawaz v
State-PLD 1994 SC 858).
Now, since the burden of proof, as in the above
illustration, is on A, he must lead evidence as to the facts alleged
by him to prove that B committed the alleged offence. It is plain
451
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 244
that if he leads no evidence at all, he must fail. This is the principle
enacted by Article 118:
"The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that
person who would fail if no evidence at all were given
on either side",
The word 'proceeding' includes criminal proceeding and
the word 'liability' includes criminal liability; the rule therefore
applies both to civil and criminal cases.
Article 119 puts the same idea as is embodied in Article
117(1) in another way: "The burden of proof as to any particular
fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its
existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact
lies on any particular person". This applies equally to the
prosecutor and the person accused. The two illustrations to this
Article exemplify this position. (a) A prosecutes B for theft and
wishes the court to believe that B admitted the theft to C. The onus
to prove the admission is on A. Otherwise too, as a prosecutor, the
burden to prove that B committed the theft is on A and one piece of
prosecution evidence can be the confession of B. (b) B wishes the
court to believe that at the time of an incident he was elsewhere,
that is, so far away from the place of the incident that he could not
possibly participate in the incident. This is what is called plea of
alibi, and its burden is obviously upon B.
When the statutory burden is on accused:
In cases of 'reverse burden' (reverse because the burden
is placed on the defendant and not, as ordinarily in criminal
proceedings, on the prosecutor - see Sheldrake, p 243, per Lord
Bingham), the statutory burden of proof may be placed upon the
defendant expressly or by necessary implication, that being a
matter of interpretation of the provision in question. As was held in
Edwards (1974) 2 All ER 1085; approved in Hunt (1987) 1 All ER
1. both being cases of burden of proof by necessary implication]
452
"whichever method Parliament uses, it has created a statutory
exception and there is no difference in the quality or status of such
an exception.......".
Unlike America, and the countries governed by the
European Convention. 'presumption of innocence" has not been
accorded a constitutional status in Pakistan, and it has been held
(See Khan Asfandyar Wali v Federation - PLD 2001 SC) that the
placing of burden of proof in certain cases upon the accused is not
violative of any provision of the Constitution. Even when the right
to be presumed innocent appears on its face to be an absolute
requirement, it has been held that it does not prohibit rules which
transfer the burden to the accused to establish a defence, provided
the overall burden of proof remains on the prosecution, nor does it
necessarily prohibit presumptions of law or fact provided these are
within reasonable limits. (Brown v Scott (2001) 2 All ER 97.
105).
Article 121 of the Qanun (which is an exact reproduction
of section 105 of the Evidence Act, 1872), is a general statutory
provision expressly placing the burden of proof upon the accused.
It reads:
"When a person is accused of any
offence, the burden of proving the
existence of circumstances bringing the
case within any of the General
Exceptions in the Pakistan Penal
Code.or within any special
exception or proviso contained in any
other part of the same Code, or in any
law defining the offence, is upon him.
and the court shall presume the absence
of such circumstances".
Chapter IV of the Pakistan Penal Code comprising
sections 76 to 106, contains the General Exceptions within the
453

Page 245
meaning of Article 121 of the Qanun. Of them, Articles 82 and 83
create exceptions in favour of children. Article 84 is an exception
regarding a person of unsound mind, the leading case on this
subject being M'Naghten (1843-60) All ER 229), and sections 96
to 106 which provide for the right of private defence in its various
forms. Section 96 reads:
"Nothing is an offence which is done in
the exercise of the right of private
defence".
The leading case on this subject is Safdar Ali v Crown
(PLD 1953 FC 93) in which Safdar Ali was accused of murder; he
had, during the course of the incident, received a serious knife
injury in the thigh and had pleaded that he had caused injuries to
the deceased man in self defence. Before the Federal Court
reference was made to section 105 of the Evidence Act, 1872, (now
Article 121 of the Qanun) read with the definitions of 'proved" and
'not proved", and to the Woolmington case and the question was
what was the burden of proof on the accused under section 105
(Article 121). Chief Justice Abdul Rashid, in his short concurring
note, encapsulated the law in the following words:
the decision in the case of
Woolmington v Director of Public
Prosecutions is in no way inconsistent
with the provisions of section 105 of the
Evidence Act. In a criminal case it is the
duty of the court to review the entire
evidence that has been produced by the
prosecution and the defence. If, after an
examination of the whole evidence, the
court is of opinion that there is a
reasonable possibility that the defence
put forward by the accused might be
true, it is clear that such a view reacts on
the whole prosecution case. In these
circumstances, the accused is entitled to
the benefit of doubt, not as a matter of
grace, but as of right, because the
prosecution has not proved its case
beyond reasonable doubt".
In the opinion of the learned Chief Justice, "section
105......has been enacted in order to make it clear that it is not the
duty of the prosecution to examine all possible defenses that might
be taken on behalf of the accused and to prove that none of those
defenses would be of any assistance to him. The principles laid
down in Woolmington's case are applicable with full force in spite
of the provisions of section 105.....
Cornelius J. in his detailed judgment, felt satisfied that
"in cases like the present, there is no material difference between
the application of the standard of proof required under Pakistan
Law and that which underlies the rule of 'reasonable doubt' which
obtains in the English Courts. It is undeniable that finally the
burden lies upon the prosecution to prove each ingredient of the
offence charged, i.e. to support each ingredient by such evidence as
would justify action by a prudent man, on the basis that such
ingredient is established. He went on to say:
"I do not see any appreciable
difference between this duty, and the
duty of proving each ingredient beyond
'reasonable doubt". If then an accused
person is able to establish by evidence.
or if the prosecution evidence presents
such features as go to establish the
existence of a reasonable doubt
regarding an essential ingredient of the
offence charged, such as the requisite
intention in a case of murder, then the
prosecution must necessarily fail. Such
intention may, of course, be established
454

by proof of circumstances surrounding
an evident act of cruelty causing death
and need not necessarily be proved by
direct evidence. Yet, it must be admitted
that where the only credible evidence of
11 direct nature. relevant to the
determination of intention is furnished
by the accused person himself, who
adduces acts in avoidance of the charge
of murder, it requires very strong
circumstances indeed of a
sufficient to exclude the possibility of
the defence plea being true in order to
provide the preponderance of probability
necessary for a prudent man to act on the
footing that the accused's act was
performed with the sole intention of
killing, or of causing a necessarily fatal
injury.
nature
It is, of course, not possible to arrive at
any conclusion that the accused person
acted as he alleged he did, on a
consideration of his statement alone. It is
necessary to place his evidence
alongside all the other evidence and
circumstances appearing in the case, and
only then can a court be in a position to
weigh the testimony and the
probabilities with the requisite degree of
thoroughness before reaching its
conclusion. The process by which the
court at the close of the case assesses the
evidence and circumstances in relation
to the charges preferred by the
prosecution is precisely similar. Clearly,
as necessary to place the defence version
and its supporting evidence and
circumstances in juxtaposition to the
prosecution case for the proper
estimation of the extent to which the
charge may be held to have been proved,
as it is to examine the prosecution case
side by side with the defence case in
reaching a decision on the accused's
special pleading........
Safdar Ali was followed, among others, in Nadeem-ul-Haq v State
(1985 SCMR 510), Rab Nawaz v State (PLD 1994 SC 858), which
was a case under a Hadd Law namely Prohibition (Enforcement of
Hadd) Order, 1979 and Abdul Haque v State (PLD 1996 SC I); it
was applied and explained in State v Mushtaq Ahmad (PLD 1973
SC 418). In Mushtaq Ahmad, the accused had not specifically
raised the plea of self-defence; he did not admit the causing of the
stab wound to the deceased. Referring to Safdar Ali case and the
case of Muhammad Aslam v Crown (PLD 1953 FC 115),
Muhammad Gul J. speaking for the court, observed that-
"in both cases the pleas of self-defence
were not only specifically raised but
evidence was also led in support thereof
though such evidence was found, in each
case, to be inadequate to bring the cases
under the general exception. It was in
that context that the learned Judges of
the Federal Court laid down the rule that
in a criminal case even if the plea of
self-defence has failed, nevertheless the
court was bound to take into account all
the facts appearing on the record
including the evidence led for the
defence with a view to finding out
456
457
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 247
whether as a result of such review the
prosecution case has been affected with
a reasonable doubt, in which case the
accused will be entitled to its benefit".
To the question "whether on the facts of the instant case
a foundation was laid for application of the rule in Safdar Ali's
case", the answer, it was held, must be in the negative:
"As pointed out already the respondent
did not specifically raise a plea of self-
defence, nor did he produce any
evidence in his defence. Therefore, the
possibility of any 'reaction on the
prosecution case is excluded altogether".
Burden on accused under Special Laws:
There are a number of special laws placing the burden of
proof of some facts on, or raising a presumption against, the
accused; prominent among them are the anti-corruption laws in
which receipt of tainted money by the accused shifts the burden on
him to explain how he received the money. A respectable body of
case-law has accumulated round those laws, (See for example.
Muhammad Siddiq v State 1977 SCMR 503; Ghulam Ali v State
- PLD 1963 (WP) Kar. 582; Ghulam Muhammad v State = 1980 P
Cri J 1039). In Khan Asfandyar Wali v Federation (PLD 2001 SC
607), the law in question was the National Accountability Bureau
Ordinance, 1999, which placed the burden of certain facts upon the
person accused. In Sikandar A. Karim case (1995 SCMR 387),
section 156 of the Customs Act, 1969, provided that where goods
specified in clause (s) of section 2 of the Act were seized in the
belief that an act to defraud the Government of any duty was
committed, the burden to prove that no such act was committed
was on the accused. The accused was held to discharge the initial
burden of showing that the goods were neither smuggled nor was
458
their possession unlawful. The overall burden to prove that the
accused was guilty remained on the prosecution.
Burden to prove facts especially within one's knowledge:
Article 122 of the Qanun provides;
"When any fact is especially within the
knowledge of any person, the burden of
proving that fact is upon him".
We have, in considering the rule enacted in Article 121, noticed R
v Edwards in which the defendant was convicted of selling by
retail intoxicating liquor without holding a justices license
authorizing such a sale. The statutory prohibition of acts, otherwise
than under license granted by government, was a commonplace of
life during the war years 1939 to 1945. The question as to who was
to prove lack of license has been answered as follows. If on its true
construction an enactment prohibits the doing of an act in specified
circumstances, the accused must, by way of exception to the
fundamental rule of the criminal law that the prosecutor must
establish every element of the offence charged, prove the existence
of the specified circumstances. For example, if the charge is that a
person was selling sugar without license, where license was
necessary, the burden to prove that he had the license is on the
accused and not on the prosecution. Or, as the illustration (b) to
Article 122 reads:
"A is charged with traveling on a
railway without a ticket. The burden of
proving that he had a ticket is on him".
But this rule is not based on the premise of special or
peculiar knowledge of the accused. "There is not, and never has
been, a general rule that the mere fact that a matter lies peculiarly
within the knowledge of the defendant is sufficient to cast the onus
on him. If there was any such rule, anyone charged with doing an
459
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 248
unlawful act with a specified intent would find himself having to
prove his innocence because if there ever was a matter which could
be said to be peculiarly within a person's knowledge it is the state
of his own mind". (Lawton LJ in R v Edwards (1974) 2 All ER
1085).
Right to begin:
In one sense, 'burden of proof also means introducing
evidence. This depends on the allocation of the burden of proof.
The right to begin is in the party who bears the burden of proof. In
criminal cases, as for example under sections 244 and 265F of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, the right to begin is in the
prosecution, because, as we have seen, the burden to prove the guilt
of the accused is on the prosecution.
Standard of proof:
Though the expression 'standard of proof has not been
used in the Qanun, there is no doubt that it is laid down in its
Article 2, clauses (4) and (5), in the definitions of the expressions
"proved' and 'not proved' respectively.
While burden of proof is the burden of persuasion,
standard of proof is the degree or measure of persuasion required
of the party on whom the burden of proof lies. For a trier of fact,
the question is that, in view of the nature of the issue before him,
how convinced he must be to be convinced that the fact in question
is proved. He will ask himself the question: how sure should I be
before I decide the case in favour of one party or the other? The
appropriate confidence level depends on what is at stake in the
proceedings. ("Criminal Evidence" by Paul Roberts and Andrian
Zuckerman, p 351).
"Standard of proof is also known as "quantum of
proof. For example, (1) the Hadood Laws prescribe the number
of witnesses required to prove offences punishable with Hadood
460
punishments: (2) Article 17(2)(a) of the Qanun, requires that "in
matters pertaining to financial or future obligations, if reduced to
writing, the instrument shall be attested by two men, or one man
and two women, so that one may remind the other, if necessary.
and evidence shall be led accordingly"; and (iii) Article 79 of the
Qanun lays down that "if a documents is required by law to be
attested, it shall not be used as evidence until two attesting
witnesses at least have been called for the purpose of proving its
execution, if there be two attesting witnesses alive and subject to
the process of the court and capable of giving evidence"
Required standard of proof:
The law may require different standards of proof or
persuasion in different fact-situations. For example, Article 23 of
the Qanun provides that where there is "reasonable ground to
believe" that two or more persons have conspired, then anything
said or done by one of such persons is a relevant fact. Section 497
Cr. P. C. provides that a person shall not be released on bail if there
appear "reasonable grounds for believing" that he has been guilty
of an offence punishable with death etc. These expressions
"reasonable ground to believe" and "reasonable grounds for
believing" mean that there exists a prima facie case. (See Niamat
Singh v State ILR 2 All 25 and other cases considered in Z A
Bhutto case PLD 1979 SC 53, paras 106 to 115 in the judgment of
the Chief Justice). They do not mean, as we shall see, the same
thing as the expression "believes it to exist" in Article 2, clauses
(4) and (5), of the Qanun.
In laying down the standard of proof, the Qanun in its
Article 2, clauses (4) and (5), does not prescribe one standard of
proof for criminal cases and another for civil cases. What it says is.
to quote from clause (4), that -
A fact is said to be proved when, after considering the
matters before it, the court either -
461
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 249
(i)
(ii)
believes it to exist; or
considers its existence so probable that a
prudent man ought, under the circumstances
of the particular case, to act upon the
supposition that it exits.
This definition and the definition of 'not proved' in clause (5)
visualize two kinds of cases:
(i)
(ii)
Cases in which the matters before the court
induce in its mind an absolute, almost
mathematical certainty - a belief that the fact
in question exists;
But
human knowledge has inherent
limitations, and absolute certainty is seldom
to be had in the affairs of life. (Emperor v
Ram Dat 143 IC 129; 133 O. 340;
Prasannamayi case 1922 Cal. 260). As
Viscount Sankey LC said in Woolmington-
"If it is proved that the conscious act of
the prisoner killed a man and nothing
else appears in the case, there is
evidence upon which the jury may, not
must, find him guilty........ It is difficult
to conceive so bare and meager a case
The same idea was re-echoed in the judgment of Cornelius J. in
Safdar Ali:
"The answer is simple enough if the
court finds it possible to believe the case
for one side and disbelieve the case for
the other, but ordinarily, in human
affairs such as give rise to cases of this
kind, things are much more evenly
divided".
And in the American case of Re Winship (397 US 358; 25 L. Ed 2d
368). Justice Harlan referred to the proposition which cannot "be
fairly disputed", namely -
in a judicial proceeding in which
there is a dispute about the facts of some
earlier event, the fact-finder cannot
acquire unassailable accurate knowledge
of what happened.....".
Therefore, if the evidence is not of such a quality as to induce
absolute certainty, then the law, as laid down in clauses (4) and (5)
of Article 2, allows the court to decide on probabilities - the court
may, after considering the matters before it, consider the existence
of the fact in question so probable that a prudent man ought to act
on the supposition that it exists. Here, the court is the spokesman of
an ordinary prudent man. The test is whether an ordinary prudent
man will, on the material before him, hold the disputed fact proved.
That is why in the Anglo-American system, the questions of fact
are left to the jury, a panel of layman, not lawyers.
As was said by Muhammad Afzal Zullah J. in State v
Habibur Rehman (PLD 1983 SC 280, 289):
"Circumstantial deduction reaching
"probability is a mental cognition which
leads to 'supposition" regarding
existence of a fact. This the law permits
as an alternative to positive 'belief in its
existence. Probability is not lower than
likelihood which is higher than a mere
possibility a surmise to distinguish a
462
463
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 250
probability from conjecture and even
possibility........
In the words of Justice Harlan in Re Winship, if the fact-finder
cannot acquire "unassailably accurate knowledge of what
happened", then-
all that the fact-finder can
acquire is a belief of what probably
happened. The intensity of this belief-
the degree to which a fact-finder is
convinced that a given act actually
occurred can, of course, vary. In this
regard, a standard of proof represents an
attempt to instruct the fact-finder
concerning the degree of confidence our
society thinks he should have in the
correctness of factual conclusion for a
particular type of adjudication".
Although, the definitions of 'proved' and 'not proved' govern both
the criminal and civil cases, and the law of evidence does not lay
down one standard for one type of cases and a different standard
for another type, yet, the courts have evolved two basic standards:
(1)
(2)
standard of proof on balance of probabilities-
also called preponderance of evidence;
standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
The authority to so evolve these standards is implicit in the courts'
general power to decide which is recognized by the Constitution.
Articles 189 and 201. These Articles lay down that a decision of
the Supreme Court or as the case may be of a High Court, to the
extent that it...
.... is based upon or enunciates a principle
of law shall be binding. If an express authority is needed, it is to be
found in the words "under the circumstances of the particular case"
464
in the definitions of 'proved" and "not proved". As was said in
Hornal v Neuberger Products (1956) 3 All ER 970)-
the standard of proof depends
on the nature of the issue. The more
serious the allegation the higher the
that is
of probability
degree
required......
Standard required in civil and criminal cases:
In general, in ordinary civil cases, the required standard
of proof is preponderance of probabilities, and in criminal cases it
is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Muhammad Ibrahim v
Muhammkad Sharif 1980 CLC 296: Zakaullah Khan v
Muhammad Aslam-1991 SCMR 2126).
The reason for different standards of proof in civil as
opposed to criminal litigation was explained in Re Winship (397
US 358; 25 L Ed 2d 368) by Justice Harlan as follows:
"In a civil suit between two private
parties for money damages, for example.
we view it as no more serious in general
for there to be an erroneous verdict in
the plaintiff's favour. A preponderance
of the evidence standard therefore seems
peculiarly appropriate for, as explained
most sensibly, it simply requires the trier
of fact 'to believe that the existence of a
fact is more probable than its non-
existence before he may find in favour
of the party who has the burden to
persuade the Judge of the fact's
existence.
465

Page 251
In a criminal case, on the other hand, we
do not view the social disutility of
convicting an
innocent
man
as
equivalent to the disutility of acquitting
someone who is guilty..
In this context, I view the requirement of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a
criminal case as bottomed on
fundamental value determination of our
society that it is far worse to convict an
innocent man than to let a guilty man go
free.........
The rule is not absolute:
The above statement is subject to the qualification that
there is no absolute standard in either case. We have seen that
when the law places a legal burden of proof upon a person accused
of a criminal offence, the burden upon him is to be discharged by
preponderance rule as opposed to the burden of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt upon the prosecution. (See e.g. Safdar Ali (PLD
1953 SC 53): Hunt -(1987) 1 All ER 1; and Sheldrake - (2005) 1
All ER 237). Then, in a civil case of divorce on ground of cruelty
(Bater v Bater (1950) 2 All ER 458), as also on ground of
adultery (Preston-Jones (1951) 1 All ER 124), the burden of
proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. In Rashid Ahmad v President
(PLD 1994 SC 36, 45). proceedings which entailed disqualification
from being elected as a member of an Assembly were proceedings
of civil nature, yet the benefit of doubt rule, was applied.
Meanings of the two standards:
We have already noticed the American case of Re
Winship, which declared:
"Lest there remain any doubt about the
constitutional stature of the reasonable -
doubt standard, we explicitly hold that
Due Process Clause protects the accused
against conviction except upon proof
beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact
necessary to constitute the crime with
which he is charged".
That case, as we have noticed, also explained the reasons for the
two different standards and in the process their meanings.
In Miller v Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All ER 372.
Lord Denning, in explaining the preponderance standard, observed:
"If at the end of the case the evidence
turns the scale definitely one way or the
other, the tribunal must decide
accordingly. This means that the case
must be decided in favour of the man
unless the evidence against him reaches
the same degree of cogency as is
required to discharge a burden in a civil
case. That degree is well settled. If must
carry a reasonable degree of probability
but not so high as is required in a
criminal case. If the evidence is such that
the tribunal can say: "we think it more
probable than not" the burden is
discharged, but if the probabilities are
equal, it is not".
Thus, the balance of probability standard requires the party who
has the burden to show that it is more likely than not that his case is
true. The court, so to say. puts the evidence of one side in one scale
of justice and the evidence of the other, in the other scale of justice,
and sees which way the balance tilts.

"Beyond reasonable doubt" is a time-honoured phrase
as was noticed in Re Winship by Justice Brennan. "it is now
accepted in common law jurisdictions as the measure of persuasion
by which the prosecution must convince the trier of fact of all the
essential elements of guilt; it is a prime instrument for reducing the
risk of convictions resting on factual error...... a person accused
of a crime........ would be at a severe disadvantage, a disadvantage
amounting to a lack of fundamental fairness, if he could be
adjudged guilty and imprisoned for years on the strength of the
same evidence as would suffice in a civil case". As we have seen, it
was explained and reinforced in Viscount Sankey's most famous
and frequently quoted golden thread passage in the English
Criminal Jurisprudence in Woolmington (followed in Safdar Ali
which passage is often referred by the English lawyers as shorthand
for the burden and standard of proof in criminal proceedings.
Yet, there is no universally agreed definition of "beyond
reasonable doubt". As the authors of the American Jurisprudence
point out, the courts at one time defined it in terms of "important
life decision", "the proof be so convincing that an ordinary person
would be willing to make the most important decisions in his or her
own life", and by equating it to a moral certainty. In Sandoval v
California (1994) it was said that it is that state of the case which,
after the entire comparison and consideration of entire evidence
leave the minds of the jurors in that they cannot say they feel an
abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge.
In England, in one case - Rv Yap Chuan Chin (1976) 63 Cr. App.
R 7), the judge defined a reasonable doubt as one "for which you
could give reasons if you were asked"; the Court of Appeal
disapproved it. So despaired was Lord Goddard CJ of an exact
definition of the phrase that he suggested in R v Summers (1952)
36, Cr. App.R.14; (1952) I AIIER 1059) that the phrase should be
abandoned altogether. And in Khawaja (1984) AC 74) where the
question was whether proof beyond reasonable doubt or proof on
balance of probabilities was the appropriate standard in
applications for habeas corpus, Lord Scarman said:
M
I have come to the
conclusion that the choice between the
two standards is not of any great
moment. It is largely a matter of
words".
The question at the end of the day is that a case is either proved or
not proved in accordance with the standard appropriate to the case
before the court. As was said in an Australian case - Rajfek (1965)
112 CLR 517)-
"The difference between the criminal
standard of proof and the civil standard
of proof is no matter of words. It is a
matter of critical substance..........
And Dixon CJ said in another Australian case - Dawson (1961)
106 CLR 1)-
"it is a mistake to depart from the time-
honoured formula. It is, I think, used by
ordinary people and understood well
enough by the average man in the
community....".
"Beyond reasonable doubt" is not the only phrase or
expression in law which is insusceptible of an exact definition.
There are many other such expressions such as negligence. It is a
fallacy to think, so said Lord Reid in Ridge v Baldwin - (1963) 2
All ER 66, 71) in which the phrase under consideration was
"natural justice", that because something cannot be cut and dried or
nicely weighed or measured therefore it does not exist.
We think that a fairly good idea of the meaning of the
phrase can be had from Lord Denning's following observations in
Miller v Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All ER 372) -
468

"It need not reach certainty, but it must
carry a high degree of probability. Proof
beyond reasonable doubt does not mean
proof beyond the shadow of a doubt. The
law would fail to protect the community
if it admitted fanciful possibilities to
deflect the course of justice. If the
evidence is so strong against a man as to
leave only a remote possibility in his
favour which can be dismissed with the
sentence: 'of course it is possible, but
not in the least probable', the case is
proved beyond reasonable doubt, but
nothing short of that will suffice".
The following two cases decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan
shed considerable light on the subject.
In State v Mushtaq Ahmad (PLD 1973 SC 418, 430).
Muhammad Gul J. said:
"Law allows to persons accused of
criminal offences the benefit of
'reasonable and not of imaginary
doubts. What is a reasonable doubt is not
a question of law; it is essentially a
question of human judgment by a
prudent person to be formed in each
case, in the light of day to day
experience in life, after taking into
account fully all the facts and
circumstances appearing on the record. It
is anti-thesis of haphazard approach.or
reaching fitful decision in a case".
470
In State v Manzoor Ahmad (PLD 1966 SC 664, 680), a
case resting upon circumstantial evidence only, Hamoodur Rehman
J. said:
"It is also equally well settled that the
circumstances sought to be relied upon
must have been established beyond all
doubt. But this only means reasonable
doubt i.e. doubt such as would assail a
reasonable mind and not any and every
kind of doubt and much less a doubt
conjured up by pre-conceived
notions..
That the difference between the preponderance standard and
reasonable doubt standard is one of "critical substance" may be
illustrated by the following cases.
In Re Winship, a 12-year-old boy was charged with
stealing money, and was tried under a statute which prescribed the
standard of preponderance of evidence. The trial judge made an
order placing the juvenile in a training school, subject to
confinement for six years. In doing so, the trial judge
acknowledged that if he were to apply the reasonable doubt
standard, the evidence might not establish guilt. The question was
whether proof beyond a reasonable doubt was among the
"essentials of due process and fair treatment". The Court of Appeal
confirmed the order suggesting that there is, in any event, only a
"tenuous difference" between the reasonable doubt and
preponderance standards. In the US Supreme Court, Justice
Brennan rejected the suggestion:
"The suggestion is singularly
unpersuasive. In this very case, the trial
Judge's ability to distinguish between
the two standards enabled him to make a
finding of guilt that he conceded he
471

Page 254
might not have made under the standard
of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
Indeed, the trial judge's action evidences
the accuracy of the observation of
commentators that 'the preponderance
test is susceptible
misinterpretation that it calls on the trier
10 the
of fact merely to perform an abstract
weighing of the evidence in order to
determine which side has produced the
greater quantum, without regard to its
effect in convincing his mind of the truth
of the proposition asserted".
In the same case, Justice Harlan referred to Wigmore's famous
book on Evidence 3 ed (1940), who, in discussing the various
attempts by courts to define how convinced one must be to be
convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, observed: "The truth is that
no one has yet invented or discovered a mode of measurement for
the intensity of human belief. Hence there can be yet no successful
method of communicating intelligibly...a sound method of
self-analysis for one's belief. Notwithstanding Professor
Wigmore's skepticism, said Justice Harlan -
"We have before us a case where the
choice of the standard of proof has made
a difference: the juvenile court judge
below forthrightly acknowledged that he
believed by a preponderance standard of
the evidence, but was not convinced
beyond a reasonable doubt, that
appellant stole $ 112 from the
complainant's pocket book...
There is then the recent American case of O.J. Simpson
-rightly called a tale of two verdicts. O. J. Simpson was tried for
the murder of his wife and another. The trial took about eleven
472
months, and resulted in a verdict of not guilty. On the same facts,
Simpson was sued for damages and the civil action resulted in a
verdict against him and he was held liable to pay heavy damages.
For our purposes, it is sufficient to say that it was the difference in
the standard of proof that made the difference.
THE PRINCIPLE OF BEST EVIDENCE
The principle of "best evidence' is well-established in
English Common Law, it was, as we shall see, implicit in the
Evidence Act, 1872, and is implicit in its successor - the Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984. It requires that the best available evidence of
which the case is susceptible should always be presented. (Murarka
(1978) I SCC 109 and Janki Narayan (2003) 2 SCC 91). It finds
expression, so far as oral evidence is concerned, in Article 71 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984: "Oral evidence must, in all cases
whatever, be direct......" and so far as documentary evidence is
concerned, in Article 75: "Documents must be proved by primary
evidence except in the cases hereinafter mentioned"; "hereinafter
means Article 76, which enumerates the cases in which instead of
primary evidence, secondary evidence may be given. Primary
evidence, so says Article 73, means the document itself produced
for the inspection of the court.
In elaboration of this general principle, Article 71 goes
on to provide that if oral evidence-
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
refers to a fact which could be seen, it must be
the evidence of a witness who says he saw it;
refers to a fact which could be heard, it must
be the evidence of a witness who says he
heard it;
refers to a fact which could be perceived by
any other sense or in any other manner, it
must be the evidence of a witness who says he
perceived it with that sense or in that manner.
473
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 255
(iv)
refers to an opinion or to the grounds on
which that opinion is held, it must be the
evidence of the person who holds that opinion
on those grounds.
The word 'direct' is used, in the law of evidence, in two senses;
one, in contrast to indirect, or hearsay, and the other, in contrast to
circumstantial.
Here, in Article 71, it has been used in the first sense,
that is, in contrast to indirect or hearsay.
The word 'must' emphasizes the mandatory nature of
the rule: Oral evidence must be direct; it must not be indirect or
hearsay. By necessary implication, therefore, indirect or hearsay
oral evidence is excluded; it is not admissible.
In Article 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 (as in its
predecessor provision viz section 60 of the Evidence Act, 1872),
the expression "direct evidence", so observed Monir in his
"invaluable treatise" on the Law of Evidence, 1974 Edition V.I, p.
690 (quoted in Z.. A. Bhutto v State - PLD 1979 SC 53, in para 62),
has been used in the sense of 'original' evidence as distinguished
from 'hearsay evidence. According to Monir, section 60 of the
1872 Act and Article 71 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat enact the general
English rule that "hearsay' is no evidence.
As regards oral evidence referred to at (i), (ii) and (iii)
above, the underlying notion is that a witness should speak only of
facts which he has perceived with one of his five senses. Indeed,
there are exceptions which will be noticed later.
Hearsay
The starting point for the consideration of the hearsay
rule is that the rule presupposes that the evidence in question is
relevant to the fact in issue. If the evidence is irrelevant, it is
inadmissible for that reason. That will obviate the necessity to ask
whether the evidence is hearsay.
The word 'hearsay' was not used in the Evidence Act.
1872; it has not been used in the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 either.
This avoidance to use it seems to be deliberate. The reason is that it
has no exhaustive definition and any definition can, therefore, be
misleading.
It is difficult, said Lord Reid in Myers v Director of
Public Prosecutions, (1965) AC 1001:(1964) I All ER 877) "to
make any general statement about the law of hearsay
evidence which is entirely accurate". As we shall see, in the recent
leading case on the common law hearsay, R v Kearley ((1992) 2
AC 228; (1992) 2 All ER 345)). a decision by a 3:2 majority, one
point of divergence between the majority and the minority of the
Law Lords was whether the evidence in question was hearsay or
not. The majority thought it was and the minority, that it was not.
In simple language, hearsay evidence means evidence at
second hand; anything that is not based on the personal or first-
hand knowledge of the witness. The courts are not to hear second-
hand stories; they must have Zaid's story out of his own mouth, not
Umer's account of what Zaid had to say. Thus, if A gives evidence
that B killed C, and when asked how he knew it, he says, he saw it.
the evidence is admissible, because it is direct evidence of what the
witness perceived with his own unaided senses. But if the witness
replies: "so and so told me", this is hearsay and is inadmissible to
prove its truth.
The distinction between direct and hearsay evidence,
said Anwar-ul-Haq CJ. in Z. A. Bhutto case "is best illustrated by
Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Edition, Volume V, section 1361".
According to the learned author-
"when a witness A on the stand testified,
'B told me that event X occurred', his
testimony may be regarded in two ways:
475
474

(1) he may be regarded as asserting the
event upon his own credit i.e. as a fact to

knowledge to speak to it. (2)
suppose in order to
But
obviate that
objection that we regard A as not
making any assertion about event X (of
which he has no personal knowledge)
but as testifying to the utterance in his
hearing of B's statement as to event X.
To this, A is clearly qualified to testify,
so that no objection can arise on that
score".
In Charles Dicken's "Pickwick Papers". Sam's evidence called for
the Judge's ruling on its admissibility. He admitted that he was in
Pickwick's service:
"Little to do, and plenty to get, 1
suppose", asked Sergeant Buzfuz, with
jocularity:
"Oh, quite enough to get, Sir, as the
soldier said when they ordered him three
hundred and fifty lashes," replied Sam.
"You must not tell me what the soldier
or any other man said, Sir," intercepted
the Judge, "it is not evidence".
Because the precise scope of the rule against hearsay is.
so said Lord Ackner in Kearley, a matter of controversy, there are a
variety of formulations of the rule. In Cross on Evidence (7th ed.
1990. p 42), the rule was thus stated:
"an assertion other than one made by a
witness while giving oral evidence in the
proceedings is inadmissible as evidence
of any act asserted".
This formulation was approved by the House of Lords in R v Sharp
(1988) 1 All ER 65, 68) and was relied on in Kearley.
The best way of understanding the concept of hearsay is
to see how the rule has been applied in decided cases.
R v Gibson (1887) 18 QBD 537) is an example of
classic hearsay. The accused was charged with malicious
wounding, by throwing a stone at the complainant, in the street
where the accused's house was situated. In the evidence, the
complainant stated that just after he had been hit by the stone, a
woman pointed to the door of the accused's house and said: "The
person who threw the stone went in there'. Shortly afterwards the
accused was arrested from that house. He was convicted by the trial
Judge. Lord Coleridge CJ in Court of Appeal held:
I am of opinion that the true
principle which governs the present case
is that it is the duty of the Judge in
criminal trials to take care that the
verdict... is not founded upon any
evidence except that which the law
allows. Here evidence which was at law
inadmissible was allowed to go to the
jury".
Note that the evidence was not described as hearsay; the
reason is that it was well-understood that this was hearsay and
therefore inadmissible.

In Mst. Atkia Begum v Mohammad Ibrahim (AIR 1916
PC 25), which was a suit for restitution of marriage, and in which
the question of fact was whether the appellant, Atkia, was of age
the date of her alleged marriage, which took place at Mecca, and if
so, was the marriage with her consent. According to the Islamic
Law, "a girl becomes a major on the happening of either of two
events; first, the completion of her fifteenth year and second, on
her attaining a state of puberty at an earlier period".
Their Lordships insisted upon 'legal evidence' because-
"it appears to their Lordships that
hearsay evidence-in some cases indeed
mere gossip, wholly inadmissible in its
nature was admitted and treated as
substantive proof of the fact related or
discussed".
They referred to two instances, "one so coarse as to be almost
incredible and the other such a travesty of legitimate methods of
proof as to be comical".
The first was where a witness to the Nikah, Bashir
Ahmad by name, "having taken upon himself to state, in answer to
a question that he knew the appellant to be of age by certain
signs of puberty recognized by Mohammedan Law. When asked
how he knew this, he replied: "through her father". It is difficult to
believe that the girl's father can even have bestowed this
confidence upon the witness; but even if he had done so, the
repetition of what the father said was no evidence whatever of the
substantive fact of the girl's puberty".
The other instance was furnished by the evidence, taken
on commission at Mecca, of one of the witnesses of the plaintiff in
the suit. "After being examined by the person appearing for the
defendant, he was re-examined by the person appearing for the
plaintiff and was asked: Did you hear from anybody that Atkia
Begum was of age? And he replied: I heard it from my wife who
478
heard from the mother of Atkia Begum........ The point is that the
deposition appears to have been read in evidence as it stood.
without any objection having been made to this undoubted
hearsay".
The evil consequences of the admission of such
evidence, their Lordships went on to say, as this is, are-
"not merely that it prolongs litigation
and increases its costs, but that it may
unconsciously be regarded by judicial
minds as corroboration of some piece of
evidence legally admissible and thereby
obtain from the latter quite undue weight
and significance".
The rationale of the rule was stated by Lord Normand in
Taper v R (1952) AC 480, 486):
"It (hearsay) is not the best evidence and
it is not delivered an oath. The
truthfulness and accuracy of the person
whose words are spoken to by another
witness cannot be tested by cross-
examination and the light that his
demeanor would throw on his testimony
is lost".
According to Wigmore on Evidence, vol.5, section 1420, the
hearsay rule is based on the assumption-
sources of
"that many possible
inaccuracy and untrustworthiness which
may be underneath the bare untested
assertion of a witness can best be
brought to light and exposed, if they
exist, by the test of cross-examination".

A small quantity of amphetamine was recovered from his flat,
In Kearley, the accused was charged with drug-dealing
which he shared with his wife and another man, but not in
sufficient quantity to raise the inference that the accused was a
dealer. The accused was arrested and taken to the police station but
the police party remained there for several hours during which time
they intercepted ten telephone calls in which the callers asked to
speak to the accused and asked for drugs. In addition, seven
persons called at the flat asking for the accused and seeking to buy
drugs. At the trial, the prosecution was unable or unwilling to call
the telephone callers or visitors to the flat as witnesses to prove the
charge of drug-dealing; instead, the prosecution proposed to call
the police officials who had intercepted the calls or received the
visitors to prove as a fact that they were customers from which it
could be inferred that the accused was dealing in drugs. The
defence objected that the evidence of the police officials was
hearsay and inadmissible. The Judge overruled the objection and
the accused was convicted. His appeal was dismissed by the Court
of Appeal, but on appeal to the House of Lords, the conviction was,
by a 3:2 majority, set aside, for it was based on the hearsay and
inadmissible evidence of the police officials. As Lord Ackner put
it:
"What is sought to be done is to use the
oral assertion, even though it may be an
implied assertion, as evidence of the
truth of the proposition asserted. That
the proposition is asserted by way of
necessary implication rather than
expressly cannot, to my mind, make any
difference. The object of tendering the
evidence would be to establish the truth
of what is contained in the statement.
This is precisely what the rule
prohibits....
Lord Griffiths and Lord Browne - Wilkinson, in their dissenting
speeches, emphasized the common sense view of the evidence; in
480
their opinion, the police officials' evidence was evidence of the
conduct of the callers, recounted at first-hand, by them. In the
words of Lord Griffiths-
"Unless compelled to do so by authority
I should be most unwilling to hold that
such evidence should be withheld........
In my view the criminal law of evidence
should be developed along common
sense lines readily comprehensible to the
men and women who comprise the jury
and bear the responsibility for the major
decisions in criminal cases. I believe that
most layman if told that the criminal law
of evidence forbade them even to
consider such evidence........ would
reply, then the law is an ass'......
Lord Griffiths went on to say:
"It is hardly surprising that the jury
convicted the appellant for as a matter of
common sense it is difficult to think of
much more convincing evidence of his
activity as a drug dealer than customers
constantly ringing his house to buy drugs
and a stream of customers beating a path
to his door for the same purpose.....
The requests for drugs made by the
callers were not hearsay as generally
understood, namely an out-of-court
narrative description of facts which have
to be proved in evidence. The callers
were neither describing the appellant as
a drug dealer nor stating their opinion
that he was a drug dealer. They were
calling him up to visit him as customers.
481

a fact revealed by the words they used in
requesting drugs from him".
The risk of wrongful convictions based on unreliable hearsay
evidence is another strong reason for the exclusion of such
evidence.
Hearsay in America:
Hearsay rule exists in one form or another in all
American jurisdictions, but cases on hearsay have generally been
considered with reference to the Sixth Amendment "Confrontation
Clause":-
"In all criminal prosecutions, the
accused shall enjoy the right....... to be
confronted with the witnesses against
him".
The accused's right to confrontation "has been traced historically
through medieval jurisprudence into Roman and other ancient
systems of justice". (Frank R. Herrmann and Browlow M. Speer in
their Article in (1994) 34 Virginia Journal of International Law.
481, cited by Paul Roberts and Adrian Zuckerman in their
"Criminal Evidence" p 668). As was noticed by the Chief Justice
delivering the opinion of the Court in White v Illinois (116 L Ed 2d
848 (1992), the confrontation clause's "limited purpose is to
prevent a particular abuse common in 16th and 17th century
England, prosecuting a defendant through the presentation of
exparte affidavits, without the affiants ever being produced at
trial". In 16 Century England, magistrates interrogated the
prisoner, accomplices and others prior to trial. These interrogations
"were intended only for the information of the courts. The prisoner
had no right to be, and probably never was, present". At the trial
itself "proof was usually given by reading depositions, confessions,
letters and the like" and this occasioned frequent demands by the
prisoner to have his 'accusers' i.e. the witnesses against him,
brought before him face to face." (J. Stephen "A History of
482
the Criminal Law of England 221. (1883) cited in White). In that
connection is "none more frequently retold than the infamous
denial of a right of confrontation to Sir Walter Raleigh". Raleigh
was convicted of treason and executed in 1603 on the basis of an
out-of-court testimony secured from his alleged accomplice, Lord
Cobham. Raleigh, it seems, did not ask to cross-examine Cobham,
or even to have him questioned in court by judges, but only that he
be produced. 'Let Cobham be here, let him speak it. Call my
accuser before my face and I have done". The judges were
apparently fearful that the mere sight of Raleigh would induce
Cobham to change his story and Raleigh's demand to have
Cobham produced face-to-face was denied. (For this statement of
the case, we are indebted to the book "Criminal Evidence" p 668
referred to above). Apparently, so observed the learned Chief
Justice in White,
"in response to such abuses, a common
law right of confrontation began to
develop in England during the late 16
and early 17th Centuries. Justice Story
believed that the Sixth Amendment
codified some of this common
law.
Under the rules of evidence currently applicable in the
different States of America, most hearsay testimony is not
admissible, but there are exceptions; the rationale of many common
law exceptions as also of exceptions under the Confrontation
Clause are primarily based upon a guarantee of reliability or
trustworthiness intended "to ensure the truthfulness of the admitted
statement and to compensate for the fact that a party would not
have the opportunity to test its veracity by cross-examining the
declarant".
In Bourjaily v US (483 US 171: 97 L Ed 2d 144 -
(1987)), Clarence Greathouse, an informant working for the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, arranged to sell a kilogram of
cocaine to Lonardo, who agreed that he would find individuals to
483
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 260
distribute the drug. When the sale became imminent, Lonardo
stated in a tape recorded telephone conversation that he had a
gentleman friend who had some questions to ask about the cocaine,
In a subsequent telephone call, Greathouse spoke to the 'friend'
about the quality of the drug and the price. Greathouse then spoke
again with Lonardo and the two arranged the details of the
purchase. They agreed that the sale would take place in a
designated hotel parking lot, and Lonardo would transfer the drug
from Greathouse's car to the 'friend' who would be waiting in the
parking lot in his own car. Greathouse proceeded with the
transaction as planned, and FBI agents arrested Lonardo and
Bourjaily, the petitioner, immediately after Lonardo placed the
cocaine into the petitioner's car. In the petitioner's car, the police
found over 20000 Dollars in cash.
The petitioner was charged with conspiring to distribute
cocaine and its possession with intent to distribute. The prosecution
introduced Lonardo's telephone statements regarding the
participation of the 'friend' in the transaction. At the trial, Lonardo
exercised his right not to testify. The petitioner argued that
Lonardo's unavailability rendered the telephone talk hearsay and
its admission unconstitutional under the Confrontation Clause.
Rejecting this argument, Chief Justice Rehnquist, speaking for the
Court held:
"While a literal interpretation of the
confrontation clause could bar the use of
any out-of-court statements when the
declarant is unavailable, this court has
rejected that view as 'unintended and too
extreme....... Rather, we have
attempted to harmonize the goal of the
clause with a societal interest in
accurate fact-finding, which may require
consideration
out-of-court
statements..."
484
of
The argument was rejected and the conviction was
upheld. This case provides an interesting contrast with the English
case of Kearley, where also a part of the evidence rejected as
hearsay comprised telephone calls.
In White v Illinois (116 L Ed 2d 848 (1992)), the
application of the confrontation clause to hearsay was considered
in another setting-witness statements made by the alleged child
victim of a sex offence. Speaking for the Court, the Chief Justice
said:
We have consistently sought to
steer a middle course that recognizes that
hearsay rules and the confrontation
clause are generally designed to protect
similar values and stem from the same
roots......
The preference for live testimony in the
case of statements....... is because of
the importance of cross-examination,
'the greatest legal engine invented for
the discovery of truth'. Thus courts have
adopted the general rule prohibiting the
receipt of hearsay evidence. But where
professed hearsay has sufficient
guarantee of reliability to come within a
firmly rooted exception to the hearsay
rule, the confrontation clause is
satisfied".
After referring to the history of the rule, and the previous
discussions, the learned Chief Justice went on to say -
"Ever since Ohio v Roberts (448 US 56-
1980), the Court has interpreted the
Confrontation Clause to mean that
hearsay may be admitted only under a
485
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 261
firmly rooted exception, or if it otherwise
bears particularized guarantees of
trustworthiness'. This analysis implies
that the Confrontation Clause bars only
unreliable hearsay..
...Reliability is
more properly a due process concern.
There is no reason to strain the text of the
Confrontation Clause to provide criminal
defendants with a protection that due
process already provides them".
Purpose determines admissibility:
The general rule is not that hearsay evidence is always
inadmissible. Depending upon the purpose for which it is offered
as evidence, it may be hearsay and inadmissible or it may not be
hearsay and therefore admissible. This distinction is well-settled.
Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed, V.6, page 178) puts the
matter clearly in this way:
"The prohibition of the hearsay rule,
then, does not apply to all words or
utterances merely as such. If this
fundamental principle is clearly realized,
its application is a comparatively simple
matter. The hearsay rule excludes extra-
judicial utterances only when offered for
a special purpose, namely, as assertions
to evidence the truth of the matter.
asserted".
The rule has been stated to the same effect by the Privy Council in
Subramanian (1956) I WLR 965). The accused was charged with
being in possession of ammunition. His defence was that he was
acting under duress, and he sought to give evidence of what had
been said to him by terrorists. The trial judge excluded this
evidence as hearsay and the accused was convicted, but the Privy
486
Council held that the evidence was admissible, and quashed his
conviction. Delivering the opinion of the Board, Mr. De Silva held:
"In ruling out peremptorily the evidence
of conversation between the terrorists
and the appellant the trial judge was in
error. Evidence of a statement made to a
witness by a person who is not himself
called as a witness may or may not be
hearsay. It is hearsay and inadmissible
when the object of the evidence is to.
establish the truth of what is contained in
the statement. It is not hearsay and is
admissible when it is proposed to
establish by evidence, not the truth of the
statement, but the fact that it was
made.........
In that case, it was held, "statements could have been
made to the appellant by the terrorists, which, whether frue or not,
if they had been believed by the appellant, might reasonably have
induced in him an apprehension of instant death if he failed to
conform to their wishes".
In Mawaz Khan v R (1967) AC 454; (1967) 1 All ER
80), the Privy Council accepted the generality of the proposition
maintained by the text writers, like Wigmore, and the above
statement of the rule in Subramanian.
A simple example of the rule has been given by P.B.
Carter in his "Cases and Statutes on Evidence", at p 319: Whereas
a witness's testimony that X told him that he had seen Y steal
would be inadmissible to show that Y had committed theft, the
hearsay rule would not preclude its admissibility to show that X
had uttered a defamatory statement about Y. In the latter case the
statement is said to constitute 'original' evidence rather than
hearsay: again it is sometimes said to be 'circumstantially
relevant.

Oral evidence as to an opinion and its grounds; If the oral
evidence refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that
opinion is held, the evidence to be direct must be the evidence of
the person who holds that opinion on that ground. But an expert
opinion expressed in any treatise commonly offered for sale, and
the grounds on which such opinions are held, may be proved by
production of such treatises if the author is dead or has become
incapable of giving evidence, or cannot be called as a witness
without an amount of delay or expense which the court regards as
unreasonable.
Hearsay in cases other than oral evidence: The hearsay rule is.
by no means, limited to the spoken word or oral evidence. Thus, in
Chandersekara v R [(1937) AC 220]. the complainant was
prevented from speaking because her throat had been cut, but she
managed to indicate using hand-signals that the accused was her
assassin. The Privy Council held that such non-verbal assertions
were within the rule against hearsay.
The best evidence rule namely that the best evidence in
the possession or power of the party must be produced applies
equally to documentary evidence. What the best evidence is in a
particular case depends upon its circumstances. Generally
speaking, the original document is the best evidence; but
circumstances may arise in which secondary evidence of the
contents may be given. (Macdonnel (1852) 138 ER 742). Similarly,
the hearsay rule has been extended to statements in documents and
to writings on objects provided of course that the statement or
writing is adduced as evidence of its truth.
This is enacted in Article 75 of the Qanun-c-Shahadat,
which requires that the contents of documents must be proved by
primary evidence, that is, original document, unless a case for
secondary evidence has been made out. Indeed, what is an original
document is a separate question; as we shall see, modern
technological devices have changed many a concept.
The rule of "primary evidence" necessarily involves the
exclusion of hearsay evidence.
In Patel v Comptroller of Customs [(1966) AC 356).
(1965) 3 All ER 593] the accused was convicted of falsely
declaring to customs officials that the country of original of the
five bags of imported seed was India, when in fact the seed came
from Morocco. The prosecution proved the seed's country of origin
at trial by removing its outer packing to reveal inner bags marked
with the legend 'produce of Morocco. The Privy Council held that
the markings were hearsay and should have been excluded. The
words 'produce of Morocco' were being adduced to prove that the
seed really was the produce of Morocco. Yet the bag itself could
not vouch, by direct evidence, for the authenticity of this assertion.
As Lord Hudson said:
"Nothing here is known of which and by
whom the markings on the bags were
affixed, and no evidence was called to
prove any fact which tended to show that
the goods in question in fact came from
Morocco".
What the prosecution needed was the testimony of a witness who
personally could speak of the origin of the seed. Without such
testimony, the prosecution was merely relying on second hand
assertions from an unknown source, that is, hearsay evidence. The
conviction was set aside.
Myers v Director Public Prosecutions (1965) AC 1001;
(1964)! All ER 877) is another example of the application of the
hearsay rule to documentary evidence.
The only way to prove the contents of a document is by
producing the criginal document or by secondary evidence where
secondary evidence is admissible. This is what Article 72 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984 provides:
488
489
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 263
"The contents of documents may be
proved either by primary or by
secondary evidence".
One of the modes of secondary evidence under Article
74 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat is "oral accounts of the contents of a
document given by some person who has himself seen it".
In Ma Mi (AIR 1927 PC 15), it was held that "seen it"
here means 'read it'; therefore evidence of an illiterate person who
gave evidence that he had heard the document in question read to
him was hearsay and inadmissible evidence.
Exceptions: We have seen that "as a general rule hearsay evidence
is not admissible and in order to justify its reception authority must
be found within some existing established exceptions to this rule"
(Mayer case); and where the law has been codified, as in Pakistan,
the authority must be found in the codified law, e.g. the Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984.
Need to reform the hearsay rule:
We have referred to the observations of Lord Griffiths
(dissenting) in R v Kearley, namely that "most laymen if told that
the criminal law of evidence forbade them even to consider such
evidence as we are debating in this appeal", would reply: "Then the
law is an ass". He went on to observe that "The hearsay rule was
created by our judicial predecessors", and suggested that in order
that the law of evidence should develop "along common sense
lines" readily comprehensible to the common men and women, and
to prevent it, so to say, from being as asinine as that, "the Judges of
today should accept the responsibility of reviewing and adapting
the rules of evidence to serve present day society".
In England, there had been widespread criticism of the
hearsay exclusionary rule with the result that the law has been
modernized and changed both as regards civil and criminal cases.
in civil cases by the Civil Evidence Act, 1968, and in criminal
cases by the Criminal Justice Act, 2003, Chapter 2 of Part II.
sections 114 to 136. Section 114(1) of the 2003 Act provides for
the admissibility of 'hearsay evidence' by saying that-
"In criminal proceedings a statement not
made in oral evidence in the proceedings
is admissible of any matter stated"
if that statement falls within the categories mentioned in that
section. One of the categories is a statement about which-
"the court is satisfied that it is in the
interest of justice for it to be
admissible".
Thus, the law as it is reflected in section 114(1)(d) of the English
Act of 2003 now is that the Judges have an overriding residual
discretion to admit any oral or documentary hearsay evidence in
the interest of justice. Thus, in England, the law as reflected in
Kearley has been replaced by this statutory law.
In America, the hearsay rule has, as we have seen, its
basis in the Constitution's Confrontation Clause, and the common
law general principle that hearsay evidence is not admissible has
not been followed strictly; the constitutional law as developed by
the US Supreme Court seems to be that "the Confrontation Clause
bars only unreliable hearsay". In other words, the test is reliability.
In that behalf, the English case, R v Kearley, and the
American case, Bourjaily v US. provide a very interesting contrast.
Both were drug cases; in both a very important piece of evidence.
upon which the prosecution relied, consisted of telephone calls or
conversation, but whereas in the English case that evidence was
excluded, in the American case it was held admissible.
In Pakistan, and perhaps also in India, the old common
law 'rule against hearsay' is being followed. It has not undergone
any change either at the hands of the Judges or the Legislature. The
491
490

Page 264
only change, if it can be so described, is the one introduced in
Article 71, third proviso. That Article enacts the general rule that
oral evidence must be direct, excluding by necessary implication,
the admission of hearsay evidence. The third proviso reads:
"Provided further that if a witness is
dead or cannot be found or has become
incapable of giving evidence or his
attendance cannot be procured without
an amount of delay or expense which
under the circumstances of the case the
court regards as unreasonable, a party
shall have the right to produce shahada
ala al shahadah, by which a witness can
appoint two witnesses to depose on his
behalf, except in the case of Hadd".
It is obvious that the proviso has a limited application. It cannot
apply to a witness who is dead, or who cannot be found or who has
become incapable of giving evidence; it can apply to a witness
whose attendance cannot be procured without undue delay or
expense only.
As we have sought to demonstrate, there seems to be no
doubt that the English Common Law hearsay rule needs to be
modernized and changed "along commonsense lines". The
common law of England is not the common law of Pakistan. In any
case, it was a judge-made law; we have seen that the common law
rule has been changed, in England, by legislation and in America,
by Judges. There is no reason why we should continue to follow
the English Common Law, which even the English follow no more.
If the Legislature does not intervene, then, it is submitted, the
Judges "should accept the responsibility of reviewing and adapting
the rules of evidence to serve present day society". Whether the
reform is legislative or judge-made, it cannot be over-stressed that
the reform, in at least criminal cases, in such a way that the law
operates fairly both to the prosecution and the accused, is long
over-due. The requirements of fairness, we should think, will be
492
amply satisfied whether we adopt the American constitutional law
or the English statutory law.
SOME SALIENT FEATURES OF CRIMINAL EVIDENCE
False in one thing, false in everything:
The principle embodied in the Latin maxim-Falsus in
uno falsus in omnibus - which means false in one thing. false in
everything, was at one time applied to criminal cases (See, for
example, the Privy Council case of Muhammad Fiaz Baksh v The
Queen PLD 1959 P.C. 24). But this principle has not been
followed in Pakistan. The rule that has been applied since the case
of Ghulam Muhammad v Crown (PLD 1951 Lah 66) is that where
it is found that a witness has falsely implicated one accused person.
ordinarily he would not be relied upon with regard to the other
accused. But if the testimony of such a witness is corroborated by
very strong and independent circumstances regarding others, then
reliance might be placed on the witness for convicting the other
accused. What the courts do now is to separate the grain from the
chaff (Ghulam Sikandar v Mumraze Khan-PLD 1985 SC 11. 23).
It is interesting to note that in Ghulam Sikandar v Mumraze (PLD
1985 SC 11, 23) the principle of Islamic jurisprudence that when a
witness has been found false as regards one accused, his credibility
is irretrievably shaken was noticed and it was observed that the rule
of separating the grain from the chaff will perhaps undergo a
change when considered in the light of the Islamic Jurisprudence.
The rule propounded in Ghulam Muhammad v Crown has been
followed in a number of cases; Tuwaib Khan v State (PLD 1970
SC 13); State v Mushtaq Ahmad (PLD 1973 SC 418); Muhammad
Nawaz v State (1984 SCMR 190) and Feroz Khan v Fateh Khan
(1991 SCMR 2220) are some of those cases.
The rule thus is that
"Where for an offence of murder, the
evidence of the prosecution witnesses is
wholly rejected as unreliable so far as
most of the accused are concerned, it is
493
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 265
not safe to rely upon the evidence of the
same witnesses for the purpose of
convicting the remaining accused in the
case for that offence in the absence of
confirmatory circumstances"
Muhammad and Sher v Crown
PLD
(See
1954 FC 84; cited in Muhammad Akhtar
v State-PLD 1957 SC 297).
Suspect evidence which needs corroboration:
Ocular evidence may be classified into three categories,
first, wholly reliable, secondly, wholly unreliable; and thirdly,
partly reliable and partly unreliable.
In the first category, conviction may safely be based on
uncorroborated testimony. In the second category, even the
strongest corroborative evidence may not rehabilitate such
evidence. In the third category, conviction cannot be recorded
unless such evidence is corroborated by other oral or circumstantial
evidence (Muhammad Iqbal v Muhammad Akram 1996 SCMR
908).
In the English cases (See for example Junior Reid v R
(1993) 4 All ER 95), the third category is described as suspect
evidence. As has been said in Junior Reid case, "judicial
experience has established that there are certain categories of
evidence which are, by their very nature, potentially unreliable and
in respect of which, in order to avoid the serious danger of wrong
conviction, special warmings and directions have to be given to
juries".
In other words, suspect evidence is that evidence which
cannot, consistently with the safe dispensation of criminal justice,
be acted upon without corroboration.
Concept of corroboration:
There is no magic or artificiality about the rule of
judicial practice concerning corroboration; nor is the word
"corroboration" a technical term of art. It is a dictionary word
bearing its dictionary meaning which by itself means no more than
evidence tending to confirm other evidence (Lord Hailsham L. C.
in DPP v Kilbourne (1973) I All ER 440). "When in ordinary
affairs of life, one is doubtful whether or not to believe a particular
statement, one naturally looks to see whether it fits in with other
statements or circumstances relating to the particular matter; the
better it fits in the more one is inclined to believe it. The doubted
statement is corroborated to a greater or lesser extent by the other
statements or circumstances with which it fits in (Lord Reid in DPP
Kilbourne (1973) 1 All ER 440; also see Irshad Ahmad v State -
1990 P Cr. LJ 374, 383).
To give or to require corroboration, a witness must be
believed without doubt. This means that unless a witness's
evidence in intrinsically credible, he can neither afford
corroboration nor be thought to require it. In such cases a witness's
evidence is rejected before the question of corroboration arises
(Boardman v DPP (1975) 60 Criminal Appeal Reports 165, 183,
per Lord Hailsham). To illustrate it by an example, suppose that
'A' an interested witness gives evidence that he saw 'B' killing
'C'. The court does not believe the claim of 'A' that he saw the
killing taking place. This is a case in which A's evidence is
rejected before the question of corroboration arises.
Thus, the tainted evidence of a witness must satisfy what-
in Indian and Pakistani cases is called a double test; first, whether
his evidence is reliable, that is, probable and natural. If the answer
to this question is in the negative, that is the end of the matter, and.
no occasion for the application of the second test, namely whether
it has received sufficient corroboration, will arise. (Muhammad
Bashir case-PLD 1967 SC 447, applied in Z. A Bhutto case - PLD
1979 SC 53, para 424 per Anwar-ul-Haq, C.J).
494

Categories of suspect evidence include the following:
i)
Evidence of interested witnesses
In criminal law, the expression 'interested witness' has
acquired a technical meaning. Mere friendship or relationship with
the deceased or the victim does not make a witness an interested
witness. An interested witness is a person who has a motive to
falsely implicate the accused. In one of the leading case on the
point namely Niaz v Sate (PLD 1960 SC 387), it was held:
"Whenever interested persons claiming
to be eye-witnesses of an occurrence
charge persons against whom they have
some motive for false implication, with
the commission of the offence, the first
question to be considered is whether in
fact they saw the occurrence and were in
a position to identify the culprits. If there
be no reason to doubt that they in fact
witnessed the occurrence and were in a
position to identify the offenders, the
further question arises as to whether they
can be relied upon for convicting the
accused without corroboration. In cases
where such interested witnesses charge
one person only with the commission of
the offence, or where the number of
persons whom they name does not
exceed that which appears from
independent evidence or from
circumstances not open to doubt to be
the true number of culprits, their
evidence may, in the absence of
anything making it unsafe to do so, be
accepted without corroboration, for
substitution is a thing of rare occurrence
and cannot be assumed, and he who sets
496
up the plea of substitution has to lay the
foundation for it. But if the court finds
that the number mentioned by interested
persons may have been exaggerated their
word cannot be made the basis of
conviction and the court will have to
look for some additional circumstance
which corroborates their testimony".
Elaborating upon these observations in Nazir and others
y The State (PLD 1962 SC 269), it was held:
"There may be an interested witness
whom the court regards as incapable of
falsely implicating an innocent person.
But he will be an exceptional witness
and, so far as an ordinary interested
witness is concerned, it cannot be said
that it is safe to rely upon his testimony
in respect of every person against whom
he deposes. In order, therefore, to be
satisfied that no innocent persons are
being implicated along with the guilty.
the court will in the case of an ordinary
interested witness look for some
circumstance that gives sufficient
support to his statement so as to create
that degree of probability which can be
made the basis of conviction. This is
what is meant by saying that the
statement of an interested witness
ordinarily needs corroboration".
These principles were re-affirmed and applied in Talib Husain v
State (PLJ 2009 SC 483).
The principle to be gleaned from decided cases may be
summed up as follows. In the case of an ordinary interested
497
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 267
witness, as in the case of any other witness, the first question the
court must ask is whether he had seen the incident taking place and
was in a position to identify the culprit. In other words, the Court
must first decide if the evidence of a witness is intrinsically
credible. Only if the answer be in the affirmative, can the question
of corroboration of an ordinary interested witness arise. For, it is
not the purpose of corroboration to give validity or credence to
evidence which is intrinsically incredible (Irshad Ahmad v The
State 1990 PCr.L.J. 374, 385). This may be illustrated by an
example. Suppose that "K" appears as an eye witness and testifies
to having seen an incident of murder taking place. There is,
however, evidence to show that 'K' was at the time of the incident
lodged in a jail, and it was therefore impossible for him to be
present at the time and place of occurrence. Assuredly, no amount
of corroborative evidence would make his testimony, that the
accused was the person whom he had seen firing the fatal shot,
make his evidence credible.
This does not mean that the mere disinterestedness of a
witness in the sense referred to above is sufficient to hold that he is
a truthful witness. If the principle be that a disinterested witness is
always to be relied upon even if his evidence is unreasonable,
improbable and implausible, it would lead to very dangerous
consequences (Muhammad Rafique v The State 1997 SCMR 412;
Furman Ullah v Qadeem Khan 2001 SCMR 1474).
ii)
Evidence of identity
Recent judicial experience in England has established
that the identification evidence is one of the categories of suspect
evidence. This was brought in sharp focus by two much publicized
cases of Dougherty and Virag where miscarriage of justice was
established despite the apparent strength of the identification
evidence. Miscarriage of criminal justice, affecting as it does the
life and liberty of person, being a very serious matter and the
country being England, there was great public concern. That
concern found expression first in the Eleventh Report of the
Criminal Revision Committee, published in 1972, which was
498
followed by the appointment of a Committee under the
chairmanship of Lord Devlin to consider identification evidence in
criminal cases. In the light of recommendations of that Committee.
Lord Widgery, Cl, giving the judgement of the Court of Appeal in
R v Turnbull (1976) 3 All ER 549) laid down the guidelines which
are, by now, well known and consistently applied in England and
in a number of Commonwealth countries (See for example, the
Privy Council decisions in Scott v Queen (1989) AC 1242: Junior
Reid v Queen (1990) I AC 363). This trend of judicial authority in
England was noticed in the leading judgment in Muhammad
Arshad v State (PLD 1995 SC 475) and the principles were stated
as follows: The evidence of visual identification is one of the
categories of suspect evidence and that ordinarily it is not safe to
convict on the basis of such evidence without corroboration.
Indeed, in exceptional circumstances, that is, where the evidence of
visual identification is of exceptionally good quality, such as.
where the offender was known to the witness, there was sufficient
light, the witness had had an unobstructed view of the offender and
there was a dialogue between the witness and the offender, the
evidence may be acted upon. It was observed that there was no
reason why we should not benefit from the "accumulated judicial
experience" in England. If anything, the need for caution here is
greater than in England. The other two learned Judges, however.
agreed with the conclusion, but referring to the decision in State v
Farman Hussain (PLD 1995 SC 1) preferred to follow the views in
that case. In that case, in the majority judgment authored by Ajmal
Mian, J, reference was made to two cases namely Lal Pasand v
State (PLD 1981 SC 142) and Abdul Sattar v State (1981 SCMR
678). In the first it was emphasized that "although the witness was
an honest witness the dangers of errors in identification are so great
that it would not be safe to base a conviction on the evidence
of a solitary eye witness if the witness has only had a fleeting
glimpse of the assailants....." and in the second, the question was
whether the evidence of the prosecution witnesses who were
admittedly complete strangers to the accused persons should be
acted upon. In that behalf, reference was made to observations in
an earlier case viz. Ramzan v Emperor (AIR 1929 Sindh 149)
namely that the "recognition of a dacoit or other offender by a
499
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 268
person who has not previously seen him is, I think, a form of
evidence which has always to be taken with a considerable amount
of caution because mistakes are always possible in such cases"
The learned Judges agreed with these observations and held that
"evidence of the identification of strangers must always be
scrutinized very carefully", In State v Farman Hussain. Ajmal
Mian, J. had no "cavil with the proposition of law propounded in
the above reports". He made distinction "between a case in which
witness has had only a fleeting glimpse of the accused who
happened to be stranger and a witness who had known the accused
previously or who had met the accused several times. In the former
case, the court insists upon having proper identification parade
whereas in the latter case, the identification parade can be
dispensed with as witness can identify the accused even in the
court". State v Farman Hussain (PLD 1995 SC 1), it may be noted,
belonged to the second category of cases.
To establish the identity of the culprits, the police often
have resort to identification parade or identification test. There is
no legal requirement that such a parade or test should be held and
whether any identification parade was warranted would depend
upon the facts of each case. Where an identification parade is held,
its value is that of corroborative evidence but the mere fact that a
witness is able to pick out an accused person from among the
crowd does not prove that he had identified that accused person
having taken part in the crime. It might merely mean that the
witness happens to know that accused person. The principal
evidence of identification is the evidence of a witness given in
court as to how and under what circumstances he came to pick out
a particular accused person and the details of the part that accused
took in the crime in question. Thus, the proceedings of the
identification parade where the accused were picked out without
describing the roles played by them in the crime have no
evidentiary value and cannot be relied (Mehmood Ahmad v State
1995 SCMR 127). Then, the value of the fact of identification at a
parade would depend upon the surrounding circumstances. The
court must he satisfied, and the burden to satisfy is upon the
prosecution, that the accused had not been shown to the witness
before the parade and the fact that the parade was held after
considerable unexplained delay would militate against the
identification (Sajjad Ali Shah J, in State v Farman Hussain PLD
1995 SC 1, 131
Evidence of a child witness
A child witness is an example of a case in which the
question both of competence and credibility can arise. Under
Article 3 of the Qanun, a child witness is a competent witness
provided the court considers that he is not prevented from
understanding the questions put to him or from giving rational
answers to those questions. Where the court had, by questioning
the child concerned, fully satisfied itself that the child witness was
capable of understanding the questions put to him and of giving
rational answers to those questions, he is not only a competent
witness but his evidence can also be acted upon (Abdullah Shah v
State 1968 SCMR 852: State v Farman Hussain PLD 1995 SC 1.
21).
But the evidence of children is suspect evidence because
"although old enough to understand the nature of an oath and thus
competent to give sworn evidence, may yet be so young that their
comprehension of events and of questions put to them, or their
power of expression, may be imperfect". However, it seems that
quality is what matters in the end and for that purpose the views of
the trial court who had seen the child witness in the witness box
both as to the competence and the credibility of a child witness will
carry considerable weight (This seems to be the ratio of majority
judgment in State v Farman Hussain PLD 1995 SC 1).
iv)
Evidence of an accomplice
The term 'accomplice has not been defined in the
Qanun and is, therefore, presumed to have been used in its ordinary
sense. Yet, some indication of its meaning is provided by section
337 Cr.P.C. It means "a guilty associate or partner in crime. or.
who in some way or the other, whether before, during or after the
500
301
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 269
commission of the offence, is consciously connected with the
offence in question, or who makes admissions of facts showing that
he had a conscious hand in the offence.....
.... In other words,
50
an accomplice is a particeps criminis, who is consciously
connected with the criminal act done by his confederate, that he on
account of the presence of the necessary mens rea, and his
participation in the crime in some way or the other can be tried
along with that confederate actually perpetrating the
crime..... (Bagu v Emperor - AIR 1925 PC 130; Mahadeo
v Emperor AIR 1936 PC 242: Z A Bhutto case - PLD 1979 SC
53. paras 408-410, per Anwar-ul-Haq CJ). Whether a person is or
is not an accomplice depends on the facts of each particular case,
considered in connection with the nature of the crime. The burden
of showing that a witness is an accomplice lies ordinarily upon the
party alleging it (Z A Bhutto case, para 411 of Anwar-ul-Haq CJ's
judgment).
By Article 16 of the Qanun, an accomplice is a
competent witness against an accused person except in the case of
an offence punishable with 'hadd' and a conviction is not illegal
merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of
an accomplice.
Article 16 is to be read with Article 129, illustration (b),
of the Qanun. The latter provides that "the court may presume the
existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened,
regard being had to the common course of natural events, human
conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the
facts of the particular case". Illustration (b) to that Article reads:
"That an accomplice is unworthy of
credit unless he is corroborated in
material particulars".
The rule in Article 129, illustration (b), is based on the
ground that "an accomplice, with a purpose of his own to serve.
such as the hope of lenient punishment, may well tend, when
giving evidence for the prosecution, to suggest that the entirety or
the majority of the blame for the crime should fall upon the
accused rather upon himself (These observations are from Junior
Reid R (1993) 4 All ER 95). As was said in Ishaq v Crown
(PLD 1954 FC 335, 343), an accomplice is a moral wretch who not
only publicly boasts of his own part in the crime............but who,
prompted by a mean desire to save his skin, shamelessly betrays his
companions in the dock and who has no scruples either in
exaggerating their part in the crime or in substituting in a well
thought-out narrative a completely innocent man.
The effect of the provisions of Article 16 as it stood
before 31.8.1993 read with Article 129 illustration (b) of the Qanun
was that "though by virtue of illustration (b) of Article 129 of the
Qanun, the court may presume that the testimony of an accomplice
is unworthy of credit unless it is corroborated in material
particulars but the court may convict an accused person on the
hasis of the sole testimony of an accomplice in view of the
language employed in the above Article 16 of the Qanun except in
case of an offence punishable with Hadd. We may observe that in
practice the courts, as a rule of prudence while considering section
133 of the late Act (Evidence Act 1972) had been insisting to have
the testimony of an accomplice or approver corroborated in
material particulars keeping in view illustration (b) of section 114
thereof (Federation of Pakistan v Muhammad Shafi Muhammadi.
1994 SCMR 932; relying upon Abdul Qadir v State PLD 1956
SC (Pak) 407; Dr. Muhammad Bashir v State - PLD 1971 SC 447).
Reference in the above-cited case to offences punishable
with Hadd is reference to offences punishable under the Offences
against Property (Enforcement of Hadood) Ordinance. 1979, the
Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hadood) Ordinance. 1979, the
Offence of Qazf (Enforcement of Hadd) Ordinance, 1979, and the
Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979.
In Federation of Pakistan v Muhammad Shafi
Muhammadi (1994 SCMR 932), the question before the Appellate
Shariat Bench of the Supreme Court was whether Article 16 of the
Qanun was in conformity with the Injunctions of Islam. It was held
503
502

Page 270
that there is a distinction between an offence punishable with Hadd
or Qisas on the one hand and an offence which entails 'taazir' only.
In the former case, the State cannot deviate as to the type or nature
of evidence which is required for recording a conviction in terms of
the Holy Quran and Sunnah but in the latter case, the State
provides the punishment and, therefore, the State can also lay down
the type and nature of evidence for warranting conviction. So in the
case of offences entailing punishment of Hadd and Qisas, even the
State cannot provide that the testimony of an accomplice or an
approver will be admissible. However, in case of an offence
punishable with 'taazir, the State may provide that the testimony
of an accomplice or an approver is admissible in evidence and can
furnish basis for conviction subject to corroboration or otherwise as
the facts of the case warrant. The conclusion reached, therefore,
was that "the evidence of an accomplice is not admissible at all in
case of an offence punishable with Hadd and Qisas. However, in
case of an offence punishable with 'taazir' his testimony is
admissible and can furnish the basis for conviction provided it is
corroborated in material particulars. However, in exceptional cases.
for the reasons to be recorded by the court, his testimony may be
acted upon as sufficient for warranting recording of conviction".
This decision of the Supreme Court directed that Article
16 be "amended accordingly by 31.8.1993, failing which the said
provision will become void and shall be of no effect to the extent
stated above".
The position that emerges as a result of the reading
together of the provisions of Article 16 and Article 129 illustration
(b) of the Qanun in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court
in Shafi Muhammadi case and the provisions of the amended
section 338 Cr.P.C. may be summed up as follows:
An accomplice is not a competent witness
against an accused person in the case of an
offence-
b)
punishable with Hadd; and
punishable with Qisas;
its consequence being that the evidence of an accomplice in these
cases is not admissible at all.
ii)
An accomplice is a competent witness in other
cases, that is, cases other than those involving
offences punishable with 'Hadd" and "Qisas
and though a conviction is not illegal merely
because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated
testimony of an accomplice, yet the rule of
prudence which has hardened into a rule of
law is that the testimony of an accomplice
cannot be acted upon unless it is corroborated
in material particulars by independent
evidence.
iii) Though an accomplice is a competent witness in
cases covered by (ii) above, yet he cannot be
tendered pardon under Chapter XXIII Cr.P.C.
in the case of an offence relating to 'hurt' or
'qatal' without the permission of the victim or
as the case may be of the heirs of the victim.
Real Evidence:
Real evidence in the legal sense means material physical
matters such as a body, wound, finger print or a bloodstain.
For example, the discovery of a body provides the best
evidence of the death of the victim, of his identity and generally the
means by which he was killed.
Effect of dead body not found
There is a firm and salutary rule that no one shall be
convicted of murder when the body of the alleged victim has not
504
505
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 271
been found, unless there is circumstantial evidence of such weight
that it can lead to no other reasonable conclusion than that the
person for whose murder the accused is being tried is dead. It is a
salutary rule because there have been instances where persons have
been hanged for the murder of someone who subsequently turned
up alive and well. As we have seen, the, the high sounding maxim
that 'let justice be done, though the heavens should fall' owes its
origin to the man for whose murder the accused was sentenced to
death coming forward himself alive and well. (See Part I, chapter 1
ante of this book.)
Lord Goddard CJ said in R v Onufrejezyk (1955) 1 All
ER 247) "...........there is apparently no reported case in English
law where a man has been convicted of murder when there has
been no trace of the body at all. But it is equally clear that the fact
of death, like any other fact, can be proved by circumstantial
evidence, that is to say, evidence of facts which lead to one
conclusion, provided that the jury are satisfied and are warned that
it must lead to one conclusion only".
Medical, chemical examination etc.
The evidence as to a body, or a wound, nature of injuries
etc., is provided by postmortem examination and medico legal
examination. In this connection, reference is invited to sections 509
and 510 of the Criminal Procedure Code and the instructions
contained in Chapters 18(A) and 18(B) of the High Court Rules
and Orders Vol. III. Section 509 provides for the deposition of
medical witnesses and section 510 provides for the reports of
chemical examiner and serologist etc. While ordinarily a medical
officer who had carried out the postmortem examination or medico
legal examination should appear in court to testify to that fact,
unless, of course his deposition had been taken and attested by a
Magistrate in the presence of the accused or taken on commission,
section 510 makes the reports under the hands of a chemical
examiner, assistant chemical examiner to government, serelogist.
finger print expert or fire arm expert appointed by the government
upon any matter or thing duly submitted to him for examination
506
and analysis, per se admissible without the need of calling him as a
witness.
Post-mortem of female body
The Supreme court has in a recent case (Muhammad
Iqbal v Muhammad Akram - 1996 SCMR 908, 919) taken a very
serious view of dead bodies of females being subjected to post-
mortem examination by male doctors, and issued instruction that
such examination should be conducted by female doctors.
Medical evidence as corroboration
Medical evidence by itself does not establish the identity
of the culprits (Mehmood Ahmad v State-1995 SCMR 127, 133).
It can be used as corroborative evidence "but only to the extent of
nature and number of injuries" (State v Muhammad Sharif - 1995
SCMR 635, 647)
Direct and Circumstantial Evidence:
Under Article 18 of the Qanun, evidence may be given
in a proceeding of the existence or non-existence of facts in issue
and such other facts as are declared by the Qanun to be relevant.
Direct evidence is that which goes expressly to the very
point in question and which, if believed, proves the point in
question without aid from inference or reasoning. For example, the
testimony of an eye-witness of a murder is direct evidence.
Circumstantial evidence, on the other hand, does not prove the
point in question directly but establishes it only by inference. Thus
if A is tried for the murder of B, evidence of the fact that A had a
motive to murder B and that at the time B was murdered, A, with a
drawn sword, was seen going towards the place where B was
murdered and shortly afterwards was seen returning from the place
with his clothes stained with blood would be circumstantial
evidence.

"Direct evidence" as used here, that is, as opposed to
circumstantial evidence, is not the same thing as "direct evidence"
as used in Article 71 of the Qanun. In Article 71, the term direct
evidence is used as opposed to hearsay evidence and not as
opposed to circumstantial evidence. Therefore, in the sense in
which this term is used in Article 71, circumstantial evidence must
always be direct ie, the facts from which the existence of the fact,
in issue is to be inferred must he proved by direct and not by
hearsay evidence (See Monir in his invaluable Treatise on the Law
of Evidence, 1974 ed., p 690. cited with approval in Z A Bhutto
case-PLD 1979 SC 53. para 62, per Anwar-ul-Haq CJ).
'Circumstantial evidence' is evidence of facts from
which, taken with all other evidence, a reasonable inference is a
fact directly in issue. It works by cumulatively, in geometrical
progression, eliminating other possibilities (DPP v Kilbourne
(1973) AC 729, 752 = (1973) 1 All ER 440, 462; 1990 PCrLJ 374).
As evidence of a fact in issue, it is ordinarily produced when direct
evidence is not available. An example is an unwitnessed crime.
It is well established that when all the evidence is
circumstantial it is necessary that cumulatively its effect should be
to exclude any reasonable hypothesis of the innocence of the
accused. In other words the chain of circumstances established
against the accused person should raise a strong probability that he
is guilty of the offence charged (Allah Ditta v State - PLD 1958
SC (Pak) 290, 293, 298; Muhammad Nazir Hossain v State - 1969
SCMR 388; Mst. Sairan v State - PLD 1970 SC 56).
Before the guilt of the accused can be inferred merely
from inculpatory circumstances, those circumstances must be
found to be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and
incapable of explanation upon any reasonable hypothesis other than
that of his guilt. It is also equally well established that the
circumstances sought to be relied upon must have been established
beyond a doubt. But this only means a reasonable doubt, that is, a
doubt such as to assail a reasonable mind and not any and every
kind of doubt and much less a doubt conjured up by pre-conceived
508
notions but once the circumstances have been found to be so
established they may well furnish a better basis for decision than
any other kind of evidence (Hamoodur Rehman J. in State v
Manzoor Ahmed - PLD 1966 SC 664, 680).
In other words, if circumstantial evidence of this quality
is produced, then there can be no better evidence than this
evidence. For it must be remembered that witnesses can make
mistakes, forget or lie. Therefore, it is no derogation of evidence to
that it is circumstantial (Hewart L.CJ. in (1828) 21 Cr. A. 20
cited in State v Manzoor Ahmad - PLD 1966 SC 664, 680).
F.L.R. as evidence in contrast to police statements during
investigation and police diaries:
say
We have seen that in cognizable cases ordinarily the law
is set in motion, that is to say, the process of investigation begins,
when a report under section 154 Cr.P.C. commonly known as the
First Information Report is lodged. Such a report is to be recorded
as intimation of the commission of a cognizable offence and not as
a prayer for redress for personal wrong or injury suffered. For the
report may be made by any person, eg. a Lumbardar or a
Chowkidar or a member of the public who has gained knowledge
in any manner howsoever of the commission of a cognizable
offence. The further pursuit of the matter by the police is an
activity of the State (Muhammad Ashiq v Allah Bakhsh - PLD
1957 SC (Pak) 293). The First Information Report is supposed to
contain a narration of the way the incident took place; it is not
supposed to contain minute details, particularly when it is made by
a person who had not seen the incident taking place (Liaqat Ali v
State 1981 SCMR 1130).
F.I.R. after investigation
But when a statement is recorded by the police after
investigation, it is not the First Information Report and cannot be
so used under section 154 Cr.P.C. In other words, a
509
so-called
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 273
F.I.R. recorded after investigation is inadmissible in evidence
(Nasim Akhtar v State PLD 1968 Lah 841). In that case, it is a
statement before the police during investigation within the meaning
of section 162 Cr.P.C. and can be used only for the purpose
mentioned therein namely for contradicting the witness in the
manner provided by Article 140 of the Qanun.
F.I.R. at a place other than police station
As a rule, a First Information Report recorded at a place
other than the police station may raise an inference that it was
recorded after preliminary investigation had commenced and
would not therefore be admissible in evidence (Muhammad Hanif
v State - PLD 1977 Lah. 1253: Lakhmir v State - PLD 1968
Quetta 7: Ghulam Qadir v State - PLD 1967 Peshawar 269).
Use of F.I.R.
As an F.I.R. recorded under section 154 Cr.P.C. is not a
statement during investigation. it can be used as corroboration
under Article 153 of the Qanun. In any case, it is a previous
Statement for the purposes of Article 140 thereof (A. Nagesia v
Bihar State AIR 1966 SC 119). A prompt FIR eliminates the
possibility of fabrication (Khalil Ahmad v State 1975 SCMR
442); similarly delay in making it, if reasonably explained, does not
affect the prosecution case adversely (Ismail v. State 1976 SCMR
135: Hamid Khan v State - PLJ 1980 SC 519 and Mst. Siani v
State PLD 1984 FSC 121). Delay in making the FIR can assume
importance, for it "can be attributed to consultation, taking
instructions and calculatedly preparing report..
(Mehmood Ahmad v State-1995 SCMR 127, 131).
F.I.R. by culprit
The first information of an offence may have been given
by the culprit himself, and it may contain a confession of his guilt.
In that case, the question of admissibility of the First Information
Report arises. This turns on the provisions of Articles 38 and 39 of
510
the Qanun. Article 38 forbids proof of a confession made to a
police officer and Article 39 forbids proof of a confession made by
any person while in police custody. The preponderance of judicial
opinion seems to be that a first information report if it contains a
confession of the accused is inadmissible in evidence (Muhammad
Saleh v State - PLD 1965 SC 366 and A. Nagesia v Bihar State-
AIR 1966 SC 119). But the prohibition is against using a
confession against the accused person and not using it in favour of
the accused person (State v Ghandal - PLD 1960 Peshawar 137:
Salman Shah v Ayub-PLD 1971 SC 751).
Statement before Magistrates during investigation
As regards a statement of a witness recorded by a
Magistrate under section 164 Cr.P.C., the court has a discretion to
treat it as evidence if (a) it was made in the presence of the accused
and he had notice of it and was given an opportunity of cross-
examining the witness and (b) if the witness is produced and
examined at the trial. (Sections 244A and 265J Cr.P.C)
Statement of a Dying Man - Dying declaration:
Such statements are relevant and admissible under
Article 46 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat, which makes statements,
written or verbal, relevant facts made by a person who is dead.....
when the statement is made by the person as to the cause of his
death or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which
resulted in his death in cases in which the cause of that person's
death comes into question. Such statements are relevant whether
the person who made them was or was not at the time when they
were made under expectation of death and whatever may be the
nature of the proceeding in which the cause of death comes into
question. This is an exception to the general rule against hearsay
evidence.
The expression "any of the circumstances of the
transaction which resulted in his death" is wider in scope than the
expression "the cause of his death". Similarly the words "resulted
511
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 274
in his death" do not mean caused his death. In other words, the
intention clearly is to make admissible not only the statement
dealing directly with the cause of death but also a statement as to
any of the circumstances. Thus, the statement of a deceased person
is admissible not only in regard to the cause of his death, but also
in regard to any of the circumstances of the transaction which
resulted in his death and this would include the circumstances in
which his companion may have been done to death in the course of
the same transaction, provided the case is one in which the cause of
the death of the maker of the statement comes into question
(Muhammad Aslam v State PLD 1978 SC 298, 311, 312).
Dying declaration as basis of conviction
There is a respectable body of judicial literature on the
evidential value of a dying declaration, and on whether such a
declaration can form a safe basis for conviction without
corroboration. From the guidance to be gained from decided cases,
the position seems to emerge as follows. A dying declaration when
it falls under Article 46(1) of the Qanun becomes evidence. Neither
that Article nor any other provision of the Qanun says that a
conviction cannot be based on a dying declaration. It can therefore
be said that a conviction can be based solely on a dying
declaration, particularly because it is presumed to be true on the
ground that a statement made by a person under expectation of
death is treated as a substitute for oath on the religious view that no
man who is immediately going into the presence of his Maker will
do so with a lie on his lips (Reg v Osman (1881) 15 Cox C.C. 1.
3). As has been said, such a declaration is made in extremity "when
the party is at the point of death, and when every hope of this world
is gone; when every motive of falsehood is silenced and the mind is
induced by the most powerful considerations to speak the truth
(Eyre C.B. in R v Woodcock - 1 Leach C.C. 500, quoted in Zarif v
State PLD 1977 SC 612, 617). But the deceased man might not
have been a man of unquestionable integrity; or as was said in
Bakhsheesh Singh v Emperor (AIR 1925 Lah 549) family feuds
and enmities do not die with death. However that may be, the
evidence of dying declaration is a weaker type of evidence than the
512
evidence hy a witness in the witness box and therefore as a rule of
as distinct from a rule of law, a close scrutiny of the
prudence.
dying declaration like the statements of interested witnesses
becomes absolutely necessary. A dying declaration can be
challenged on any ground on which the evidence of a witness can
be challenged. For example, it can be challenged on the ground of
enmity and also on the ground that the deceased was not a very
honest man. Then a person can make an honest mistake about the
identity of the person who attacked him and if he has implicated
the wrong person, his cross-examination may help to bring out the
truth. But this is not possible in the case of a dying declaration.
although the possibility of an error in identification is far greater.
Thus, though a conviction can be based on a dying declaration, yet
as the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is on the
prosecution, it will be for the prosecution to prove that the author
of the dying declaration was a man of unquestionable integrity and
if the prosecution discharges this burden, a conviction can be based
on a dying declaration subject to the further condition that evidence
about the dying declaration recorded and deposed to by a judicial
officer is generally considered to be more reliable than a dying
declaration recorded and deposed to by the police or by a relative
of the deceased (Abdul Razik v State PLD 1965 SC 151: Towaib
Khan v State PLD 1970 SC 13: Zarif v State PLD 1977 SC
612).
To sum up, if the court is satisfied that the dying man
was able to identify the assailant, that there was no background of
enmity, that there was no chance of tutoring the dead man and his
having acted under the influence of another and that the dying man
was fully conscious and in possession of his senses when he made
the statement, the court may act upon the dying statement (These
principles are deducible from the judgment in Muhammad Aslam v
State PLD 1978 SC 298). In one word, to accept a dying
declaration without considering the surrounding circumstances
would be totally inconsistent with the safe administration of
criminal justice (Cornelius CJ in Abdul Razik v State - PLD 1965
SC 151. 155)
513
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 275
The modern approach to dying declarations seems to be
that the acceptance of a dying man's statement depends on its
probative value, that is, on whether it inspires confidence as to its
truthfulness (See among others Ratten v The Queen (1971) 3 All
ER 801 and Mills v Queen (1995) I WLR 511).
It is well settled that the provisions of section 164
Cr.P.C. do not in any way affect the admissibility of a statement
made by a person, if it falls within the terms of Article 46(1) of the
Qanun. To be admissible under that Article, it is not necessary that
such statements must necessarily have been recorded and much
less recorded in accordance with the provisions contained in
Chapter XXV Cr.P.C. Also, dying declarations are admissible even
if made orally (Allah Bakhsh v Crown PLD 1951 FC 111, followed
in Muhammad Aslam v State - PLD 1978 SC 298, 309).
Confession Evidence:
Confession is a species of admission. An admission is a
statement, oral or documentary, which suggests any inference as to
any fact in issue or relevant fact and which is made by any of the
persons or under the circumstances mentioned in Articles 31 to 45
of the Qanun.
The term 'confession' has not been defined in the
Qanun; it was not defined in the Evidence Act, 1872 either. The
term was defined in Pakala Narayana Swami v Emperor (AIR 1939
PC 47) by Lord Atkin, who said:
"As the point was argued however and
as there seems to have been some
discussion in the Indian courts on the
matter it may be useful to state that
no statement that contains self-
exculpatory matter can amount to a
confession, if the exculpatory statement
is of some fact which if true would
negative the offence alleged to be
514
confessed. Moreover, a confession must
either admit in terms the offence or at
any rate substantially all the facts which
constitute the offence. An admission of a
gravely incriminating fact, even a
conclusively incriminating fact is not of
itself a confession e.g. an admission that
the accused is the owner of and was in
recent possession of the knife or revolver
which caused a death with
explanation of any other man's
possession.
по
Some confusion, so noted Lord Atkin, "appears to have been
caused by the definition of confession in Article 22 of Stephen's
Digest of the Law of Evidence which defines a confession as an
admission made at any time by a person charged with a crime
stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that crime. If
the surrounding articles are examined it will be apparent that the
learned author after dealing with admissions generally is applying
himself to admissions in criminal cases, and for this purpose
defines confession so as to cover all such admissions in order to
have a general term for use in the three following articles.
confession secured by inducement, made upon oath, made under a
promise of.......". The definition is not, so held Lord Atkin.
"contained in the Evidence Act, 1872;
and in that Act it would not be consistent
with the natural use of language to
construe confession as a statement by an
accused suggesting the inference that he
committed the crime".
Lord Atkin's definition in Pakala has been followed in
Pakistan (See, among others. Liaqat Bahadur v State - PLD 1987
FSC 43, 49; Z A Bhutto case - PLD 1979 SC 53, paras 123, 124,
125 of Anwar-ul-Haq C.J's judgment).

To the argument raised by the prosecution that a
statement, partly inculpatory and partly exculpatory, can also be
used under section 30 of the Evidence Act, 1872 (now Article 43 of
the Qanun). Anwar-ul-Haq CJ., in Z A Bhutto case, referred to the
cases relied upon by the Prosecutor and observed that "A perusal of
the facts and observations appearing in these cases, however, does
not fully support the learned Special Public Prosecutor, as there is
no departure from the basic definition as given by the Privy
Council in the case of Pakala......... He went on to hold:
"The principle underlying the section
(section 30 of the 1872 Act) is that the
consequences of self-implication in an
offence afford some sort of guarantee for
the truth of the statement and when the
maker of such statement also implicates
another prisoner, it is very difficult, if
not practically impossible, to require the
court to exclude
that statement
altogether from its mind when it comes
to consider the case against the other
accused. An admission by an accused
person of his own guilt affords some sort
of sanction in support of the truth of his
confession against others as well as
himself. These considerations however
do not apply when the question is
whether statement partly inculpatory and
partly exculpatory should be used
against the maker thereof. In his case,
even if the statement does not amount to
a confession in the full sense of the term,
it could still be used as admission
against him".
If we may say with great respect, such a statement, even
though it does not amount to confession, can be used, so far as its
inculpatory part is concerned, against the maker, only if the
516
statement is not read as a whole; that is, by separating the
inculpatory part from the exculpatory part. This will be against the
well settled principle that such statements must be read as a whole.
However that may be, in view of the fact that the right
against self incrimination is now a constitutionally guaranteed
right, a change in the definition of 'confession' is inevitable. We
have seen that in Miranda (384 US 436 -1966) where the US
Supreme Court was dealing with the protections guaranteed by the
Fifth Amendment (right against self-incrimination) and the Sixth
Amendment (right to counsel), Chief Justice Earl Warren had said
that-
"No distinction can be drawn
between statements which are direct
confessions and statements which
amount to 'admissions' of part or all of
an offence. The privilege against self
incrimination protects the individual
from being compelled to incriminate
himself in any manner, it does not
distinguish degrees of incrimination.
Similarly, for precisely the same reason,
no distinction may be drawn between
inculpatory statements and statements
alleged to be merely exculpatory...... In
fact, statements merely intended to be
exculpatory by the defendant are often
used to impeach his testimony at trial or
to demonstrate untruths in the statement
given under interrogation and thus to
prove guilt by implication. These
statements are incriminating in any
meaningful sense of the word and may
not be used without the full warnings
and effective waiver required for any
other statement...."

And as if the British Parliament were anticipating the Human
Rights Act, 1998. it, by section 82(1) of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984 (known as PACE), defined the word confession
to mean-
"Any statement wholly or partly adverse
to the person who made it".
Under that section, an adverse statement can be in words or
conduct, such as a nod or holding up one's hand, and the court will
direct the jury to consider the confession, that is the mixed
statement as a whole to decide where the truth his.
It is, therefore, time to redefine the term 'confession".
preferably by legislation; but as the definition in Pakala was judge-
made, the Judges can also assume that responsibility.
Section 162, by its subsection (1), Cr.P.C, prohibits the
use of a statement, made by a witness or an accused, to a police
officer in the course of investigation for any purpose at any inquiry
or trial in respect of any offence under investigation, except to
contradict a witness called for the prosecution in the manner
provided by Article 190 of the Qanun. However, nothing in section
162 shall, subsection (2) thereof enacts, "be deemed to apply to any
statement falling within the provisions of section 46, clause (1) of
the Qanun, or to affect the provisions of Article 40 of the Qanun".
The words "or to affect the provisions of section 27" (now Article
40 of the Qanun) were added in 1941, perhaps in the light of the
Privy Council's observations in Pakala (AIR 1939 PC 46) made in
answer to the contention that section 162, as it then stood, had the
effect of repealing section 27 (now Article 40 of the Qanun); said
Lord Atkin:
"It is obvious that the two sections
(section 162 Cr.P.C. and section 27 of
the Evidence Act) can in some
circumstances stand together. Section
162 is confined to statements made to a
518
an
police officer in course of
investigation. Section 25 (now Article
38) covers a confession made to a police
officer before any investigation has
begun or otherwise not in the course of
an investigation. Section 27 (now Article
40 of the Qanun) seems to be intended to
be a proviso to section 26 which
includes any statement made by a person
whilst in custody of the police and
appears to apply to such statements to
whomsoever made e.g. to a fellow
prisoner, a doctor or a visitor. Such
statements are not covered by section
162. Whether to give to section 162 the
plain meaning of the words is to leave
the statement still inadmissible even
though a discovery of fact is made such
as is contemplated by section 27 it does
not seem necessary to decide".
The effect of the addition of the words "or to affect the provisions
of section 27" seems to be to save section 27 (now Article 40 of the
Qanun) so that a statement covered by section 162 Cr.P.C. if it
leads to some discovery, is now provable. As was held in Stat v
Deoman (AIR 1960 SC 1125, 1129)-
"Section 162 Cr.P.C, also enacts a rule
of evidence. This section in so far as it is
material for purposes of this case.
prohibits, but not so as to affect the
admissibility of information to the extent
permissible under section 27 of the
Evidence Act, use of statements by any
person to a police officer in the course of
an investigation under Chapter 14 of the
Code in any inquiry or trial in which
such person is charged for an offence

under investigation at the time when the
statement was made".
It is to be noted that section 27, as it stood in the 1872 Act, began
with the word 'Provided'; hence the observation in Pakala that
section 27 was a proviso to section 26. In the Qanun, Article 39 is a
reproduction of section 26, but in Article 40 (previous section 27)
the word "Provided" has been deleted.
Voluntariness is the test:
The well known rule, peculiar to English Law and its
derivative systems, said Lord Hailsham in Director of Public
Prosecution v Ping Lin (1975) 3 All ER 175), is that to be
admissible, confessions, however convincing, must be voluntary in
the sense that the prosecution must prove, and prove beyond
reasonable doubt, in the classic words of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v
The King (1914) AC 599.609:
"that it has not been obtained from him
by fear of prejudice or hope or
advantage exercised (excited) or held out
by a person in authority".
Article 37 of the Qanun enacts this rule expressly, and
Articles 38 and 39 of the Qanun enact this rule impliedly, for they
proceed on the supposition that the police of our country is not to
be trusted and that confessions made to them or even to any other
person by an accused in police custody are not therefore to be
treated as voluntary.
In Muhammad Amjad v Sate (PLD 2003 SC 704, 717).
Nazim Hussain Siddiqui J. said:
"Articles 37, 38 and 39 of Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984, corresponding to
sections 24, 25 and 26 of the Evidence
Act are relevant to determine the criteria
520
as to which statement could be treated as
confession. In criminal cases great
responsibility rests upon the courts to
determine if the confession is voluntary
and true or is lacking within the scope of
either term 'voluntary' and 'true'. If the
confession directly or indirectly is the
result of inducement, threat or promise
from a person in authority, it would be
treated as not voluntary. Voluntary and
true are two different terms related with
confession and each of them has its own
significance. A confession, which is
voluntary, is admissible even though it
may be incorrect in its contents. As
against above, a confession which is not
I voluntary is not admissible though it
may be true, whether a confession is
voluntary and true is a question of fact
and is to be determined keeping in view
the attending circumstances of each case.
Voluntariness of confession and of being
true are totally distinct Voluntarily
relates to its admissibility while its truth
is looked into for the purpose of
assessing its value. Therefore, for
proving confession it shall be both
voluntary and true".
Lest the words "for proving confession it shall be both
voluntary and true" in the above statement of the law are
misunderstood, the statement must be read as a whole and so read,
as we understand it, it means that voluntariness is the test of
admissibility and if the confession is voluntary, and, therefore,
admissible, the court will then determine whether it is true. If it is
both voluntary and true, then it is proof against its maker. If the
confession is not voluntary, the confession is inadmissible and the
question of determining its truth would not arise.

Article 41 saves a confession hit by Article 37, if it was
made after "the impression caused by any such inducement, threat
or promise has, in the opinion of the court, been fully removed".
Such a confession will be treated to have been made voluntarily.
All about Article 40 of the Qanun:
Article 40 reads:
"How much of information received from accused
may be proved: When any fact is deposed to as
discovered in consequence of information received from
a person accused of an offence in the custody of a police
officer so much of such information whether it amounts
to confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact
thereby discovered, may be proved".
According to the Privy Council in Palukuri Kotayya v King (AIR
1947 PC 67) section 27 of the 1872 Act was "not artistically
worded". We have seen that section began with the word
'Provided. Article 40 has laid to sleep at least one controversy,
namely, whether it is a proviso to Article 39 of the Qanun (Article
26 of the Act). There is, however, no doubt that the rule in Article
40 is an exception to the rule enacted in Article 39; that Article
begins with the words "subject to Article 40", which indicates the
legislative intent that Article 40 is by way of exception to Article
39. Thus, a confession made by any person in police custody
cannot be proved unless:
(i)
(ii)
it is, as Article 39 itself provides, made in the
immediate presence of a Magistrate; or
when, as Article 40 says, a fact is deposed to
as discovered in consequence of information
received from the accused in police custody.
Rationale and Scope:
One of the best statements of the scope and rationale of
Article 40 (section 27 of 1872 Act) if we may say with respect is to
be found in Palukuri. In that case, the accused were charged with
murder. Some of them made statements to the police, when
arrested, that the spear "with which I stabbed I hid in a particular
place". As a result of that statement, the spear was recovered. The
High Court, relying upon the statement with which I stabbed.
convicted the accused. The Privy Council observed that section 27
provided an exception to the prohibition imposed by section 26-
"and enables certain statements made by
a person in police custody to be proved.
The condition necessary to bring the
section into operation is that the
discovery of a fact in consequence of
information received from a person
accused of any office in the custody of a
police officer must be deposed to and
thereupon so much of the information as
relates distinctly to the fact thereby
discovered may be proved.
The section seems to be based
on the view that if a fact is actually
of
discovered in consequence
information given, some guarantee is
afforded thereby that the information
was true, and accordingly can be safely
allowed to be given in evidence, but
clearly the extent of the information
admissible must depend on the 'exact
nature of the fact discovered to which
such information is required to relate.
Normally the section is brought into
operation when a person in police
custody produces from some place of
522
523
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 280
concealment some object, such as a dead
body, weapon or ornaments, said to be
connected with the crime of which the
informant is accused. Mr. Megow for the
Crown has argued that in such a case the
fact discovered is the physical object
produced, and that any information
which relates distinctly to that object can
be proved. On this view information
given by a person that the body
produced is that of a person murdered by
him, that the weapon produced is the one
used by him in the commission of
murder, or that the ornaments produced
were stolen in a dacoity, would all be
admissible. If this be the effect of section
27, little substance would remain in the
ban imposed by the two preceding
sections on confessions made to the
police by persons in police custody. That
ban was presumably inspired by the fear
of the legislature that a person under
police influence might be induced to
confess by the exercise of undue
pressure. But if all that is required to lift
the ban be the inclusion in the
confession information relating to an
object subsequently produced, it seems
reasonable to suppose that the persuasive
power of the police will prove equal to
the occasion, and that in practice the ban
will lose its effect. It is fallacious to treat
the fact 'discovered" within the section
as equivalent to the object produced; the
fact discovered embraces the place from
which the object is produced and the
knowledge of the accused as to this, and
the information given must relate
524
distinctly to this fact. Information as to
past user, or the past history, of the
object produced is not related to its
discovery in the setting in which it is
discovered. Information supplied by a
person in custody that 'I will produce a
knife in the roof of my house' does not
lead to the discovery of a knife; knives
were discovered many years ago. It leads
to the discovery of the fact that a knife is
concealed in the house of the informant
to his knowledge, and if the knife is
proved to have been used in the
commission of the offence, the fact
discovered is very relevant. But if to the
statement the words be added 'with
which I stabbed A', these words are
inadmissible since they do not relate to
the discovery of the knife in the house of
the information".
Article 40 is subject to the constitutional right against
self-incrimination:
This topic has been discussed in the Constitutional
Criminal Procedure Part of this book, with reference to the
American 5 Amendment and Article 13(b) of the Constitution of
Pakistan; they guarantee the right against self-incrimination; in the
words of Article 13(b) of the Pakistan Constitution, no person
"shall, when accused of an offence, be compelled to be a witness
against himself. It is sufficient to say here that the main object of
interrogation by the police of a suspect in custody, is to get
information relating to the crime under investigation. Even if the
suspect does not confess, in the technical sense given to
'confession' in Puluka, his interrogation might yield important
clues to the mystery. Article 13(b)of the Constitution does not use
the word 'confession'; it is enough to bring the case within the
prohibition of Article 13(b) that the accused was compelled to be a
525
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 281
witness against himself. And to determine 'compulsion', the fact
that he was in police custody, that the interrogation leading to the
discovery of an incriminating article was made in the oppressive.
suffocating and humiliating atmosphere of the police station will
all be weighed in the scale.
In a recent English case, Lam Chi-Ming. (1991) AC
212) the accused made a confession to murder which was obtained
by oppression. Part of the confession disclosed that the knife used
in the murder was at a particular place. The discovery of the knife
was held to be inadmissible on the ground that it was against self-
incrimination rule.
In that connection it is well to recall the American
exclusionary rule, discussed in the Constitutional Criminal
Procedure part of this book, namely that evidence obtained in
violation of the Constitution is inadmissible in evidence.
Confession made under promise of secrecy or deception:
If a confession is otherwise relevant, it does not, Article
42 so enacts, "become irrelevant merely because it was made under
a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practiced on
the accused for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk
or because it was made in answer to questions which he need not
have answered, whatever may have been the form of the questions,
or because he was not warned that he was not bound to make such
confession, and that evidence of it might be given against him".
This provision "shall not apply to the trial of cases under
the laws relating to enforcement of Hadood"; but we also wonder if
this Article can stand scrutiny under Article 13(b) of the
Constitution. Some of the cases noticed under the American 5
Amendment in the Constitutional Criminal Procedure Part of this
book will shed some light on the constitutional validity of this
Article.
526
Contrast Article 42 with Article 36 of the Qanun. The
latter provides that-
"In civil cases no admission is relevant.
if it is made either upon an express
condition that evidence of it is not to be
given or under circumstances from
which the court can infer that the parties
agreed together that evidence of it
should not be given".
But "nothing in this Article shall be taken to exempt any advocate
from giving evidence of any matter of which he may be compelled
to give evidence under Article 9". The reference here to Article 9
of the Qanun is to cases covered by the proviso to Article 9.
Effect of confession against its maker and others;
Section 30 of the Evidence Act, 1872 read:
"When more persons than one are being
tried jointly for the same offence and
confession made by one of such persons
affecting himself and some other of such
persons is proved, the court may take
into consideration such confession as
against such other person as well as
against the person who makes such
confession".
Section 30 of the 1872 Act was considered by the Privy
Council in Bhuboni Sahu v King (PLD 1949 PC 90), and it was
held that-
"Confession of a co-accused is
obviously evidence of a very weak type.
It does not indeed come within the
definition of 'evidence' contained in
527
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 282
section 3 (of the Act). It is not required
to be given on oath, nor in the presence
of the accused, and it cannot be tested by
cross-examination. It is much weaker
type of evidence than the evidence of an
approver which is not subject to any of
these infirmities. Section 30, however,
provides that the court may take the
confession into consideration and
thereby no doubt makes it evidence on
which the court may act; but the section
does not say that the confession is to
amount to proof. Clearly there must be
other evidence. The confession is only
one element in the consideration of all
the facts proved in the case; it can be put
in the scale and weighed with the other
evidence. The -confession of a co
accused can be used only in support of
other evidence and cannot be the
foundation of a conviction".
These observations were highlighted and followed in the majority
judgment of the Supreme Court in Z A Bhutto case (PLD 1979 SC
53, para 129 of Chief Justice Anwar-ul-Haq's judgment).
It appears that it was in the light of these observations
that Article 43 of the Qanun was drafted. It reads:
"When more persons than one are being tried jointly for
the same offence and a confession made by one of such
persons is proved-
(a)
(b)
such confession shall be proof
against the person making it; and
the court may take into
consideration such confession as
circumstantial evidence against
such other person",
The position under Article 43 now seems to be that if a confession
is otherwise relevant and admissible, it is proof against its maker,
o that it can be the foundation of his conviction without
corroboration. But as regards its use against a co-accused, it can be
taken into consideration as 'circumstantial evidence' against him.
Artistically, the expression "circumstantial evidence" is not a
happy choice; the intention seems to have been that such a
confession may be used against a co-accused as 'corroborative
evidence'.
Judicial confession:
A confession is judicial confession if it is made during
investigation and is recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C (Qazi
Pervaiz Iqbal v State - PLD 1976 Kar. 583, cited with approval in
Z A Bhutto case, PLD 1979 SC 53, para 127 of Chief Justice
Anwar-ul Haq's judgment); and if judicial confession' means
confession before a judicial officer, then a confession made before
the court during trial, e.g. under section 342 Cr.P.C. may also be
treated as "judicial confession'.
A statement or confession made in the course of any
investigation may be recorded by a Magistrate under section 164
Cr.P.C. Only a Magistrate of the Ist Class and a Magistrate of the
2nd Class specially empowered in that behalf by the Provincial
Government is competent to record a statement or confession made
to him in the course of any investigation or at any time afterwards
before the commencement of the inquiry or trial.
The subject of confessions recorded under section 164
read with section 364 Cr.P.C. has been admirably encapsulated in
Chapter 13 of the High Court Rules and Orders Vol. III. The object
of recording a confession in accordance with section 164 read with
section 364 Cr.P.C. is to provide a method of securing a reliable
record of statements or confessions made during the course of
529
528
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 283
police investigation which can be used if necessary during the trial.
Under Article 91 of the Qanun, a court is bound to presume that a
statement of confession of an accused person taken in according
with law and purporting to be signed by any Judge or Magistrate is
genuine and that the certificate or note as to the circumstances
under which it was taken are true and that such statement of
confession was duly taken. The words "taken in accordance with
law" in Article 91 are very important and it is essential that in
recording a statement or confession under section 164 Cr.P.C. the
provisions of that section are strictly followed. The evidential value
of a confession depends upon its voluntary character and the
precision with which it is reproduced and the safeguards provided
in section 164 are meant to secure this end. These safeguards are of
great importance, as confessions are often retracted at a later stage
and it becomes necessary for the court to ascertain whether the
alleged confession was actually and voluntarily made. The mere
fact that a confession is retracted does not render it inadmissible in
evidence, but the court has to scrutinize any such confession with
the utmost care and accept it with the greatest caution. These
considerations and tendency of the police, now judicially
recognized, to direct their attention to securing a confession.
especially in unwitnessed incidents, should serve to show how
serious is the responsibility entrusted to the Magistrates under
section 164 Cr.P.C. (Queen v Babu Lal ILR 6 All. 509, cited in
Naqeebulla v State-PLD 1978 SC 21, 33).
Oral evidence of such a confession cannot be allowed,
for the rule "which applies is that where a power is given to do a
certain thing in a certain way the thing must be done in that way or
not at all (Nazir Ahmad v King - AIR 1936 PC 253, cited in
Muhammad Aslam case-PLD 1978 SC 298, 309).
It should be mentioned here that Chapter 13 of the High
Court Rules and Orders Vol. III does two things:
i)
states the law on the subject of confessions.
and
530
ii)
gives instructions as to how Magistrates
should proceed with the recording of
confessions and how to deal with the
confessing accused persons after they have
made the confession.
As regards the instructions, it has been held that they are
merely directory in their nature. "The sole object and the dominant
purpose behind all these instructions........is that they (Magistrates)
must always make a real and earnest endeavour to ensure that the
confessions of the accused recorded by them are free and voluntary
and are not caused by any inducement, threat or promise". In
recording a confession, "the Magistrate must always apply himself
fully, diligently and in all seriousness as a matter of solemn duty to
this task entrusted to him under the law. He cannot be casual and
remiss or act mechanically in the enquiries made from the accused
before recording his confession. He should endeavour to place him
at ease, dispel all or any of the lurking fears inducing hope or
promise from his mind to enable him if he so chooses, to make of
his own volition and absolutely free and voluntary statement
according to the best dictates of his own inner conscience. The
Magistrate before proceeding to record the confession must fully
assure himself and satisfy his own judicial conscience about it"
(Naqeebullah v State PLD 1978 SC 21, 30).
Retracted Confession
When a confession is retracted at the trial, the rule of
caution universally applied is that it should not be acted upon
unless corroborated in material particulars by reliable evidence
(Nadir Hussain v the Crown 1969 SCMR 442; Dhani Bakhsh v
State PLD 1975 SC 187). In Dhani Bakhsh case (PLD 1975 SC
187), it was held to be well established "that a retracted judicial
confession is seldom made the basis of conviction without being
materially corroborated and even if a confession is proved to have
been voluntarily made it must further be established that it was
true. For the purpose of establishing its truth it is necessary to
examine the confession and compare it with the rest of the
531
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 284
prosecution evidence and the probabilities of the case (Naqeebullah
v State PLD 1978 SC 21, 32).
To be read as a whole
It is also well-settled that a confession must be read as a
whole (Riaz Hussain Shah v State - PLD 1995 SC 336, 341)
Extra-judicial confession
Extra judicial confession is a confession before any
person other than a Magistrate. Evidence of extra judicial
confession alone without any corroboration is not sufficient to
maintain a conviction (Ahmad Hasan v State-2001 SCMR 505
and Zia-ur-Rehman v State-2001 SCMR 1405)
Motive Evidence:
Motive has two distinct but related meanings. In the first
sense, it means an emotion prompting an act. In the second sense it
means intention or purpose. It is in the first sense that it is used in
criminal cases. Motive is the emotion that gives rise to the intention
(Muhammad Ishaq v State - 1992 PCL 2059) For example.
motive for murder may be jealousy, fear, hatred, desire for money,
perverted lust or even, as in so called mercy killings, compassion
or love (Reg y Hyam (1975) AC 55, 73 HLS
Under Article 21 of the Qanon, "Any fact is relevant
which shows or constitutes a motive or preparation for any fact in
issue or relevant fact"
Motive evidence is not only relevant but also, as was
held in Abdur Rashid case (PLD 1975 SC 2271, often helpful to the
investigating agency as well as the court. Its importance, however,
depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. For the
police, it steers and determines the course of investigation. Its
established existence and strong nature proved by reliable evidence
when put in the scales along with the ocular and other evidence
832
does often tend to set at rest some lurking suspicions and satisfy
the judicial conscience. Of course, there may be cases where even
the strongest motive may be wholly inept owing to absence or
weakness of direct evidence. Conversely, the weakness of motive
or even its conspicuous absence might not be helpful to the accused
against whom unimpeachable ocular evidence is available. As has
often been said, proof of motive loses importance if there be strong
evidence to prove that the crime was committed by the person
accused (Muhammad Ilyas v State - PLD 1967 SC 443, 447)
Motive precedes action. It is principally a kind of
circumstantial evidence. By itself it neither proves nor disproves
any assertion conclusively (Moazam Shah v Mohsin Shah PLD
2001 SC 458, 463). It is evidence of the background or history
relevant to the offence.
In ordinary human conduct where killing takes place by
design, it is not without a motive strong or weak. This is not to say
that murders are not committed wantonly without any motive
whatsoever. Motiveless murders do occur owing to mad or reckless
acts of inhuman nature. Sometimes a motive lies mysteriously
hidden in the mind of the killer with no means to dig it on the
surface. But it may be stated as a rule of prudence in judging
human conduct that where a motive is alleged by prosecution
which is found to be false, it becomes all the more necessary to
scrutinize the credentials of the witnesses who by their evidence
direct or indirect speak about the guilt of an accused person on the
premises of a false motive (Habibullah v State PLD 1969 SC 127).
Motive of crime may not be known or it may not have
been discovered. The rule, therefore, is that the prosecution is not
obliged to set up or prove a motive; but just as presence of motive
can greatly strengthen the case for the prosecution so its absence
can weaken it (Reg. v Sharmpal Singh (1962) AC 188, 197).
Although the prosecution does not have to prove motive.
evidence of motive is always admissible in order to show that it is
more probable that the accused committed the offence charged.

Previous enmity is a double edged weapon and cuts both
ways. If enmity is considered as sufficient motive for the
commission of an offence, it can also be considered as sufficient
motive for false implication (State v Muhammad Sharif - 1995
SCMR 635, 647).
Chapter 9
EXAMINATION OF THE ACCUSED
Under section 342 Cr.P.C.
Section 342 Cr.P.C. provides that for the purpose of
enabling him to explain any circumstances appearing in the
evidence against him, the court may at any stage of an inquiry or
trial without previously warning the accused put such questions to
him as the court considers necessary, and shall for the purpose
aforesaid question him generally on the case after the witnesses for
the prosecution have been examined and before he is called on for
his defence. The answers given by the accused may be taken into
consideration in such an inquiry or trial and put in evidence for and
against him in any other inquiry or trial.
Sub-section (4) of section 342 provides: "Except as
provided by sub-section (2) of section 340, no oath shall be
administered to the accused".
It will be noticed that section 342 Cr.P.C. has two parts:
the first empowers the court to put any question it considers
necessary at any stage of an inquiry or trial: this is a discretionary
power, under the second part the court shall, that is to say, it is
mandatory for the court, for the purpose of enabling the accused to
explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against him,
to question him generally.
The whole object of section 342 Cr.P.C. is to provide an
opportunity to the accused to explain the circumstances which are
relied upon by the prosecution as established in the case against
him (Amin-ul-Haque v Crown PLD 1952 FC 63, 70). Section
342 Cr.P.C. aims at bringing to the notice of the accused such
points of evidence as are likely to influence the mind of the court to
draw adverse inference against him and to give him chance if he so
desires to offer his version or to explain circumstances appearing in
evidence against him (Shabbir Ahmad v the State - PLD 1995 SC
343, 347). The object is not to cross-examine the accused or to
resort to unduly detailed examination which savours of cross-
examination, nor is it to fill up gaps in the prosecution case (Abdul
Wahab v Crown PLD 1955 FC 88; Jamal v State - PLD 1960
WP Lah 1192, 1195). In other words, the judicial questioning
should not become inquisitorial (Mohyuddin v Emperor - AIR
1925 Pat. 414).
The requirement of section 342 Cr.P.C. is to put all the
circumstances appearing in the evidence against the accused so that
he has opportunity to explain them. An omnibus question such as
"you have heard the evidence, what is your defence" would hardly
meet this requirement (Abdul Wahab x Crown PLD 1955 FC 88,
91).
Statement of accused must be read as a whole
It is well settled that the statement of an accused under
section 342 Cr.P.C. has to be read in its entirety. It is to be accepted
or rejected as a whole. It is not permissible to accept the
inculpatory part to corroborate the prosecution evidence and reject
the exculpatory part (See among others Shabbir Ahmad v State
PLD 1995 SC 343). This assumes importance where the accused
makes his statement admitting the commission of the offence
simultaneously raising a plea constituting his defence. In such a
case, the court will not accept the inclupatory portion and reject the
exculpatory one (Shabbir Ahmad v State PLD 1995 SC 343).
534

Effect of non-compliance with the provisions of section 342:
One view is that, when the prosecution relies upon a fact
as evidence against the accused, but that fact is not put to the
accused in his examination under the second part of section 342,
sub-section (1) Cr.P.C., and he is thereby deprived of an
opportunity to explain it, this should deprive the fact of its
evidentiary value with the result that it should be excluded from the
court's consideration. (S.M.K. Alvi v Crown PLD 1953 FC 189;
Abdul Salam Molla-PLD 1955 FC 129; Munawar Ahmad v State
- PLD 1956 SC (Pak) 300; Dwarkanath v Emperor - AIR 1939 PC
124). The other view is that ultimately the question may turn on
whether the non-compliance was an error or omission within the
meaning of section 537 Cr.P.C. and had resulted in miscarriage or
failure of justice; (Abdul Wahab v Crown PLD 1955 FC 88; M.
Sonafar Ali v State -1969 SCMR 461: Saleh Muhammad v State -
1971 SCMR 260; Allah Dad v State PLD 1978 SC 1) so that the
non-compliance will not result in vitiating the trial or in the
exclusion of the particular piece of evidence unless it had caused
prejudice to the case of the accused. After considering a large
number of cases for and against the above-stated two views.
Anwar-ul-Haq CJ noticed in Z A Bhutto case (PLD 1979 SC 53,
para 175) the "trend of the more recent decisions of the Privy
Council and indeed of later-day criminal jurisprudence in England
as well as in India" and observed that:
"The swing of the pendulum has been
away from technicality, and greater
endeavour has been made to regard the
substance rather than the shadow and to
administer justice fairly and impartially
as it should be administered, fair to the
accused, fair to the State and fair to the
vast mass of the people for whose
protection penal laws are made and
administered".
The conclusion reached (paras 181 and 182 of Anwar-ul-Haq CJ's
judgment) was as follows:
error
or
"It will be seen that in determining
whether an omission.
irregularity in the conduct of the trial
(including the failure to put some pieces
of evidence to the accused under section
342 Cr.P.C), using the phrase so as to

the trial in any manner, the court must
look to the substance and not to
technicalities and if the accused had a
fair trial and has not been prejudiced in
his defence, then the error, omission or
irregularity would stand cured under the
provisions of section 537 of the Code.
And as the distinction between an
illegality and irregularity is, to borrow
the words of Sir John Beaumont of the
Privy Council in AIR 1947 PC 67, only
one of degree rather than of kind,
nothing turns on this distinction for the
purposes of the application of this
curative section".
If an accused files a written statement in his defence,
that does not abrogate the duty of the court, under section 342
Cr.P.C., to ask him to explain the incriminating circumstances
appearing in the evidence; but where the accused refuses to answer
questions saying that he had said all that he had to say in his
written statement, it will be useless for the court to persist with the
detailed questioning (Rameshan v Emperor AIR 1936 Nagpur
147). In State v Zia-ur-Rehman (PLD 1973 SC 49) the Supreme
Court noticed that the accused had refused to participate in the
proceedings saying that they did not recognize the court or its
proceedings; it did not, it was held, "lie in their mouths now to
complain that they had been deprived of any valuable right..........

Section 342 Cr.P.C. and Article 43 of the Qanun:
We have already considered Article 43 of the Qanun. Its
relationship with section 342 and also with a statement on oath
under section 340 Cr.P.C. is that in statements under these sections,
an accused person, who is being jointly tried with another, may
make a confession, implicating himself and his co-accused but the
co-accused has had no opportunity to explain or rebut that
statement. Under Article 43 of the Qanun, the confession of one
accused against his co-accused may be taken into consideration.
The question is whether such a confession can be taken into
consideration against a co-accused who had had no opportunity to
explain or rebut it. This question was considered by Muhammad
Haleem J. in Qazi Pervaiz Iqbal v State (PLD 1976 Kar. 583):
"Upon a consideration of the authorities
we are inclined to hold that section 30.
Evidence Act (now Article 43 of the
Qanun) does not specify the form the
confession may take........ Section
30 provides an exception to the rule that
an admission can only be used against its
maker under section 21 of the Evidence
Act (Article 34 of the Qanun).
Therefore, in construing section 30 of
the Evidence Act regard must be had to
the fact that the confession which is
sought to be used against the co-accused,
like any other piece of prosecution
evidence, must be proved before the
prosecution closes its side so as to
provide an opportunity to the accused to
rebut it. This being the minimum of a
fair trial, the keyword 'proved must
have relation to the stage of the trial
otherwise it cannot be used in evidence
against him. Concluding, therefore, the
538
implication cannot be on the meaning of
the word 'proved' in section 3 of the
Evidence Act (now Article 2(1)(4) of the
Qanun)".
This statement of the law was approved in Z A Bhutto case (see
para 127 of Anwar-ul-Haq CJ's judgment) in which the statement
under section 342 Cr.P.C. of Z A Bhutto accused was recorded
first: thereafter, statements of his co-accused, containing
confessions implicating themselves and Z A Bhutto accused, were
recorded. As Z A Bhutto had had no opportunity to explain and
rebut those confessional statements in so far as they implicated Z A
Bhutto, they were, as regards Z A Bhutto, excluded from
consideration.
But if the confession, judicial or extra-judicial, by one
accused against his co-accused, is proved in the prosecution
evidence and the same is put to the co-accused in his statement
under section 342 Cr.P.C. thereby affording him opportunity to
explain it, it can be taken into consideration against the co-accused
(ZA Bhutto case, para 132 of Anwar-ul-Haq CJ's judgment).
Connotation of "any circumstances appearing in the evidence
against him"
A confession of an accused person against his co-
accused may, under Article 43 of the Qanun, be "taken into
consideration". As was held by the Privy Council in Bhuboni Sahu
v King (PLD 1949 PC 90) "it does not come within the definition
of evidence contained in section 3 (of the Evidence Act, 1872)".
Yet, as we have seen above, in order to be used against the co-
accused, it must be put to him in his statement under section 342
Cr.P.C. Then, suppose that during the course of the trial, the trial
judge inspects the scene of occurrence and records
"memorandum of any relevant facts observed at such inspection"
under section 539 Cr.P.C. This too is not, strictly speaking,
'evidence'. Yet, it cannot be doubted that any observation by the
trial judge which has a bearing on the guilt of the accused is a
539
a
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 288
circumstance which must be put to him to enable him to explain it
before it can be used against him.
In the context of section 342 Cr.P.C., therefore, the word
'evidence' in the phrase "any circumstances appearing in the
evidence against him" does not seem to be confined to what it is
defined to mean in Article 2, clause (1)(c) of the Qanun.
Effect of failure to answer
The accused does not, subsection (2) of section 342 so
provides, render himself liable to punishment by refusing to
answer questions so put to him or by giving false answers to them
but the court may draw such inference from such refusal or answer
as it thinks just.
Manner of recording accused's statement
The examination of the accused under section 342
Cr.P.C. has to be recorded in the manner provided in section 364
Cr.P.C. The whole of such examination, including every question
put to him and every answer given by him, shall be recorded in full
and such record shall be shown or read to him, or if necessary,
interpreted to him so that he can explain or add to his answers. The
statement shall then be signed by the Magistrate or the Judge, who
shall certify under his own hand that the examination was taken in
his presence and hearing and that the record contains a full and true
account of the statement made by the accused.
Chapter 10
THE ACCUSED ENTERS ON HIS DEFENCE
In trials before Magistrates under Chapter XX Cr.P.C..
section 244, if the Magistrate does not convict the accused on his
admission, or when the accused denies the charge, "the Magistrate
shall proceed to hear the complainant, if any, and take all such
evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution and also
540
hear the accused and take all such evidence as he produces in his
defence".
In trials before the High Courts and Courts of Session
under Chapter XXIIA, section 265F Cr.P.C., if the accused does
not plead guilty or if the accused pleads guilty but the court does
not convict him on his plea, "the court shall proceed to hear the
complainant, if any, and take all such evidence as may be produced
in support of the prosecution.......". When the examination of
witnesses for the prosecution and the examination, if any, of the
accused are concluded, the accused shall be asked whether he
means to adduce evidence. Under sub-section (5) of section 265F.
if the accused puts in any written statement, the court shall file it
with the record. Subsection (6) of that section reads:
"If the accused, or any one of several
accused, says that he means to adduce
evidence, the court shall call on the
accused to enter on his defence and
produce his evidence".
While section 244 says that after the prosecution
evidence, the Magistrate shall also hear the accused", section 265F
says "when the examination of the witnesses for the prosecution"
and "the examination of the accused" are concluded, they mean the
same thing; they mean in the words of section 342 Cr.P.C. that the
accused shall be questioned generally on the case "for the purpose
of enabling the accused to explain any circumstances appearing in
the evidence against him".
Also, section 244 Cr.P.C. does not require the
Magistrate to call upon the accused to enter upon his defence, yet
the requirement that the Magistrate shall "take all such evidence as
he produces in his defence" means the same thing.
Thus, at the end of the accused's examination under
section 342 Cr.P.C, the court of the Magistrate may put two
questions to the accused, first, whether he would give evidence on
541
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 289
oath in disproof of the charges made against him and, two, whether
he would adduce evidence in defence. The accused may not
himself enter into the witness box to give evidence on oath, but that
will not deprive him of the right to lead evidence in his defence.
Accused's right to testify
Section 340 Cr.P.C., by its sub-section(2), requires that
an accused person shall, if he does not plead guilty, give evidence
on oath in disproof of the charges or allegations made against him
or any person charged or tried together with him at the same trial.
But the proviso to subsection (2) says that the accused shall not be
asked and if asked shall not be required to answer any question
tending to show that he has committed or been convicted of any
offence other than the offence with which he is charged or for
which he is being tried, or is of bad character, unless the case falls
in one of the categories mentioned in the proviso.
The question whether an accused has a right to testify as
his own witness has a long history and it is not necessary to weary
the reader with its narration. As was said by Chief Justice Appleton
in a case from American jurisdiction (State v Cleaves - 59 ME.
298 (1871), "the defendant in criminal cases is either innocent or
guilty. If innocent he has every inducement to state the facts which
would exonerate him. The truth would be his protection. But the
defendant having the opportunity to contradict or explain the
inculpative facts proved against him, may decline to avail himself
of the opportunity thus afforded him by the law. His declining to
avail himself of the privilege of testifying is an existent and
obvious fact. It is a fact patent in the case. The Jury cannot avoid
perceiving it. Why should they not regard it as a fact of more or
less weight in determining the guilt or innocence of the guilt......
(Also see Muhammad Ishaq v State-1992 PCr.L.J. 2059, 2077).
It has always been recognized that the right of the
accused to testify was given to help the innocent. Indeed, it made
life more difficult for the guilty. Gradually, however, it seems that
the force of an inference from not testifying came to be considered
542
the equivalent of compelling the accused to furnish or give
evidence against himself and, therefore, repugnant to the self-
incrimination guarantee of the American Fifth Amendment (Addie
Dean Griffin v State 380 US 609; noted in Muhammad Ishaq v
State-1992 P Cr.L.J. 2059, 2077, 2078).
Section 340 Cr.P.C. was first amended by the Law
Reforms Ordinance 1972; it was provided that the accused may
give evidence on oath in disproof of the charges or allegations
made against him..............but-
(i)
(ii)
he could not be called as a witness except on
his own request; and
his failure to give evidence was not to be
made the subject of any comment by the
prosecution or give rise to any presumption
against him or any person charged or tried
together with him at the same trial.
This produced the result that the accused had the option
of either making an unsworn statement under section 342 Cr.P.C.
on which he could not be cross-examined or of giving evidence on
oath and submitting himself for cross-examination. Section 340 as
it stands now was amended in 1985. The present section uses the
word 'shall' and requires that the accused "shall if he does not
plead guilty give evidence on oath in disproof of the charges or
allegations made against him..........". There was a divergence of
judicial opinion on the effect of section 340(2) Cr.P.C. when
considered with reference to the fundamental right guaranteed by
Article 13 of the Constitution. The controversy seems to have been
set at rest in Mst. Amir Khatoon v Faiz Ahmad (PLD 1991 SC
787). In that case, the section was considered in its historical
setting, in the light of section 5 of the Oaths Act 1873, which
provides that "nothing herein contained shall render it lawful to
administer, in a criminal proceeding, oath or affirmation to the
accused person" and Article 13 of the Constitution, which reads:
543
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 290
"No person
a)
b)
shall, when accused of an offence, be
compelled to be a witness against himself".
The right guaranteed by Article 13 is the right not to be
compelled to be a witness against himself, it is also known as the
right of silence. This right has been discussed in the Constitutional
Criminal Procedure part of this book. The question raised in Amir
Khatoon v Faiz Ahmad was whether section 340, subsection (2)
Cr.P.C had changed the basic principle of criminal jurisprudence
namely that the prosecution shall prove its case and the accused
would not be burdened with the proof of his innocence and as to
what is the import, effect and implication of section 340 on the
right of an accused as guaranteed by Article 13 paragraph (b) of the
Constitution. It was held that the view that on the strength of these
provisions the accused can be compelled to make a statement on
oath and that on his failure to do so he can be sent to prison or that
adverse inference can be drawn against him is not correct.
Of some relevance to the question are the observations
in Shah Wali v State (PLD 1993 SC 32). That was a case under the
Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order 1979, Heroin was
recovered from the front passenger seat of a car occupied by the
two accused persons. The accused were content to deny the
recovery. The courts below found them guilty. The plea before the
Supreme Court was that the prosecution had failed to prove
exclusive possession of the heroin by either of the two accused
persons. It was held that "under the present constitutional and
juridical set up in Pakistan the old notion so called of the
entitlement of an accused person to tell a lie and divert the court in
wrong channels of inquiry cannot be accepted, particularly when
the amended law provides abundant opportunity and scope for the
accused to make deposition as a witness and also to state the truth
in that capacity. While accepting all benefits from the court to
follow the presumption of innocence till proved guilty, the accused
cannot be absolved of his duty to help the court to discover the
544
truth if need be by appearing as a witness for himself and divulging
the truth. If this culture of criminal litigation gets evolved in true
spirit of the present legal, constitutional, juridical and Islamic
ethos, new avenues of protection of the accused interest would
open...
Comments as to the implications of the ratio in Amir
Khatoon v Faiz Ahmad (PLD 1991 SC 787) were made in
Muhammad Ishaq v State (1992 P Cr.L.J. 2059, 2075) and as the
law is developed on a case to case basis, those comments and the
observations in Shah Wali v State (PLD 1993 SC 32) can be
helpful in a future case. As has been noticed in Muhammad Ishaq
case, the provision that an accused shall not be compelled to be a
witness against himself, is, to borrow from an American case
noticed there, like the rain descending upon the innocent and guilty
alike. In England, the law had not developed on the same lines as
in Pakistan. As the Privy Council said in Haw (1981) 3 All ER 14),
a case from Singapore, English Law has always recognized the
right of the deciders of fact in a criminal trial to draw inferences
from the failure of a defendant to exercise his right to give
evidence and thereby to submit himself to cross-examination. It
would in any event be hopeless to expect jurors or judges, as
reasonable men, from doing so.
Defence Evidence
It has been seen that one of the questions to be put to the
accused under section 342 Cr.P.C. is whether he means to adduce
evidence in his defence. What the accused does in answer to such a
question is to state his defence plea and to state also whether he
means or does not mean to adduce defence evidence. If he says that
he means to adduce defence evidence, he may ask the court to
summon a witness for examination or for the production of any
document or thing and the court shall summon the witness, unless
it considers that the object of the application is vexation or delay or
defeating the ends of justice. The defence plea may be a total
denial. For example, the accused may set up a plea of alibi which
means that at the time of occurrence, he was at a place other than
545
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 291
the place of occurrence and his presence elsewhere is essentially
inconsistent with his presence at the time and place of occurrence
and, therefore, with his participation in the crime. Or, the accused
may plead one of the general exceptions contained in Chapter IV,
sections 76 to 106 PPC or a special exception, if any.
Though the burden of establishing guilt is on the
prosecution, yet the court must also consider the evidence for the
defence, which may have one of the three results: it may convince
it of the innocence of the accused, or it may cause it to doubt, in
which case the accused is entitled to an acquittal; or it may and
sometimes does strengthen the case for the prosecution (Bullard v
Queen (1957) AC 635, 645 PC; noticed and relied upon in
Muhammad Ishaq Khan v State (1992) P.Crl.LJ. 2059, 2075).
Thus in Muhammad Ishaque Khan v State (1992 P.Crl.L.J. 2059),
the accused had taken the plea of self-defence which, it was found,
made great demand upon one's sense of credulity and the defence
evidence, by its inherent improbabilities, was held to lend strength
to prosecution's case.
When the burden is on accused:
There are then cases in which the law places the burden
of proof of a particular fact on the accused. As has been seen under
the heading "Burden of Proof" in an earlier part of this book, the
burden on the accused in all such cases is not as heavy as on the
prosecution; he is not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt,
and may discharge the burden on the balance of probabilities.
Chapter 11
ARGUMENTS
In trials before the High Courts and Courts of Session,
after the evidence of the prosecution, examination of the accused,
and evidence of the accused, have concluded, the court hears
arguments. Section 265G Cr.P.C. provides that in cases where the
accused, or any one of several accused, does not adduce evidence
in his defence, the court shall, on the close of the prosecution case
546
and examination of the accused, call upon the prosecutor to sum up
his case. After the prosecutor has done so, the accused shall make a
reply. Where the accused or any of the several accused examines
evidence in his defence, the court shall, on the close of the defence
evidence, call upon the accused to sum up the case. After he has
done so, the prosecutor shall make a reply.
There is no such provision in Chapter XX which governs
the trial of cases by Magistrates. Despite the absence of an express
provision to that effect in Chapter XX, the practice is, and it is a
salutary practice more in accord with the principle of fairness, that
arguments are heard by the courts of Magistrates also. As the
matter concerns the right of hearing, the courts proceed on the
principle that absence of an express provision does not mean the
absence of power to do a thing which is necessary for a just
decision of the case.
Chapter 12
ORDERS INCLUDING ORDER OF ACQUITTAL THAT
MAY BE NECESSARY TO BE MADE DURING TRIAL
After the court has heard final arguments, the stage has
reached for the final judgment of acquittal or conviction but during
the course of trial also, the court has power to make various orders.
including an order of acquittal. They include the following:
Cases which the Magistrate cannot, or does not want to, hear
Section 346 Cr.P.C. provides that if in the course of an
inquiry or trial before a Magistrate, the evidence appears to him to
warrant a presumption that the case is one which should be tried or
sent for trial to the Court of Session or the High Court or to some
other Magistrate, he shall stay proceedings and submit the case
with a brief report to the Sessions Judge or to such other Magistrate
having jurisdiction as the Sessions Judge directs. This may involve
547
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 292
a case in which the evidence discloses that the Magistrate lacks
territorial jurisdiction, or a case which is triable exclusively by a
Special Magistrate. Section 347 provides for a case when it appears
to the Magistrate at any stage of the proceedings that the case is
one which ought to be tried by the Court of Session, in which case
he shall send the case to the Court of Session. A case in which the
Magistrate finds from the evidence that the offence should be
punished with a sentence which is beyond his power to inflict, is
one of the categories which falls within this section. Section 348
makes provision for a case in which on account of a previous
conviction under Chapter XII or XVII PPC, the Magistrate thinks
that the case should be tried by the Court of Session or High Court.
In such a case he may send the case to the Court of Session or High
Court. Section 349 provides among others for the procedure when
a Magistrate of the 2nd class or 3 class finds that the accused is
guilty and that he ought to receive a punishment different in kind or
more severe than that which he is empowered to inflict. This
section requires a Magistrate to record his opinion and to submit
his proceedings and forward the accused to a Magistrate of the 1"
Class specially empowered by the Provincial Government.
Orders of acquittal etc. during the trial
There are situations in which the court may not proceed
to final judgment and may have to record an order of acquittal
during the course of the trial.
Thus,
i)
ii)
under section 247, when the court has taken
cognizance on a complaint and the
complainant does not appear on the day
appointed for the appearance of the accused or
on a subsequent date of hearing, the
Magistrate may acquit the accused unless for
some reason he thinks it proper to adjourn the
hearing to some other date;
section 248 provides that if a complainant at
any time before a final order satisfies the
iii)
Magistrate that there are sufficient grounds
for permitting him to withdraw his complaint.
the Magistrate may permit him to do so and
"shall thereupon acquit the accused";
sections 249-A and 265-K Cr.P.C. empower
the court to acquit an accused at any stage of
the trial if, after hearing the prosecutor and the
accused and for reasons to be recorded, it
considers that the charge is groundless or that
there is no probability of the accused being
convicted of any offence. That the charge is
groundless may mean that there is not even a
prima facie case against the accused, or that
the facts do not disclose the commission of
any offence or do not constitute the offence
with which the accused is charged. The other
ground is that there is no probability of the
accused being convicted of any offence. Cases
in which the prosecution fails to adduce its
evidence resulting in inexcusable or
unconscionable delay may fall in this
category. For this, the reader is referred to the
discussion under
heading
"Commencement of trial" in a preceding part
of this book, which deals with the provisions
of section 344 Cr.P.C. The power under this
section may be exercised at any stage and
even without recording evidence (Badar-ud-
Din v Mehr Ahmad Raza PLD 1993 SC 399).
The rationale is that if the facts of the case do
not disclose the commission of an offence, the
accused should not suffer the ordeal of trial.

Composition etc. of offences:
Section 345 provides for the compounding of offences.
It provides by its subsection (1) that the offences punishable under
the sections of the Pakistan Penal Code "specified in the first two
columns of the table next following may be compounded by the
persons mentioned in the third column of that table", and
punishable under the sections of the Pakistan Penal Code specified
"in the first two columns of the table next following may, with the
permission of the court..........be compounded by the persons
mentioned in the third column of that table". Included in the table
under subsection (2) of section 345 Cr.P.C. are offences as grave as
murder, grievous hurt. This is a departure from the rule of the
Anglo-Saxon Jurisprudence; to quote from "Salmond on
Jurisprudence",
"A crime
is an act deemed by
law to be harmful to the society in
general, even though its immediate
victim is an individual. Murder injures
primarily the particular victim, but its
blatant disregard of human life puts it
beyond a matter of mere compensation
between the murderer and the victim's
family".
This change by way of amendments of section 345
Cr.P.C. enlarging the category of compoundable offences, and
some other sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure, e.g.
sections 337 and 338, as also the amendments of some of the
provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code to which we shall presently
advert, is the direct result of the Supreme Court's decision in
Pakistan v Gul Hasan Khan (PLD 1989 SC 633), a decision under
Article 203D read with Article 203F of the Constitution of
Pakistan, declaring certain provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code
and the Code of Criminal Procedure "repugnant to the Injunctions
550
of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of the
Holy Prophet........
are
offences which
Besides enumerating the
compoundable and the persons in whom vests the right to
compound each of those offences, section 345 provides further-
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
by its subsection (2a) that a Karo Kari or
Siyah Kari offence under the Pakistan Penal
Code may be waived or compounded subject
to such condition as the court may deem fit to
impose with the consent of the parties;
by its subsection (3), that the abetment of or
attempt to commit a compoundable offence
may be compounded in the same manner as
the offence itself;
by its subsection (4). that if the person
competent to compound is an idiot, under the
age of 18, or a lunatic, the offence may be
compounded by "any person competent to
contract on his behalf with the permission of
the court";
by its subsections (5) and (6), that in an
appeal or revision against conviction of a
compoundable offence, the composition will
be with the leave of the court; and
by its subsection (6), that the composition of
an offence under this section shall have the
effect of an acquittal of the accused.
Subsection (7) of section 345 enacts that-
"No offence shall be compounded except as provided by
this section".
551

Page 294
Sections 337 to 339A which relate to tendering of
pardon to accomplices have also been amended so that no person
shall now "be tendered pardon who is involved in an offence
relating to hurt or Qatl without the permission of the victim or as
the case may be of the heirs of the victim".
The Pakistan Penal Code has also been, in pursuance to
the decision in Gul Hasan, been suitably amended, and
(i)
(ii)
sections 299 to 338 PPC as they originally
stood have been repealed and substituted by
the new sections 299 to 338H;
section 54 PPC has been amended to provide
that "in a case in which sentence of death
shall have been passed against an offender
convicted of an offence of Qatl, such sentence
shall not be commuted without the consent of
the heirs of the victim".
Some of the provisions in the PPC, enacted to give effect
to the decision in Gul Hasan, are of procedural nature. For example
i)
ii)
section 309, titled "waiver (afw) of Qisas in
qati-i-amd", provides that in the case of qatl-i-
amd, an adult sane wali (the term is defined in
section 305 PPC to mean the heirs of the
victim according to his personal law, and if
there is no heir, the Government) may, at any
time and without any compensation, waive his
right of qisas; this section also makes other i
related provisions;
section 310 provides, inter alia, that in the
case of qatl-i-amd, an adult sane wali may, at
any time on accepting badl-i-sulh
(compensation) compound his right of qisas:
552
iii)
the value of badl-i-sulh shall not be less than
the value of divat, which term is defined in
section 299 PPC to mean compensation
specified in section 323 PPC payable to the
heirs of the victim,
Section 311 PPC reads:
"Notwithstanding anything contained in
section 309 or section 310, where all the walis
do not waive or compound the right of gisas
.or if the principle of fasad-fil-arz........is
attracted, the court, having regard to the facts
and circumstances of the case, punish an
offender against whom the right of qisas has
been waived or compounded with death,
imprisonment for life or imprisonment of
either description for a term which may
extend to fourteen years as taazi".
The term "fasad-fil-arz" has been defined in the Explanation to
section 311 PPC to include the past conduct of the offender, or
whether he has any previous convictions, or the brutal or shocking
manner in which the offence has been committed which is
outrageous to the public conscience or if the offender is considered
a potential danger to the community or if the offence has been
committed in the name or on the pretext of honour.
Composition in Hadd and Taazir cases-distinction:
The distinction may well be illustrated with reference to
cases under section 302 PPC. Whoever commits qatl-i-amd is
punishable -
(3)
with death as qisas, provided proof as
provided in section 304 PPC is given; or
553
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 295
(b)
with death or imprisonment for life as taazir,
if proof under section 304 PPC is not
available.
Section 345, subsection (2), Cr.P.C. provides that the offence of
qatl-i-amd punishable under section 302 may be compounded by
the heirs of the victim.
In Khan Muhammad State (2005 SCMR 599), it was
held that sections 209, 310 and 311 PPC apply to qatl-i-amd
punishable with death as qisas that is, under section 302, clause (a)
PPC and "the sentence of death, liable to qisas, has been made
compoundable even if the offence has not been compounded by all
the legal heirs or otherwise, subject to the provisions of sections
309, 310, 311 PPC". But as far as the offence of qatl-i-amd liable
to death by taazir is concerned. (that is, the one falling under
section 302, clause (b)] it has been made compoundable by
enacting section 345(2) Cr.P.C. which says that if all the legal heirs
have compounded the offence, the court is empowered to accord
permission to ensure that the parties may bury their
hatchets..
Thus, for the composition of an offence against section
302(b)PPC, all the heirs of the victim must join in the composition,
but the joining of all the heirs is not necessary for the composition
of offences against section 302(a) PPC. Earlier the same view had
been taken in Muhammad Aslam v Shaukat Ali (1997 SCMR
1307).
Composition where one of the Walls dies leaving
his/her own heirs:
In Ahmad Nawaz v State (PLD 2007 Lah. 121), M, an
unmarried man was murdered. His heirs were his mother B, and his
father A. A died after the incident of murder, and was survived by
children from other wives. The question was whether the children
of A had become walis of M. This turned on the interpretation of
section 305 PPC which provides that in case of qatl, the wali shall
554
be the heirs of the victim according to his personal law. It was held
that section 305-
"clearly states that in case of a qatl, the
wali shall be the heirs of the victim...
And the said provisions do not
contemplate that the heirs of heir of the
victim shall also be wali of the
victim..........
Accordingly, the heirs of A were not the walis of M for the purpose
of composition.
Chapter 14
JUDGMENT AND SENTENCING
Some general observations
(a)
Definition of judgment
The expression judgment" has not been defined in the
Code of Criminal Procedure and is, therefore, to be understood in
its ordinary signification, namely, where a written judgment is
required by law, the document which for the reasons stated therein
concludes the trial and disposes of the proceedings (Munir CJ in
Malik Feroz Khan Noon case - PLD 1958 SC (Pak) 333, 348). In
England, judgment is equivalent to a judgment of conviction or
acquittal and is distinct from other orders in a criminal case, and in
the Code also, it means a judgment of conviction or acquittal. Thus,
neither under the English law nor under the Code, the term
"judgment" in a criminal case includes an interlocutory order
(Horiram Singh v Emperor AIR 1939 FC 43, 48 per Sulaiman J). It
follows that interlocutory orders including bail orders are not
judgments (Gulzar Hasan Shah v Ghulam Murtaza - PLD 1970 SC
335).

To believe a witness reasons to be given
When credibility is a factor it is not ordinarily sufficient
to say that you accept the evidence of witness "A" and reject that
of witness "B". Reasons must be given, that being of the essence of
a judicial pronouncement as distinguished from an administrative
order.
Disparaging or condemnatory remarks
Sometimes it becomes necessary to censure or pass
disparaging or condemnatory remarks against a party or witness.
The judge is competent to do so on the principle that when a person
is examined as a witness, he has the right to give his own version
and the party calling him has an occasion to rehabilitate his credit
by putting him questions in re-examination but the exercise of this
power must be marked with judicial self-restraint. The reason is
that disparaging remarks in a judgment, whether they amount to
verdict or not, imputing crime, moral delinquency or improper
conduct to a person are a constant source of weariness and
irritation to him. They lower him in the public estimation and haunt
him like a specter for life, invariably visiting him whenever he
enters the premises of a court of justice as a witness or a party.
Being fraught with such serious consequences they should only be
made where any hesitation or reluctance in making them would
impede the ends of justice. Persons making or publishing such
remarks, whether true or not, are not liable for libel or for
defamation because in the former.case they are protected by
common law and in the latter by statute the reason being that unless
judges had the power to make bold and fearless comments on the
evidence given before them they would not be able to effectively
discharge their functions. These two conflicting considerations
must always be present to the mind of a judge whenever he is
called upon to criticize the character and conduct of a person (In
the matter of Mr. Hameed-ud-Din PLD 1950 Lah 34, 41 cited
with approval in Malik Feroz Khan Noon case - PLD 1958 SC
(Pak) 333, 359).
556
NO
It is also within the province of the power and duty of an
appellate court or revisional court to comment upon the judgment
or mode of trial adopted by a lower court judge. The degree of
sharpness that can be permitted in the comment would be
determined by the gravity of the irregularity or the injury resulting
there from. For, in all circumstances, the criticism offered would of
necessity fall within the requirements of the dispensation of justice.
But a judge should devote more than ordinary care to the
ascertainment of the facts on which his censure is to be founded for
"it is imperative that the criticism offered should not only be well
informed, but also that it should be well intentioned in a strictly
judicial sense". These are necessary conditions of anything said by
way of reproof or admonition in a solemn judicial pronouncement.
Any criticism directly diminishes the capacity of the judge, who is
criticized, to do justice in matters coming before him. Equally it
affects the standing of the court of which he is an integral part
(This statement of law is based upon the judgment of S. A.
Rehman, J, in Ali Nawaz v Muhammad Yousaf - PLD 1963 SC 51.
81, 82).
Delivery, language etc., of judgment
Chapter XXVI, sections 366 to 373 Cr.P.C. provide for
the mode of delivery of judgment. language of judgment and
contents of judgment etc.
By the trial court
The judgment in every trial in any criminal court of
original jurisdiction shall, so provides section 366 Cr.P.C, be
pronounced or its substance shall be explained in open court either
immediately after the termination of the trial or at some subsequent
time of which notice shall be given to the parties or their pleaders
in the language of the court or in some other language which the
accused or his pleader understands. The whole of the judgment
557
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 297
shall be read out by the presiding judge if he is requested so to do
by either of the parties; the accused shall if in custody be brought
up and if not in custody be required by the court to attend to hear
judgment except where his personal attendance has been dispensed
with and the sentence is one of fine only or he is acquitted in either
of which cases it may be delivered in the presence of his pleader.
Section 367 requires that every judgment shall be
written by the Judge or Magistrate or from his dictation in the
language of the court or in English. The judgment shall contain-
the points for determination;
i)
ii)
iii)
the decision thereon, that is to say, the
findings recorded on all the charges; and
reasons for the decision.
It shall be dated and signed by the Judge or Magistrate in
open court at the time of pronouncing it and where it is not in the
hand-writing of the Judge or Magistrate, every page of such
judgment shall be signed by him. A judgment shall specify the
offence of which and the section of the PPC or other law under
which the accused is convicted and the punishment to which he is
sentenced. Where the judgment is under the Pakistan Penal Code
and it is doubtful under which of two sections or under which two
parts of the same section of that Code, the offence falls, the court
shall distinctly express the same and pass judgment in the
alternative. If it is a judgment of acquittal, it shall state the offence
of which the accused is acquitted and direct that he be set at liberty.
If the accused is convicted of an offence punishable with death and
the court sentences him to any punishment other than death. the
court shall in its judgment state the reason why the sentence of
death was not passed.
Under section 368, when a person is sentenced to death,
the sentence shall direct that he be hanged by the neck till he is
dead.
Except as otherwise provided in the Code or any other
law for the time being in force, no court, when it has signed its
judgment, shall alter or review the same, except to correct a clerical
error. This is so provided by section 369 Cr.P.C.
Sections 366, 367 and 369 must be read together, with
the result that the 'Judgment" which is referred to in section 369
means a judgment which has been delivered, that is to say.
pronounced, in accordance with section 366. Delivering judgment
means pronouncing judgment (Amin Sharif v Syeda Khatoon -
PLD 1962 SC 97, 101). Thus, a verbal or oral announcement of
acquittal without writing and signing the judgment is a nullity, and
despite such announcement, the case was held to be pending
(Mehboob Ali v Qamar Ali 1972 SCMR 109); similarly a mere
writing and signing of a judgment of acquittal without pronouncing
it was also held to be of no legal erfect (Amin Sharif v Syeda
Khatoon PLD 1962 SC 97). Prohibition as to alteration becomes
operative only after it has been signed, and a judgment delivered
orally, without any note in writing duly signed by the judge, can be
altered (Rukan Din v Hafiz-ud-Din - PLD 1962 (WP) Lah. 161).
Under section 371, in every case where the accused is
convicted, a copy of the judgment shall be given to him at the time
of pronouncing the judgment free of cost. This does not apply to
cases tried summarily or where the accused is convicted of an
offence under any law other than the Pakistan Penal Code. When
the accused is sentenced to death by a Sessions Judge, such judge
shall inform him of the period within which if he wishes to appeal,
his appeal should be preferred. In cases tried by the Court of
Session, the court shall forward a copy of its finding or sentence to
the officer-in-charge of prosecution in the district.

Failure to sign the judgment when
pronounced-consequences:
What are the consequences when a judgment is
pronounced but is not signed by the trial court at the time of its
pronouncement as is required by section 367 Cr.P.C? Of course,
when a judgment has not been written and signed by the trial judge
or magistrate at the time of its pronouncement, its copy will not be
supplied to the convict as required by section 371 Cr.P.C. The
courts seem to have treated such an error or defect as a procedural
irregularity not affecting the merits of the case or the jurisdiction of
the court, unless it has occasioned a failure of justice.
This question arose in Firm Gokal Chand y Firm Nand
Ram (AIR 1938 PC 292), with reference to the corresponding
similar provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure. Lord Wright
speaking for the Privy Council observed:
"The rule (Order 41 CPC) does not say
that if its requirements are not complied
the judgment shall be a nullity. So
startling a result would need clear and
precise words. Indeed the rule does not
even state any definite time in which it
be fulfilled. The time is left to be defined
by what is reasonable. The rule from its
very nature is not intended to affect the
rights of the parties to a judgment. It is
intended to secure certainty in the
ascertainment of what the judgment was.
It is a rule which judges do so comply
with for that object. No doubt in practice
judges do so comply as it is their duty to
do. But accidents may happen. A judge
may die after giving judgment but before
he has a reasonable opportunity to sign
it. The court must have inherent
jurisdiction to supply such a defect. The
case of a judge who has gone on leave
before signing the judgment may call for
more comments, but even so the
inconvenience of the court and the
interest of the litigants must prevail. The
defect is merely an irregularity".
This case was followed by the Supreme Court of India in Iqbal
Ismail v State (AIR 1974 SC 1880) in which the question turned on
the provisions of sections 366 and 367 Cr.P.C, and was: can a
convicted person be said to be lawfully imprisoned if at the time of
his conviction the trial judge dictates the judgment but does not
sign the same because of its having not been transcribed? The
petitioner (it was a habeas corpus petition) was convicted under
sections 392 and 397 of the Penal Code and sentenced to 7 years in
prison. The judgment was pronounced on May 12, 1972, and its
copy was not supplied to the petitioner till February 19, 1973. This,
it was noted, was a "rather depressing state of affairs"; yet, the
defect was to be considered with reference to section 537 Cr.P.C.
which provided, inter alia, that no finding, sentence, or order
passed by a court of competent jurisdiction would be reversed or
altered on appeal or revision on account of any error, omission, or
irregularity... unless such error, omission, or irregularity had
in fact occasioned a failure of justice. It was held that the failure to
write and sign the judgment at the time of its pronouncement was a
procedural irregularity and that in the facts of the case, it had not
occasioned a failure of justice.
Confirmation of death sentence by High Court:
Chapter XXVII, sections 374 to 379, of the Code of
Criminal Procedure provide for submission of sentences for
confirmation. Sections 374 and 375 provide that when the Court of
Session passes the sentence of death, the proceedings shall be
submitted to the High Court and the sentence shall not be executed
unless it is confirmed by the High Court. If the High Court thinks
that further inquiry should be made into or additional evidence
taken upon any point bearing upon the guilt or innocence of the
561
560
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 299
convicted person it may make such inquiry or take such evidence
itself or direct it to be made or taken by the Court of Session. When
the inquiry is not made and the evidence is not taken by the High
Court, the result of such inquiry and the evidence shall be certified
to the High Court. The High Court, under section 376, may-
b)
confirm the sentence or pass any other
sentence warranted by law; or
may annul the conviction and convict the
accused of any offence of which the Sessions
Court might have convicted him, or order a
new trial on the same or any other charge, or
may acquit the accused person.
But no order of confirmation shall be made under this
section until the period allowed for an appeal has expired or if an
appeal is presented within such period, until such appeal is
disposed of. Section 377 requires that the confirmation of the death
sentence or any new sentence or order passed by the High Court
shall be made, passed and signed by at least two judges. When a
difference of opinion arises, the case shall be laid before another
judge and such judge after such hearing as he thinks fit shall
deliver his opinion and the judgment or order shall follow such
opinion. A copy of the order of the High Court in cases submitted
for confirmation shall without delay be sent to the Court of
Session.
Judgment of acquittal and question of compensation:
It has been seen that under section 367 Cr.P.C., if it is a
judgment of acquittal, it shall state the offence of which the
accused is acquitted, and direct that he be set at liberty.
In passing a judgment of acquittal, the provisions of
section 250 Cr.P.C. have to be kept in mind. That section provides
that if in any case instituted upon complaint or upon information
562
given to a police officer or to a Magistrate, the Magistrate acquits
the accused and is of opinion that the accusation against him was
false and either frivolous or vexatious, he may by his order of
acquittal call upon the informant or the complainant, as the case
may be, to show cause why he should not pay compensation to
such accused. The Magistrate shall record and consider any cause
which such complainant or informant may show and if he is
satisfied that the accusation was false and either frivolous or
vexatious, may, for reasons to be recorded, direct that
compensation to such amount not exceeding Rs.25.000/-, or if the
Magistrate is a Magistrate of 3 class, not exceeding Rs.2500/- as
he may determine, be paid by such complainant or informant to the
accused. The compensation payable under this section is
recoverable as arrears of land revenue. Further, this payment of
compensation will not exempt the complainant or the informant
from any civil or criminal liability. However, such compensation
shall be taken into consideration in any subsequent civil suit
relating to the same matter. Such an order is to be treated as an
appealable order, as if it were an order of conviction.
Convicting and sentencing - difference:
Conviction and sentence are two different things.
Conviction means to find guilty of an offence. Sentence is the
punishment awarded to a person convicted in a criminal trial.
Conviction is followed by sentence (Abdul Kabir v State 1990
PSC 1081). Only when a person has been found guilty of an
offence can the question of sentencing him arise. (This statement in
the author's book "Access to Justice in Pakistan" has been cited
with approval in the recent case of Shah Hussain v State PLD 2009
SC 460, 491). An order or judgment which merely says, e.g., that
the accused is sentenced to such and such imprisonment is not a
correct order or judgment. The correct order will be to say that the
accused is guilty and convicted of such and such offence and is
sentenced to such and such punishment.

Sentencing:
It is the requirement of fairness that the individual
knows not only what behaviour will be illegal but also what
punishment and penalty may be imposed for such behaviour. This
concept is reflected in the legal maxims Nullum Crimen Sine Lege
and Nulla Poena Sine Lege; the latter simply means that there shall
be 'no crime without punishment'. The prescribed punishment is,
therefore, an integral part of the crime.
We have seen in the Constitutional Criminal Procedure
part of this book that there are a number of constitutional
protections afforded to persons accused of crime during pre-trial
and trial phases. Only two of the protections are relevant to
punishment namely the protection against retrospective punishment
guaranteed by Article 13 of the Constitution and in a way, Article
14 thereof, in so far as it ensures inviolability of the dignity of man
in matters of punishment.
There can be no doubt that the consequences of a
sentence are of the highest importance; if too short, or of the wrong
type, it can deprive the law of its effectiveness and if too severe, it
can reinforce the criminal tendencies of the defendant. In America,
Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984; it classified
federal criminal offences and designated the sentencing range,
stated the purposes to be served by any sentence, established a
commission to promulgate guidelines, required judges to give
reasons for sentencing and for departing from the guidelines.
By the U.S. Amendment VIII, there is a prohibition
against excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishments. On the
question of unusual and cruel punishment, the Supreme Court has
upheld the death penalty, reasoning that-
"the Eighth Amendment's meaning must
be drawn from evolving standards of
decency: that although punishments
must not be excessive in form or severity
and must respect human dignity, the
564
legislature need not select the least
severe sanction available; that capital
punishment could be justified on
retributive and deterrent theories and
that a sentencing authority could impose
a death sentence if properly guided by
statutory standards" (Gregg v Georgia -
428 US 153-1976).
Some of the cases under the Due Process Clause make useful
reading. In Lockett v Ohio (438 US 586-1976), the contention
was that the death sentence awarded to the petitioner was invalid
because the statute under which it was imposed did not permit the
sentencing judge to consider, as mitigating factors, her character.
prior record, age, lack of specific intent to cause death. The
Supreme Court began by "recognizing that the concept of
individualized sentencing in criminal cases generally, although not
constitutionally required, has long been accepted in this country.
Consistent with that concept, sentencing judges have taken a wide
range of factors into account.... And where sentencing
discretion is granted, it generally has been agreed that the
sentencing judge's possession of-the fullest information possible
concerning the defendant's life and characteristics is highly
relevant, if not essential, to the selection of an appropriate
sentence". Although Legislatures remained free to decide how
much discretion in sentencing should be reposed in the judge or
jury in non-capital cases, as regards capital cases, Chief Justice
Burger in his opinion referred to Woodson, where it was held:
"in capital cases the fundamental respect
for humanity underlying the Eighth
Amendment...........requires
consideration of the character and record
of the individual offender and the
circumstances of the particular offence
as a constitutional indispensable part of
the process of inflicting the penalty of
death".
565
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 301
This declaration rested "on the predicate that the penalty of death is
qualitatively different" from any other sentence. The Supreme
Court reversed the death sentence of Lockett and concluded that-
"the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments
(the latter is Due Process Clause) require
that the sentencer, in all but the rarest
kind of capital case, not be precluded
from considering as a mitigating factor
any aspect of a defendant's character or
record and any of the circumstances of
the offence that the defendant proffers as
a basis for any sentence less than death.
We recognize that in non-capital cases,
the established practice of individualized
sentences rests not on constitutional
commands but public policy enacted into
statutes. Given that the imposition
of death by public authority is so
profoundly different from all other
penalties, we cannot avoid the
conclusion that an individualized
decision is essential in capital cases. The
need for treating each defendant in a
capital case with that degree of respect
due the uniqueness of the individual is
far more important than in non-capital
cases.......
In Specht v Patterson (386 US 605-1967), the sentence could be
an indeterminate term of from one day to life without notice and
full hearing. The petitioner argued that his sentence did not satisfy
due process because the sentence could be imposed at a hearing at
which the convict could not confront and cross-examine adverse
witnesses and present evidence of his own; it was held that "Due
process
requires that he be present with counsel, have an
opportunity to be heard, be confronted with witnesses against him,
have the right to cross-examine and to offer evidence of his
own.........
There is, in Pakistan, no statutory guidance available to
the courts in cases in which, e.g. the law provides the punishment
of death or life imprisonment, or the law fixes the maximum
penalty, say, ten years, and leaves it to the court to award any
punishment. one month or ten years. As was observed in
Muhammad Rafiq v State (1995 SCMR 1525, 1531), in which the
offence was under section 13 of the West Pakistan Arms
Ordinance, 1965, and which provided the maximum and minimum
imprisonment-
"This is the only legislative contribution

tariff (a convenient name for the process
by which the length of sentence of

the matter of the length of the prison
Like numerous other
provisions, section 13 of the Ordinance
affords no other guidance for the
exercise of that discretion. Nor does that
section contain a general statement of
the aims in terms of different theories of
punishment such as the "protection of the
public', the 'prevention of crime' and
the reform of the offender'. Decided.

committed. The ranges vary according
to the gravity of the offence, that is, the
sentence must be proportionate to the
offender's culpability and must have
some relation to the gravity of the
offence. Included in them, of course, are
offences which are known to be rampant
at the present time and are 'grave and

for very severe sentences. In such cases.

They expect that criminals who prey on

rapacious conduct

security and confidence in law and
order, should be made themselves to
suffer in requital for the harm they have
done to others. (The Courts and Criminal
Punishment by an Australian Judge, Sir
John Barry, quoted in Sir Rupert Cross's
book)".
The cases from the American jurisdiction mentioned above can
hopefully provide some guidance. In that connection the
philosophy of the classical and positivist schools of criminology is
worth noticing. The classical school philosophy is largely
expressed in the notion that "the punishment should fit the crime"
and the positivist school theory shifts attention from the crime to
the criminal; it is that "the punishment should fit the criminal".
With this was born the idea that rehabilitation of the offender
should be the objective. Obviously, these two philosophies cannot
operate at the some time, and a compromise has to be struck. As
has been said in "Criminal Justice System" by Professors Hazel B.
Kerper and Jerold H. Israel, 2d ed., p 93-
"A statutorily prescribed maximum
punishment for the crime would be set
consistently with the classical viewpoint,
according to the harm done. However,
when it came to sentencing the
individual offender, consideration would
be given for the need to achieve
rehabilitation.
When discretion given to the court is so wide-ranging, as well as
so unguided and unfettered, one is reminded of what US Attorney
General (later Justice of the Supreme Court) Robert H. Jackson
said:
"It is obviously repugnant to one's sense
of justice that the judgment meted out to
an offender should be dependent in large
part on a purely fortuitous circumstance,
namely, the personality of the particular
judge before whom the case happens to
come for disposition".
An example is cases in which for an offence of killing under grave
and sudden provocation, under the old section 304 PPC, one judge
would impose the sentence of six months, another life
imprisonment.
No statute contains, and this is as true of PPC. a general
statement of the aims and objects which the sentencer should seek
to achieve, or is expressed in terms of the different theories,
although there may be references to "protection of the public' or
'prevention of crime" etc. However that may be, the concept of
punishment for homicide and the like offences as recognized in
Islam is relatable to none of the western theories. "It is manifold
wherein the main consideration is the fulfillment of God's will.
This, in turn, is conducive to the improvement, reformation and
preservation of good society. Regarding the citizens, while on the
one hand it serves as strong deterrent for the criminal, on the other,

aggrieved individual is not ignored and the criminal's option for
reform is not stifled" (Muhammad Afzal Zullah, J. in Muhammad
Bashir v State PLD 1982 SC 139, 144).
Proportionality:
To put it in simple terms, the primary object is to fix a
sentence proportionate to the offender's culpability; this is
described as the tariff system (See Cross on "The English
Sentencing System 2d ed p.146). The doctrine of proportionality
requires a nexus between the punishment and the defendant's
blame-worthiness. The heart of the retribution rationale is that a
criminal sentence must be directly related to the personal
culpability of the criminal offender (See South Carolina v Gathers
-104 Ed 2d 876, in which these views have been expressed and
reiterated). As has been said, you cannot use a sledge-hammer to
crack a nut.
The doctrine of proportionality has been recognized in
England. For example, in R v Cunningham (1993) 2 All ER 15.
18), it has been held that the sentence must be commensurate with
the seriousness of the offence. It has been recognized also in
Pakistan (See inter alia, Zafar v State 1999 SCMR 2028 reiterated
in Muhammad Ilyas v Muhammad Sufian - PLD 2001 SC 465,
474; Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari v Federation PLD 1999 SC 57,
192),
Judgment of conviction and question of compensation:
Under section 544A Cr.P.C. when a person is convicted
of an offence in the commission whereof death, or hurt, injury or
mental anguish or psychological damage to any person is caused or
damage to or loss or destruction of any property is caused, the
court shall, when convicting such person, unless for reasons to be
recorded in writing it otherwise directs, order the person convicted
to pay to the heirs of the person whose death has been caused, or to
the person hurt or injured or to the person to whom mental anguish
or psychological damage has been caused, or to the owner of the
property damaged, lost or destroyed, as the case may be, such
compensation as the court may determine having regard to the
circumstances of the case. The compensation payable under this
section is recoverable as arrears of land revenue and the court has
also power to order further that in default of payment or recovery.
the person ordered to pay such compensation shall suffer
imprisonment for a period not exceeding six moths or if it be a
court of the Magistrate of the 3rd class for a period not exceeding
30 days.
In addition to any sentence for the offence of which the
accused has been convicted, the provisions of section 250 Cr.P.C.
subsections (2B), (2C), (3) and (4) also apply to the payment of
compensation under this section.
For the purpose of determining compensation, the court
may, at the penultimate stage of the case, conduct an inquiry as to
what compensation should be awarded for the 'power to conduct
inquiry must be regarded as incidental or ancillary to the main
power exercisable under section 544A (State v Rab Nawaz - PLD
1974 SC 87, 99).
On some sentences under PPC:
As section 53 PPC says, imprisonment is of two
descriptions namely, rigorous that is with hard labour, and simple,
There are offences in the PPC which are punishable witn
570
571

Page 304
imprisonment as well as fine. The usual formula adopted is to
provide the maximum term of imprisonment by saying, for
example, "which may extend to three years". Where the sentence is
death or life imprisonment, the rule is that death is the normal
penalty and life imprisonment is an exception (Noor Muhammad y
State 1999 SCMR 2722). As has been seen, by section 367,
subsection (5), if the accused is convicted of an offence punishable
with death and the court sentences him to life imprisonment, the
court must state the reasons why the sentence of death was not
passed. Where the sentence of fine is mandatory, the usual formula
adopted is to say that the offence shall be punished with
imprisonment and fine. Where the sentence of fine is in the
discretion of the court, the normal drafting formula in the PPC is to
say that the person convicted "shall also be liable to fine' (Koro v
State PLD 1963 Kar 256, Shamroz Khan v Muhammad Amir-
PLD 1978 SC 89).
For some offences imprisonment may be simple, for
some, both simple and rigorous and for some, rigorous only. When
an offence is punishable with imprisonment which may be of either
description, it is competent to the court under section 60 PPC to
direct "that such imprisonment shall be wholly rigorous, or that
such imprisonment shall oe wholly simple or that any part of such
imprisonment shall be rigorous and the rest simple".
Solitary confinement:
Rigorous imprisonment may, in the discretion of the
sentencing court, become solitary confinement. Section 73 PPC
empowers the court when passing the sentence of rigorous
imprisonment to order that the convict shall be kept in solitary
confinement for any portion or portions of the imprisonment to
which he is sentenced, subject to the limits mentioned in that
section and section 74 PPC. Solitary confinement means isolation
of the prisoner from human intercourse and society; it may lead to
a morbid state of mind in the convict and does frequently lead to
mental derangement. In view of its cruel nature and the
consequences that it may produce in the prisoner concerned, it has
572
been abandoned in the United Kingdom and it is no more
awardable as a punishment in that jurisdiction.
Solitary confinement is a serious deprivation (Saifuddin
v Federation of Pakistan PLD 1977 Lah. 1174; on this point also
see Begum Shamim Afridi v Province of Punjab PLD 1974 Lah.
120); it is an exceptional punishment and must be confined to most
exceptional circumstances such as in the case of a person guilty of
unparalleled atrocity or brutality (See AIR 1949 Mad. 386 and
Ramanjulu v State - AIR 1947 Mad. 381).
In this connection it is well to recall to mind the
provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution which inter alia
guarantees the dignity of man. This is one of the few fundamental
rights which are absolute in nature, and of which a person cannot
be deprived at all. There may, therefore, be a question as to the
constitutional validity of section 73. But apart from the question of
its constitutional validity, there can be no question that the power is
an exceptional power and must, therefore, be confined to
exceptional circumstances.
Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960
It is important for the sentencing court to always have
before it the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Ordinance
1960 (the Ordinance). That Ordinance authorizes the courts
mentioned in section 3 thereof namely, the High Court, the Court
of Session and the Court of Magistrate of the first class to exercise
powers under this Ordinance. Under section 5 of the Ordinance the
court by which -
a)
a male person is convicted of any of the
offences mentioned therein, or
b)
any female person is convicted of any offence
other than an offence punishable with death
573

Page 305
if it is of opinion, having regard to the circumstances, including the
nature of the offence and the character of the offender that it is
sentencing the person at once, to make a probation order, that is to
expedient to do so, for reasons to be recorded in writing, instead of
say, an order requiring him or her to be under the supervision of a
probation officer for such period not being less than one year or
more than 3 years as may be specified in the order.
Section 4 of the Ordinance applies where the offender is
not a previous convict of an offence punishable with imprisonment
for more than two years, and the court is of the opinion having
regard to the age, character, antecedents or physical or mental
condition of the offender and the nature of the offence or any
extenuating circumstances attending the commission of the
offence, that it is inexpedient to inflict punishment and that a
probation order is not appropriate, it may, after recording its
reasons, make an order discharging him after admonition, or if the
court thinks fit, it may make an order discharging him subject to
the condition that he executes a bond with or without sureties for
committing no offence and being of good behaviour during the
specified period. These powers may under section 8 also be
exercised by the court of appeal or revision.
The court to remain within its power
It is well to remember that for what is the punishment
for a particular offence, the section of the law which creates that
offence must be referred to; the punishment awardable for a
particular offence is one thing, and the punishment that the court
trying the offence is competent to award is another. Suppose that a
Magistrate of the First Class is trying an offence against section
406 PPC which is punishable with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to seven years. But
because the offence is punishable with seven years' imprisonment
does not mean that the Magistrate is competent to sentence the
offender to seven years in prison. If he does so, he will exceed his
power and the sentence will be without jurisdiction.
Death Sentence
Where death is the only punishment, the court has no
discretion. Where death or life imprisonment is the sentence for the
offence, the court has a discretion and the doctrine of
proportionality should guide it. As has been seen, the normal
punishment in such a case is death. "This is to be awarded as a
matter of course except where the court finds some mitigating
circumstances which may warrant imposition of lesser sentence
namely imprisonment for life" (Noor Muhammad v State - 1999
SCMR 2722). The Supreme Court has, in recent years, taken
strong notice of "a kind of inhibition or hesitancy on the part of the
trial courts in awarding the normal penalty of death" and "of a
marked tendency....to find a laboured pretext to alter the
sentence of death to life imprisonment" (Muhammad Sharif v
Muhammad Javed PLD 1976 SC 452; relied and followed in
Muhammad Ilyas v Muhammad Sufian - PLD 2001 SC 265), and
also that "the people are losing faith in the dispensation of criminal
justice. It has accordingly been held in Muhammad Ilyas
v Muhammad Sufian (PLD 2001 SC 465, 473), and this is to a
large extent a departure from the views expressed in some previous
cases, that "no extenuating or mitigating circumstances such as
extreme youth, grave and sudden provocation or question of family
honour are available.... ..". This was a case in which murder
was said to have been committed under the influence of accused's
father; in Moazam Sheh v Mohsin Shah (PLD 2001 SC 458)
absence of immediate motive for commission of offence was used
in the High Court to reduce death to life imprisonment.
Aggravating and mitigating circumstances
Previous conviction is in some cases statutorily
recognized as an aggravating circumstance. Section 75 PPC
provides that if a person had been convicted of an offence
punishable under chapter XII or XVII thereof and sentenced to a
term of imprisonment of three years or more is again convicted of
an offence under those chapters he shall be liable to the enhanced
sentence of life imprisonment or imprisonment of ten years.
574
575

Page 306
Under section 382C Cr.P.C. raising a scandalous or
frivolous plea in defence by the accused may be taken into
consideration and can be an aggravating circumstance.
Then, prevalence of a particular kind of offence, such as
abduction for ransom, is a circumstance which might require
severer punishment (R v Cunningham (1993) 2 All ER 15; State v
Farman Hussain-PLD 1995 SC 1).
Whether a circumstance is or is not an aggravating or
mitigating circumstance is a question to be determined on the facts
of cach case.
Offence for which maximum sentence is prescribed:
Where a maximum sentence of imprisonment or fine is
prescribed by using such expressions as "which may extend to
three yeas or with fine", the intention is to give discretion to the
sentencer and thereby to allow him room to maneuver so as to
impose the maximum in the worst kind of case.
Consecutive and concurrent sentences:
Section 35 Cr.P.C. provides for the sentences to run
concurrently or consecutively. When a person is convicted at one
trial of two or more offences, the court may, subject to the
provisions of section 71 PPC, sentence him for such offences to the
several punishments prescribed therefore which such court is
competent to inflict; such punishments when consisting of
imprisonment to commence the one after the expiration of the other
in such order as the court may direct, unless the court directs that
such punishment shall run concurrently. In other words, sentences
for two or more offences are to run consecutively, unless the court
directs that they shall run concurrently.
In case of consecutive sentences it is not necessary for
the court by reason only for the aggregate punishment for the
several offences being in excess of the punishment which it is
competent to inflict on conviction of a single offence, to send the
offender for trial before a higher court. [Sub-section (2) of Section
35). This is subject to the provise to sub-section (2) of section 35,
which provides that-
a)
b)
in no case shall such person be sentenced to
imprisonment for a longer period than 14
years;
if the case is tried by a Magistrate the
aggregate punishment shall not exceed twice
the amount of punishment which he is, in the
exercise of his ordinary jurisdiction.
competent to inflict.
Section 71 PPC which finds mention in sub-section (1)
of section 35 Cr.P.C. provides for the limits of punishment of an
offence made up of several offences. It enacts that where any thing
which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself
an offence, the offender shall not be punished with the
imprisonment of more than one of such offences, unless it be so
expressly provided. It provides further that where any thing is an
offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law
in force for the time being by which offences are defined or
punished, or, where several acts, of which one or more than one
would by itself or themselves constitute an offence. constitute.
when combined, a different offence, the offender shall not be
punished with a more severe punishment than the court which tries
him could award for any one of such offence.
Section 397 Cr.P.C. is also relevant in this context. That
section applies where a person already undergoing a sentence of
imprisonment is sentenced to imprisonment and provides that such
imprisonment shall commence at the expiration of the
imprisonment to which he has already been previously sentenced,
unless the court directs that the subsequent sentence shall run
concurrently with such previous sentence. The proviso to this
576
577
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 307
section makes an exception; it is that where a person who has been
committed to prison under section 123 Cr.P.C. in default of
furnishing security is, while undergoing such imprisonment,
sentenced to imprisonment for an offence committed prior to the
making of such order, the latter sentence shall commence
immediately.
Proviso to section 35(2) governs sentences passed
by Magistrates only:
It is now settled that-
(I)
(2)
the proviso (a) in sub-section (2) is a proviso
to sub-section (2) only and it is not a proviso
to sub-section (1) of section 35; and
sub-section (2), and its proviso (a), of section
35 of Cr.P.C. applies to the sentences passed
by courts of Magistrates and Assistant
Sessions Judges only; it does not apply to the
sentences passed by the High Courts and the
Sessions Judges and Addl. Sessions Judges.
(Bashir v State-PLD 1991 SC 1145).
Consequently, the decisions in cases such as Javed
Sheikh v State, (1985 SCMR 153) Jumma Khan v State, (1986
SCMR 1573), Muhammad Ittefaq v The State, (1986 SCMR 1627)
and Khanzaman v State, (1987 SCMR 1382), which applied.
section 35, sub-section (2), to sentences passed by Sessions Judges,
were not correctly decided. They were expressly over-ruled in
Bashir v State. The facts of one of the cases dealt with in Bashir v
State are sufficient to illustrate the point. Four persons were tried of
offences under sections 302, 326, 324 read with section 34 PPC.
They were all convicted of these offences by the trial court. Their
convictions were maintained by the High Court and then by the
Supreme Court. Thus, they stood convicted under section 302 read
with section 34 PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment, and under
section 326 read with section 34 and sentenced to 3 years' RI. The
578
Supreme Court while reducing the sentence of Bashir to life
imprisonment had maintained his sentence of imprisonment which
had been ordered to run consecutively and the sentence of fine. The
contention was that the consecutive running of his sentences was in
violation of proviso (a) to subsection (2) of section 35 Cr.P.C. The
contention was repelled and it was held that the proviso to sub-
section (2) of section 35 did not apply to sentences passed by the
Court of Session and the sentences were, therefore, lawful.
In the recent case of Shah Hussain v State (PLD 2009
SC 460), the petitioner was sentenced to 10 years' RI and
imprisonment for life on two counts. His sentences were ordered to
run consecutively. The aggregate sentence of the petitioner, so
observed the Supreme Court, "would thus come to sixty years.
which is contrary to the provisions of section 35 Cr.P.C. Proviso
(a) of section 35 prohibits the giving of consecutive sentences in
one trial beyond the period of 14 years". This issue, it was
observed further, was examined in Javed Sheikh v State (1985
SCMR SC 153).
It appears that the attention of the Supreme Court, in
Shah Hussain case, was not invited to the later case of Bashir v
State (PLD 1991 SC 1145), which case had expressly overruled
Javed Sheikh v State and other cases on the subject. As we have
noticed above, in Bashir v State, it was held that sub-section (2) of
section 35 applies to sentences passed by Magistrates and Assistant
Sessions Judges only; it does not apply to the sentences passed by
the Court of Session.
The sentences in Shah Hussain case were passed by the
Court of Session and according to the decision in Bashir v State
those sentences were not hit by section 35, sub-section (2). As
Bashir v State was not referred to or considered in Shah Hussain
case, it cannot, it is submitted, be said to have been overruled.

Sentence of fine:
There may be provisions which express a sum of money
to which a fine may extend; or, there may be previsions where no
sum of money is expressed to which a fine may extend. For
offences under the Pakistan Penal Code section 63 provides that
where no sum is expressed to which a fine may extend the amount
of fine to which the offender is liable is unlimited, but shall not be
excessive. The discretion in such cases is therefore subject to the
limitation that the court shall, while imposing the sentence of fine,
take account of the circumstances of the case including the
financial position of the offender, and see that the fine is not
excessive, that is, disproportionate to the offence committed.
When death is, by executive order, changed to
life imprisonment, Sections 35 and 397 do not apply.
It sometimes happens that death sentence awarded by
the court is subsequently, by an executive order, commuted into
life imprisonment. To such a situation neither section 35(1) nor
section 397 Cr.P.C. in terms applies, and the court cannot pass any
order with regard to its being concurrent or otherwise. In the
absence of any provision directly applicable to the case, the
sentence so commuted shall run concurrently and not
consecutively. (Bashir v State-PLD 1991 SC 1145, 1162).
For purposes of appeal, aggregate of consecutive
sentences is one sentence.
For the purpose of appeal the aggregate of consecutive
sentences passed under section 35 Cr.P.C. in case of conviction for
several offences at one trial shall be deemed to be a single
sentence.
The court may make preventive order when
passing a sentence:
Section 106 Cr.P.C. empowers the courts mentioned
therein to make, while recording conviction for offences stated
therein, orders of a preventive nature. If such a court is of the
opinion that the convict should execute a bond for keeping the
peace, it may, in addition to passing the sentence order him to
execute such a bond proportionate to his means for keeping the
peace for a period not exceeding three years. Similarly, under
section 565 Cr.P.C., if a person was convicted of any of the
offences mentioned therein and sentenced to three years or more in
prison and is again convicted and sentenced for any of such
offences, the court recording the conviction and sentence may also
order that his residence and any change of or absence from such
residence after release be notified as provided in section 565 for a
term not exceeding five years from the date of the expiration of
such sentence.
This power under sections 106 and 565 Cr.P.C. may also
be exercised by the appellate court.
Where sentence is imprisonment or fine:
Where the sentence prescribed for the offence is
imprisonment or fine, the court has discretion either to send the
convict to prison or to be content with imposing a sentence of fine
only. In such a case, the first question that the court should ask
itself is whether the convict should go to prison or not.
In imposing a sentence of fine again the gravity of
offence has to be kept in mind. In determining the amount of fine,
the court will also keep in mind the convict's capacity to pay; for to
impose fine beyond his capacity will make the discretion to impose
fine ineffectual; that does not however mean that a wealthy man
must pay heavy fine. In his case as also in the case of any other
person, the fine imposed must have relation to the gravity of the
580
581

Page 309
offence. Thus, while incapacity to pay is a mitigating circumstance,
the main consideration is the gravity of the offence.
Period of detention during trial-section 382B Cr.P.C.
Section 382B provides: "Where a court decides to pass a
sentence of imprisonment on an accused for an offence, it shall
take into consideration the period, if any, during which such an
accused was detained in custody for such offence".
When this section was originally enacted the word "may"
was used; which meant the court had discretion to take or not to
take into consideration the pre-sentence period spent in detention.
The word 'shall' was substituted for the word 'may' by Ordinance
LXXI of 1979.
The rationale behind section 382B is the legislative
realization that -
"an accused person is entitled to be put
to trial or released on bail. If he is not to
be released on bail, he must be put to
trial. If for any reason the State is unable
to put him up for trial it is only fair that
during the period he is detained to await
his trial that period is taken into
consideration in computing the sentence
of imprisonment given to him. Another
point to be noted is that the provision
occurs in a criminal statute which
requires strict construction as far as it
imposes restrictions and punishments.
Beneficial provisions need to be
construed liberally. These are axiomatic
principles". (Qadir v State PLD 1991 SC
1065 cited in Javed Iqbal v State 1998
SCMR 1539 and again in the very recent
582
case Shah Hussain y State PLD 2009
SC 460).
After referring to the above noted cases and the fact that it was the
"hue and cry of the convict prisoners" that ultimately led to the
enactment of section 382B. Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad
Chaudhry, speaking for a six-Judge Bench in the very recent case
of Shah Hussain v State (PLD 2009 SC 460) observed:
"This was a new era in the area of
criminal law, which dealt with the
liberty of a person. Prior to it the time
spent by the convicts in custody for the
same offence would not be accounted for
in any way. Having waited for the
conclusion of their trials for months, and
in many cases for years together they
would re-enter the jail to serve out the
sentence imposed upon them. The
enactment of section 382B brought a
complete shift in the approach of the
court towards the issue of pre-sentence
period of a convict".
The learned Chief Justice went on to say:
The pre-sentence custody period
certainly called for a rational treatment.
which it got in the shape of section
382B"
The stage for the application of this section is when the
court decides to pass a sentence of imprisonment. This is the stage
when the court asks the crucial question: what length of sentence
shall be regarded as appropriate. When the court has asked and
answered that question then it shall take into consideration the
period during which the accused has remained detained in custody
for such offence during the trial. This is a beneficial provision and
583
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 310
has been liberally construed in favour of the accused. It has been
held that after the court decides to pass a sentence of imprisonment
on an accused, it shall, in the absence of special circumstances
disentitling the accused to have the sentence of imprisonment
reduced by the period spent in jail during the trial, exercise its
discretion in favour of the accused by ordering that that period
shall be counted towards his sentence of imprisonment or that the
sentence of imprisonment shall be treated as reduced by that
period. This may involve a balancing exercise between the public
and the private interests and also the consideration of such other
factors as the conduct of the accused, his antecedents, nature of the
offence etc. Indeed, the court will use its good sense in determining
the circumstances in which the discretion will not be exercised in
favour of the accused. But as the discretion is a judicial discretion.
the order of the court must show that the pre-sentence period has
been taken into consideration and if the court thinks that the
sentence should not be reduced by the period spent in prison during
the trial, the court must give reasons for so thinking. This is
necessary, among others, because (i) the court's discretion is liable
to be set right by the court of appeal and (ii) if justice is to be seen
to be done, the discretion which falls to be exercised by different
judges in different cases must manifest a reasonable consistency as
between one case and another (Muhammad Rafiq v State 1995
SCMR 1525; Mukhtiar-ud-Din v State 1997 SCMR 55 and
Ghulam Murtaza v State PLD 1998 S.C. 152).
The general practice is to make an order saying that the
accused shall or shall not have the benefit of section 382B. This
practice should be discouraged. The sentencing court must apply its
judicial mind to the facts of the case and give reasons for the order
that the accused is or is not entitled to have his sentence reduced by
the period spent in detention during the trial. The proper order to
make is to say that the sentence will be reduced by the period spent
in jail during the trial. (Fazal Karim J. in Muhammkad Rafiq v
State-1995 SCMR 1525).
The very recent landmark judgment in Shah Hussain v
State (PLD 2009 SC 460) considers questions under section 382B
584
for the first time as questions of public importance relating to the
enforcement of Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Articles 9 and
25 of the Constitution of Pakistan and sets many a controversy
surrounding that section at rest. Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad
Chaudhry speaking for a six-Judge Bench, revisited the provisions
of that section, and after a wide-ranging survey of almost the entire
body of case-law, including Javed Iqbal v State (1998 SCMR
1539), Muhammad Saleem v State (1996 PCr.LJ 1598), Ramzan v
State (PLD 1992 SC 11). Mukhtiar-ud-Din v State (1997 SCMR
55), Muhammad Rafiq v State (1995 SCMR 1525), Aamir v State
(2002 YLR 1902), Ghulam Murtaza v State (PLD 1998 SC 152).
Qadir v State (PLD 1991 SC 1065), held:
1. After the use of the word 'shall' for the word 'may' in
section 382B Cr.P.C., at the time of passing the
sentence, it is mandatory for the trial court (and when
the occasion arises, for the appellate and revisional
court) to take into consideration the pre-sentence
custody period in the light of the following principles:
(i)
(ii)
Ordinarily, in the absence of
special circumstances disentitling
the accused to have his sentence of
imprisonment reduced by the
period spent in jail during or before
trial, the court shall exercise its
discretion in favour of the accused:
to do so will promote the policy
and objects underlying section
382B.
The pre-sentence period spent in
jail was not spent in vain; nor can
such period be ignored on the
pretext that it was not so spent by
way of punishment. That will be a
play on the meaning of
'punishment'. Detention in jail is
deprivation of the very valuable
585
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 311
Fundamental Right of liberty
guaranteed by Article 9 of the
Constitution and that is certainly
punishment. The Article 9 right to
life and liberty is also available to
prisoners.
2. The refusal to take into consideration the pre-sentence
custody period at the time of passing the sentence is
illegal inasmuch as if the court sentences a convict to
imprisonment for life which is the alternate but
maximum sentence for the offence of murder, but does
not make allowance for the pre-sentence custody period,
it would be punishing the convict - prisoner with
imprisonment for life plus the pre-sentence custody
period, that is to say, more than the maximum legal
punishment.
3. The practical effect of reducing the sentence to the
extent of pre-sentence custody period, particularly the
way it is done in Pakistan, is that the sentence takes
effect from the date of the arrest of the convict in
connection with the offence for which he is sentenced.
" conviction follows proof of guilt of the convict,
which is relatable to the time of the commission of the
offence. Only its finding is reached on a subsequent
date. On proof of guilt, the presumption of innocence is
displaced and the convict is considered guilty of the
offence from the very inception i.e. from the date of
commission of the offence".
4. The under-trial prisoners, or criminal prisoners,
particularly those who are later convicted of the offence
in connection with which they were incarcerated, sooner
or later, join the ranks of convicted criminal prisoners. It
is discriminatory not to treat them at par with their co-
prisoners living in the same or similar premises, may be
under the same very roof. They are equal before law and
586
are entitled to equal protection of law under Article 25
of the Constitution. "The classification of criminal
prisoners and convicted criminal prisoners qua the
admissibility of remissions granted by any authority
where the court has passed an order granting the benefit
of section 382B Cr.P.C. does not meet the test of
'intelligent differentia' laid down in 1 A Sharwani v
Government of Pakistan (1991 SCMR 1041)".
5. The cases of convict - prisoners who are expressly
debarred under any law from the benefit of section 382B
Cr.P.C. stand on a different footing. For example, where
section 382B Cr.P.C. itself is not applicable, no
remission of the pre-sentence custody period can be
allowed to the prisoner in question".
Section 382B applies where a sentence of death has been
reduced to life imprisonment by the appellate court (Ramzan v
State PLD1992 SC II); Shah Hussain v State PLD 2009 SC 460).
It also applies where the sentence is life imprisonment. (Bashir v
State PLD 1991 SC 1145 and Qadir v State-PLD 1991 SC 1065).
Remissions and section 382B:
In Bashir v State (PLD 1991 SC 1145) it was held that
section 382B does not apply when the death sentence is reduced to
life imprisonment by an executive order, e.g. under Article 45 of
the Constitution, or Chapter XXIX of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. In Haji Abdul Ali case (PLD 2005 SC 163) Abdul Ali
was arrested on 24.7.1994 under section 302 PPC, but was, on trial,
acquitted by the Sessions Judge. On appeal, the High Court set
aside the acquittal, convicted him under section 302(b) PPC and
sentenced him to life imprisonment. "The benefit, as it is
commonly referred to of section 382B Cr.P.C. was extended to
him". Remissions granted by various authorities from time to time
including the remissions of the pre-sentence custody period were
recorded in his history ticket. This granting of remissions was
challenged before the High Court, and the High Court held that the
587
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 312
petitioner was not entitled to the remissions of his sentences for the
period prior to his conviction. In the Supreme Court, it was held:
the conviction and sentence of
an accused could not be made to run
from the date prior to the date of
conviction by a competent court
although in certain eventualities the
execution of sentence of a convict could
be postponed. Ordinarily a conviction
commences from the time it is passed. A
criminal court does not posses any
power to make a sentence to precede the
conviction. In other words, the
conviction and sentence cannot be ante-
dated........
As has been seen above, this view has not been approved in the
recent case of Shah Hussain v State. Therefore Haji Abdul Ali case
and the Human Rights case No.4115 if 2007 (PLD 2007 SC 71)
which followed Haji Abdul Ali case have ceased to be good law.
The law as laid down in Shah Hussain case now is that-
-
"The convict prisoners who are
granted the benefit of section 382B
Cr.P.C. shall be entitled to remissions
granted by any authority in their pre-
sentence detention or during their pre-
sentence detention in connection with
such offence. However, the same shall
not be available to the convicts of
offences under the National
Accountability Bureau Ordinance, 1999,
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, the offence of
Karo Kari etc. where the law itself
prohibits the same".
Orders relating to property subject matter of offence:
Section 517 Cr.P.C. provides that at the conclusion of
the enquiry or trial the court may make such order as it thinks fit
for the disposal by destruction, confiscation or delivery to any
person claiming to be entitled to possession thereof or otherwise of
any property or document regarding which any offence appears to
have been committed or which has been used for the commission
of any offence. Such an order is not to be carried out, except where
the property is subject to speedy and natural decay, for one month
or if an appeal has been filed till the disposal of the appeal. Section
519 provides for compensation to an innocent purchaser for value
of a thing subject matter of an offence.
Under section 522 Cr.P.C. the court has power, while
convicting a person of an offence of cheating, forgery etc., to direct
that the person dispossessed of any immovable property be restored
to the possession of the same. Such an order will be subject to the
right or interest that a person may be able to establish in a civil suit.
Section 522A Cr.P.C. empowers the court convicting a
person of an offence of criminal misappropriation of property or
criminal breach of trust or cheating etc., to direct that the person
dispossessed of any moveable property as a result of the
commission of such an offence be restored to its possession. This
order is also subject to the decision in a civil suit that may be
brought by any person to establish his right or interest in the
property.

Chapter 1
Appeals
General observations on right of appeal
It appears necessary to preface the provisions of the
Code of Criminal Procedure providing for appeals as contained in
Part VII thereof with the following general observations:
1.
An appeal does not exist in the nature of things; a right
of appeal from a decision of any tribunal or court must be given by
express provision. It must, therefore, be shown to exist before the
higher forum can claim to exercise it (See among others Hussain
Bakhsh v Settlement Commissioner PLD 1970 SC 1; Re - Racal
Communications Limited (1980) 2 All ER 634; Habib Bank v State
1993 SCMR 1583). Thus, if no appeal is provided by the
Constitution or law against the determination of a court or tribunal,
its decision is final (Rahim Shah v Chief Election Commissioner
PLD 1973 SC 24, 36).
provides:
Section 404 Cr.P.C. recognizes this principle; it
"No appeal shall lie from any judgment
or order of a criminal court except as
provided for by this Code or by any
other law for the time being in force".
The Code of Criminal Procedure itself provides
examples of cases in which no appeal lies. They are being deall
with below.
2.
Appellate jurisdiction, as distinguished from original
jurisdiction, is the jurisdiction of a higher court to review the final,
and in some cases interim judgment, order or decree of an inferior
court on the record made in the inferior court and to affirm, reverse
or modify such order, judgment or decree,
3.
Proceedings in appeal are a continuation of the original
proceeding where cause is reheard (Jamal Shah v Election
Commissioner PLD SC 1, 50). Rehearing is a technical expression
which does little more than entitle the appellate court to review the
facts as at the date when the appeal is reheard (Calvin v Carr -
(1979) 2 All ER 440).
4.
From the proposition that an appeal is a continuation of
the original proceeding, it follows that an appellate court would in
the absence of a contrary provision in the statute conferring the
appellate jurisdiction cannot claim higher and larger jurisdiction
than the original court and that an appellate authority exercises the
same powers as the original authority had under the relevant
enactment (Sabir Shah v Shad Muhammad Khan PLD 1995 SC.66.
143, 212; Rab Nawaz v State PLD 1994 SC 858, 866). Also, the
appellate court has ordinarily no power to pass an order on any
ground on the basis of which the original court could not have
proceeded under the relevant enactment (M.M. Isphahani Ltd. v
Muhammad Sultan - PLD 1961 SC 76).
5.
The scope and ambit of the appellate jurisdiction
depends upon the provisions of the law conferring the appellate
jurisdiction. Where the provisions conferring the appellate
jurisdiction are general and are not qualified by any limitation, the
appellate authority may set aside the order appealed against in its
entirety or may grant even partial relief depending upon the facts of
a particular case (Sindh Employees of the Social Security v
Adamjee Cotton Mills PLD 1975 SC 32).
Non-Appealable orders under Cr.P.C.
It has been seen that under section 404, no appeal lies
from any judgment or order of a criminal court except as provided
for by the Code or by any other law for the time being in force. The
590

Page 314
following are the cases in which no appeal lies, that is to say, the
following orders and judgments are not appealable:
1.
No appeal in petty cases
Under section 413 Cr.P.C., a convicted person has no
right of appeal-
2.
i)
ii)
iii)
iv)
in cases in which a High Court passes a
sentence of imprisonment not exceeding six
months only or of fine not exceeding Rs.200/-
only:
in cases in which a Court of Session passes a
sentence of imprisonment not exceeding one
month only;
in cases in which a Court of Session or a
Magistrate of the 1" Class passes a sentence
of fine not exceeding Rs.50/- only:
in cases in which a sentence of imprisonment
has been passed by a Court of Session or
Magistrate in default of payment of fine when
no substantive sentence of imprisonment has
also been passed.
No appeal from some summary convictions
Section 414 Cr.P.C. provides that there is no right of
appeal by a convicted person in any case tried summarily in which
a Magistrate passes a sentence of fine not exceeding Rs.200/- only.
Section 413 Cr.P.C. is subject to Article 185
of the Constitution:
Article 185 of the Constitution provides, by clause (2)
thereof, for cases in which an appeal to the Supreme Court lies as
of right, and by its clause (3), for cases not covered by clause (2).
but in which the Supreme Court may grant leave to appeal. For
example, an appeal lies, under sub-clause (c) of clause (2) of
Article 185, as of right against an order of a High Court "if the
High Court has imposed any punishment on any person for
contempt of the High Court". So, despite the provisions of section
413 which say that there shall be "no appeal by a convicted person
in cases in which a High Court passes a sentence of imprisonment
not exceeding six months or fine not exceeding two hundred rupees
only", an appeal, in a case covered by sub-clause (c) of clause (2)
of Article 185 of the Constitution, shall lie, as of right, to the
Supreme Court. Similarly, whatever the sentence of imprisonment
or fine awarded by the High Court, the Supreme Court may, in its
discretion, and despite the provisions of section 413 Cr.P.C.. grant
leave to appeal.
Scope of appeal-when accused pleaded guilty
Where an accused pleaded guilty and was convicted and
sentenced by a High Court, a Court of Session or a Magistrate of
the 1 Class on such plea, there is no appeal except as to the extent
or legality of the sentence.
Appeal under Cr.P.C. in case of conviction
i)
ii)
Under section 408, appeals against orders and
judgments of Magistrates under the Code of
Criminal Procedure lie to the Court of Session
except where the conviction is under section
124A PPC. Such appeals are heard by the
Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions
Judge.
Under section 408, proviso (b), appeals
against orders or judgments of an Assistant
Sessions Judge where the sentence of
imprisonment exceeds four years lie to the
High Court.

Under section 410 appeals against orders and
judgments of a Sessions Judge or an
Additional Sessions Judge lie to the High
Court.
Except in cases in which an appeal lies to the
Supreme Court under Article 185 of the
Constitution, any person convicted on a trial
held by a High Court in the exercise of its
original criminal jurisdiction,
notwithstanding anything contained in section
418, or section 423, subsection (2), appeal to a
larger bench (Divisional Court) of the High
Court on the grounds enumerated in Section
411A.

An appeal lies against an order or judgment of
the Divisional Court made in an intra-court
appeal under section 411A Cr.P.C. to the
Supreme Court. This right is provided by
subsection (4) of section 411A and is subject
to such rules as may from time to time be
made by the Supreme Court in this behalf and
to such conditions as the High Court may
establish or require provided the Divisional
Court declares that the matter is a fit one for
such appeal.
Appeals in cases of acquittal
Against an order of acquittal, an appeal lies only to the
High Court. Such an appeal may be filed-
under section 417(1) Cr.P.C. by the Public
Prosecutor on being so directed by the
Provincial Government. The order to be
appealed against may be an original or
appellate order. But this right of the Public
594
b)
Prosecutor is subject to subsection (4) of
section 417, which says that if application for
special leave to appeal under subsection (2) of
section 417 made by the complainant has been
rejected, then, no appeal by the Public
Prosecutor under subsection (1) is competent;
under section 417(2) Cr.P.C. by the
complainant where an order of acquittal is
passed in a case instituted upon complaint and
the High Court on an application made in that
behalf grants special leave to appeal:
under section 417, subsection (2A) Cr.P.C. by
any person aggrieved by the order of acquittal
passed by any court other than a High Court..
The Public Prosecutor, on the direction of the Provincial
Government, may file an intra-court appeal under section 411A (2)
Cr.P.C. against an order of acquittal made by the High Court on its
original side.

Petition of appeal
an order under section 89 Cr.P.C. by a court
lies to the court in which appeals ordinarily lie
from the sentences of such court;
an order under section 212 Cr.P.C. lies to the
Court of Session.
Under section 419, an appeal is to be made in the form
of a petition in writing presented by the appellant or his pleader;
ordinarily it is to be accompanied by a copy of the judgment or
595
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 316
order appealed against, unless the appellate court permits
otherwise.
Under section 420 Cr.P.C, a petition for appeal by a
prisoner may be presented to the officer in charge of the jail who
shall forward it along with its annexures to the appellate court
concerned.
Grounds of appeal
Under section 418.Cr.P.C. an appeal lies on a matter of
fact as well as a matter of law and severity of sentence is for the
purpose of this section a matter of law.
As an appeal lies both on a question of fact and a
question of law, this does away with the distinction, which assumes
importance in civil cases, between a question of law and a question
of fact.
When an appeal lies on a question of fact as well as on a
question of law, it means that the appellate court may interfere with
the order of the court below both on the ground that the decision of
the court below is wrong on a question of law and on the ground
that it is wrong on a question of fact.
Summary dismissal of appeal
When the petition of appeal is properly before the
appellate court, it shall pursue it and if it considers after affording
the appellate or his counsel a reasonable opportunity of being heard
in support of it, that there is no sufficient ground for interfering, it
may dismiss the appeal summarily. The court may do so after
summoning the record of the court below or without summoning it.
The words 'may dismiss the appeal summarily' can be
said to give discretion. But the discretion must be exercised like
any other judicial discretion to secure due and efficient
administration of justice and to inspire confidence in the mind of
596
the accused persons that their case has been treated with due care
and caution by the appellate court'. There may be cases which are
so clear and simple that nothing whatever can be urged in defence;
in such cases the appellate court may dismiss the appeal summarily
without giving reasons. But in cases which raise complicated
questions of fact and law an order of summary dismissal must
indicate in brief the reasons which led the court to reach the
conclusion that there was insufficient ground for interference
(Khalil v Crown PLD 1953 FC 133).
When the appeal is admitted for hearing
If the appeal is not dismissed summarily, the appellate
court shall, section 422 Cr.P.C. so ordains, give notice to the
appellant or his pleader and to the Public Prosecutor of the time
and place at which such appeal will be heard; and where the appeal
is under section 411A, subsection (2), or section 417 (that is, it is
an appeal against an order of acquittal) the appellate court shall
cause notice to be given to the accused.
The appellate court shall then send for the record of the
case (if it is not already there) and after perusing it and hearing the
appellant or his pleader, if he appears, and the Public Prosecutor, if
he appears, or in appeals against acquittal, the accused, if he
appears, shall, if it thinks that additional evidence is necessary.
record its reasons and may either take such evidence itself or direct
it to be taken by a Magistrate or when the appellate court is a High
Court, by a Court of Session, or a Magistrate. Such additional
evidence shall, section 423(1) and section 428 Cr.P.C. so provide.
ordinarily be taken in the presence of the accused or his pleader
and shall be certified to the appellate court. The appellate court
shall then proceed to dispose of the appeal.
As we shall see, there is no power in the appellate court
to dismiss an appeal under section 423 Cr.P.C. in default of
appearance. An appeal once admitted must be decided on its
merits.

Some important principles governing appellate powers
From the provisions of chapter XXXI, and its various
sections relating to appeals and from the decided cases the
following general principles emerge:
i)
Section 423 Cr.P.C. is, as regards the powers
of the appellate courts, self-contained and
exhaustive; that is to say, the appellate courts.
have only those powers as are expressly
conferred on them by that section or some
other provisions of law. They have no power
independently of them (9 Crl. L. J. 553; Zamir
Qasim v Emperor - AIR 1944 All 137, 141).
Thus-
a)
b)
there is under section 423 Cr.P.C.
no power to enhance a sentence
(Muhammad Aslam v State - PLD
1959 SC (Pak) 119);
an appeal under section 423 cannot
be dismissed in default of
appearance and the absence of the
appellant or his pleader does not
relieve the court of its duty of
perusing the record and disposing
of the appeal on merits giving
599

Page 318
ii)
曲
iii)
iv)
v)
reasons in support of the judgment
(Muhammad Ashiq Faqir v State
PLD 1970 SC 177; Asif Ali v State
PLD 1971 SC 223: Muhammad
Bakhsh v State 1986 SCMR 59).
The primary duty of the appellate court as
indicated by subsection (1) of section 423
Cr.P.C. is to consider the record before it and
to decide whether there is sufficient ground
for interfering. In considering that question,
what the court has to decide is whether there
has been a failure of justice in the sense that a
guilty man has been acquitted or an innocent
man has been convicted (Abdul Rahim v
Emperor AIR 1946 PC 82).
The words "after perusing such record"
manifest the intention that the proceedings in
appeal are a continuation of the original
proceedings where a cause is reheard. The
record will include the record of evidence
prepared under section 428 Cr.P.C.
The requirement of hearing the appellant or
his pleader is not of a merely directory
character. Just as a conviction following a
trial cannot stand if there has been a refusal to
hear the counsel for the accused so an
appellate order cannot stand where there has
been a refusal to hear the appellant's counsel.
Appellant or his counsel is entitled as of right
to be heard (Galos Hirad v King - AIR 1944
PC 93).
But the fact that the appellant or his counsel is
entitled as of right to be heard does not mean
that the appellant or his counsel may or may
600
not appear; nor is it a license to him to appear
or not to appear at will. This intention is made
clear by using the expression "if he appears".
Provided the appellant or his counsel has been
afforded an opportunity to be heard, the fact
that the appellant or his counsel does not avail
of the opportunity does not deprive the court
of its power to proceed to judgment (Asif Ali
v State PLD 1971 SC 223). Indeed, in doing
so, it must peruse the record and give reasons
for its conclusions.
When may the appellate court reverse a finding of fact
The principles which guide an appellate authority in
deciding whether to reverse the trial court on a question of fact,
were laid down by the Privy Council in Prem Singh v Deb Singh
(PLD 1947 PC 293). They are:
1.
2.
3.
Where a question of fact has been tried by a
Judge without a Jury and there is no question
of misdirection of himself by the Judge an
appellate court which is disposed to come to a
different conclusion on the printed evidence
should not do so unless it is satisfied that any
advantage enjoyed by the trial Judge by
reason of having seen and heard the witnesses
could not be sufficient to explain or justify the
trial Judge's conclusion.
The appellate court may take the view that
without having seen and heard the witnesses.
it is not in a position to come to any
satisfactory conclusion on the printed
evidence.
The appellate court either because the reasons
given by the trial Judge are not satisfactory or
601
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 319
because it unmistakably
so appears from the
evidence, may be satisfied that he had not
taken proper advantage of his having seen and
heard the witnesses and the matter will then
become at large for the appellate court.
Governing principles in acquittal appeals:
There was at one time difference of opinion in the
several Indian High Courts as to the scope of the appellate courts
power to reverse an order of acquittal on a matter of fact. That
controversy was set at rest by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup v
King (AIR 1934 PC 227); it was held that sections 417, 418 and
423 give to the High Court full power to review at large the
evidence upon which the acquittal was founded and to reach the
conclusion that the order of acquittal should be reversed. There is
no limitation upon that power. But in exercising that power and
before reaching its conclusions upon fact, the High Court will
always give proper weight and consideration to such matters as-
i)
ii)
iii)
113)
the views of the trial court as to the credibility
of a witness;
the presumption of innocence in favour of the
accused, a presumption certainly not
weakened by the fact that he has been
acquitted at the trial;
the right of the accused to the benefit of any
reasonable doubt;
the slowness of an appellate court in
disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a
Judge who had the advantage of seeing the
witnesses.
These principles were reaffirmed by the Privy Council in Noor
Muhammad case (AIR 1945 PC 151), and have been adopted and
602
followed in Pakistan (See for example Abdul Majid case -
1964 SC 422).
Right to withdraw the appeal:
PLD
So far as an appeal by a convicted person is concerned,
he is as much at liberty to withdraw it as he was at liberty to file it
and in such cases the obvious duty of the appellate court is to
dismiss the appeal. If, however, the appellate court considers that
an order or finding should be set aside or a retrial ordered or the
sentence enhanced, the proper course for it is to act on the
revisional side. This is on the principle that an appeal is the
creation of statute and a convicted person is not bound to appeal.
There is, therefore, no general principle which stands in the way of
his withdrawing the appeal. If he can accept the finding and the
sentence by electing not to appeal, there is no reason why the mere
fact of his having filed an appeal should, in the absence of a
principle akin to estoppel, be considered to be a bar to his
subsequently waiving the right (Muhammad Aslam v State PLD
1959 SC (Pak) 119). Cases taking the contrary view such as Crown
v Ghulam Muhammad (ILR (1942) 23 Lah 241 F.B) should.
therefore, be taken to stand over-ruled.
Death of accused - its effect on appeal:
Under section 431 Cr.P.C. an appeal against acquittal
under section 411A(2) or section 417 finally abates on the death of
the accused and every other appeal under Chapter XXXI, except an
appeal from a sentence of fine, finally abates on the death of the
appellant.
Delivery of Judgment by appellate court:
Section 424 Cr.P.C. provides that the rules contained in
Chapter XXVI Cr.P.C. as to the judgment of a criminal court of
original jurisdiction apply, so far as may be practicable, to the
judgment of any appellate court other than a High Court, and the
preceding discussion may, in that behalf, be referred to.
603
15

Page 320
As regards the judgments by the High Court, Rules and
Order of the High Court, Volume V, Chapter 4-H, are relevant.
Appeal to Supreme Court:
The Constitution itself provides for appeals to the
Supreme Court. Under Article 185, clause (2), of the Constitution,
in so far as relevant, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from
any judgment, final order or sentence of a High Court-
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
if the High Court has on appeal reversed an
order of acquittal of an accused person and
sentenced him to death or imprisonment for
life; or on revision, has enhanced a sentence
to a sentence as aforesaid;
if the High Court has withdrawn for trial
before itself any case from any subordinate
court and has in such trial convicted the
accused person and sentenced him as
aforesaid;
if the High Court has imposed any
punishment on any person for contempt of the
High Court; or
if the High Court certifies that the case
involves a substantial question of law as to the
interpretation of the Constitution.
An appeal to the Supreme Court in other cases is not as a
matter of right; such an appeal lies, as clause (3) of Article 185
provides, only if the Supreme Court grants leave to appeal.
Under Article 187(1) of the Constitution, the Supreme
Court has power to issue such directions and orders, enforceable
throughout Pakistan as may be necessary for doing complete
justice in any pending case or matter.
604
Preliminary observations
Chapter 2
REVISIONS
While an appeal is a continuation of the original
proceedings and if it is given by statute, ordinarily it carries with it
the right of oral hearing, a revision is simply an examination of the
matter for the purpose of seeing the propriety and legality of the
orders of the subordinate and inferior authorities and it does not
carry the same incidents as are peculiar to appeal. Also, a revision
is not, like an appeal, a matter of right (Adnan Afzal v Sher Afzal
PLD 1969 SC 187, 193).
The extent of a revisional jurisdiction depends upon the
statute conferring it. The classical and the most well known
revisional jurisdictions are those conferred by the Code of Civil
Procedure 1908, by its section 115, and by the Code of Criminal
Procedure 1989, by its sections 435, 439 and 439A. It is not
necessary to compare the two jurisdictions; suffice it to say that the
scope of the revisional powers under sections 435, 439, 439A
Cr.P.C. is much wider. Under those sections, the High Court and
the Sessions Court can, not only, consider the legality but also the
correctness and even the propriety of any sentence or order of an
inferior court as also the regularity of the proceedings of such a
court. In other words, it can, not only go into the evidence and.
reverse the finding of fact, but can even consider the propriety of
an order or the propriety of adopting a particular procedure (Abdul
Rehman Bajwa v Sultan PLD 1981 SC 522).
Revisional powers are generally discretionary powers.
Section 439 Cr.P.C. expressly says that the High Court "may in its
discretion" exercise all or any of its revisional powers and as
regards the Sessions Judges, section 439A expresses the same
intention by using the word 'may'.
605

Page 321
Revisional powers under Code of Criminal Procedure:
Section 435 to 440 of Chapter XXXII Cr.P.C. deal with
the revisional powers of the High Court and the Court of Session.
These sections must be read together.
Under section 435 Cr.P.C., the High Court or any
Sessions Judge may call for and examine the record of any
proceeding before any inferior criminal court within its territorial
jurisdiction for the purposes of being satisfied as to the correctness,
legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or
passed, and as to the regularity of any proceedings of such inferior
court. When calling for such record, the High Court, or as the case
may be, the Sessions Judge, may suspend the execution of any
sentence and may release the accused on bail or on his own bond
pending examination of the record.
Under section 438, an Additional Sessions Judge may
exercise all the powers of a Sessions Judge under Chapter XXXII
in respect of any case which may be transferred to him by or under
any general or special order of the Sessions Judge.
The expression "inferior criminal court" seems to have
been used in order to avoid the use of 'subordinate which
expression had been used in the predecessor section namely section
295 of the Criminal Procedure Code 1872. The expression "inferior
criminal court" refers to a court of which the High Court or the
Sessions Judge proceeding under section 435 is the appellate court.,
From this it follows that there may be inferiority without
subordination but there cannot be subordination without inferiority
(Muhammad Hafeez v State PLD 1981 SC 352, 355). In Abdul
Hafeez v State (PLD 1981 SC 352), the question was whether a
Drug Court established under the Drugs Act 1976 was a criminal
court inferior to the High Court and whether the High court was
competent to hear a revision petition against that court's order. The
High Court was, in respect of the orders of the Drug Court, the
appellate court and it was held that it was, for the purposes of
section 435 Cr.P.C., an inferior criminal court.
The explanation to section 435 says that all Magistrates
shall be deemed to be inferior to the Sessions Judge for the
purposes of section 435.
Thus, the courts of Sessions Judges, Additional Sessions
Judges and the courts of Magistrates are all criminal courts inferior
to the High Court and all Magistrates are criminal courts inferior to
the Court of Session.
It will be noticed that section 435 Cr.P.C. by itself gives
no power to set right errors, illegalities or irregularities. The
machinery for sc doing is provided by sections 436 to 440 Cr.P.C.
By section 439A, the Sessions Judge has the same
powers of revision, as regards the orders or proceedings of
Magistrates, as the High Court has under section 439 Cr.P.C.
Thus, the power of revision of the High Court and the
Court of Session, as regards the orders and proceedings of
Magistrates, is concurrent power. The general principle is that
where two courts have concurrent jurisdiction and one of such
courts happens to be a superior court to which an appeal lies from
the other court of concurrent jurisdiction then the superior court
will not normally entertain an application for revision which the
applicant could have made to the other court, in this case the Court
of Session (Muhammad Yasin Khan v State 1983 PCŕLJ 27:
Muhammad Ehsan v State PLD 1968 Lah. 451; Muhammad
Farooq v Riaz Ehsan Khan PLD 1960 Kar. 42: Ghulam
Muhammad Jafar v Crown-PLD 1952 Bal. 25).
Revision against orders under Sections 203, 204(3)
and 119 Cr.P.C:
On examining any record under section 435, or
otherwise, the High Court or Sessions Judge may order further
inquiry-

into any complaint which has been dismissed
under section 203 or section 204 subsection
(3) Cr.P.C;
into any proceeding in which order of
discharge or release has been made under
section 119 Cr.P.C.
Powers of revision of High Courts and Sessions Courts
in other cases:
Where the record of any inferior criminal court has been
called by itself or which otherwise comes to its notice, the High
Court or the Court of Session may, in its discretion, exercise any of
the powers conferred on a court of appeal by sections 423, 426, 427
and 428 Cr.P.C. In one important respect, the revisional power is
wider, namely, the revisional court may, but the appellate court
may not. enhance the sentence.
Restrictions on the powers of the High Court
and Sessions Court:
The revisional power of the High Court and the Court of
Session is subject to the following restrictions:
i)
ii)
under section 439, subsection (3) Cr.P.C,
when the sentence was passed by a
Magistrate, the High Court or the Court of
Session shall not inflict a greater punishment
for the offence which in the opinion of such
court the accused had committed than might
have been inflicted for such offence by a
Magistrate of 1" class;
under subsection (4) of section 439 Cr.P.C.
the revisional court cannot convert a finding
of acquittal into one of conviction;
CEL
iii)
iv)
under subsection (5) of section 439 Cr.P.C.
where an appeal lies and no appeal is brought
no proceeding by way of revision shall be
entertained at the instance of the party who
could have appealed. In other words, no
revision lies against appealable orders or
judgments;
under subsection (4)(b) of section 439 Cr.P.C.
no further revision lies to the High Court
against an order of the Court of Session made
in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction
under section 439A Cr.P.C.
Right of hearing before the revisional court:
No party has, section 440 Cr.P.C. so provides, any right
to be heard either personally or by pleader before any revisional
court. To this general rule there are the following exceptions:
i)
ii)
Section 439(2) provides that no order can be
made to the prejudice of the accused unless he
has had an opportunity of being heard either
personally or by pleader in his own defence.
The court may, if it thinks fit, hear any party
either personally or by pleader. In other
words, the revisional court has a discretion to
afford hearing to the parties.
When a convicted person has been given an opportunity under
subsection (2) of section 439, of showing cause why his sentence
should not be enhanced, he is entitled also to show cause against
his conviction.
As we have seen in the Constitutional Criminal
Procedure part of this book, hearing includes the right of hearing
608

by counsel. Therefore, if a petitioner wants to be heard through
counsel, his right to do so will be respected.
Chapter 3
Review
Like an appeal and revision, power to review is a statutory power
and must be expressly conferred by law, and unless it is so
conferred, no court or authority can exercise it.
Section 369 CrPC provides:
"Save as otherwise provided by this
Code or by any other law for the time
being in force, or in the case of a High
Court by the Letters Patent of such High
Court, no court, when it has signed its
judgment, shall alter or review the same
except to correct a clerical error".
Thus, unless there is a provision in the Code or any other law,
expressly conferring the power, a judgment on a criminal case once
signed by the court which had delivered it, cannot be altered or
reviewed by that court except to correct a clerical error. A clerical
error may be corrected by the court suo motu or on the application
of a party. In truth, the power to correct a clerical error is not.
strictly speaking, a power of review. It is a power to correct
mistakes "due to human forgetfulness and not involving a mental
process of reasoning in the application of any law or the facts
already proved or admitted." (Muhammad Tufail v Abdul Ghafoor
-PLD 1958 SC(Pak) 201, 205).
There are two well-recognized exceptions, vouched by
high and respectable authority to the general rule that power to
review does not exist unless it is expressly conferred by law,
namely-
(1) a court has inherent jurisdiction to set aside a judgment
or order which it had delivered without jurisdiction
(Kofi Forfi v Seifah- (1958) 1 All ER 289); and
(2) a court or authority has the power to review an order or
judgment obtained by fraud. (Ali iqtidar v Custodian -
PLD 1964 Lah. 274; Chief Election Commissioner v
Muhammad Fazil - PLD 1975 SC 331). The reason is
that a fraud vitiates the most solemn proceedings.
(Muhammd Fazil case.)
Chapter 4
Inherent powers of the High Court:
Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads:
"Saving of inherent power of High Court: Nothing in
this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent
power of the High Court to make such order as may be
deemed necessary to give effect to any order under this
Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or
otherwise to secure the ends of justice".
This section was enacted in 1923. At that time, the concept of
'inherent jurisdiction' was well-known. As was observed by Fazal
Karim J. in Sardar Ali v State (PLD 1987 Lah. 633)-
"The concept of inherent jurisdiction is a
concept of the law of England, where
there is no written constitution. There,
most of the jurisdiction which the courts
exercise, including the supervisory
jurisdiction of the High Court to issue
writs, is inherent jurisdiction. It appears
therefore that section 561A was enacted
under the influence of the English
(common) law".
610

Page 324
Section 561A is, as was noticed in Sardar Ali case, "one
of the most frequently invoked as also one of the most debated
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, since its
enactment in the year 1923, there has naturally grown a large and
respectable body of case-law around it".
To the many controversies that have bedeviled the
discussion of section 561A, two more, and both are serious, must
needs be added. They are about the constitutional validity of this
section; and its justification for continued existence.
Whatever be the position in England, in a country
governed by a written constitution, as Pakistan is, a court has only
such jurisdiction as is conferred on it by the constitution or statute
law. Article 175. clause (2) of the Constitution of Pakistan
expressly so provides:
"No court shall have any jurisidicition
save as is or may be conferred on it by
the Constitution or by or under any law".
As was pointed out in Sardar Ali case, the question is that if the
only source of jurisdiction be the Constitution and the statute law,
and if no court has any jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction
expressly conferred on it by the Constitution or the law, then can a
court claim to have inherent jurisdiction. In other words, the
question is whether the assumption which was the basis of section
561A when it was enacted in the year 1923 is still valid in view of
Article 175 of the Constitution?
This question was not finally decided in Sardar Ali case;
yet, the matter is, it was observed, not wholly destitute of judicial
authority. Reference was in that behalf made to Sind Employees
Social Security v Adamjee Cotton Mills (PLD 1975 SC 32) and
Shahnaz Begum case (PLD 1971 SC 677, 687). In the first, it was
expressly ruled that the claim to inherent jurisdiction is no longer
tenable in view of Article 175(2) of the Constitution, and in the
second, it was held that so far as the High Courts are concerned,
they have no powers other than those conferred upon them by the
Constitution or by any law.
One way to save section 561A Cr.P.C. from invalidity is
to read "inherent power" in that section in the sense of ancillary or
incidental. "Inherent powers" and "incidental and ancillary power"
are not to be confused the one with the other. When a statute grants
power or jurisdiction, it also impliedly grants powers which are
reasonably incidental or ancillary to the main jurisidiciton and the
fact that there is no express provision in the statute enabling the
court to exercise such powers does not negative their existence.
(Commissioner Khairpur Division v Ali Sher Sarki, PLD 1971 SC
242, citing Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 1962 ed). On
the other hand, what is inherent is an inseparable incident of a thing
or an institution in which it inheres. (Adamjee Cotton Mills case-
PLD 1975 SC 32, 36). As has been said by I. H. Jacob, the source
of inherent jurisdiction of the court is derived from its nature as a
court of law. (See Current Legal Problems 1970 at p 23). Yet, as
was demonstrated in Sardar Ali case the expressions 'inherent
power' and 'incidental or ancillary power' are frequently used
interchangeably. It is therefore reasonably possible, as was
suggested in Sardar Ali case, to read 'inherent' in section 561A
Cr.P.C. in the sense of ancillary or incidental.
Some well-settled propositions:
Some well settled propositions of law to be gleaned from
cases decided by the courts may be stated as follows:
1.
Section 561A does not confer inherent
jurisdiction upon the High Court. It does not
confer any powers but only indicates that
there is a power to make such orders as may
be necessary for the purposes mentioned
therein. (Mardan Shah v Sattara - PLD 1954
Lah. 87; Sardar Ali v State, PLD 1987 Lah.
633,642).

3.
The inherent jurisdiction given by section
561A is not an alterative or an additional
jurisdiction. Nor has it given increased powers
to the High Court. It is a jurisdiction
preserved in the interest of justice to redress
grievances for which no other procedure is
available or has been provided by the Code of
Criminal Procedure itself. (Emperor v
Khawaja Nazir Ahmed - AIR 1945 PC 18, 22
and Ghulam Muhammad v Muzammil Khan-
PLD 1967 SC 317). What is preserved by
section 561A is the power "to meet a lacuna
in the Criminal Procedure Code in
extraordinary cases" and not to vest the High
Courts with powers to make any order that
they are pleased to consider to be in the
interest of justice. These powers are as much
controlled by principles and precedents as are
any express statutory powers. (Ghulam
Muhammad case, at p 324).
The power under section 561A can certainly
not be so utilized as to interrupt or divert the
ordinary course of criminal procedure; it is
generally accepted that the inherent
jurisdiction should not normally be invoked
where another remedy is available. (Ghulam
Muhamad case; also Khawaja Fazal Karim v
State PLD 1976 SC 461; A. Habib Ahmed
case PLD 1992 SC 353). Thus, the High
Court would not normally exercise its power
to quash criminal proceedings under section
561A unless the trial court's power under
section 249A or 265K, as the case may be, has
first been invoked. Incidentally, these
provisions are "of the same nature and in a
way akin to and co-related with quashment of
proceedings as envisaged under section 561A
614
Cr.P.C." (Asif Ali Zardari case-1994 SCMR
798). Nor would the remedy under section
561A be available, where the remedy of
revision under section sections 435 and 439
Cr.P.C., a much wider power, is available.
(Muhammad Samee Ullah Khan case PLD
1963 SC 237).
4.
i)
ii)
The inherent powers which section 561A
saves are-
power to make an order that is
necessary to give effect to any
order of the court; this is obviously
in the nature of ancillary or
incidental power. (Sardar Ali case,
P 646);
power to prevent abuse of process
of any court or otherwise to secure
the ends of justice. The word
"abuse' is a strong word. It can only
be in a rare case that the High
Court would deem it appropriate to
act so as to place an alleged offence
outside the operation of the
criminal law, on incidental
grounds, such as that of delay or for
any reasons other than reasons
going to the question whether the
allegation is sufficient to constitute
an accusation of an offence in law.
To quash a judicial proceeding in
order to ensure the ends of justice
would involve a finding that if
permitted to continue the
proceeding would defeat the ends
of justice or would either operate or
615
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 326
perpetuate an injustice. To find an
abuse, it would be necessary to see
in the proceedings a perversion of
the purpose of the law such as to
cause harassment to an innocent
party, to bring about undue delay
etc. (M. S. Khawaja v State - PLD
1965 SC 287).
The words 'justice' in the phrase "ends of
justice", it was held in Shahnaz Begum case
(PLD 1971 SC 677). necessarily means
justice as administered by the courts and not
justice in the abstract sense of justice
administered by other agencies.
The words "otherwise to secure the ends of
justice" also have to be read subject to the
well-known nositur a sociis nule namely that
when two or more words which are
susceptible of analogous meaning are coupled
together, they are understood to be used in
their cognate sense. (Sardar Ali case, p 646-
7). As was said in Shahnaz Begum case (at p
693), these words have to be read along with
the earlier objects mentioned in this section
and must have some co-relation with them;
they must have reference to the purposes
which the judicial process is intended to
secure "(also sec M. S. Khawaja v State
- PLD 1965 SC 287).
5.
As the words "ends of justice" have
reference to the purposes which the
judicial process is intended to secure, "it
is difficult to include actions of the
investigation agencies within the scope
of judicial process". In other words,
616
6.
actions during the investigation stage of
an offence are not amenable to the
jurisdiction under section 561A Cr.P.C.
(Emperor v Khawaja Nazir Ahmed
AIR 1945 PC 18; M.S. Khawaja case;
also Sardar Ali case at page 647).
The power under section 561A is not in
the nature of, or as wide as, the power of
revision or appeal. An order within
jurisdiction cannot be described as an
abuse of the process of the court. There
is a trite saying that the power to decide
includes the power to decide wrong as
well as right (Lord Hobson in Malkarjun
v Narhari (1900) 23 Bom. 337 PC; A.
Habib Ahmed case - PLD 1992 SC 353.
362). A wrong decision cannot therefore
engage the power under section 561A
Cr.P.C.
A proposal for Law Reform:
Apart from the constitutional validity of section 561A
Cr.P.C., a more vital question is as to the justification and need for
the continued existence of that section.
Criminal justice system in Pakistan is known to be a
system of too many remedies. There are the statutory remedies of
appeal and revision. Then there are sections 249A and 265K
Cr.P.C., which, as we have seen, are of the same nature "and in a
way akin to and co-related with the quashment of proceedings as
envisaged under section 561A Cr.P.C." (Asif Ali Zardari case-
1994 SCMR 798, cited in Muhammad Khalid Mukhtar v State-
PLD 1997 SC 275). More remedies, particularly those which
interrupt or divert the ordinary course of criminal procedure
provided in the procedural statutes, must necessarily occasion more
delays in the decision of the criminal cases. A. Habib Ahmed case
617
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 327
(PLD 1992 SC 353) provides a striking example. There it was
noticed by Muhammad Afzal Zullah CJ that if the High Court had
allowed the trial court, without interrupting the normal course of
the case, to proceed with it, then "in that eventuality it would have
taken few weeks or at the most few months, while in the present
situation where the normal course has been deflected by the High
Court the time that has already been consumed is about four years.
Such like inherent and consequential elements in the interference
by the High Court, as has been demonstrated in this very case", so
held the learned Chief Justice, "instead of advancing the cause of
justice sometimes prove counter productive".
A. Habib Ahmed case was a case under Article 199 of
the Constitution, but the ratio of that case, it is submitted, applies
equally, if not more forcefully, to cases under section 561A Cr.P.C.
Be that as it may, now that Article 199 of the
Constitution provides a speedier and higher remedy to do justice
and to prevent abuse of the process of the court, there seems to be
hardly any need or justification for a provision like section 561A to
remain on the statute book. This provision, we reckon, cannot
conceivably provide a more efficacious remedy, in a proper case,
than the constitutional remedy under Article 199.
repealed.
We propose therefore that section 561A may be.

PART VIII
MISCELLANEOUS
Chapter 1
SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE CODE OF
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND OTHER LAWS
Relating to lunatics
Two questions can arise as to a person of unsound mind:
i)
ii)
whether he was at the time of the offence
alleged to have been committed by him, by
reason of unsoundness of mind, incapable of
knowing the nature of the act or that he was
doing what was either wrong or contrary to
law; and
whether the accused is of unsound mind at the
time of trial or inquiry.
As regards the first question, section 84 PPC says:
"Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time
of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of
knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either
wrong or contrary to law". Under sections 469 and 470 Cr.P.C., if
the Court of Magistrate or the Court of Session or the High Court
finds that the accused was of unsound mind at the time of the
commission of the offence, it shall acquit him upon that ground but
the finding shall state specifically whether he had committed the
act or not.
As regards cases falling under the second category.
namely whether the accused is of unsound mind at the time of the
inquiry or trial, sections 464 and 465 Cr.P.C. require the court of
the Magistrate, the Court of Session or as the case may be, the
High Court, to try the fact of such unsoundness and if it is satisfied
of the fact, it shall record a finding to that effect and shall postpone
619
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 328
further proceedings in the case. The court may release such person
on bail, or if it is a case in which in the opinion of the court bail
should not be taken or sufficient sureties are not given, the court
shall order the accused to be detained in safe custody in such place
and manner as it may think fit and shall report the action taken to
the Provincial Government, Section 466 Cr.P.C. provides that no
order for the detention of the accused in a lunatic asylum shall be
made otherwise than in accordance with such rules as the
Provincial Government have made under the Lunacy Act 1912,
Indeed, if the accused is subsequently found to be capable of
making his defence then section 468 Cr.P.C. permits the inquiry or
trial to proceed.
2.
Proceedings in offences affecting the administration
of justice
Chapter XXXV, sections 476 to 487 Cr.P.C., make
provisions for these proceedings.
When an offence referred to in section 195, subsection
(1), clause (b) or clause (c) Cr.P.C. has been committed in or in
relation to a proceeding in any civil, revenue or criminal court, the
court may take cognizance of the offence and try the same in
accordance with the procedure prescribed for summary trials in
Chapter XXII Cr.P.C. This is so provided by section 476(1)
Cr.P.C.
The offences mentioned in clause (b) of subsection (1)
of section 195 are offences against sections 193, 194, 195, 196,
199, 200, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211 and 228 PPC and the
offences mentioned in clause (c) of subsection (1) of section 195
are offences against sections 463, 471, 475 and 476 PPC.
It has been seen that under Chapter XXII, section 262
Cr.P.C., no sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding three
months can be passed in the case of any conviction under that
Chapter. This limitation does not apply in a case tried under sub-
section (1) of section 476 Cr.P.C., and as subsection (2) of section
476 Cr.P.C. provides when the court finds the offender guilty-
b)
c)
if the court is the High Court, a Court of
Sessions, a District Court or any court
exercising the power of the Court of Session
or a District Court, it may pass any sentence
authorized by law for such offence except the
sentence of death and imprisonment
exceeding five years;
if the court be a court of a Magistrate 1"
Class, a Civil Court other than a High Court, a
District Court or a court exercising the powers
of a District Court, or revenue court not
inferior to the court of Collector, then it may
sentence the offender to simple imprisonment
for a term which may extend to 3 months or to
pay a fine not exceeding Rs.1000.00 or both;
and
if the court be a criminal court or revenue
court other than a court referred to in clauses
(a) and (b) above, it may sentence the
offender to simple imprisonment for a term
not exceeding one month or a fine not
exceeding Rs.50/- or both.
The powers under section 476 may also be exercised by
the court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the court in relation
to whose proceedings the offence was committed.
Appeals against conviction and sentence under section
476 Cr.P.C., lie to the courts mentioned in sub-section (4) thereof.
This is a special provision and applies notwithstanding anything
contained in the earlier parts of the Code of Criminal Procedure but
the provisions of Chapter XXXI so far as applicable apply to
appeals under this sub-section,
620
621
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 329
The procedure for a case in which the court considers
that the person accused of an offence referred to in section 476 sub-
section (1) should not be tried under that section is contained in
section 476A Cr.P.C.
Section 480 Cr.P.C. provides for summary trial of cases
of contempt of court. When an offence under section 175 P.P.C.
(omission to produce document by a person legally bound to
produce it), section 178 P.P.C. (refusing oath or affirmation when
duly required by public servant to make it), section 179 P.P.C.
(refusing to answer public servants authorized to question), section
180 P.P.C. (intentional insult or interruption to public servant
sitting in judicial proceeding), is committed in the view or presence
of any civil, criminal or revenue court, the court may cause the
offender to be detained in custody and at any time before rising of
the court on the same day, may, if it thinks fit, take cognizance of
the offence and sentence the offender to fine not exceeding
Rs.200.00 and in default of payment to simple imprisonment for a
term which may extend to one month.
But if the court thinks that for the reasons stated in
section 482 Cr.P.C., or for any other reason, the case should not be
disposed of under section 480 Cr.P.C., the court may forward the
case to a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the same and may
require security to be given for the appearance of the accused
person before such Magistrate, and if sufficient security is not
given, the court may forward the accused in custody to such
Magistrate. The Magistrate to whom the case is forwarded shall
then proceed to try the case in the ordinary way.
Section 484 Cr.P.C. empowers the court to discharge the
offender or remit his punishment on apology being made to its
satisfaction.
If a witness or a person called to produce document or
thing before a criminal court refuses to answer such questions as
are put to him or to produce any document or thing in his
possession or power which the court requires him to produce, does
622
not offer any reasonable excuse for such refusal, such court may
for reasons to be recorded, sentence him to simple imprisonment
for a term not exceeding seven days.
Under section 486 Cr.P.C. appeals against convictions in
contempt cases lie to the court to which decrees or orders made in
such court are ordinarily appealable.
Section 487 Cr.P.C. emphasizes that the provisions of
sections 476, 480 and 485 are exceptions to the general rule that no
one shall be a judge in his own cause, by enacting that except as
provided in those sections, no Judge of a criminal court or
Magistrate, other than a Judge of a High Court, shall try any
offence referred to in section 195 Cr.P.C. when such offence is
committed before himself or in contempt of his authority or is
brought under his notice as such Judge or Magistrate in the course
of judicial proceedings.
3.
Cr.P.C.
Remedy in the nature of Habeas Corpus under
There are three provisions in the Code of Criminal
Procedure providing for a remedy in the nature of habeas corpus.
They are sections 100, 491 and 552.
Under section 100 if a Magistrate of the first class has
reason to believe that any person is confined under such
circumstances that the confinement amounts to an offence, he may
issue a search warrant and the person to whom such warrant is
directed may search for the person so confined; and such search
shall be made in accordance therewith, and the person, if found,
shall be immediately taken before a Magistrate, who shall make
such order as in the circumstances of the case seems proper.
Under section 552, a Session Judge may, upon
complaint on oath of the abduction or unlawful detention of a
woman or of a female child under the age of 16 years for any
unlawful purpose, may make an order for the immediate restoration
623
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 330
of such woman to her liberty, or of such female child to her
husband, parent or other person having the lawful charge of such
child and may compel compliance with such order using such force
as may be necessary.
Section 491 Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court,
whenever it thinks fit, to direct, among others, that -
a)
b)
a person within its territorial limits be brought
up before it to be dealt with according to law;
a person illegally or improperly detained in
public or private custody within such limits be
set at liberty.
This section does not apply to persons detained under
any law providing for preventive detention. -
The High Court may from time to time frame rules to
regulate the procedure for cases to be deal with under this section,
These provisions are in addition to Article 184(3) and
Article 199, clause (1)(b)(i) of the Constitution.
By subsection (1A) of section 491, which has been
recently inserted by Ordinance VIII of 2002, the High Court may
delegate its powers under section 491, subsection (1), to a Sessions
Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge to be exercised within the
territorial limits of a Sessions Division.
Scope of power under section 491
There is no authority in law authorizing an adult woman
to be detained in Dar-ul-Aman against her will (Noor Hussain v
Superintendent Dar-ul-Aman PLD 1988 Lah 333). Where the court
finds that the person brought before it was not being illegally or
improperly detained, the question is what order can be passed
regarding the custody of that person under section 491. If the
624
person is a minor, the court may make over his custody to his
guardian which will be dealing with him in accordance with law
but if the person is major the only jurisdiction which the court can
exercise is to set him at liberty whether illegally or improperly
detained in public or private custody or not. The court may "set at
liberty" but cannot restore status quo ante against the wishes of the
person brought before it. Such a course will lead to curtailment of
liberty for which there is no warrant under section 491 nor can such
an order be made under section 561-A Cr.P.C. as it cannot be said
that allowing the person freedom of movement is an abuse of the
process of the court (Muhammad Rafiq v Abdul Ghafoor - PLD
1972 SC 6).
The right conferred by these provisions, concerned as it
is with the liberty of citizen, is the "most cherished right", and if
the court is satisfied that the custody is illegal, the order that must
necessarily and inevitably follow is that the person in custody be
set at liberty (Noor Hussain v Superintendent Dar-ul-Aman - PLD
1988 Lah 333).
Chapter 2
HADOOD LAWS
The Offences against Property (Enforcement of Hadood)
Ordinance 1979, the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hadood)
Order 1979, the Offence of Qazf (Enforcement of Hadood)
Ordinance 1979, and the Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd)
Ordinance 1979, are the Hadood laws here under consideration.
These laws codify and in the process modify the existing laws on
the subjects dealt with by them. In the language of Article 227 of
the Constitution they bring the existing criminal law on the
subjects in conformity with the Injunctions of Islam as laid down in
the Holy Quran and Sunnah.
"Hadd' in Islam is the name of that punishment which is
fixed by the Holy Quran or the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet. It is
enforceable as a right of God and is liable to be changed neither by
625

the legislature nor by the courts (Hazoor Baksh v Federation - PLD
1981 FSC 145, 224).
One special feature of these Hadood laws is that they are
a combination of substantive and procedure laws; that is to say,
they create offences, provide for their punishment with Hadood
sentences and also provide for the forums for, and mode of trial of,
those offences. For example, section 3 of the Offences against
Property (Enforcement of Hadood) Ordinance 1979 and section 19
of the Offence of Qazf Ordinance 1979 impliedly repeal the
substantive law on the subject in the PPC, and other laws by saying
that "the provisions of this Ordinance shall have effect
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time
being in force" and the Offence of Zina Ordinance, 1979, contains
an express repeal clause in section 19, subsection (3), which
provides that section 366, section 372, section 373, section 375,
section 376, section. 493, section 497 and section 498 of the PPC
shall stand repealed. The Prohibition Order contains no such
express repeal clause but it is obvious that it has also the effect of
impliedly repealing the provisions on the subject in other laws.
Each of these laws provides for two kinds of offence,
namely offences punishable with 'Hadd' and ofences punishable
with Taazir. The expression 'Hadd' or 'Hafood' means the
punishment ordained by the Holy Quran or the Sunnah and the
expression 'Taazir' means any punishment other than Hadd. The
cases which are punishable with "Taazir' are those which are either
not liable to be punished with 'Hadd' or for which the required
proof is not available. The distinction is important for it
emphasizes that on account of the severity of the punishment for
offences liable to 'Hadd', a higher and severer standard of proof is
needed. If that proof is not available, then the offender is liable to
ordinary punishment prescribed by the Legislature. These Hadood
laws are self-contained codes in the sense that they provide both
Tor 'Hadd' punishments and "Taazir' punishments.
As regards the procedure, the fact that offences
punishable with 'Hadd' require special proof has already been
noted. What remains to be stated is that for the proof of offences
626
liable to 'Hadd' sentences, the witnesses testifying before the court
have also to undergo the test of Tazkiya Al-Shuhood namely an
inquiry by the court to satisfy itself as to the credibility of the
witness that is to say that he is a truthful person and abstains from
major sins. Further if the accused is a Muslim, the eye witnesses
must be Muslims but if the accused is a non-Muslim, the eye
witnesses may be non-Muslims.
In the context of the Hadood laws, the requirement of
enquiry as to the witness's credibility has great importance. For the
purposes of that enquiry, mere statement of the witness. and
questions put to him, are not sufficient. For no one who has
deposed or who has come to depose for the prosecution in a case of
Hadd will be willingly disclosing that he has some defects of
character or that he is not a truthful person". Therefore, there is
need for the matter of the credibility of the witness to be referred to
one or more than one Muzakki (a referee who gives evidence about
the truthfulness of the witness). The Muzakki's evidence must be
recorded in the presence of the accused (Ghulam Ali v State - PLD
1986 SC 741,755).
The Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 applies to the trial
of cases under these Hadood laws, except to the extent that special
procedure has been provided.
These laws also provide for the presiding officers
competent to try these offences. The presiding officers of these
courts must be Muslims except in cases where the accused is a non-
Muslim.
Chapter 3
JUVENILES INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL LITIGATION
The law on juvenile persons involved in criminal
litigation is now contained in Juvenile Justice System Ordinance
2000 (the Ordinance). This Ordinance, unlike an Ordinance
promulgated under the Constitution, is a permanent primary
legislation, and as its section 14 says, its provisions are in addition
627

Page 332
to and not in derogation of any other law for the time being in
force.
This law provides for the protection of children involved
in criminal litigation, their rehabilitation in society, reorganization
of juvenile courts and matters connected therewith and incidental
thereto. Section 2 of this Ordinance defines certain expressions
such as "borstal institution', 'child', 'guardian', and 'probation
officer'. The expression 'child', means a person who at the time of
the commission of the offence had not attained the age of 18 years.
If a question arises as to whether a person is a child for the
purposes of the Ordinance, the Juvenile Court shall under section 7
make an inquiry and record its finding.
The definition of the expression 'minor' in section 299
PPC is the same. Under section 299 PPC 'minor' means a person
who is not an adult, and "adult" means a person who has attained
the age of 18 years,
The expressions 'guardian' means a parent or a person
who has actual care of the child and includes such relative who is
willing to bear the responsibility of the child; 'offence' means an
offence punishable under any law for the time being in force and
'probation officer' means a person appointed under the Probation
of Offenders Ordinance 1960 or such person as the Provincial
Government may appoint to perform the functions of probation
officer under the Ordinance.
Under section 3 of the Ordinance every child who is
accused of the commission of an offence or is a victim of an
offence has the right of legal assistance at State expense.
The Provincial Government has power, under section
4(1), in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court
concerned. by notification in the official gazette. to establish one or
more juvenile courts for any local area within its jurisdiction. For
that purpose, the High Court may-
a)
confer powers of juvenile court on
628
b}
ii)
Courts of Session; or
Magistrates of the 1" Class.
appoint from practicing advocates having
seven years' standing at the Bar, Presiding
Officers of juvenile courts with powers of
Judicial Magistrate of the 1" Class on such
terms and conditions as the High Court may
determine.
Jurisdiction of juvenile court
The juvenile court established under this Ordinance has
exclusive jurisdiction to try cases in which a child is accused of the
commission of an offence. The juvenile court shall decide the case
within 4 moths of taking cognizance of an offence. This is so
provided by sub-sections (3) & (6) of section 4 of the Ordinance.
Notwithstanding anything contained in section 239
Cr.P.C.. or any other law for the time being in force, no child shall
be charged with or tried for an offence together with an adult.
Where a child is charged with the commission of an offence along
with an adult, (which expression means a person who has attained
the age of 18 years), the court shall direct separate trial of the child.
The procedure to be followed by the juvenile court is the
procedure provided for in the Code of Criminal Procedure as
modified and supplemented by the provisions of the Ordinance, for
example, by the provisions of section 6, section 8 and section 10.
Section 6 empowers the juvenile court to control and restrict the
entry of persons in the court when a juvenile is being tried or as to
when the presence of a child accused may be dispensed with:
section 8 empowers the court to prohibit the publication of the
court proceedings and section 10 provides for the arrest and bail of
juveniles.
The probation officer is to assist the juvenile court by
making a report on the child's character, and education, social and

moral background. When the juvenile court finds, at the conclusion
of the trial or inquiry, that a child has committed an offence, then
the juvenile court may, if it thinks fit-
a)
b)
c)
direct the child offender to be released on
probation for good conduct and place such
child under the care of the guardian or any
suitable person executing a bond for the good
behaviour and well being of the child for any
period not exceeding the sentence of
imprisonment;
make an order directing the child offender to
be sent to a Borstal Institution until he attains
the age of 18 years or for the period of
imprisonment whichever is earlier;
reduce the period of imprisonment or
probation in a case where the court is satisfied
that further imprisonment or probation is
unnecessary.
No child offender shall --
a)
b)
be awarded punishment of death or ordered to
labour during the time spent in any Borstal or
such other Institution; and
handcuffed, put in fetters, or given any
corporal punishment at any time while in
custody.
But if there is reasonable apprehension of the escape of a
child offender from custody, he may be handcuffed.
Appeals by juvenile offenders
A child convicted and in case of acquittal the Provincial
Government has a right of appeal under section 13 of the
Ordinance.
PART XI
POWER TO PARDON, REMIT, SUSPEND SENTENCES
Under the Constitution
(i)
Under Article 45 of the Constitution,
"The President shall have power to grant
pardon, reprieve and respite, and to remit,
suspend or commute any sentence passed by
any court, tribunal or other authority"
The power to grant pardon, remission etc. is an
executive power and Article 45 of the Constitution expressly
recognizes it. Though the power is expressed to vest in the
President, yet, as Article 48(1) of the Constitution requires, it is to
be exercised on the advice of the Cabinet or the Prime Minister.
In Sakina Bibi v Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1992 Lah.
99), it was held that in view of Article 2A of the Constitution, the
power to grant pardon, reprieve etc. under Article 45 in Hadood
cases was, to that extent, repugnant to the Injunctions of Islam and
therefore void. This view was not approved by the Supreme Court
in Hakim Khan case (PLD 1992 SC 595) and the position remains
that the President continues to have the power to grant pardon.
reprieve etc. under Article 45 of the Constitution even in Hadood
cases.
We shall presently notice the provisions of Chapter
XXIX of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Suffice it to say here
that those provisions are subject to Article 45 of the Constitution.
with the result that to the extent of any inconsistency between
Article 45 of the Constitution and the provisions of Chapter XXIX
of the Code, the provisions of Chapter XXIX will be void. This
question fell directly for consideration in Abdul Malik v State
(PLD 2006 SC 365) and it was held that the newly amended
sections 401, 402, 402A, 402B and 402C Cr.P.C. (the amendments
630
631
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 334
probably gave effect to the decision of the Federal Shariat Court in
Habib-ul-Wahab Al-Khairi v Federation of Pakistan - PLD 1991
FSC 236) cannot affect or fetter the powers of the President under
Article 45, for-
"It is settled principle of constitutional
interpretation that a provision enshrined
in the Constitution shall prevail
notwithstanding anything
contrary
contained in a piece of subordinate
legislation".
For example, section 402C Cr.P.C. provides -
"Notwithstanding anything contained in
section 401, section 402, section 402A
or section 402B the Provincial
Government, the Federal Government or
the President shall not, without the
consent of the victim or as the case may
be, of his heirs, remit or commute any
sentence passed under any of the
sections in Chapter XVI of the Pakistan
Penal Code".
This provision is obviously inconsistent with the power of the
President under Article 45 of the Constitution, which power is not
subject to the limitation of consent of the victim or his heirs and as
held in Abdul Malik v State is, to that extent, void.
Scope of Article 45:
President-
By Article II, Section 2, of the US Constitution, the
"shall have power to grant reprieves and
pardons for offenders against the United
States except in cases of impeachment",
632
Thus, the power under Article II of the US Constitution is much
wider than the power under Article 45 of the Pakistan Constitution.
It is not necessary for the exercise of the power under the US
Constitution that there should have been a trial resulting in
conviction and sentence by a court. "The power extends to every
offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after
its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during
their pendency or after conviction and judgment....... A pardon
reaches both the punishment prescribed for the offence and the
guilt of the offender". Murphy v Ford (390 F. Supp. 1372) affords
a recent example. President Nixon was pardoned by his successor's
order for offences for which he had not been tried, convicted and
sentenced and it was held that the fact that Mr. Nixon -
"had been neither indicted nor convicted
of an offence against the United States
does not affect the validity of the
pardon".
Pakistan
In contrast, under Article 45 of the
Constitution, the power to pardon, reprieve etc, comes into play
unly after a person has been tried, convicted and sentenced.
However, Article 45 applies to cases in which the Sessions Court
has passed a sentence of death which is subject to confirmation by
the High Court and the sentence has not yet been confirmed. In
such cases, there has been a conviction and sentence. (Eid
Muhammad v State - PLD 1993 SC 17).
(ii)
Power to remit etc. under the Code of Criminal
Procedure:
Chapter XXIX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, by its
sections 401 to 402C, provides for the power to suspend, remit,
commute sentences, that is, sentences awarded by courts after trial
and conviction. Like Article 45, the power under Chapter XXIX
too does not come into operation until there has been a trial,
conviction and sentence.
633

We have seen that the provisions of Chapter XXIX are,
as has been held in Abdul Malik case, subject to Article 45 of
Constitution; they cannot affect or limit the President's powers
under Article 45 of the Constitution.
The provisions of Chapter XXIX of the Code, as they
stood at the time of the decision in Habib-ul-Wahab v Federation
(PLD 1991 FSC 236), were declared in that case to be repugnant to
the Injunctions of Islam, in so far as they did not provide for the
consent of the victim or as the case may be of his heirs in Qatl and
hurt cases. The new section 402C gives effect to the decision of the
Federal Shariat Court.
Section 401 Cr.P.C. empowers the Provincial
Government to suspend the execution of any sentence, or remit the
whole or any part of the sentence of any person who has been
sentenced to punishment for any offence without condition or upon
any condition which the person sentenced accepts. This provision
does not apply to cases of karo kar, siyah kari or similar other
customs or practices.
Section 401 further provides by its subsection (2), that
when an application is made to the Provincial Goverment for the
suspension or remission of a sentence, that Government may
require the sentencing Judge to state his opinion as to whether the
application should be granted or refused together with his reasons.
If the remission or suspension was granted subject to any
condition and the condition is not fulfilled, the remission or
sentence may, under subsection (3) of section 401, be cancelled
and the person may be arrested to undergo the unexpired portion of
the sentence.
Section 402 Cr.P.C.
Government without the consent of the person sentenced to
empowers the Provincial
commute the sentences of death, imprisonment for life, rigorous
imprisonment in the manner stated therein.
Section 402B empowers the President to exercise the
same powers, in the cases of sentence of death, as the Provincial
Government has under sections 401 and 402. In view of Article 45
of the Constitution, this, it is submitted, seems to be unnecessary.
Section 402B makes the powers of the Provincial
Government under sections 401 and 402 subject to the approval of
the President in cases in which the President has exercised his
power under Article 45 of the Constitution or under section 402A
Cr.P.C.
As has been noticed above, section 402C gives effect to
the decision of the Federal Shariat Court in Habib-ul-Wahab case
by providing that the power of the President or other authority to
remit or commute any sentence passed under Chapter XVI of the
Pakistan Penal Code shall be subject to the consent of the victim.
or as the case may be, of the heirs.
This section. in so far as it makes the power of the
President under Article 45 of the Constitution subject to the
consent of the victim or his heirs is, as held in Abdul Malik case.
void.
Scope of review by courts:
The general rule is that the power to pardon, remit etc. is
an executive discretionary power and the courts will not interfere in
such matters. (Muhammad Sadiq case 1979 SCMR 69; Ayub
Khan case 1979 SCMR 302). In Bagh Sultan case (1979 SCMR
292), a press statement said that in mercy petitions, the executive
authority would be guided by court decisions. This was challenged
on the ground that this was not a proper and legal exercise of the
power under Article 45 of the Constitution, for mercy begins where
justice ends. It was held that mercy and justice cannot be entirely
divorced from each other and whether justice has been done is a
relevant factor in the exercise of mercy power.

PART X
BAIL to Persons Accused and Convicted
Chapter 1
Relevant Provisions
There is no provision in the Constitution of Pakistan
relating to bail. The subject is usually considered in the context of
the individual's fundamental right to life and liberty guaranteed by
Article 9 of the Constitution.
In the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, the provisions
as to bail are to be found, as regards bail to accused persons, in
Chapter XXXIX, sections 496, 497, 498, and as regards bail to
convicts, in section 426. Sections 496, 497, 498 and 426 read as
follows:
"496. In what cases bail to be taken. When any person
other than a person accused of a non-bailable offence is
arrested or detained without warrant by an officer in
charge of a police station, or appears or is brought before
a court, and is prepared at any time while in the custody
of such officer or at any stage of the proceedings before
such court to give bail, such person shall be released on
bail: Provided that such officer or court, if he or it thinks
fit, may, instead of taking bail from such person.
discharge him on his executing a bond without sureties
for his appearance as hereinafter provided:
Provided, further, that nothing in this section shall be
deemed to affect the provisions of section 117, sub-
section (4) or section 117, sub-section (3).
636
497. When bail may be taken in case of non-bailable
offence. (1) When any person accused of any non-
bailable offence is arrested or detained without warrant
by an officer in charge of a police-station, or appears or
is brought before a court, he may be released on bail, but
he shall not be so released if there appear reasonable
grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an
offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life
or imprisonment for ten years:
Provided that the Court may direct that any person under
the age of sixteen years or any sick or infirm person
accused of such an offence be released on bail:
Provided further that a woman accused of such an
offence shall be released on bail, as if the offence is
bailable, notwithstanding anything contained in
Schedule II to this Code or any other law for the time
being in force:
Provided further that a woman may not be so released if
there appear reasonable grounds for believing that she
has been guilty of an offence relating to terrorism.
financial corruption and murder and such offence is
punishable with death or imprisonment for life or
imprisonment for ten years, unless having regard to the
facts and circumstance of the case, the court directs that
she may be released on bail:
Provided further that where a woman accused of an
offence is refused bail under the foregoing proviso, she
shall be released on bail if she has been detained for a
continuous period of six months and whose trial for such
offence has not been concluded, unless the court is of the
opinion that the delay in the trial of the accused has been
occasioned by an act or omission of the accused or any
other person acting on her behalf.

Page 337
Provided further that
a person accused of an
offence as aforesaid shall not be released on bail unless
the prosecution has been given notice to show cause why
he should not be so released.
(2) If it appears to such officer or court at any stage of
the investigation, inquiry or trial, as the case may be,
that there are not reasonable grounds for believing that
the accused has committed a non-bailable offence, but
that there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into
his guilt, the accused shali, pending such inquiry, be
released on bail, or, at the discretion of such officer or
court, on the execution by him of a bond without sureties
for his appearance as hereinafter provided.
(3) An officer or a court releasing any person on bail
under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall record in
writing his or its reasons for so doing.
(4) If, at any time after the conclusion of the trial of a
person accused of a non-bailable offence and before
judgment is delivered, the Court is of opinion that there
are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is
not guilty of any such offence, it shall release the
accused, if he is in custody or the execution by him of a
bond without sureties for his appearance to hear
judgment delivered.
(5) A High Court or Court of Session and, in the case of
a person released by itself, any other Court may cause
any person who has been released under this section to
be arrested and may commit him to custody.
498. Power to direct admission to bail or reduction of
bail. The amount of every bond executed under this
Chapter shall be fixed with due regard to the
circumstances of the case, and shall not be excessive:
638
and the High Court or Court of Session may, in any case.
whether there he an appeal on conviction or not, direct
that any person be admitted to bail, or that the bail
required by a police-officer or Magistrate be reduced.
426. Suspension of sentence pending appeal. Release of
appellant on bail. (1) Pending any appeal by a convicted
person, the appellate court may, for reasons to be
recorded by it in writing, order that the execution of the
sentence or order appealed against be suspended and.
also, if he is in confinement, that he be released on hail
or on his own bond.
(2) The power conferred by this section on an appellate
court may be exercised also by the High Court in the
case of any appeal by a convicted person to a court
subordinate thereto.
(2-A) Subject to provisions of section 382-A when any
person other than a person accused of a non-bailable
offence is sentenced to imprisonment by a court, and an
appeal lies from that sentence, the court may, if the
convicted person satisfies the court that he intends to
present an appeal, order that he be released on bail, for a
period sufficient in the opinion of the court to enable
him to present the appeal and obtain the orders of the
appellate court under sub-section (1) and the sentence of
imprisonment shall, so long as he is so released on bail.
be deemed to be suspended.
(2-B) Where a High Court is satisfied that a convicted
person has been granted special leave to appeal to
Supreme Court against any sentence which it has
imposed or maintained, it may, if it so thinks fit order
that pending the appeal the sentence or order appealed
against be suspended, and also, if the said person is in
confinement, that he be released on bail.

(3) When the appellant is ultimately sentenced to
imprisonment, or imprisonment for life, the time during
which he is so released shall be excluded in computing
the term for which he is so sentenced.
As Interpreted by Courts
It was held by the Privy Council in Lala Jairam Das v
King Emperor (72 IA 120) that -
"Chapter XXXIX of the Code together
with section 426 is and was intended to
contain a complete and exhaustive
statement of the powers of a High Court
in India to grant bail and excludes the
existence of any additional inherent
power in High Court relating to the
subject of bail"
In the view of the Privy Council in Lala Jairam Das.
which the question was whether a High Court in India had power to
grant bail under section 498,
"the scheme of Chapter XXXIX is that
sections 496 and 497 provide for the
granting of bail to accused persons
before trial and the other sections of the
Chapter deal with matters ancillary and
subsidiary to that provision".
It was clarified in Sadiq Ali case (PLD 1966 SC 589, 593) that the
expression "before trial" in the above quoted observation of the
Privy Council "was perhaps not a happy one" for "bail can be
granted to an accused person under sections 496 and 497 of the
Code at any stage prior to the conviction being recorded".
The Privy Council's view in Lala Jairam Das case that
"Chapter XXXIX of the Code of Criminal Procedure dealt
exclusively with the subject of bail to accused persons" and the
question of grant of bail to convicts has been "dealt with fully in
section 426 of the Code" was commented upon by S. A. Rehman J.
in Muhammad Ayub v Muhammad Yaqoob (PLD 1966 SC 1003.
1009) as follows:
"Apparently, their Lordship's attention
was not drawn to the provisions of
section 435 of the Code, which enable
the High Court or a Sessions Judge or a
District Magistrate or a specially
empowered Sub-Divisional Magistrate
to call for and examine the record of any
proceedings before any inferior criminal
court for the purposes of satisfying itself
as to the correctness, legality or
propriety of any finding, sentence or
order recorded or passed etc. and
empowers them, when calling for such
record, to direct that the execution of
such sentence be suspended and if the
accused is confined, that he be released
on bail or on his own bond pending the
examination of the record"
It would be, so wrote S. A. Rehman J. "more correct to say.
therefore, that the question of bail to convicted and accused
persons is exhaustively dealt with in sections 426 and 435 and
Chapter XXXIX of the Code. Under section 426 there is exercise
of appellate jurisdiction and under section 435 that of revisional
jurisdiction whereas the subject of bail to accused persons, prior to
conviction, forms the subject of Chapter XXXIX and is partly
covered by section 435"
640
641
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 339
To this extent, the Privy Council's decision in Lala
Jairam Das case also stands modified.
The Supreme Court, in Muhammad Ayub case, next
considered the view of the Privy Council that the remaining
provisions of Chapter XXXIX of the Code, particularly section
498, were ancillary or subsidiary to the provisions of sections 496
and 497.
In considering that question, the Supreme Court
affirmed the Privy Council's view that section 498 applies only to
the accused persons and does not apply to convicted persons. The
next question considered by the Supreme Court in Muhammad
Ayub case was whether section 498 should be confined to the
category of persons visualized by section 497.
In Sadiq Ali case (PLD 1966 SC 589), the Supreme
Court had held. "keeping the dictum of the Privy Council in view",
that the word "appears" in section 497 need not be confined to
persons appearing in response to a process, and that persons
appearing voluntarily were also covered by section 497. On further
reflection, S. A. Rehman J. thought that this meaning of the word
"appears" would render section 498 redundant. He therefore came
to the conclusion that:
"The view in Sadiq Ali's case may
require a little modification in so far as
the word 'appears' in sections 496 and
497 need not be construed to include
voluntary
appearance, even in
circumstances of grave apprehension of
arrest. This word may be taken to have
been used in sections 496 and 497 in the
same sense as in section 242 or 252 of
the Code, which obviously contemplate
appearance in answer to a process issued
by a court. This interpretation will have
642
the merit of saving section 498 in its
own right".
The position that emerges then would be, so held S. A. Rehman J..
"That under sections 496 and 497,
Criminal Procedure Code, the court can
bail out a person only if he has been
placed under actual custody or appears
in answer to a process issued or is
brought before the court. personally by
the police, or by some other arresting
authority. In other words, these sections
apply when there has been an actual
arrest attracting the court's jurisdiction
or the court is seized of the proceedings
directly, in which bail is requested.
Section 498, however, would be called
in aid before the Court of Session and
the High Court, even where the court is
not seized directly of the proceedings in
question and where no actual arrest has
been made so far but anticipatory bail is
asked for e.g. when the case is still at a
stage of investigation by the police or is
pending in a subordinate court. The
power to grant such anticipatory bail
would thus be confined to the High
Court and the Court of Session and other
courts would be excluded from its
scope".
This interpretation, it was held,
"would seem to be consistent with the
use of general expressions like 'in any
case' and 'any person' in section 498".
643
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 340
The conclusion as to whether section 498 is ancillary or subsidiary
to section 497, as reached by S. A. Rehman J. was expressed thus:
"The better view seems to me to be that
the policy of the law, in respect of bail to
persons accused of non-bailable offences
is laid down in section 497 and the same
policy should be kept in view while
considering the question of bail under
section 498, Criminal Procedure Code.
After all judicial discretion has to be
exercised while granting bail and the
power conferred by section 498 of the
Code cannot be construed to be purely
arbitrary. In this respect, section 498 of
the Code seems to be to be ancillary or
subsidiary to sections 496 and 497 of the
Cude, in the wurds of the Privy
Counci!"
In other words, the policy of the law as laid down in and
the limitations on the grant of bail imposed by section 497, such as
that a person accused of a non-bailable offence shall not be
released on bail "if there appear reasonable grounds for believing
that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or
imprisonment for life or imprisonment for ten years", also govern
the grant of bail under section 498.
To this extent, section 498 is, as was held by the Privy
Council in Lala Jairam Das case, ancillary or subsidiary to sections
496 and 497 of the Code. In other respects, however, section 498,
so held S. A. Rehman J.,
a
"occupies the position of
supplementary provision in so far as it
confers not only concurrent but
revisional powers on the High Court and
044
the Court of Session in respect of grant
or refusal of bail by subordinate courts
and the police that enables these courts
to exercise the power of anticipatory bail
in suitable cases".
Thus, section 498, it was held in Muhammad Ayub case, is partly
ancillary and subsidiary and partly supplementary to sections 496
and 497 of the Code. This was again a departure from the view
taken in Lala Jairam Das case.
It will be noted that sections 496 and 497 use the
expression "released on bail" and section 498 uses the expression
"admitted to bail". At one time, the view taken was that this
difference of expressions was intended to mean two different
things. However, in Khushi Muhammad case (PLD 1953 FC 170)
it was held that they mean the same thing and this view was
reiterated in Muhammad Ayub case (PLD 1966 SC 1003, 1011).
This view seems to have received legislative recognition in section
498A, which uses both the expressions "released on bail" and
"admitted to bail".
To complete the survey of the landscape presented by
Chapter XXXIX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it is to be
noted that the provisions of sections 497 and 498 are subject to
section 498A, which was enacted in 1976. The provisions of this
section are clarificatory in nature; they seem to reiterate what was
already the law; the section provides that-
i)
in order to be released on bail or admitted to
bail, the applicant for bail must be,
a)
in custody; or
b)
present in court; or
645

c)
a person against whom a case
stands registered for the time being;
and
an order that a person be released on, or
admitted to, bail, "shall be effective only in
respect of the case that so stands registered
against him and is specified in the (court's)
order or direction".
Chapter 2
Meaning and Concept of "Bail"
When a person is arrested and detained (this detention is
described, in the American legal literature, as "preventive"
detention) in connection with a criminal offence, he is deprived of
his liberty, and the question immediately arises whether his
detention is, in the language of Article 4, clause (4)(a), and Article
9 of the Constitution of Pakistan, "in accordance with law", or to
use the language of Article 199, clause (1), sub-clause (b)(i).
whether he is not being held in custody (i) without lawful
authority, or (ii) in an unlawful manner. (These topics have been
discussed earlier under Article 9 and under Article 199, clause (1),
sub-clause (b)(i) under the heading "Remedies for the Enforcement
of Fundamental Rights"). It is sufficient to say here that, as was
succinctly put by Hamood-ur-Rehman J. in Begum Shorish
Kashmiri case (PLD 1969 SC 15, 30, 31), in 'without lawful
authority' is comprised all questions of vires of the statute itself as
also of the person acting under the statute; there must be a
competent (and valid law) authorizing the detention and the officer
issuing such order (to arrest and detain) must have been lawfully
vested with the power to do so, and the person causing the arrest
and detention must have been duly authorized by such law to do so.
The words "in an unlawful manner" seem to reflect the view that
even technicalities may be decisive in favour of the person
detained, "since where the liberty of the subject is concerned the
646
formalities required must be strictly observed". (Lord Hodson in
Metropolitan Police Commissioner v Hammond (1964) 2 All ER
772, 783). Thus, as Hamood-ur-Rehman J. said in Shorish
Kashmiri case, the words "in an unlawful manner" have been used
deliberately to give meaning and content to the solemn declaration
under Article 2 (now Article 4) of the Constitution itself that it is
the inalienable right of every citizen to be treated in accordance
with law. An arrest and detention in disregard of the procedural
safeguards, constitutional as well as statutory, will, therefore, be in
an unlawful manner.
The authority to arrest and detain a person accused of a
criminal offence, as well as the authority for the continued
detention of such person, is a statutory authority; if there is no law
authorizing such arrest or detention, the same will not be in
accordance with law. If there is such law and the arrest and
detention are under it, the arrest and detention and the resultant
deprivation of liberty will be in accordance with law, within the
meaning of Article 9 of the Constitution. Then, such a law not only
authorizes the arrest and detention of the persons accused, but also
invariably addresses the question regarding the cases in which, or
persons whose continued detention during trial will or will not be
necessary. This question relates to the temporary release on bail of
the persons accused. The law determines as a matter of policy not
only the category of persons to whom and the circumstances in
which bail will be granted but also the question of what is called
"setting of bail"- that is, determination of those conditions that the
accused person will have to meet to gain his release from custody
pending trial or after conviction. (See the "Criminal Procedure and
the Constitution" by Professors Jerold H. Israel, Yale Kanisar and
Wayne R. LaFave, p. 9).
It is important to remember that detention during trial is
regulatory in nature; its purpose is two-fold:
(1)
To secure the presence of the accused at the
trial and thereby to ensure the integrity of the
647

Page 342
(2)
judicial process. As was said by Chief Justice
Rehnquist in Salemo (481 US 339: 95 L Ed
2d 697):
"the primary function of bail is to
safeguard the court's role in adjudicating the
guilt or innocence of defendants......."
To secure the safety and the lives of its
citizens. This gives "appropriate recognition
to the dangers a person may pose to others if
released". (Salerno).
Thus, the basic justification for imprisonment during trial is to
guarantee the presence of the suspect in order to ensure proper
judicial disposition of the case. As a corollary, pre-trial
incarceration may protect the judicial process by precluding any
interference with evidence or witnesses on the part of the
defendant. Detention may even serve to protect the accused from
others who have a stake in the disposition of his case, or from
himself, if the accused is violent or unstable or otherwise judged
likely to harm himself". (See "American Criminal Procedure" by
Stephen. A Saltzburg and Daniel J. Capra p. 703). And as has been
held repeatedly by the US Supreme Court, "the government's
regulatory interest in community safety can. in appropriate
circumstances, outweigh an individual's liberty interest". (Chief
Justice Rehnquist in Salerno).
To sum up, "in our society liberty is the norm, and
detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited
exception" and "the primary concern of every government-a
concern for the safety and indeed the lives of its citizens" on its
face does not violate any constitutional guarantee. (Chief Justice
Rehnquist in Salerno).
And despite the fact that in America, the "presumption
of innocence" has been accorded a constitutional status, and the
dictum by Chief Justice Vinson in Stack v Boyle (342 US 1: L Ed
3 (1951)) that-
"Unless this right to bail is
preserved, the presumption of innocence,
secured only after centuries of struggle,
would lose its meaning"
there is little reason to think that the presumption of innocence -
which is no more than a rule of evidence that allocates the burden
of proof to the government and serves as the foundation of the
procedural requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt - and
the bail systems cannot co-exist". (See "The American Criminal
Procedure" by Stephen A. Saltzburg and Daniel J. Capra, p. 723.
The decision in Salerno is also an authority for this view).
The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, which is the
general criminal procedural law of Pakistan is a prime example of a
law within the meaning of Article 9 of the Constitution.
We have seen that the Code deals with the question of
bail in its Chapter XXXIX. However, it does not define "bail", the
intention being that it is to be understood in its ordinary dictionary
meaning and that if there are more than one dictionary meaning.
the context will determine the meaning. According to the
dictionaries, 'bail" means-
i)
ii)
money etc. required as security, against the
temporary release of a prisoner pending trial;
or
a person or persons giving such security,
known as sureties.
Hence the expression "bail out"-release from a difficulty, come to
rescue.

The concept of bail probably dates back to the system
adopted in England after the Norman conquest of 1060. Under that
system, if a member of a community was alleged to have
committed a crime, the community as a whole was required to
pledge its property as security for the accused's appearance at his
trial. Later, it became a business and bail bonding companies
came into existence who would charge fees for standing sureties.
The prospect of imposing a property loss on others in the
community could produce considerable pressure on the accused to
remain in the area and stand trial. The concept of community
responsibility eventually dissolved, but the capacity of the accused
to retain his freedom pending trial by posting security (commonly
called "bail') remained. ("Criminal Justice System" by Professors
Hazel B. Kerper and Jarold H. Israel, 2 ed p. 269). In other
words, bail means security and security can be personal security or
security by sureties.
In the context of Code of Criminal Procedure:
The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, makes
distinction between 'releasing on bail" and releasing on his own
bond i.c. personal bond.
Thus, section 169 of the Code empowers a police
officer, to whom it appears that "there is not sufficient evidence or
reasonable ground for suspicion to justify the forwarding of the
accused to a Magistrate" to release the accused "on his executing a
bond, with or without sureties". Section 496 entitles a person
accused of a bailable offence to be "released on bail". Such a
person, when he is arrested by a police officer or when he appears
or is brought before a court, "shall be released on bail" or if the
police officer or the court thinks fit, may, "instead of taking bail
from such person, discharge him on his executing a bond without
sureties for his appearance". Section 499 and the form of "bond
and bail bond" in the sixth schedule to the Code make the position
clearer. Section 499 provides that before a person is released on
bail or released on his own bond, a bond for such sum of money as
the police officer or the court may determine shall be executed by
him and "when he is released on bail, by one or more sufficient
sureties conditioned that such person shall attend at the time and
place mentioned in the bond......... The form of the bond and bail
bond as prescribed in the sixth schedule reads:
"I,
...., do hereby bind myself
to attend in the court of on the
day. And in case of making
default. I bind myself to forfeit to
Goverment.
of
rupees
1,
the
sum
...do hereby declare myself
surety for the above named that he shall
attend the court...... and in case of his
making default therein
I bind
myself to forfeit to Government the sum
of rupee....
The distinction, under the Code, therefore, is between releasing an
accused on his own bond, or releasing him on bail: and releasing
him on bail' means releasing him on the security of sureties. A
surety is a person who is willing to undertake a responsibility by
entering into a recognizance or bond, that the accused person "shall
attend at the time and place mentioned in the bond and shall
continue so to attend unless otherwise directed by the police officer
or the court and that if the accused fails to do so the surety shall
Torfeit the amount of bail". Thus, in Crown v Khushi Muhammad
(PLD 1953 FC 170), Chief Justice Abdul Rashid, speaking for the
Court, said:
"The basic conception of the word "bail"
is release of a person from the custody of
police and delivering him into the hands
of sureties, who undertake to produce

him in court whenever required to do
This view of the word "bail" was affirmed by the Supreme Court in
Sadiq Ali v State (PLD 1966 SC 589, 597), in which it was said
that "bail is really substitute of one form of custody by another"; it
was reiterated in Mahmood Ali Qasuri v State (PLD 1963, SC
478):
"The connotation of the word "bail".
itself as understood in law, supports the
position...... An accused person is said,
at common law, to be admitted to bail,
when he is released from the custody of
the officers of the court and is entrusted
to the custody of persons known as his
sureties.........
and in the judgment of Mukhtar Ahmad Junejo J. in Hakim Ali
Zardari v State (PLD 1998 SC 1).
Hence the expression such as 'remand in custody' and
*remand on bail'.
Chapter 3
Striking a fair balance between the rights of Society and
individuals:
It is plainly clear that the question of release on bail is
directly related to right to liberty which is one of the fundamental
rights guaranteed by the Constitution, Article 9. Additionally.
arrest and detention of a person must needs produce grave
consequences for the arrestee and his family, párticularly if the
arrestee is the only bread earner of his family. The law of bails, as
has been said in an Indian case (Supdt. v Amiya Kumar Roy (1974)
78 Cal. WN. 320, 325)-
"has to dovetail conflicting
demands, namely, on one hand, the
requirement of the society for being
shielded from the hazards of being
exposed to the misadventures of a person
alleged to have committed a crime, and
on the other, the fundamental cannon of
criminal
jurisprudence viz the
presumption of innocence of an accused
till he is found guilty".
And it was said by Chief Justice Vinson in Stack v
Boyle (342 US 1: 96 L Ed 3 (1951)-
"This traditional right to freedom before
conviction permits the unhampered
preparation of a defence and serves to
prevent the infliction of punishment
prior to conviction. Unless this right to
bail before trial is preserved, the
presumption of innocence secured only
after centuries of struggle would lose its
meaning".
In Hakim Ali Zardari v State (PLD 1998 SC 1, 118, 20) Mukhtar
Ahmad Junejo J. said:
"The concept of bail emerges from the
conflict between the police power to
restrict the liberty of a man who is
alleged to have committed a crime and
the presumption of innocence in favour
of the alleged criminal.
652

"The law of bail is not a static law but is
growing all the time moulding itself with
the exigencies of time, as in times of war
and crisis it leans in favour of the society
and the government while in times of
peace it leans in favour of the individual
and the subject. The main purpose of
keeping an under trial accused in
detention is to prevent repetition of the
offence with which he is charged or
perpetration of some other offence and
to secure his attendance at the trial. Such
object has to be achieved within the
framework of a man's right to
liberty.
To summarise, the objects served by hail are:
i)
to avoid incarceration of innocent persons;
ii)
to prevent the infliction of punishment prior to
conviction:
iii)
to enable the
etc.
to prepare his defence,
to collect evidence to pr
The objectives at (i) and (ii) above are well illustrated by the
following examples given by the US President's Commission on
Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice in their report:
(1)
A man was jailed on a serious charge..... He
could not afford bail and spent 101 days in jail
until a hearing. Then the complainant
admitted the charge was false.
654
(2)
(3)
A man could not raise $300 bail. He spent 54
days in jail waiting trial for a traffic offence,
for which he could have been sentenced to no
more than 5 days.
A man spent 2 months in jail before being
acquitted. In that period he lost his job and his
car and his family was split up.
Incidentally, release of a person on bail serves the same purpose as
his detention, namely, it assures that he will be available to face the
charges at his trial and receive the judgment of the court.
Chapter 4
Ballable and Non-bailable:
An offence can be bailable, which means, according to
section 4(1)(b) of the Cr. P. C. "an offence shown as bailable in the
second schedule (to the Code), or which is made bailable by any
other law for the time being in force" and a non-bailable offence
means any other offence. Thus, an offence is bailable or non-
bailable according as it is so shown in the second schedule to the
Code of Criminal Procedure or as it is so described in any other
law. This is a matter of legislative policy, and it is not necessary
that every cognizable office is necessarily a non-bailable offence.
For example, an offence under section 183 PPC is shown in the
second schedule to the Code as cognizable but bailable.
As we shall see, different consequences flow from an
offence being bailable or non-bailable.
Bail under section 496:
This section applies to any person who is arrested or
detained without warrant by the police, or appears, in answer to a

public order under section 107 Cr. P. C. ctc.
Release in bailable and other cases under S. 496;
Bail under section 496 Cr. P. C. is a right of a person
accused of a bailable offence; when a person accused of a bailable
offence is arrested or detained by a police officer, or appears, (that
is, appears in answer to a court process) or is brought before a
court, and is prepared at any time or at any stage of the proceedings
to give bail, "he shall be released on bail". The word 'shall' here is
mandatory; if the arrestee is prepared to give bail, he must be
released on bail. There is here no discretion in the police officer or
court; all that the police officer or the court can do is to release him
on bail. As was held in Mahmood Ali Qasuri v State:
"The policy of the Code seems to be that
in the case of bailable offences the
person accused has the indefeasible right
to grant of bail subject of course to
satisfactory sureties being offered, if
sureties are considered necessary. There
is admittedly no provision in the Code
permitting cancellation of such a bail.
Bail is not a mere privilege in such cases
but a right of the subject whose liberty is
regarded as a precious asset to be
preserved undiminished, If of course the
656
person enlarged on bail subams the
witnesses there may be other remedies at
law open against him. e.g. contempt
proceedings or conceivably even
proceedings to bind him over to keep the
peace or be of good behaviour in certain
circumstances. But to hold that on such
grounds the bail granted under section
496 of the Code can be cancelled
amounts to saying that the High Court
possesses inherent power to override the
express provisions of the Code".
After referring to the observations of the Privy Council
in Lala Jairam Das case and to a case of Indian Supreme Court, S.
A. Rehman J. went on to say-
"
It must be pointed out that i
effect was not given to the
pronouncement of the Privy Council that
the powers to grant bail were exhausted
by Chapter XXXIX read with section
426 of the Criminal Procedure Code and
that section 561-A did not add to such
powers
Thus, it is crystal clear that in bailable offences the grant of bail is
a right and not a favour (Tariq Bashir v State-PLD 1995 SC 34):
it is an indefeasible right, so indefeasible indeed that bail in such
cases cannot be cancelled,
Discretion in bailable offences:
We have seen that the arrestee is entitled to be released
on bail if he is prepared to give bail; this means that the right is
"subject to satisfactory sureties being offered"; that is, satisfactory
to the police officer or as the case may be, to the court.
657

Page 347
Here the element of discretion creeps in. In other words,
it is in the discretion of the police officer or the court to determine
the satisfactory amount of bail.
Is this discretion unguided or unfettered? Without going
into the question whether the discretion is judicial or administrative
(this is relevant because, a police officer too has the discretion), the
answer is 'No'. The general question of discretion will be
discussed later. Suffice it to say here, that the discretion is subject
to the provisions of section 498 Cr.P.C. which provides that "the
amount of every bond executed under this Chapter shall be fixed
with due regard to the circumstances of the case, and shall not be
excessive.........
Secondly under section 496 the police officer or the
court "if he or it thinks fit, may, instead of taking bail from such
person, discharge him on his executing a bond without sureties for
his appearance........
So, the police officer or the court has the discretion to
release the arrestee on bail or on his personal bond. This discretion
is judicial or at the least quasi-judicial discretion and in
exercising it the bail granting authority will keep in mind the
fundamental right to liberty. Liberty is the norm to which detention
during trial is a limited exception, and the right to bail in bailable
offences must not be allowed to be defeated by excessive bail, that
is, by putting the amount of bail so high as to be beyond the reach
of the arrestee. Thus, even if one has to err, one should err in
favour of the liberty of the arrestee and keeping in view the
circumstances of the case, if the option is between keeping a man
in prison for want of means to provide sureties and discharging
him, that is, releasing him from custody on personal bond, the latter
course should be preferred. This aspect of the matter was dealt with
in Tariq Bashir case (PLD 1995 SC 34, 40). It was noticed that
many under trial accused of bailable offences, or detained for
security purposes i.e. under sections 107, 109 and 110 Cr. P. C. are
sent to prison for want of surety bonds although they, at the
658
discretion of the court, could be released on execution by them of
bond (personal bond) without surety. A general direction was
therefore issued that-
"In bailable cases while remanding the
accused to jail on his failure to furnish
surety/bail bonds, the trial court shall
consider the propriety of his release on
execution of personal bond....... Instead
of being severe to an under - trial
accused
of
carrying presumption
innocence with them, it is better that the
court should be lenient in the matter of
bail.......
Bail in non-bailable offences:
It will be seen that the law as contained in section 497
makes, for the purpose of bail, distinction between-
a)
non-bailable offences which are punishable
with death or imprisonment for life, or
imprisonment for 10 years; and
by
non-bailable offences, punishable with less
than ten years imprisonment.
As will be presently seen, offences punishable with
death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for 10 years are, for
the purposes of bail, a category apart, hereinafter to be described as
category (a).
The following principles governing the grant of bail in
non-bailable offences are well settled
659
Scanned with CamScanner

Page 348
i)
ii)
iii)
iv)
-
Sections 497 and 498 are confined to the case
of accused persons (Mohammad Ayub v
Mohammad Yaqub PLD 1966 SC 1003,
1012). They do not apply to bail to convicted
persons;
Bail should never be with-held as a
punishment (Abdul Malik case - PLD 1968
SC 349: Sikandar A. Karim case - 1995
SCMR 387).
In cases of non-bailable offences, grant of bail
is a relief resting primarily in the discretion of
the court to be exercised with due care and
caution as a fundamental incident of exercise
of judicial power taking into account the facts
and circumstances of each case. Orders in bail
applications should not be considered as
routine orders. Involving as they do the liberty
of the citizens, they must be carefully
balanced and weighed in the scales of justice
and the requirements of the relevant law as
contained in sections 496 to 498 must be
fulfilled (Abdul Malik case PLD 1968 SC
349):
The principle to be deduced from section 497
Cr. P. C. is that in non-bailable offences not
falling in category (a) above the grant of bail
is a rule and refusal an exception. So the bail
will be declined only in extraordinary and
exceptional case; for example:
v)
vi)
a)
where there is likelihood that the
accused will abscond;"
b)
where there is apprehension of the
with
accused
Lampering
prosecution evidence:
c)
where there is danger of the offence
Being repeated if the accused is
released on bail, and
d)
where the accused is a previous
convict,
Thus, the decision to grant bail in cases not
falling under category (a) above remains in
the discretion of the bail - granting authority
and the words "the grant of bail is a rule" do
not mean that what is given is an "unlimited
discretion". The nature and seriousness of the
charges, the arrestee's background and
characteristics and "the State's regulatory
interest in community safety can. in
appropriate circumstances, outweigh an
individual's liberty interest". (Chief Justice
Rehnquist in Salerno -95 L Ed 2d 697; 481
US 739);
There is a limitation on the court's discretion
in cases of offences which fall in category (a);
in such cases, the accused shall not be
released on bail if there are reasonable
grounds for believing that he has committed
such an offence:
"Reasonable ground" is an expression which
connotes that the ground be such as would
appeal to a reasonable man for connecting the
accused with the crime with which he is.

import than suspicion. However strong a
suspicion may be, it cannot take the place of
reasonable grounds. Grounds will have to be
tested by reason for their acceptance or
rejection. The reasonableness of the grounds
has to be shown by the prosecution by
displaying its cards to the court as it may
possess or is expecting to possess as
demonstrating evidence available in the cases
both direct and circumstantial (Abdul Malik
case-PLD 1968 SC 349). The courts "have
only to look at the material placed before
them by the prosecution, to see whether some
tangible evidence is available against the
accused, which if left unrebutted, may lead to
the inference of guilt. Reasonable grounds are
not to be confused with mere allegations or
suspicions пог with tested and proved
evidence, which the law requires for a
person's conviction for an offence (Nisar
Ahmad y State PLD 1971 SC 174);
If such grounds exist tending to connect the
accused with the crime, bail shall be refused
without the need to go into a deeper
appreciation of the merits of those grounds
and the evidence on which they are based,
which functions ought to be assumed at the
trial stage:
However, if it is found that the charge is
groundless, that is to say, unsupported by any
evidence or instead of the grounds being
reasonable, their absurdity stands on a plain
view or the charge on its face value is reduced

example, where it is a case of accidental and
unintended death caused by simple hurt, the
limitation on the court's discretion is removed
which must then be freely exercised in favour
of bail,
Similarly, where such reasonable grounds do
not exist but the grounds exist for a further
investigation and inquiry into the guilt of an
accused person, the case will fall under
section 497 (2) Cr. P. C. in which case again.
bail shall not be withheld. As was held in
Ibrahim v Hayat Gul (1985 SCMR 382) bail
in such cases is to be allowed to him as of
right under this provision if an important prior
condition is fulfilled, namely, that the officer
in charge of police station or the court......
comes 10 a definite conclusion on
consideration of the entire material that there
are no reasonable grounds for believing that
the accused has committed a non-bailable
offence;
Even for the purposes of bail the law is not to
be stretched in favour of the prosecution and
any benefit of doubt arising in the case must
go to the accused (Sikandar A. Karim case-
1995 SCMR 387): and
While deciding a bail application, the court
should avoid making observations which can
embarrass or prejudice the accused in his
defence (1995 SCMR 387,399).

Bail to women, minors and sick persons:
It has been seen that under section 497, subsection (1),

under the age of 16 yeas or is a sick or infirm person even though
there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he or she has
been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment
for life or imprisonment for 10 years. It seems therefore that the
cases, in which the accused person is less than 16 years of age or is
a sick or infirm person, even though the offence is punishable with
death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for 10 years, are on
a par with ordinary non-bailable cases and the court has a
discretion to release or not to release such a person depending upon
the facts of each case (Abdul Aziz v Bashir Ahmad - PLD 1966
SC 658).
The second proviso to section 497 (1) Cr.P.C. is a recent
enactment: it makes special provision for bail to women. A women,
even if she is accused of an offence punishable with death,
imprisonment for life or for ten years, "shall be released on bail, as
if the offence is bailable, notwithstanding anything contained in
Schedule II to this Code or any other law for the time being in
force". But a woman accused may not be released "if there appear
reasonable grounds for believing that she has been guilty of an
offence relating to terrorism, financial corruption or murder and
such offence is punishable with death or imprisonment for life or
imprisonment for ten years, unless having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case, the court directs that she may be
released on bail".
A woman who has been refused bail under the foregoing
provisions. "shall be realeased on bail if she has been detained for a
continuous period of six months and whose trial for such offence
has not been concluded, unless the court is of the opinion that the
delay in the trial has been occasioned by an act or omission of the
accused or any other person acting on her behalf".
Cases in which the accused has right to bail:

Besides the cases governed by section 496 Cr. P. C, in

ii)
in which there do not appear reasonable
grounds for believing that the accused has
been guilty of a non-bailable offence
including an offence punishable with death or
imprisonment for life or imprisonment for 10
years, within the meaning of section: 497
subsection (1) Cr. P. C., and
in which there are sufficient grounds for
further inquiry into the guilt of the accused
within the meaning of subsection (2) of
section 497,
the accused has a right to be released on bail (Ibrahim v Hayat Gul
1985 SCMR 382).
Further enquiry' means that the facts show or tend to
show that the accused is not guilty or is not guilty of the offence
charged (Arbab Ali case-1985 SCMR 195; Ibrahim v Hayat Gul
(1985 SCMR 382).
In other words, in such cases, the law does not leave it to
the discretion of the court to withhold bail (Ibrahim v Hayat Gul
(1985 SCMR 382). Examples of cases of further inquiry within the
meaning of section 497 subsection (2) are cases in which a
person's name does not find mention in the challan as an accused
person or his name finds mention in column 2 of the challan; or the
facts show that the accused may not be convicted under section 302
or will be convicted for a lesser offence (Shahzaman v State- PLD
1994 SC 65).

A mere jalkara, without more, it has been held, is non
reasonable ground to hold that the accused is guilty of a non-
bailable offence (Abdul Aziz v Bashir Ahmad - PLD 1966 SC
658).
Notice to prosecution
The fifth proviso to section 497(1) provides that a person accused
of an offence covered by that section shall not be released on bail
unless the prosecution has been given notice to show cause why he
should not be so released.
Chapter 5
Pre-arrest bail;
It is well sealed that the High Court and the Court of
Session have power under section 498, read with section 497, to
grant pre-arrest bail but this is subject to the conditions enacted in
section 498A which says that a person who is not in custody or is
not present in court or against whom no case stands registered shall
not be released on bail or be admitted to bail.
The jurisdiction to grant bail under section 498 vests
concurrently in the High Court and the Court of Session.
Ordinarily, the applicant must first approach the Court of Session.
The tendency of applications for bail and anticipatory bail being
brought in the High Courts has been deprecated and should be
discouraged (Nisar Ahmad v State PLD 1971 SC 174, 177).
The policy of the law as to grant of bail to accused
persons has been laid down in section 497 Cr. P. C., and section
498 occupies the position of a supplementary provision; also, as
regards orders of subordinate courts, section 498 gives revisional
powers to the High Court and the Court of Session (Mohammad
Ayub v Mohammad Yaqub - PLD 1966 SC 1003, 1015 per S. A.
666
Rehman J.). The words "admitted to bail" in section 498 mean the
same thing as 'released on bail' in section 497 (Mohammad Ayub
Mohammad Yaqub PLD 1966 SC 1003, 1011: Khushi
Muhammad case - PLD 1953 FC 170).
The power to admit a person to pre-arrest bail is an
extraordinary power. The applicant must, therefore, show, not only.

if the court stays its hands until the police

alleged but also that if the petitioner were to
be arrested and refused bail, such an order
would, in all probability, be made not from
motives of furthering the ends of justice in
relation to the case but from some ulterior
motives and with the object of injuring the
petitioner or that the petitioner would in such
an eventuality suffer an irreparable harm
(Hidayatullah case PLD 1949 Lah 21: Sadiq

PLD 1983 SC 82; Muhammad Shoaib Suddle
v State 1997 SCMR 1234).

satisfied, the most essential of them being that the intended arrest
would be tainted with malafide which must be specifically stated. It
is in this context that the other condition of irreparable loss is to be
viewed. In that connection, it is the duty of the court granting pre-
arrest bail to examine the question whether such grant of bail
would not frustrate investigation viz-a-viz various factors including
the relevant recovery.
Can the court dismissing ball application direct arrest
of the accused:
The non-granting of pre-arrest bail or cancellation of
interim pre-arrest bail does not necessarily entail the consequence
that the court should order the petitioner to be given into police
custody without there being a request in that behalf by the police
itself. The proper order to pass is to cancel the ad-interim bail and
to leave the petition to be dealt with by the police as they think fit.
He would thus be in no better and no worse position than the
position before he was granted ad-interim bail (Sadiq Ali case PLD
1966 SC 589).
Chapter 6
Order of bail-can it impose conditions
Under section 499 Cr. P. C. before any person is
released on bail or released on his own bond, a bond for such sum
of money as the police officer or the court thinks sufficient shall be
executed by such person and when he is released on bail, by one or
more sufficient sureties conditioned that such person shall attend at
the time and place mentioned in the bond and shall continue so to
attend until otherwise directed by the police officer or the court as
the case may be. Thus, both when the accused is released on bail
and when he is released on his own bond, he has to execute a bond,
that is to say, the requirement to execute a bond is mandatory. The
only discretion in the court is to fix the amount of bond and
whether or not the release will be on bail or on his own bond. It
follows that the court has no power while granting bail to impose a
condition such as that the accused would not deliver any speech of
a political kind (Mahmud Ali Kasuri case PLD 1963 SC 478); or
that he should pay the amount of fine (Faiz-ur-Rehman Sarkar case
1970 SCMR 175; Abdul Rehman v State 1985 SCMR 542). On the
principle that the court cannot impose any condition other than
those expressly permitted to be imposed by law, it seems to follow
that the court cannot in cases under the Code direct that instead of
furnishing bond he should pay cash security (see the judgment of
Mukhtar Ahmad Janejo J. in Hakim Ali Zardari case PLD 1998 SC
1, and the Indian cases cited there). For imposing such a condition,
the High Court cannot even invoke its inherent powers under
section 561A Cr.P.C.
This is the position under the Code of Criminal
Procedure as it stands. Of course, if the law under which bail is
granted provides that any condition can be imposed, the condition
would be valid (Hakim Ali Zardari case PLD 1998 SC 1). The law
under consideration in Hakim Ali Zardari case provides an
example. That law authorized the court to require the bail amount
to be paid in cash. Even under the Code of Criminal Procedure, the
bail granting authority has, under section 513, a discretion "to
permit him to deposit a sum of money or Government promissory
notes to such amount as the court or officer may fix in lieu of
executing such bond".
Chapter 7
Cancellation of bail:
Under section 497, subsection (5), "A High Court or
Court of Session and in the case of a person released by itself, any
other court may cause any person who has been released under this
section to be arrested and may commit him to custody". Thus, the
court which granted the bail, and the High Court and the Court of
Session whether or not the bail was granted by it, have power to
cancel the bail of an accused person.
668

Bail cannot be cancelled without notice to the accused
(Mushtaq Ahmad v State-PLD 1966 SC 126).
Considerations for the grant of hail and for its
cancellation of the same are different. Once the bail is granted by a
court of competent jurisdiction, then strong and exceptional
grounds would be required for cancellation thereof. To deprive a
person on post-arrest bail of his liberty is a most serious step to be
taken, Bail can neither be withheld nor cancelled as punishment
(Tariq Bashir v State PLD 1995 SC 34; also see Mst. Noor Habib v
Saleem Raza - PLJ 2009 SC 529)
When trial has commenced, bail should not ordinarily be
cancelled (Muhammad Ismail v Muhammad Rafiq - PLD 1989 SC
585: Mst. Irshad Begum v Muhammad Afzal - 1985 SCMR 1691).
Chapter 8
Propriety of hearing bail matters by same Judge:
In State v Zubair (PLD 1986 SC 173), it was ruled that if
a Judge of a High Court has heard a bail application of an accused
person, all subsequent applications for bail of the same person or in
the same case should be referred to the same Judge wherever he is
sitting. If it is impossible to do so, order of the Chief Justice should
be obtained. This rule is based on the salutary principle that
successive applications in the same case, if heard by different
judges, can result in conflicting orders and encourage malpractice
by accused persons and thereby bring the judicial system into
disrepute. This rule applies equally to the other courts.
In a recent suo motu matter (PLD 2002 SC 171), the
Supreme Court took judicial notice of the difficulties arising out of
the strict implementation of the above-stated rule and held, in
modification thereof, that-
(1)

(5)
Constitution of the Benches is the exclusive
function of the Chief Justice.
Ordinarily, subsequent bail application by the
same accused or in the same case must be
placed for disposal before the same Single
Judge/Division Bench of the High Court
which had dealt with the first bail application.
If the learned Single Judge who had dealt with
the first bail application is not available and
departure from (2) above is unavoidable, the
learned Chief Justice concerned may refer the
second or subsequent bail application to
another learned Single Judge at the Principal
Seat or Permanent Benches/Circuit Benches.
as the case may be.
Where the first bail application is heard and
disposed by a Division Bench which is not
available either at the Principal Seat or the
Permanent Benches/Circuit Benches at the
time of filing of the second or subsequent bail
application then such bail application shall be
heard by a Division Bench of which one of
the Judges was a Meraber of the Division
Bench which dealt with the first bail
application. If none of the Members of the
Division Bench which heard the first bail
application is available, the learned Chief
Justice concerned may assign the subsequent
bail application to any appropriate Division
Bench at the Principal Seat or the Permanent
Benches/Circuit Benches, as the case may be.
Subsequent bail application shall be filed,
heard and disposed of at the Principal Seat or
670
671

Page 354
(6)
the Permanent Benches/Circuit Benches, as
the case may be, where the first bail
application was filed and finally disposed of.
In the event of non-availability of the learned
Single Judge or the learned Members of the
Division Bench, who had dealt with the
earlier bail applications, the office at the
Principal Seat shall obtain appropriate orders
from the learned Chief Justice and the office
at the Permanent Benches/Circuit Benches
shall obtain appropriate orders from the
leamed Chief Justice through fax or on
telephone for fixation of subsequent bail
application before other appropriate Benches,
in the interest of expeditious and inexpensive
dispensation of justice in bail matters.
Subsequent bail application shall not be
entertained unless accompanied by copies of
earlier bail applications and copies of orders
thereon.
Duty of counsel in this matter:
To enable the implementation of the above-mentioned
rule, it is the duty of the counsel for the accused to mention in the
bail application the fact of the previous bail application and its
result. Failure of the counsel to do so would be professional
misconduct (Zubair case-PLD 1986 SC 173, 177).
Chapter 9
Bail after conviction or acquittal:
The general law on bail to a convict is contained in
section 426 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which is a
complete code on the subject. Though the powers under section
672
426 are controlled by sections 496 and 497 of the Code, yet the
principles of those sections have to be borne in mind in granting or
refusing bail to a convict. (Bihar Khan v State - 1969 SCMR 81).
Under Section 426, an appellate court may, pending the
appeal of the convict, for reasons to be recorded in writing, order
that the execution of the sentence or order appealed against be
suspended and also, if he is in confinement, that he be released on
bail or on his own bond. In exercising the powers under section
426, it should be remembered that an accused stands on a different
footing from a convict. In the case of an accused, the presumption
of innocence has a part to play, but in the case of a convict, that
presumption disappears. (Qaim Ali Shah case 1992 SCMR 2192:
Gul Zaman v State-1999 SCMR 1271, 1277).
The question of bail can also arise in appeals or
revisions against acquittal. An accused is presumed to be innocent
and when he is duly tried and acquitted, he earns a double
presumption of innocence. (Abdul Mateen case - PLD 2006 SC
538).
The sentencing court may also, in certain cases, suspend
the sentence and allow bail to the convict to enable him to file an
appeal. Such bail will be subject to confirmation by the appellate
court. (Section 382A and Section 426, subsection (2A). Cr.P.C)
Indeed, a special law may make different provisions
governing the suspension of sentences of and the granting of bail to
convicts under that law.

Chapter 10
Ball by High Court of one Province to an accused to be tried in
another Province:
The Lahore and Sind High Courts have been
consistently granting interim protective bail in respect of offences
committed outside their territorial jurisdictions. This situation
arises when a case is pending before a court in one Province and
the accused happens to be in another Province and the trial court
issues a warrant for the arrest of that person. In Mukhtar Ahmad
Awan v State (1990 P Cr. L J 617), the question has been dealt
with at some length and it has been held that the High Court can
grant interim protective bail to such an accused person to enable
him to approach the competent court in another Province.
Chapter 11
Application of sections 497 and 498 in Special Offences triable
by Special Courts:
It has been noticed that the provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure will apply to proceedings governed by special
laws unless their application is expressly excluded. Even where the
application of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure is
expressly excluded the jurisdiction of the High Court and the Court
of Session to deal with bail matters is not excluded in such special
cases till the Special Court has taken cognizance of the offence
(Musahib Ali v State PLD 1975 Kar 909; Zahur Ilahi v State PLD
1977 SC 273, 303). Then it is well settled that a law excluding
jurisdiction of ordinary courts is to be strictly construed, that is to
say, if there is any doubt or ambiguity, it is to be resolved in favour
of the accused. State v Qaim Ali Shah (1992 SCMR 2192, 2217)
and Gul Zaman v State (1999 SCMR 1271) are illustrations of
doubts as to the application of sections 497 and 498 having been
resolved in favour of the ordinary jurisdiction of the High Court
under the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Chapter 12
Excessive ball:
It is a fundamental right guaranteed by the US
Constitution, 8 Amendment, that "Excessive bail shall not be
required.. ..". Bail here seems to have been used in the sense
of "security", so that it applies to cases of release on personal bond
as well as release on the bond of sureties. The 8th Amendment says
nothing about whether bail shall be available at all. It was held in
Carlson v Landon (342 US 524 (1952):
"The bail clause was lifted with slight
changes from the English Bill of Rights
Act. In England that clause has never
been thought to accord a right to bail in
all cases, but merely to provide that bail
shall not be excessive in those cases
where it is proper to grant bail. When
this clause was carried over into our Bill
of Rights, nothing was said that
indicated
different
any
concept...
It was held in Stack v Boyle (342 US 1; 96 L Ed 3-1951) that-
"Bail set at a figure higher than an
amount reasonably calculated (to ensure
the defendant's presence at trial) is
excessive
the Eighth
Amendment".

The reason why this right against excessive bail was
constitutionally guaranteed is that the result of denying bail and
requiring excessive bail is the same. To grant bail but to require
excessive bail, wholly disproportionate to the circumstances of the
case, may well amount to giving by one hand and taking hack by
another. In the words of Justice Marshall in his dissenting opinion
in US v Salerno:
"If excessive bail is imposed the
defendant stays in jail. The same result is
achieved if bail is denied altogether.
Whether the Magistrate sets bail at $1
billion or refuses to set bail at all, the
consequences are indistinguishable. It
would be mere sophistry to suggest that
the Eighth Amendment protects against
the former decision, and not the latter
The protection against excessive bail is not a constitutional
protection in Pakistan; it is provided by section 498 Cr. P. C:
"The amount of every bond executed
under this Chapter shall be fixed with
due regard to the circumstances of the
case, and shall not be excessive........".
Thus, though the amount of bail is in the discretion of the bail
granting authority, yet the amount must be fixed with due regard to
the circumstances of the case and it will be excessive if the amount
is "set at a figure higher than an amount reasonably calculated to
ensure the defendant's presence at trial".
The amount of bail, fixed by a police officer or a court,
is subject to the revisional powers, under section 498 Cr. P. C., of
the High Court and Court of Session, and if it is excessive it will be
reduced.
Chapter 13
Bail bonds and their forfeiture:
The provisions as to the bail bonds and their forfeiture
are contained in Chapter XLII Cr. P. C.
Sections 514, 514A and 514B lay down the procedure to
be followed when forfeiture of bond has occurred. Forfeiture of
bond occurs when a condition of the bond is violated. It has been
seen that under section 499 Cr. P. C. the condition on which the
accused is released on bail is that he shall attend at the time and
place mentioned in the bond and shall continue so to attend until
otherwise directed by the court. Thus, when the accused fails to
attend at the time and place mentioned in the bond, forfeiture of the
bond takes place.
The question usually arises whether when forfeiture of
the bond has taken place, the whole of the amount of the bond
should be forfeited and recovered from the surety. The leading
authority on the subject is Dildar v State (PLD 1963 SC 47):
"Sureties are not constituted as custodians of
accused persons and in the absence of proof to the
contrary, it may generally be assumed that they do
not gain by standing surety. The system of
releasing accused persons on bail has several
aspects of importance to the administration of
justice generally. It avoids anything in the nature of
punishment in advance, since restraint upon liberty
even when applied for the purpose of ensuring that
a case is duly enquired into and judged, necessarily
involves loss of personal rights. At the same time,
ue release of accused persons on bail assists in the
adn.inistration of justice by preventing over-
crowding in the available spaces of imprisonment.
676

Page 357
Therefore, in dealing with cases of sureties who are
in default a balance has to be held between undue
leniency, which might lead to abuse of the
procedure and interference with the course of
justice in a large number of cases, and on the other
hand, undue severity, which might lead to
unwillingness on the part of neighbours and friends
to come forward and give bail for persons under
accusation. Finally, in assessing to what extent the
bond should be forfeited, the court would have
regard to such matters as to whether the sureties
have any direct interest through financial or blood
connection with the absence of the accused, and
whether they have done their best to secure his
attendance".
The law has been re-examined in two recent cases
namely Zeshan Kazmi v The State (PLD 1997 SC 267) and Abdul
Bari v Ameer Jan (PLD 1998 SC 50). In Zeshan Kazmi case it was
noted that the observations of Cornelius, CJ. in Dildar case were
made "more than three decades ago, since then there has been
overall deterioration in all spheres of life. The crime rate has
increased manifold. The criminal instinct/propensity has penetrated
in all walks of life.....", and in Abdul Bari v Ameer Jan, these
observations were reaffirmed and in the facts of that case, the
decision of the court below to forfeit 25% of the amount of surety
bond only was set aside. The rule thus is that the extent of
imposition of penalty by the court while forfeiting a bond is within
the discretion of the court which is to be exercised keeping in view
the circumstances of each case.
Chapter 14
Are questions of bail or conditions of bail a matter of
procedure only:
To take an extreme ca e, suppose that the law under
which a person is arrested provides that the offence is bailable or
that the offence is non-bailable, but the court may, in its discretion.
grant bail. Suppose also that A is arrested under the law, and the
court releases him on bail. Suppose further, that the law is.
subsequent to his release on bail, amended and it is provided in the
amended law that an accused arrested for such an offence shall not
be released on bail at all. Such a law will be constitutionally valid
because the Constitution does not provide that bail is a right. Can A
be taken into custody, although the amended law does not say that
persons in the position of A should be re-arrested? That question
will turn on whether bail is a matter of procedure only or whether it
touches substantive rights. If it is a matter of procedure only, the
amended law will, so hold the decided cases, e.g. Colonial Sugar
Refining Company v Irving (1905 AC 369), apply retrospectively.
with the very serious consequence that A will be deprived of his
liberty and sent to prison, to remain there, during the course of the
trial. may be for an indefinite period. Not only are the
consequences serious for A but also for his family.
The question arose in an acute form in Hakim Ali
Zardari v State (PLD 1998 SC 1). The appellant was arrested under
the Ehtsab Ordinance 1997, which empowered the court to release
an accused on bail, but provided that "the amount of bail will be
fixed having regard to the gravity of the charge...... and where
the charge specified any amount in respect of which the offence is
alleged to have been committed, shall not be less than twice the
amount". The appellant was allowed interim bail on his furnishing
bail bond in the sum of Rupees one million with two sureties. On
his request, the appellant was allowed, instead of two sureties, to
deposit prize bonds of the value of two million. Before the
confirmation of the bail, the Ordinance was repealed by the Ehtsab
Act 1997, which provided that the amount of bail would not be less
than the amount specified in the charge and empowered the court
to "direct that the amount be deposited (in cash) in court". The
Ehtsab Bench, while confirming the bail, ordered that the appellant
shall deposit Rupees one crore in cash as the amount of bail.
678
679

Page 358
The question was whether the appellant's case had
continued to be governed by the Ordinance or whether the Act in
so far as it empowered the court to order the amount of bail to be
deposited in cash, applied retrospectively to the appellant's case.
The question in the words of Saiduzzamman Siddiqui J. speaking
for the majority, was "whether the condition for deposit of bail
amount in cash.......is a valid condition, in view of the change in
the law". This, the learned Judge observed. "depends on a finding
whether the conditions for grant of bail are matters relating to
procedure or they relate to substantive rights". In other words, the
question was "whether the provisions relating to fixation of amount
of bail and the discretion conferred on the court to order deposit of
this amount in the court under the Act, are only matters of
procedure or they also touch upon the existing rights of the
parties".
Relying upon Adnan Afzal case (PLD 1986 SC 187) and
other cases and some books, the learned Judge concluded:
"The provision in the Act conferring
jurisdiction on the courts to direct deposit
of bail amount in the court instead of
executing bond or offering securities for
the amount in our view related only to a
procedural matter which did not affect the
existing right of the appellant for the grant
of bail under the Ordinance. Whether the
concession of bail allowed by the court is
to be enjoyed by the accused on the
execution of the personal bond, furnishing
of the securities or deposit of the amount
in court is purely regulatory and
procedural in nature in which the person
enlarged on bail, in our view, cannot
claim any vested right. Similarly, the
provision in the Act, that the amount of
the bail should not be fixed by the court
less than the amount mentioned in the
charge, is more beneficial to the accused
as compared to the provisions in the
Ordinance.....the mere fact that the
accused is required to deposit the amount
in court instead of securing the same
through securities or bond cannot be said
to have caused prejudice to the accused or
have taken away any of his vested
rights.....".
In his dissenting note, Mukhtar Ahmed Junejo J. thought that the
interim bail granted to the appellant under the Ordinance and
before the coming into force of the Act, was a matter which
"became a past and closed transaction under the repealed
Ordinance, 1997". The change introduced by the Act, empowering
the court to require the deposit in cash of the bail amount, in the
view of the learned Judge, "was a change in the substantive law
and therefore cannot operate retrospectively to deprive the
appellant of his right to remain on bail in terms of the orders" made
before the Act came into force.
The first observation that falls to be made is that the bail
granted to the appellant under the Ordinance was an interim bail.
That means that the question whether the appellant was entitled to
bail, as of right, had not yet been finally decided under the
Ordinance. That fell to be decided when the bail came to be
confirmed, and by that time, the Ordinance had been repealed by
the Act. Looked at from that angle, the question of the appellant
having acquired a vested right under the Ordinance, or of that right
being affected by the new provisions in the Act did not arise. The
question whether the appellant was entitled, as of right, to bail, was
thus finally decided, not under the Ordinance, but under the Act.
This interim order, by its very nature, did not decide, and was
incapable of deciding, finally the question whether the appellant
was entitled to bail; the interim order was subject to the final order
and as the final order was made under the Act, it was the Act, and
680

not the Ordinance, which governed the question of bail and the
conditions on which it could be granted. That should have, it is
submitted, rendered it unnecessary to raise and decide the question
whether the conditions for the grant of bail were matters relating to
procedural or substantive law.
But since that question was actually decided, we shall
make such comments as the importance of the matter warrants.
What is the proper approach to determining such a
controversy? Is it to see whether the matter is one of procedural or
substantive law? Or, is it what label to apply to the amending
enactment-procedural or substantive?
It is fair to state at the outset that there are no cases "on
which differences of opinion may readily be entertained, or which
are more embarrassing to dispose of, than the cases where the court
has to decide whether or not an amending statute affects procedure
and consequently will operate retrospectively or affects substantive
rights and therefore in the absence of clear contrary intention,
should not be read as acting retrospectively. The distinction
between procedural matters and substantive rights must often be of
great fineness......"
The proper approach, it is submitted, was stated by the
Privy Council in the Yew Bon Tew case (1982) 3 All ER 833), a
case from Malaysia. A motor bus belonging to the respondents
collided with a motorcycle driven by the first appellant with the
second appellant as pillion passenger. Both the appellants were
injured. The respondent was a statutory body and the accident
occurred in the course of the respondents' public duties. Under the
relevant law, the period of limitation for an action was 12 months,
in this case up to 5 April 1973. No action was brought during that
period. On 13 June 1974, the law was amended, and the period of
limitation for such actions was fixed as 36 months. An action was
brought on 20 March 1975. The question was whether the period of
limitation was 12 or 36 months, and whether the amending law was
682
procedural and hence retrospective. The Privy Council observed
that-
there is at common law a prima
facie rule of construction that a statute
should not be interpreted retrospectively
so as to impair an existing right or
obligation unless that result is
unavoidable on the language used. A
statute is retrospective if it takes away or
impairs a vested right acquired under
existing laws, or creates J new
obligation, or imposes a new duty, or
attaches a new disability, in regard to
events already past. There is however
said to be an exception in the case of a
statute which is purely procedural,
because no person has a vested right in
any particular course of procedure....".
But, these expressions, 'retrospective" and "procedural", so said the
Privy Council,
"though useful in a particular context.
are equivocal and therefore can be
misleading......
In the view of the Privy Council.
...the proper approach to the
construction of the 1974 Act is not to
decide what label to apply to it,
procedural or otherwise, but to see
whether the statute. if applied
retrospectively to a particular type of
case, would impair existing rights and
obligations A Limitation Act
683

may therefore be procedural in the
context of one set of facts, but
substantive in the case of a different set
of facts".
It was, accordingly, held, "that an accrued right to plead a time bar,
which is acquired after the lapse of the statutory period, is in every
sense a right, even though it arises under an Act which is
procedural....".
Returning to Hakim Ali Zardari case, assuming that the
question of bail and its conditions had been finally decided under
the Ehtsab Ordinance 1997, the proper approach, it is submitted,
would have been to ask whether the new provisions in the Act
could be applied retrospectively so as to impair the appellant's
existing rights. One of the existing rights that the appellant had
acquired under the Ordinance was no less than the constitutionally
guaranteed right to personal liberty described as the most cherished
right. "If excessive bail is imposed, the defendant stays in jail. The
same result is achieved if the bail is denied altogether. Whether the
Magistrate sets the bail at $ 1 billion or refused to set bail at all, the
consequences are indistinguishable......" (Justice Marshall in
Salerno-481 US 739; 95 L Ed 2d 697).
This approach should have led, inexorably in our
opinion, to the answer that the new provisions in the Act could not
be applied retrospectively to the case of the appellant. The
condition of cash deposit of as much as one crore could not be
imposed under the Ordinance; it could be, and was, imposed under
the Act. The result of the failure of the appellant to comply with it
was that he had to go to jail. This is how his existing right to
personal liberty under the Ordinance was impaired by the new
provisions of the Act, and this is how the new provisions operated
retrospectively.
