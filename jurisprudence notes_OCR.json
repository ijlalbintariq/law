  "Introduction",
  "The subject matter of jurisprudence is the nature of law and its working. That,",
  "clearly, is a subject of some breadth, and so it is not surprising that different theo-",
  "rists take different perspectives on the law and what is most important about it.",
  "Historically, theorists often approached the nature of law through the study of",
  "legal ideas or concepts; so for example, one would seek to explain what the essence",
  "of property' was, or the nature of 'rights' or what punishment amounted to and",
  "how it might be justified. These sorts of inquiries are still found in jurisprudence",
  "courses today. But they are no longer regarded as central to the enterprise in the",
  "way the issues covered by this book are. Nowadays we find two central strands to",
  "jurisprudence-what might be called the philosophy of law' and 'legal theory'.",
  "1.1 The philosophy of law",
  "As its name indicates, the philosophy of law concerns itself with whatever philo-",
  "sophical issues arise because of the existence of law. Such as? Well, the law is typ-",
  "ically enforced by a state which uses coercion, punishments or the threat thereof,",
  "to ensure that the law is complied with. Is it therefore true, we may ask, that the law",
  "is necessarily coercive? Some theorists have thought so, for example Kelsen, who",
  "thought that law was by definition the form of social order which applies sanctions",
  "to those who break rules. Others, such as Raz, would say no-for Raz, even a soci-",
  "ety of angels would need laws; for example, however morally stainless they might",
  "be, as drivers they would need traffic laws, rules of the road to avoid crashing into",
  "each other, just as much as we fallen creatures do.",
  "To take another example, everyone agrees that the Nazi legal system contained",
  "some very wicked laws. Some philosophers, such as Fuller, have contended that the",
  "Nazi legal system was so wicked that it did not really count as a legal system at all,",
  "on the basis that there are minimum moral requirements which a system of state",
  "rules must possess for it to be a legal system at all. Hart, by contrast, thought this",
  "a confusion: wicked though it was, the Nazis still had a legal system; it was just a",
  "very wicked legal system, which because of its wickedness no one had any moral",
  "obligation to obey.",
  "Now stop and think for a moment about these two examples. You almost start",
  "thinking by noticing you have a gut reaction, preferring the view of one of the",
  "theorists to the other in each case. To put this slightly more elaborately, you have a",

  "prescriptive conclusion from it. (Artistic creativity and genius are statistically",

  "gourmets (those who sometimes eat purely for pleasure) would seem to",

  "that these persons mean something prescriptive when they say \"laws of",

  "is there perhaps a cosmic legislature? If, as is most likely the case, these",

  "this, avoid all the confusing and ambiguous references to laws of nature,",
  "and face the resulting problems honestly and squarely-one of the problems",
  "in our system being the First Amendment's ban on an establishment of",
  "religion.",
  "Not all linkings between descriptive and prescriptive law, however, are",
  "as confused as the one noted above. Consider the following problem: Would",
  "we say that a certain-document-a written constitution perhaps-was really",
  "the prescriptive law of the land if nobody ever in fact obeyed it or paid it",
  "even the slightest bit of attention? Does not the claim that the United States",
  "Constitution is the highest prescriptive law of the land have something to",
  "do with the descriptive fact that this document is actually appealed to in",
  "deciding legal cases? If, starting tomorrow (because of a revolution perhaps),",
  "all citizens, legislators, government executives, and courts started ignoring",
  "the Constitution, would it still be the law of the land? At some point would",
  "Iwe not be forced to say that it was at most former or previous law?",
  "Legality is not to be simply identified with descriptive regularity any",
  "more than it is to be simply identified with morality or force. As these",
  "questions clearly show, however, it must have some important relationship",
  "with such regularity. An analysis of the concept of law will perhaps illuminate",
  "what this relationship is.",
  "(3) The concept of law strikes up against certain puzzling but important",
  "borderline cases-cases of practices or institutions that have enough features",
  "in common with clear cases of law to tempt us to regard them as law but",
  "enough dissimilar features to tempt us in the other direction as well. Is",

  "We cannot, of course, even understand this claim of moral allegiance to",
  "law until we understand the concept of law itself, and, given that rational",
  "evaluation presupposes understanding, we cannot evaluate the claims for",
  "moral fidelity to law in the absence of such analysis. If, for example, law",
  "is simply to be identified with mere force, then it would be hard to mount",
  "a persuasive case for a moral obligation to obey the law. I may fear and",
  "understandably obey the thug holding a gun to my head, but the thug",

  "fidelity and allegiance are surely provocative enough to demonstrate the",
  "importance of analyzing the concept of law even to those (their numbers",
  "are legion) who do not see philosophical clarity as a good for its own sake.",
  "A second (and related) practical reason for being concerned with an",
  "analysis of the concept of law is more strictly legal in nature. When, in an",
  "everyday context, we seek to have \"the law\" applied to a controversy in",
  "which we are involved, what exactly are we seeking? Those who are naive",
  "about the nature of law are inclined to think that it is easy to discover the",
  "law that applies to any particular case: one just looks it up in a statute",
  "book or pays a lawyer to look it up. In reality, however, the process of",
  "discovering the law is often not so simple. Perhaps the statute is vague-",
  "e.g., it prohibits driving a vehicle while intoxicated and you, cited for being",
  "intoxicated while pedaling your bicycle, believe that the statute does not",
  "really cover your action (you believe that a bicycle is not a vehicle). When",
  "the court agrees with you and holds that a bicycle is not a vehicle for",
  "purposes of this statute, even though in an earlier case it had held that a",
  "moped with its engine off is a vehicle, what is actually going on? Is the",
  "court really applying a law to new cases or is it simply making it up as it",
  "goes along, legislating rather than judging?",
  "If interpreting a simple statute can raise problems about the nature of",
  "law, imagine how these problems can be compounded in other more complex",
  "sorts of cases. Some cases are only loosely governed by statute or not",
  "governed by statute at all. In a common law system such as ours, applying",
  "\"the law\" to a particular case often means, not applying a statute, but",
  "rather a present judge applying to the present case the rulings (called",
  "\"precedents\") of previous judges in earlier cases. Since these earlier cases",
  "are rarely exactly like the present case, however, the judge will have to",
  "depend on analogies, a process that at least seems to leave a great deal of",
  "free play for the judge's discretion. Sometimes the decision, though defended",
  "by analogy with the past, will transform the law for the future, as when",
  "Justice Cardozo for the first time, interpreted precedents so that automobile",
  "manufacturers could be held liable for injuries caused to the driving public",
  "by negligent manufacture of their product. What does it mean to talk about",
  "\"the law\" here was it something Cardozo discovered and applied or did",
  "he just invent it, using the talk about precedents simply as a rationalization?",
  "Or consider controversial constitutional cases-e.g.. the Supreme Court",
  "finding that the right to privacy, though never mentioned in the Constitution,",
  "is a fundamental constitutional right and then holding that this right",

  "any sentence he substituted for any occurrence of the word to be defined so as to",
  "yield a new sentence equivalent in meaning to the old. Or they can be answered",
  "by giving a definition in use. i.e.. by giving a series of equivalences each consisting",
  "of one sentence in which the word to be defined occurs and one sentence in which",
  "the word to be defined does not occur and that also differs from the first sentence",
  "in some further respect. From such a series we gather the use of the original word.",

  "Bentham attacked",
  "Beyond this Bentham attacked natural law upon philosophical grounds. In some",
  "ways Bentham stood in a tradition of increasing 'secularisation' in legal theory",
  "which can be traced at least to the seventeenth century, for example, in the work",
  "of Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679). Bentham's immediate philosophical inspiration",
  "however, lay in the distinction between 'is' and 'ought, descriptive and normative,",
  "as exposed by David Hume. Hume wrote that Censorial juripuance",

  "(D. Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, ed. L. A. Selby-Bigge and P. H. Nidditch (Oxford:",
  "Oxford University Press, 1978), 3.1.1)",
  "In other words, it does not follow from the fact that a thing or condition 'is' that it",
  "'ought' so to be. Whether the classical natural lawyers discussed in the last chapter",
  "really fall foul of this criticism is to be doubted, but the conventional quasi-natural",
  "law ideas attacked by Bentham were much more open to it.",
  "In any event, Bentham's broad aim was to establish a scientific jurisprudence",
  "which would clearly distinguish between the descriptive and the normative and",
  "deal with each upon its own appropriate level without confusion. To this ende",

  "The relationships and the detail of these elements are manifestly more complex",

  "that a 'sovereign' may be a body of persons rather than a single autocrat- indeed,",
  "the nineteenth-century English legal sovereign was clearly a collective body-",
  "Bentham and Austin seem to have become entrapped in a discourse of personal",

  "when the mandate in question has already been issued, and 'pre-adoption,",

  "The diversity of these examples, and others omitted. demonstrates the peculiarit",
  "of the proposition. The officer's orders rely upon a structure of superior authority",
  "and military law which ultimately derive from sovereign authorisation and,",
  "Bentham interpreted the situation, the sovereign 'adopts' each successive level of",
  "'command' by not countermanding it. Military orders, perhaps, fit reasonably wel",
  "with a 'command' theory, but the cook and the nurse, in more modern langua",
  "we should perhaps refer more generally to 'employees', fit much more oddly in",
  "this scheme. It is true that a contract of employment may ultimately be enforce!",
  "through legal proceedings, but to ascribe the arrangement itself upon this basis",
  "sovereign command seems a contorted and needless nicety of interpretation. The",
  "is a point that emerges more clearly perhaps in the context of the application d",
  "'sanctions' to facilitative laws such as provision for contract.",
  "The idea of tacit, or adoptive, command has been much attacked, not least withs",
  "the positivist tradition. H. L. A. Hart remarks that",
  "The incoherence of the theory...may be seen most clearly in its incapacity to explain",
  "why the courts of the present day should distinguish between a Victorian statute which",
  "has not been repealed as still law, and one which was repealed under Edward VII as",
  "no longer law. Mainly... the courts... use...a criterion (of legal identification]... which",
  "embraces past as well as present legislative operations.",
  "(HL. A. Hart, The Concept of Law (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1961), p. 63)",
  "In short, legislation is a process the products of which are identified according",
  "to criteria of recognition without need for 'adoption' by the personnel of a given",
  "time. These criteria include, of course, due authority, but this is not quite the same",

  "idea of adoption of contracts and other similar arrangements, founded upon the",

  "isation. It is undeniable that laws are imperatively expressed and are in their effects",
  "both prescriptive and normative,",
  "and normative, but it does not follow from this that all laws are",
  "simply orders. Many laws are facilitative; for example, a contract or a will may only",

  "Turning to the issue of the character of the sovereign who issues the commands,",
  "in view of his philosophical starting point it is not surprising that Bentham was",
  "anxious in his definition of 'sovereignty' o avoid any suggestion of a right to rule.",
  "True to his expository intention, he was concerned simply to describe the fact of",
  "rulership. Thus he defined a 'sovereign' as",

  "(no matter on what account) supposed to be in a disposition to pay obedience: and that",
  "in preference to the will of any other person.",

  "wide range of elements à varying degrees. The final clause, the preferential habit",
  "of obedience, refers obviously to the primacy of the sovereign, as compared with",

  "only a positive mark of sovereignty (obedience by others) but also a negative mark",
  "That [sovereign] is not in a habit of obedience to a determinate human superior.",

  "Introduction",
  "This chapter identifies that part of legal theory which is known as",
  "analytical positivism, and considers the work of two of its leading",
  "English exponents, namely Austin and Hart. More particularly, it will",
  "show how the work of the latter remedies certain deficiencies in the",
  "work of the former.",
  "The tradition of English analytical positivism may be traced back to the",
  "work of Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832). Although some of Bentham's work",
  "was published in his lifetime, the manuscript of his major work on legal",
  "theory was overlooked for more than a century, with its first publication",
  "occurring as late as",
  "as late as 1945, under the title The Limits of Jurisprudence Defined,",
  "before appearing in",
  "in definitive form in 1970 as Of Laws in General. There",
  "was, however, no such delay in the publication of the work of his follower,",
  "John Austin (1790-1852).",
  "In 1826 Austin became the first Professor of Jurisprudence in the newly",
  "founded University of",
  "rsity of London, which subsequently became University",
  "College, London. (Before this time, access to university education was",
  "restricted to",
  "Ito members of the Church of England, and University College",
  "specifically to widen access to university education for",
  "or no-religious persuasions. This objective, together",
  "fact that",
  "was -and indeed still is - based in Gower Street, not",
  "was founded spe",

  "people of other",

  "the fact",
  "only explains why members of the college are commonly called 'the",
  "godless of Gower Street', but also made it a peculiarly appropriate envi-",

  "positivist professor of law.) Austin's work, The Province of",
  "Jurisprudence e Determined, which consisted of",
  "rofessor",
  ", which consisted of the text of six lectures which",
  "he had delivered in the college, was first published in 1832, but his version",
  "of what is known as the command theory of law continued to dominate the",
  "English teaching of jurisprudence well into the 20th century.",
  "as",
  "Finally, and by way of an aside, one reason why analytical positivism",
  "came to dominate English legal theory, is that 'late-nineteenth and",
  "twentieth century juristic thought evolved mainly within a university",
  "culture which emphasized rigorous inquiry and the systematization of",
  "knowledge'. (Neil Duxbury, Why English Jurisprudence is Analytical, in",
  "[2004] Current Legal Problems, forthcoming.) Thus it is not surprising",
  "that the work of John Austin fell to be assessed by succeeding",

  "dence. This necessarily involves eliminating a great deal of material",
  "which may in one way or another be said to be law, without being law for",
  "the present purposes. Austin begins with an unequivocal statement of his",
  "positivist position:",
  "'The matter of jurisprudence is positive law; law, simply and strictly so called:",
  "or law set by political superiors to political inferiors (The Province of Jurispru-",
  "dence Determined, 1832, p. 9.)",
  "Further refinements are then introduced. First, the political superior",
  "must be a sovereign:",
  "absolute",
  "'If a determinate human superior, not in the habit of obedience to a like supe-",
  "rior, receive habitual obedience from the bulk of a given society, that determi-",
  "nate superior is sovereign in that society, and the society (including the",
  "superior) is a society political and independent.' (Op. cit., p. 194.)",
  "The next stage is to explain the concept of command, which may be",
  "either 'direct or circuitous'. (Op. cit., p. 134):",
  "'The ideas or notions comprehended by the term command are the following.",
  "(1) A wish or desire conceived by a rational being, that another rational being",
  "shall do or forebear. (2) An evil to proceed from the former, and to be incurred",
  "by the latter, in case the latter not comply with the wish. (3) An expression or",
  "intimation of the wish by words or other signs.' (Op. cit., p. 17.)",
  "It will be apparent that, for these purposes, the idea of a sanction (i.e. the",
  "evil which is imposed in the event of non-compliance with the",
  "command) is inextricably involved in the idea of the command itself.",
  "Finally, the status of law is reserved for a command which 'obliges",
  "generally to acts or forbearances of a class'. (Emphasis added.)",
  "In summary, therefore, Austin's version of law requires a command",
  "which is both express and general, which is issued from a sovereign to a",
  "subject, and non-compliance with which results in the sovereign",
  "imposing a sanction on the subject. We must now consider each of these",
  "elements in more detail.",

  "nesses of this general tradition may be seen to advantage in Kelsen's legal theory.",
  "Like all positivists Kelsen was concerned with what law 'is', but he was not directly",
  "concerned with the substantive norms of any particular legal system. His interest",
  "was instead in the nature of the building blocks out of which a legal system, any",
  "legal system, is constructed. The model which he advanced is one of a hierarchy of",
  "norms, each of which is validated by a preceding norm until, finally, an ultimate",
  "of authorisation is reached in a basic norm termed the Grundnorm. This",
  "model is essentially abstract and Kelsen never suggested that actual legal systems",
  "are expressly formulated in this way. Rather, it is rather, suggested that this is how",
  "a legal system, whatever its mode of expression, actually works.",
  "source",
  "Kelsen termed his legal theory 'pure', implying some lack of contamination. By",
  "this he meant that the theory excluded from consideration all factors which could",
  "not be regarded as of the essence of 'law'. These included a wide range of consider",
  "ations which other schools of jurisprudence incorporate in their models of law and",
  "its operation, for some of which Kelsen manifested an unmistakable contempt.",
  "This endeavour to establish a pure theory rested upon a concept of knowledge.",
  "which owed much to the work of Immanuel Kant (1724-1804).",
  "3.4.1 Pure theory and the Kantian theory of knowledge",
  "immanuel Kant argued that in acquiring knowledge human beings impose a",
  "framework of categorisations upon their impressions of the world beyond them-",
  "selves. The impressions thus processed in the cause of understanding therefore",
  "have imposed upon them a structure which not necessarily inherent in the",
  "objective phenomena observed. In other words, the nature of the human percep-",
  "tual and cognitive faculties contributes to the shape of our concepts, and thus the",
  "way in which we think about the world. Two of the best examples of this are our",
  "concepts of space and time, which we find it impossible to 'think outside of'. It",
  "should be emphasised that this is not to assert a condition of error or falsity, it is",
  "simply to advance an analysis of the ways in which the world impinges upon us",
  "are tracked, processed, and structured into forms of understanding acceptable to",
  "human mentality.",
  "In what can only be described as a bold move, Kelsen claims to have set out a",
  "similar formal conceptual structure through which the nature of law and legal",
  "systems may be known, even though this structure may be far removed from the",
  "overt substance of any given legal system. Thus, for Kelsen, although jurisprudence",
  "is to be considered a science in the sense that it aims to discover the facts about our",
  "concept of law, it should not be treated as a natural science, which is concerned",
  "with the observation of facts and analysis of causal relations. Instead, Kelsenian",
  "jurisprudence seeks to discover a logical structure underlying the objective reality",
  "of our concept of law.",
  "The pure theory is a science of norms, one concerned with 'ought' propositions",
  "and not the study of factually descriptive 'is' propositions. Lest it be thought that",
  "there is here a conflict with the claimed positivism of Kelsen's theory, it should be",
  "Classical Legal Positivism: Bentham, Austin, and Kelsen",
  "emphasised that these are not, for example, the moral or ethical 'oughts' with",
  "which naturalist theories are concerned. The point is rather that law is by its nature",
  "normative: it is concerned precisely with what people 'ought', or 'ought not', to do.",
  "Of course, people do not always actually do what they ought to, or, indeed, always.",
  "avoid doing what they ought not to do. For Kelsen legal norms take the general",
  "form that if condition x applies then consequence y ought to follow. The effect of",
  "such a norm is essentially to validate, i.e., render 'legal', the actions or decisions",
  "which in any given case comprise consequence y. Again, it must be stressed that",
  "this is a model of how the law works and not a description of how it is stated. In",
  "English law the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 does not, quite, state that",
  "'if development is undertaken without planning permission, then an enforcement",
  "notice ought to be served upon the developer'. There is a certain degree of local",
  "planning authority discretion in this respect. The process is seen by Kelsen as one",
  "of authorisation. Thus the local planning authority is authorised by the summary",
  "norm stated above to serve enforcement notices in appropriate cases, but not, of",
  "course, in inappropriate cases.",
  "How compelling is Kelsen's 'Kantian' approach to theorising the law? Two dif-",
  "ficulties might immediately be noticed. First, it is one thing for Kant to argue that",
  "our concepts of 'space' and 'time' are more or less unshiftable constraints upon our",
  "ability to conceive the world, unshiftable in the sense that they seem more or less",
  "'hard-wired' in us, as aspects of our fundamental way of seeing the world we cannot",
  "sensibly transcend. It is quite another to say the same thing about the concept of",
  "law, in respect of which it is easy to observe shifting historical and cultural under-",
  "standings. In the second place, Kelsen ties his idea of law to the normative (rather",
  "than causal) relation that if x then y ought to follow, where y is a sanction; so Kelsen",
  "yis",
  "embraces a sanction theory of law, and so his theory raises the same sort of worries",
  "as Bentham and Austin's command ('orders backed by threats') theory of law.",
  "3.4.2 The meaning of 'purity'",

  "from consideration all factors and issues which can be considered not to be strictly",
  "\"legal'. These include all the moral, ethical, sociological, and political factors and",
  "values which are commonly advanced in explanation or pleaded in justification of",

  "an hypothetical judgment expressing a specific relationship between a conditioning",

  "it is necessary to appreciate the nature of the norms in question and the functio",

  "number of important, and in some ways problematic, issues.",
  "3.4.3.1 The structure of norms",

  "intended purity of the analysis. The pure theory excludes not only moral, political",
  "and sociological values but also ideas of the purpose, in the sense of legislative",
  "judicial intention, of law; we have just seen how this can give rise to a problem",
  "in the inability of the Kelsenian to distinguish a tax from a fine. Such ideas an",

  "pure theory is concerned with the active function of legal norms, that is to sa",
  "how they actually work. Interpreting norms should be left to moralists, politician",
  "and sociologists.",
  "As we have seen, according to Kelsen the key function of law in this sense is on",
  "of coercion. He argued that all legal norms are concerned with force, either with!",
  "response to unilateral use of force, for its suppression, or in the threatened or actu",
  "use of legal force to secure compliance with lawful orders and directions. The se",
  "ond category, of course, embraces the first insofar as, for example, a tortfeasor",
  "criminal may be confronted with legal force in order to terminate the wrongfu",
  "conduct in question. Thus the normative formula-if condition x is satisfied the",
  "consequence y ought to follow-will take the concrete form that if the specifie",
  "situation occurs then the stated sanction ought to be applied.",
  "Classical Legal Positivism: Bentham, Austin, and Kelsen",
  "The emphasis upon coercion resonates strongly with the Benthamite/Austinian",
  "concept of law as the 'command of a sovereign backed by a sanction'. There is a",
  "significant difference, however, in that Bentham and Austin saw the application",
  "of sanctions as a predictive element accounting for the working of legal obligation.",
  "Kelsen's norms, in contrast, are not supposed to be factually predictive. It is simply",

  "the way in which positive law acts, rather than with the forms in which it may be",
  "stated. In effect, the norms are summaries of authorisations admitting the taking",

  "in turn, is determined by a third one.",

  "Thus, upon the Kelsenian model, the norm that if the judge hearing a case orders",
  "the payment of damages by the defendant then damages ought to be levied (under",
  "coercion if need be), follows from the prior norm that, if the conduct of a defend-",
  "ant falls within the stated category then the judge ought to make an award of",
  "damages, and so on up to a legislative enactment or (in a common law system)",

  "those who deviate or threaten to deviate is great.' (Op. cit., p. 86.)",

  "Although the phrases being obliged and being under an obligation to do",

  "between them. He illustrates the distinction through the example of a",
  "gunman, A, who demands money Hom",
  "from a victim, B. According to the",

  "to",
  "the money (because he fears the consequences f he does not do so), but",
  "we would not say that B",

  "to comply",
  "say that B is even obliged to comply with the demand if the harm which",
  "A threatens to inflict on B is merely trivial; or if the harm is serious but",
  "there are circumstances making it unlikely that A will actually inflict it.",

  "so it is possible to be under an obligation without being obliged. For example, if",
  "the law requires that all able-bodied males within a specified age group shall",

  "the distinction between primary and secondary legal rules, and the",
  "for both to exist before there can be said to be a legal system.",
  "Primary rules are those which impose obligations. Such rules",

  "from murder. However, it will be readily apparent that the",

  "frequently be uncertainty as to the content of the primary rules, coupled",
  "a need to change them from time to time, and a need to resolve",
  "arising from the application of the rules in particular cases. It is",
  "with these matters that Hart formulates the concept of secondary",
  "which he classifies under three headings.",
  "The first category of secondary rules deals with the proble",
  "uncertainty. Here, Hart says, there must be a rule of recognition,",
  "actors within the legal system can recognize those rules which a",
  "English analytical positivism 83",
  "and distinguish them from those which are not. The rule of recogni-",
  "tion operates",
  "'by reference to some general characteristic possessed by the primary rules.",
  "This may be the fact of their having been enacted by a specific body, or their",
  "long customary practice, or their relation to judicial decisions.' (Op. cit., p. 95.)",
  "In the English system, therefore, the rule of recognition has at least two",
  "limbs: those things are law which are enacted by, or under the authority",
  "of, Parliament, as are the decisions of the courts which acquire authorita-",
  "tive status under the doctrine of binding precedent. It may be possible to",
  "formulate it in such a way that more limbs appear. For example, the rule",
  "of recognition may extend to laws emanating from the European",
  "Community, and it may still be possible to regard custom as a source of",
  "English law. However, the first of these propositions stems directly from",
  "the European Communities Act 1972, while the second stems from a",
  "number of judicial decisions to this effect, and therefore the application",
  "of Occam's razor should leave the original formulation unadorned",
  "ned by",
  "by additions.",
  "(Occam's razor",
  "is the name given to the principle attributed",
  "to William of Occam, a a 14th century Franciscan philosopher, which",
  "requires superfluous elements in any argument to be discarded. He is",
  "said to have dissected arguments as if he were taking a razor to them.) At",

  "stage, therefore, it becomes plain why the obligation to stop at a red",

  "sense would seem to indicate that its being the very foundation of the",
  "legal system should make it primary, but we will introduce needless",
  "complication we try to redefine his terms.",
  "The second",
  "The second category of secondary rules, namely rules of change has",
  "two dimensions. The first dimension deals with the need to change the",
  "primary rules, which, in the context of the English legal system, means",
  "overruling judicial decisions in order to terminate their status as",
  "binding precedents, and repealing or amending statutes. Obviously,",
  "therefore, these rules are intimately connected with the rule of recogni-",

  "Despite Hart's use of the phrase natural law, it can be argued that this part",

  "to the functioning of society. Therefore, since no moral quality can attach",
  "to that which is truly essential, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that",
  "Hart's use of the phrase natural law is merely an attempt to establish that",
  "his subject matter has a moral status which closer consideration reveals to",
  "be not only spurious but also fundamentally inappropriate.",

  "(A A ruling that the court has no",
  "jurisdiction to deal with a particular matter may appear to be an excep-",
  "tion, but it is not truly so, since the ruling as to lack of jurisdiction is itself",

  "some examples, not of all of which Hart himself uses, the prohibition",

  "Secondly, the proposition that the existence of the rule of recog",
  "is a matter of fact creates a difficulty, since it is also, ex hypothesi, at",
  "of law. Hart responds to this by saying that 'the ultimate rule of re",

  "'even though it may not be arbitrary or irrational, [the decision] is in",

  "PART THREE",
  "PLATO'S JURISPRUDENCE",
  "THE PLATONIC CONCEPTION OF JUSTICE AS EVIDENCED",
  "IN THE REPUBLIC",
  "The ideal state has two key attributes: (i) it is founded upon justice; (i) all the citizens",
  "within it are happy. To achieve this Plato seeks to create a small scale city-state modelled",
  "upon the rather tribalist and closed societies of pre-classical Crete and Sparta. Plato's",
  "naturalism is not a scientific analysis of the reality of contemporary Athens - which he",
  "appeared to find distasteful-but an intellectual nostalgia for the supposed purity of a",
  "mythical golden age where all things belonged to their 'natural station'. To avoid his",
  "image of the ideal society being seen as a return to the past, Plato presents a narrative of",
  "the development of city life. While the first city came about purely as the result of",
  "material self interest, it soon began to pursue the idea of the common good. What is the",
  "common good? How is it to be known? Plato appears confident that some can",
  "understand what the common good truly entails, and is quite ready advocate",
  "compulsion and manipulation in realising these goals. Justice then means something like",
  "'what is necessary for the functioning of the common good'. Democracy has the appeal",
  "of freedom of thought, but this also is the reason for its self-destruction. Democracy",
  "espouses 'liberty' whereby 'every individual is free to do as he likes' (Republic, 375).",
  "Although many today find pluralism, diversity and variety attractive, Plato stressed its",
  "disintegrating effects. Authority is stripped of its foundations, the young do not look up",
  "to their elders, 'and the minds of the citizens become so sensitive that the least vestige of",
  "restraint is resented as intolerable' (384). He wams that dissension grows on the lack of",
  "social cohesion, and class struggle will develop. We need a comprehensive social vision",
  "that assures us that the social structure is just. This runs counter to the liberal image of",
  "freedom but, Plato asks, what price freedom in a society which displays its inequalities?",
  "Such a society will inevitably give rise to a struggle between the opposing sections - the",
  "rich and the poor over the material resources of society. And what of the moral",
  "condition of the society in which experimentation and diversity are seen a",
  "values? Plato",
  "gives a warning in his description of a permissive society in Book VIII. Lee\" (1974: 30)",
  "suggests that 'disunity, incompétence and violence, which he had seen at Athens and at",
  "Syracuse, were the main dangers against which Plato thought society must be protected\".",
  "What is the role of law? Law ensures collective action. Referring again to the",
  "narrative of the cave, Plato has a main character in the dialogue argue that: \"",
  "our job as lawgivers is to compel the best minds to attain what we have called the highest",
  "form of knowledge, and to ascend to the vision of the good... and when they have",
  "achieved this and see well enough, prevent them... [from] remaining in the upper",
  "world, and refusing to retum again to the prisoners in the cave below and share their",

  "class of potential Guardians and its education intensified, the parents of the child with",
  "iron or bronze in its make-up must harden their hearts and degrade it to the ranks of",
  "industrial or agricultural workers.",
  "THE UNDERLYING STRESS UPON UNITY OF",
  "SOCIAL PURPOSE",
  "Three points underlie Plato's ideal republic: (1) the unity of the state is paramount; (i)",
  "this is not maintained primarily by laws and rules but by the Guardians' character and the",
  "general education system that produces the Guardians and others; and (iii) the Guardians",
  "do not hesitate to command and use the resources at their disposal, including those both",
  "discursive and hegemonic, in pursuit of the interests of the state. Unity is vital. There are",
  "certain pragmatic factors at work: to be unified, the state must not be too big or too",
  "small, and further, it must not contain extremes of wealth; since a real city is a unity and",
  "not a divided phenomenon (422e). A city requires unity of purpose this is the real",
  "constitutive mechanism, 30",
  "Plato is undoubtedly an elitist as well as a centralist; power is to be held by a",
  "systematically produced and educated body of experts. The system will produce citizens",
  "of good chancter who in turn produce children better than themselves, and so forth.",
  "Law has a limited role and should not hinder the rulers: 'good men need no orders",
  "they will find out easily enough what legislation is in general necessary' (425e). The",
  "education of the Guardians, rather than a legal constitution or code of statutes, provides",
  "structural strength to the republic, and the Guardians are not constrained by",
  "constitution or laws in their relationship to the other classes which are the objects of",
  "their rule. To modem sensibilities the social order is wrapped in a total ideology of rank",
  "reflecting a supposed natural order; ultimately even the rulers come to believe the myth",
  "29 The great theorist of legitimacy, Max Weber (discussed in Chapter 11 of this text, for his major work",
  "see Economy and Society, 1978), stressed that, when the fortunate classes or individuals wish to justify",
  "their position, the appeal to tradition is the usual method. Weber refers to the common myth of",
  "'blood superiority' as similar to the line of succession a king would use to justify his own reign.",
  "Tradition is one of the three dominant modes of legitimation along with the 'charismatic' and 'legal-",
  "rational' modes. But tradition is the widest, since even the 'modem' mode of legal-rational authority",
  "requires long standing common values, and in the modern legal system the ideal form of legal-",
  "radional domination the imagery of custom, precedent and veneration for decisions of the past is",
  "central.",
  "30 Thus, actual existing entities, which are referred to as cities, may not be true sates for Plato, since they",
  "do not have the sense of purpose and unity that a real city (state) should have. The Guardians are",
  "empowered to employ measures to ensure unity and remove sources of conflict and instability.",
  "Property is to be held in common, and nuclear families destroyed, replaced by state nurseries and",
  "regulated breeding programmes. Both measures are designed to make the city more of a unity.",
  "Conflict of interest are not regulated by a legal framework, they are simply done away with. Thus a",
  "pluralist society would be seen as a failure by Plato, in that in members regard themselves as belonging",

  "approach in contrast to Plato's idealism, he nevertheless shares the belief that there is a",
  "certain ontological structure to human nature and the cosmos. Aristode's writings are",
  "acutely logical, but work on the basis of classifying material provided by techniques",
  "s of",
  "observation (empiricism) loosely based upon biological studies. Aristode demands that",
  "we seek the essence of things, but that we do not do this by postulating that everything",
  "is a reflection of some pure idea or essence, rather we should try to ascertain the essential",
  "nature of things as they operate in the natural processes of the world. Our search for the",
  "essence of a thing is a search for the nature of that thing: what it is, and how it fits into",
  "the wider picture of this world's operation.",
  "Plato's theory of: timeless other world of",
  "pure essences seems to postulate that the actual 'reality' of things somehow existed",
  "outside the time and space structures we take for granted when we relate to things. But,",
  "for Aristotle, we are to turn our attention to the way things operate in this word around",
  "us. What guidelines are we to use? We have to look for the underlying similarities in the",
  "motion and change we see around us. Our basic assumption is that change is not",
  "random, that things develop in predictable ways, and that we differentiate between",
  "changes which are natural and those which are the product of human artifice. Natural",
  "changes are responses to the built-in ways of behaving that natural entities have; for",
  "example, plants grow into particular forms with distinctive ways of \"being'. Natural",
  "objects change towards their 'end', and it is through understanding this process that the",
  "'good' of objects and actions is made visible: 'the end for which each action is done is",
  "the good, the good in each particular case, and i general the highest good in the whole",
  "of nature' (Metaphysics, 982b). The dominant process in life is change - development -",
  "not some static state of being. All Aristotle's writings upon human life are thus seen to be",
  "based upon a teleological or purposive account of human nature: everything in nature",
  "has a distinctive 'end' to achieve, or a function to fulfil. The cosmos is teleological in",
  "structure 33",
  "Since social existence is natural and not some forced compromise, it is in the nature",
  "of humans to live in society. Aristotle argued that the contemporary Greek society was",
  "the result of a gradual process in which the nature of man was being realised.",
  "33 While change for Aristotle appears to have included motion, growth, decay, generation, and",
  "corruption, he appears much more optimistic than Plato. For Popper (1945, vol II: 5), Aristotle",
  "remains within the sway of t",
  "y of the Platonic idea of essences, but now the essence of something lies in its",
  "final stage of development, rather than in some original state. Teleology is the claim that the form or",
  "essen of anything developing is identical with the purpose or end or final state towards which it develops... The",
  "form or idea, which is sall, with Plato, considered to be the good, stands at the end, instead of the",

  "abuse of law in the 1930s and 1940s and advanced a theory of law which he catego",
  "rised as 'procedural naturalism' in an effort to set out the minimal requirements",
  "for a recognisable 'legal system. The basis for this analysis was the perceived weak-",
  "ness of law in the Third Reich and the extent to which it could realistically have",
  "been considered to have been 'law' in any meaningful sense. It is possible to debate",
  "in some detail whether the Third Reich actually was a Rechtsstaat, one governed",
  "by a 'rule of law' (see 15.1). Fuller himself specifically debated this issue with H. L.",
  "A. Hart (see 5.4.1), unfortunately upon the basis of a misleading report of the case",
  "which was the focus of debate.",
  "However, the theory which Fuller advanced was not specifically tied to the ques-",
  "tion of the use of law in the Third Reich, but sought to make a much more general",
  "point about the nature and functions of a legal system. As its usual description",
  "suggests. Fuller's theory was not founded upon the substantive content of legal",
  "provisions but upon the procedural structure of a legal system. It is open to some",
  "question whether this approach is correctly termed a 'natural law' theory (for dis-",
  "cussion of this see 7.1.4); it cannot, however, be denied that the analysis raises",
  "issues of profound importance for the understanding of law.",
  "In The Morality of Law, Fuller addresses the problem of the interface between law",
  "and morality with particular regard to the fact that in the general legal theory of",

  "There is little recognition...of a much larger problem, that of clarifying the directions",

  "points out, to the Platonic ideal. It is in a sense a maximum goal. The morality of",

  "such rules being applied), but, equally, they would be, and have been, of very dubi",
  "ous quality indeed. An obvious example would be a law penalising people on the",

  "One might reasonably consider that for a law to be made retroactively so as to cu",
  "a failure in the existing law would not only be unobjectionable but highly desi",
  "able. Fuller counsels against this as a general conclusion, citing the Roehm purged",
  "1934 under the Third Reich as a warning instance. Hitler had come to consider th",
  "SA faction led by Roehm as a threat to his position and therefore descended upor",
  "the group at one of their meetings and ordered the summary shooting of som",

  "murders into lawful 'executions', informed by Hitler's claim that he himself was",
  "the 'supreme court' of the German Volk (see The Morality of Law, pp. 54-5).",
  "This seems a rather curious example with which to illustrate the point. In the",
  "first place it may be questioned whether the Third Reich was a Rechtsstaat, a state",
  "ruled by law, at all, a question of which Fuller was well aware (see 5.4.1). Second,",
  "this use of law to validate a patently political purge which was wholly devoid of",
  "legal process is subject to so many other objections, even in terms of Fuller's pro-",
  "cedural criteria, that the question of 'retroactive cure' seems at most a periph-",

  "judicial precedents, and Fuller gives a number of examples. One may nonetheless",
  "suggest that if a law which is reasonable in itself failed to take account of some",
  "situation in which people are greatly and improperly prejudiced by its application,",
  "then retroactive relief for those people would seem justifiable. The important point",
  "to be emphasised is the element of 'relief' which should also require that the action",
  "does not unfairly prejudice other people who relied upon the law as it stood. Such",
  "instances may be rare, may indeed be hoped to be so, but the possibility should",

  "This position is very close indeed to that of classical common law thought. As",

  "Pound's problem of needing to identify jural postulates as objectively existing",
  "components of a legal system. But, of course, something must control legal",

  "One radical answer as to what that might be is given by the literary theorist",

  "that law, like any literary text, is a matter of interpretation. He goes on to argue,",
  "however, that what is interpreted (a literary text or historical legal materials)",
  "cannot be distinguished from the interpretation itself: that the interpretation",

  "no way given by the item interpreted itself (the statute or the precedent case, for",
  "Politics, professionalism and interpretive communities 173",
  "xample, does not, 'by its nature', rule out certain interpretations). The actual",
  "controls on interpretation arise from the conventions, expectations, shared",
  "understandings and structure of the interpreting community (for example, a",

  "But this denies the utility of what Dworkin advocates: a normative legal theory",
  "developed entirely from legal insider's perspective. A sociological view of",
  "lawyers patently refuses to be restricted to such a perspective. Thus, Dworkin",
  "rejects as 'extravagant' Fish's view that interpretation constitutes what is",
  "interpreted (Dworkin [R] 1985: 176). In some way the historical legal record",
  "must be the foundation of legal interpretation, not the other way around.",
  "Therefore, he relies on the requirement of 'fit'. Legal interpretations must fit",
  "the historical materials of the legal system-the body of existing constitutional",
  "provisions, statutes,",
  "ates, judicial precedents, etc. But this begins to look like legal",

  "some objective positivist criteria of law? Finally, therefore, to escape this",
  "positivist conclusion Dworkin is forced to the position that what constrain",
  "judicial interpretations are not historical legal materials in some objective sense",

  "In what sense do these convictions constrain? Dworkin cannot rely, like Fish,",

  "inherent in the law. The law is portrayed as rational, colerent, necessary, and just",
  "by liberal legal scholarship, when in fact, according to the critical legal scholars,",

  "legal scholars' aim is to show that these rights and freedoms, although put for-",
  "ward as essential to an individual's fulfilment, actually serve the political and",
  "economic requirements of liberalism. For instance, the concept of freedom of",
  "contract, though not a civil and political right in the recognised sense, is not a",
  "liberating concept but one that ties individuals to the market-place and serves",
  "the basic aims of capitalism. Contract law, along with all other bodies of law in",

  "Altruism denies the judge the right to apply rules without looking over his shoulder at",

  "justice should be done in each case because there is insufficient certainty",
