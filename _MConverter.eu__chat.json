[9/11/25, 4:53:22 PM] insaf sab k liey: Family disputes---Writ of certiorari---Scope---High Court can issue an order of certiorari to rectify jurisdictional errors committed by subordinate Courts in family law matters---Such errors can arise when Family Courts or First Appellate Courts issue decisions without jurisdiction, in excess of jurisdiction, or fail to exercise their jurisdiction altogether---Certiorari order is applicable when Family Court or First Appellate Court acts in an illegal or improper manner while exercising its jurisdiction---This includes situations where Court makes determinations without providing an affected party opportunity to be heard or where procedural methods employed contravene fundamental principles of natural justice---It is crucial to recognize that High Court's jurisdiction to issue certiorari is fundamentally supervisory, meaning, it does not possess authority to function as an appellate body---Such supervisory role imposes clear limitations: specifically, it prohibits High Court from reevaluating or questioning factual findings made by subordinate Courts based on their assessment of evidence---High Court does not engage in reviewing or re-weighing evidence that underlies decisions made by Family Court or First Appellate Court---Instead, it may only nullify a decision it finds to be beyond jurisdiction or grossly erroneous without imposing its own conclusions in place of those reached by lower Courts---Certiorari orders can be granted solely when a clear error of law is evident on the face of record; however, this does not extend to addressing errors of fact, regardless of their severity.

[9/11/25, 4:53:25 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Recovery of dowery articles---Joinder of parties other than spouses---Petitioners/defendants were brother and wife of ex-husband of respondent/plaintiff---Suit for recovery of dowery articles was decreed by Family Court against petitioners/defendants---Judgment and decree was maintained by Lower Appellate Court and High Court---Validity---Jurisdiction of Family Court is not contingent upon identities of individuals or persons involved; instead, it is fundamentally defined by nature of subject matter presented in suit---Any dispute that pertains to the categories outlined in the schedule of Family Courts Act, 1964 can be brought to Family Court, regardless of who the parties are---Such broad approach is designed to ensure that a diverse array of family-related disputes - ranging from matrimonial issues to child custody arrangements, can be addressed in a specialized forum tailored to handle sensitive familial matters---Legislation does not specify particular individuals or persons who possess exclusive right to initiate or defend actions in Family Court---Petitioners/defendants failed to bring forth any witnesses who could confirm return of dowry articles in their presence---Petitioners/ defendants were obligated to return dowry articles in question and a decree was issued in favour of respondent/plaintiff---Petitioners/ defendants failed to point out any irregularities or errors in proceedings of Family Court or any discernible errors in law that High Court could have the authority to address in its Constitutional jurisdiction---

  
  
Word "party"---Connotation---Word "party"as defined in section 2(d) of Family Courts Act, 1964, includes any person whose presence as such is considered necessary for a proper decision of the dispute---To ensure presence of real defendant, power is also given to Family Court to add such a person as a party to the dispute---As such the definition is liberal and extensive and is not confined only to spouses rather, it gives a right and the prerogative to choose and implead in a suit as defendant, the person against whom relief is sought.
  
  Joinder and non-joinder of necessary and proper party---Object, purpose and scope---If a person deemed necessary to a suit is not joined as a party, this situation is referred to as non-joinder---All persons must be joined as defendants against whom any right to relief is alleged to exist---Necessary party is the person in whose absence no effective order can be passed at all---Proper party is the person in whose absence effective order can be made but whose presence is necessary for a complete and final decision on a question involved in proceedings.

اہم نکات

ڈگری کے خلاف اپیل نہ ہونا
عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ جب کسی ڈگری (Decree) کے خلاف اپیل ہی دائر نہیں کی جاتی تو اپیل ناقابلِ سماعت (Not Tenable) ہو جاتی ہے۔
یہ اصول اس بات کو یقینی بناتا ہے کہ اپیل عدالت میں وہی معاملات آئیں جو درست قانونی طریقۂ کار کے مطابق دائر کیے گئے ہوں۔

Bare Act Wording
Section 96 CPC – Appeal from Original Decree
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
“96. Appeal from original decree.—
(1) Save where otherwise expressly provided in the body of this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie from every decree passed by any Court exercising original jurisdiction to the Court authorized to hear appeals from the decisions of such Court.

(2) An appeal may lie from an original decree passed ex parte.

(3) No appeal shall lie from a decree passed by the Court with the consent of parties.

(4) No appeal shall lie, except on a question of law, from a decree in any suit of the nature cognizable by Courts of Small Causes, when the amount or value of the subject-matter of the original suit does not exceed twenty-five thousand rupees.”

اہم نکتہ
یہ سیکشن واضح کرتا ہے کہ اپیل ہمیشہ "ڈگری" کے خلاف دائر کی جاتی ہے، اور بغیر ڈگری کے اپیل ناقابلِ سماعت ہوگی۔

رول 1

 سی۔پی۔سی کے تقاضے
اپیل کنندہ پر لازم ہے کہ وہ اپیل دائر کرتے وقت ڈگری اور فیصلے دونوں کی نقول ساتھ منسلک کرے

Bare Act Wording
Order XLI Rule 1 CPC

"Every appeal shall be preferred in the form of a memorandum signed by the appellant or his pleader and presented to the Court or to such officer as it appoints in this behalf. The memorandum shall be accompanied by a copy of the decree appealed from and (unless the Appellate Court dispenses therewith) of the judgment on which it is founded."

اس فیصلے میں عدالت نے وضاحت کی کہ چونکہ ڈگری بعد میں تیار ہوئی لیکن اپیل کنندہ نے اسے ریکارڈ پر نہیں لایا، اس لئے اپیل ناقص رہی۔

اپیل میں ترمیم نہ کرنا

ڈگری تیار ہونے کے بعد اپیل کنندگان پر لازم تھا کہ وہ اپنی اپیل میں ترمیم کرتے اور ڈگری کو چیلنج کرتے تاکہ عدالت اس پر غور کر سکتی۔ ایسا نہ کرنے کی وجہ سے اپیل کا دائرہ محدود رہا اور ڈگری کو چیلنج نہ کرنے کے باعث اپیل غیر مؤثر ہو گئی۔

قانونی اثرات

اگر اپیل کنندہ ڈگری منسلک نہیں کرتا تو اپیل ناقابلِ سماعت قرار دی جا سکتی ہے۔

آرڈر XLI
 رول 1 
کا تقاضا
 Mandatory
 نوعیت کا ہے، یعنی اس کی پابندی ضروری ہے۔

عدالت نے یہ اصول مضبوط کیا کہ اپیل میں ڈگری نہ لانا اور بعد ازاں ترمیم نہ کرنا اپیل کنندہ کے خلاف جاتا ہےCPC
نتیجاً مختصراً۔۔۔۔۔۔

سیکشن 96 CPC 
کے مطابق اپیل ہمیشہ ڈگری کے خلاف ہونی چاہئے، ورنہ ناقابلِ سماعت ہے۔

آرڈر XLI رول 1 CPC
 کے مطابق اپیل کے ساتھ ڈگری اور فیصلہ دونوں کی نقول منسلک کرنا لازم ہے۔

اگر ڈگری بعد میں تیار ہو تو اپیل کنندہ پر لازم ہے کہ اسے ریکارڈ پر لائے اور اپیل میں ترمیم کرے۔

ڈگری منسلک نہ کرنے اور اپیل میں ترمیم نہ کرنے سے اپیل نامکمل اور ناقابلِ سماعت قرار پاتی ہے۔

2025 LHC 5519 میں عدالت نے اسی اصول کو واضح کرتے ہوئے اپیل کو خارج کر دیا۔

Specific Relief Act (I of 1877)---
----S. 42---Suit for declaration seeking change in date of birth---Preference given to date of birth recorded in matriculation certificate--- First document on record was respondent's/plaintiff's Grade VI School Leaving Certificate issued on 30-6-2009 containing respondent's date of birth as 05-06-1994 and the second one was the admission form whereby his admission in Grade VI was approved on 24-6-2009, which also contained the respondent's date of birth as 05-06-1994---Additionally, the respondent himself while filling up the examination form of Matric, had again given the same date of birth---In his suit he stated that after he passed the Secondary School Certificate (SSC), he came to know about the fact that incorrect date of birth was mentioned in his educational record and consequently, he filed the suit---However, such claim was negated by the fact that prior to SSC result, he had on 27-11-2013 applied to his academy for correction of his date of birth on the basis of his birth Certificate issued by NADRA on 19-11-2013---High Court had committed gross error of upsetting concurrent findings of the Courts below in directing the Educational Board to change respondent's date of birth merely on the basis of birth certificate issued by NADRA almost 19 years after respondent's birth and that too without supportive form 'B' which could not have been given preference over the date of birth recorded in respondent's matriculation certificate---Coming to the oral evidence, the respondent in support of his case besides official witness who produced the record, examined two witnesses, the first one was just 22 years of age whereas the other was 21 years old---Both witnesses were respondent's cousin and their statements were nothing but hearsay and could not be safely relied upon---High Court remained oblivious of the fact that such evidence, documentary as well as oral could not be made basis of changing the record maintained by the Board---Petition for leave to appeal was converted into appeal and allowed, impugned judgment of High Court was set-aside with the consequence that suit filed by respondent seeking change in his date of birth was dismissed.

 Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908)---
----O. XLI, R. 27---Appellate stage---Application for additional evidence, filing of---Whether such application should be decided first through a separate order or conjointly with the main appeal?---Held: Under the law, particularly concerning application for additional evidence, there is no specific rule that mandates such an application must be decided prior to the final judgment in the main appeal through a separate order---Appropriate course of action, whether to decide the application first or conjointly with the appeal, is entirely dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of each case and the court's assessment of what is necessary to achieve a just and holistic adjudication---Paramount consideration remains the ability of the court to pronounce a satisfactory and complete judgment, which may, in certain circumstances, be best achieved by integrating the consideration of additional evidence with the overall merits of the appeal---Additionally, an important consideration in such matters is the content and potential impact of the intended additional evidence---If the appellate court determines that the evidence sought to be produced is of such a nature that its inclusion on the record could fundamentally alter the decision of the main case, then it might indeed be prudent to decide the application separately through a distinct order---This would allow for proper consideration of its admissibility and relevance before proceeding to the merits of the appeal---However, if the appellate court, after initial assessment, forms the view that the proposed evidence, even if admitted, would likely have no material impact on the outcome of the main case, then there is no compelling need to decide the application for additional evidence separately---In such a scenario, a conjoint decision of the application and the main appeal becomes a matter of judicial economy and efficiency---Such approach significantly contributes to the sound administration of justice by streamlining proceedings, preventing unnecessary delays, and ensuring the expeditious dispensation of justice.

----Ss. 151 & 152---Specific Relief Act (I of 1877), Ss. 8 & 42---Amendment in decree---Scope---Clerical or arithmetic mistake---Determination---Accidental slip or omission---Suit for declaration with recovery of possession instituted by the petitioners/plaintiffs was dismissed, however, their appeal was partially allowed without giving the relief of possession---Petitioners sought amendment in the decree on the ground that while preparing the decree, the relief of possession was omitted by the Appellate Court, thus, the decree was in disagreement with the judgment---Validity---Petitioners in their suit themselves claimed to be owner in possession of the suit property and sought only declaration, thus, the court could not grant them relief of possession---"Accidental slip or omission" as used in S. 152, C.P.C. means to leave out or failure to mention something unintentionally; it is only where the slip or omission as accidental or unintentional could it be supplemented or added in exercise of jurisdiction conferred under S. 152, C.P.C.---Such course is provided to foster cause of justice, to suppress mischief and to avoid multiplicity of proceedings, however, where slip or omission is intentional and deliberate, it could only be remedied or corrected by way of review if permissible or in appeal or revision as the case may be---Trial Court declared the possession of the respondents/defendants valid on the basis of adverse possession, but the Appellate Court did not alter or set aside the findings of the Trial Court---Slip or omission was not accidental or unintentional rather it was intentional and deliberate, thus, if the petitioners had any grievance, then they should have approached the superior courts for redressal of their grievance, but they never challenged the said judgment and decree, which attained finality and could not be altered even with the consent of the parties---Decree was totally in accordance with the judgment, thus, did not call for any rectification under Ss. 151 and 152, C.P.C.---Civil Revision was dismissed, in circumstances.

VII, R. 14, read with O. XVI, Rr. 1 & 2 of the C.P.C.---Had the appellants/plaintiffs applied for expert [advice or evidence] for the inspection of the bus or sought appointment of any expert and the response the respondent/defendant company had opposed such prayer, there would have been some inference in favour of the appellants/ plaintiffs---Although it was proved that appellant/plaintiff No.1 had sustained injuries, she was bedridden for life and her family members might be facing trauma and emotional stress for life, however, it was not proved that those had occurred due to direct negligence by the respondent/defendant company---There was nothing on record which could have established that the bus carrying the appellants/plaintiffs had any mechanical fault, which fault was then instrumental for causing the accident---Appeal being without merit was dismissed, in circumstances.

(b) Damages---

----Doctrine of 'Res ipsa loquitur' 'the thing speaks for itself'---Essential ingredients---Applicability and significance---'Res ipsa loquitur' is Latin for 'the thing speaks for itself'---This doctrine applies, when the things that inflicted the damage was under the sole management and control of the defendant; secondly, the occurrence was such that it would not have happened without negligence; and thirdly, there must be no evidence as to why or how the occurrence took place---In such circumstances the defendants have to persuade the court that the accident did not occur on account of their negligence---In simple words, res ipsa loquitur means an inference of negligence in civil proceedings; it permits an inference of a defendant's negligence from the happening of an event and thereby creates a prima facie case of negligence sufficient for submission to a Court---To warrant submission of the inference for the court's consideration, the plaintiff must establish: (i) the event must be of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone's negligence; (ii) it must be caused by an agency or instrumentality within the exclusive control of the defendant; (iii) it must not have been due to any voluntary action or contribution on the part of the plaintiff---However, it is equally important to register that a defendant may rebut the inference of negligence with evidence that tends to cast doubt on the plaintiff's proof; and more importantly, the doctrine permits an inference of negligence to be drawn solely from the happening of the accident---The rule simply recognizes that some accidents by their very nature would ordinarily not happen without negligence---Res ipsa loquitur does not create a conclusive presumption in favor of the plaintiff but merely permits the inference of negligence to be drawn from the circumstances of the occurrence---Mere happening of an accident or injury will not give rise to an inference or presumption that it was due to negligence on the defendant's part, even in a strict liability context---It is insufficient by itself to establish a prima facie case of negligence , or to prove negligence as a matter of law---Stated another way, proof of an accident does not equate with proof of negligence---In an action based on negligence, the maxim res ipsa loquitur is merely a rule of evidence effecting onus; it does not alter the general rule that the onus to prove negligence rests upon the claimant---The doctrine has been applied to situations where a motor vehicle mounted the footpath , where a vehicle struck a pedestrian who was walking alongside the highway , where it was shown that the brake pipe of the vehicle was beyond repair, and where a vehicle of unsound condition was being driven on a poor road on a dark night.

(d) Damages---

----'General damages' and 'special damages'---Definitions---Distinction---Standards of proof---The "general damages" are implied or presumed to have accrued from the wrong complained of, for the reason that they are its immediate, direct or proximate result or such that thus necessarily result from the injury, or such that they did in fact result from the wrong, directly or proximately---The term "special damages" is defined as those which are actual, but not the necessary result of the injury complained of, and which in fact follow it as a natural and proximate consequence in a particular case i.e. by reason of special circumstances or conditions---Such special damages must be specifically pleaded and proved---In a suit for damages, the wrong done to the plaintiff must be proved to be immediate, direct or proximate result of the act, or acts of negligence.

----S.9---Suit for recovery of damages, filing of---Jurisdiction of Civil Court, invoking of---Ouster of Civil Court's jurisdiction in certain cases discussed--- Question as to what law governs the suit for recovery of damages---Held: Suit for recovery of damages is governed by S. 9 of C.P.C. as it would operate and vest jurisdiction in the Civil Court to adjudicate the suits for recovery of damages and the Civil Court is not robbed of its jurisdiction to try such kinds of suits as the said provision is all encompassing---This is based on well settled position of law that ouster of jurisdiction of Civil Court conferred upon it under S. 9 of C.P.C. cannot be readily inferred and an ouster by special law has to be specific, clear and unambiguous---Exclusion of jurisdiction of Civil Court must be expressed, and ouster clause, ousting general law's jurisdiction, must be construed very strictly.

----Definition---"Tort" is an act or omission that gives rise to an injury either to person or property---A tortious breach is where one party (the tort-feasor) breaches the legally protected rights of another party (the claimant)---Torts tend to fall within four categories---They are: 1) torts of physical integrity; 2) torts of interests in property; 3) torts of use and enjoyment of land and; 4) torts of reputation.

       Pakistan Television Corporation v. Noor Sanat Shah 2023 SCMR 616 rel.

(g) Jurisprudence---

----Justice and morality---Standards and yardstick to be adopted by courts while deciding cases---Scope---Judicial decisions must rest on legal principles, not on compassion or emotions---Justice or morality do not signify any concept of precision as morality may fluctuate from one community to another and from one country to the other---Courts are not required to enforce moral standards but as courts of law are merely concerned with the enforcement of law enacted by the legislature---Courts of law are not mandated to rule on the basis of mere agony, unfortunate pain and helplessness---It is the duty of every court to implement the enforced laws and to decide the disputes in accordance therewith, rather than on the basis of compassion---Any relief granted on the touchstone of subjective standards of leniency and compassions, rather than the law, cannot be sustained.

 Writ Petition-Civil Proceedings-Miscellaneous 15389-19 (FAIZ UR REHMAN ALVI VS
ADJ ETC) by 
Mr. Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabir
Uploaded 9/9/2025

*عرض گزار نے ابھی تک اپنے حق میں مبینہ زبانی معاہدہ کو بطور شہادت پیش نہیں کیا ہے، اور یہ اصول طے شدہ ہے کہ جب کسی معاملے کے ثابت ہونے کے لیے باقاعدہ شہادت درکار ہو تو ابتدائی طور پر مقدمہ (prima facie case) تسلیم نہیں کیا جا سکتا، بالخصوص اس صورت میں جب کوئی تیسرا فریق بھی جائیداد پر ملکیت کا دعویٰ کرے اور اس کے حق میں ریکارڈ میں اندراج (mutation entry) بھی موجود ہو۔ اس لیے عبوری حکم امتناعی کے لیے لازمی پہلا جزو، یعنی prima facie case، اس معاملے میں غیر موجود ہے۔ مزید یہ کہ عرض گزار یہ بھی ظاہر کرنے میں ناکام رہا ہے کہ سہولت کا توازن (balance of convenience) اس کے حق میں ہے یا یہ کہ اگر اس کے حق میں عارضی حکم امتناعی نہ دیا گیا تو اسے ایسا ناقابل تلافی نقصان (irreparable loss) پہنچے گا جس کا بعد میں ازالہ ممکن نہ ہو۔ جہاں تک جائیداد پر اس کے قبضے کے دعوے کا تعلق ہے، محض قبضہ کسی فریق کو عبوری ریلیف کا حقدار نہیں بناتا۔ اس سلسلے میں مقدمہ “محمد علی بنام مہنگا خان” (2004 SCMR 1111) پر انحصار کیا گیا ہے۔ نتیجتاً عرض گزار ابتدائی مقدمہ، ناقابل تلافی نقصان اور سہولت کا توازن اپنے حق میں ثابت کرنے میں ناکام رہا ہے، *اس لیے وہ اس مرحلے پر عبوری حکم امتناعی کا اہل نہیں۔
قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 
(Legal Analytical Review)
1. Specific Relief Act, 1877
Section 12 (Specific Performance of Contract)

*"Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, the specific performance of any contract may, in the discretion of the Court, be enforced when the act agreed to be done is in the performance wholly or partly of a contract which is capable of being specifically enforced."*

 جائزہ
جب تک معاہدہ ثابت نہ ہو، specific performance یا اس سے متعلقہ عبوری ریلیف ممکن نہیں۔ زبانی معاہدہ محض دعوے کی سطح پر ہے، ثبوت درکار ہے۔

Section 54 (Perpetual Injunctions)

"A perpetual injunction may be granted to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in favour of the applicant."

 جائزہ
یہ دفعہ تب لاگو ہوتی ہے جب کوئی قانونی حق prima facie ثابت ہو۔ اگر mutation entry تیسرے فریق کے نام پر ہے، تو مدعی کا حق ابتدائی سطح پر ثابت نہیں ہوتا۔

2. Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (CPC)
Order XXXIX Rule 1

"Where in any suit it is proved by affidavit or otherwise that any property in dispute is in danger of being wasted, damaged, or alienated by any party to the suit, the Court may by order grant a temporary injunction."

Order XXXIX Rule 2

"In any suit for restraining the defendant from committing a breach of contract... the Court may grant a temporary injunction."

 جائزہ
Temporary injunction کے لیے تین شرائط ہیں:

Prima facie case

Irreparable loss

Balance of convenience

یہ تینوں یہاں absent ہیں

Prima facie case → زبانی معاہدہ غیر ثابت + mutation entry تیسرے فریق کے نام۔

Irreparable loss → اگر بعد میں ثابت بھی ہو جائے تو ہرجانہ یا specific performance مل سکتی ہے، ناقابل تلافی نقصان نہیں۔

Balance of convenience → چونکہ mutation entry تیسرے فریق کے حق میں ہے، اس لیے سہولت کا توازن مدعی کے خلاف ہے۔

3. Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984
Article 17 (Competence of witnesses)

"The competence of a person to testify... is not dependent on number, but on being able to understand and give rational account of the matter."
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
 زبانی معاہدہ تبھی ثابت ہو سکتا ہے جب معتبر گواہ پیش ہوں۔

Article 79 (Proof of contract required to be in writing)

"If a law requires a contract to be in writing, it must be proved by the document itself."

 جائیداد کی منتقلی کے لیے تحریری معاہدہ ضروری ہے۔ زبانی دعویٰ mutation entry کو rebut نہیں کر سکتا۔

4. Case Law Support
Muhammad Ali v. Mehnga Khan (2004 SCMR 1111): صرف قبضہ عبوری حکم کے لیے کافی نہیں۔

PLD 2002 SC 615: عبوری حکم کے لیے تین بنیادی عناصر (prima facie case, balance of convenience, irreparable loss) ضروری ہیں۔

2016 SCMR 2061: زبانی معاہدے کی بنیاد پر injunction نہیں دیا جا سکتا جب تک شہادت مکمل نہ ہو۔
جامع قانونی نتیجہ 
(Conclusion)
جب 
mutation entry
 کسی تیسرے فریق کے نام درج ہو، تو مدعی کا زبانی معاہدے پر مبنی دعویٰ prima facie case
 قائم نہیں کرتا۔ CPC (Order XXXIX) 
کے مطابق تینوں لازمی اجزاء
 (prima facie case, irreparable loss, balance of convenience)
 غیر موجود ہیں۔ Specific Relief Act بھی صرف ایسے معاہدے کو enforce کرتا ہے جو ثابت شدہ ہو، جبکہ قانون شہادت کے مطابق زمین کے معاملے میں تحریری دستاویز ضروری ہے۔ اس لیے عدالت کا عبوری حکم امتناعی سے انکار درست اور قانون کے مطابق ہے۔

Summary ...
Specific Relief Act کے تحت specific performance یا injunction اسی وقت ملتا ہے جب معاہدہ ثابت اور enforceable ہو۔

CPC (Order XXXIX) کے مطابق عبوری injunction کے تین لازمی اجزاء ہیں، جو petitioner یہاں establish کرنے میں ناکام رہا۔

Qanun-e-Shahadat کے تحت زبانی معاہدہ گواہوں سے ثابت ہونا ضروری ہے، محض دعویٰ کافی نہیں۔

اس لیے عدالت نے درست طور پر قرار دیا کہ جب تک evidence ریکارڈ نہ ہو، عبوری injunction نہیں دیا جا سکتا۔

LHC 5254 PLJ 2022 Cr.C 979 
لاہور
, 2023 P Cr. L J 56

اپیل کنندہ کو سیشن جج حافظ آباد نے جھوٹی شکایت درج کروانے پر دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان کے تحت سزا سنائی تھی۔
تاہم، دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان کا ذکر ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 195(1)(a) میں موجود ہے اور اس دفعہ کے تحت کسی جرم کے ارتکاب کی صورت میں صرف متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم ہی شکایت درج کرا سکتا ہے۔

موجودہ کیس میں دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان کے تحت مقدمہ چلانے کے لیے کسی سرکاری ملازم نے شکایت دائر نہیں کی تھی۔
مزید یہ کہ دفعہ 476 ضابطہ فوجداری 1898 صرف ان جرائم پر لاگو ہوتی ہے جو دفعہ 195(1)(b) اور (c) میں درج ہیں، نہ کہ ان پر جو دفعہ 195(1)(a) میں مذکور ہیں۔
اگر کوئی جرم دفعہ 195(1)(b) یا (c) کے دائرہ میں نہیں آتا تو عدالت کو دفعہ 476 کے تحت شکایت دائر کرنے کا اختیار حاصل نہیں ہے۔

دفعہ 195(1)(a) ضابطہ فوجداری کے مطابق عدالت کسی ایسے جرم کا نوٹس نہیں لے سکتی جو تعزیراتِ پاکستان کی دفعات 172 سے 188 کے تحت قابلِ سزا ہو، سوائے اس کے کہ متعلقہ سرکاری افسر یا اس کا ماتحت تحریری شکایت کرے۔

موجودہ کیس میں یہ صورتحال نہیں تھی کہ جھوٹا بیان دینے پر کوئی باقاعدہ شکایت دائر کی گئی ہو۔
البتہ، اس کیس میں ڈسٹرکٹ اینڈ سیشن جج قانون کے مطابق متعلقہ مجسٹریٹ کے روبرو دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان کے تحت شکایت دائر کر سکتے تھے اور مجاز عدالت کو اس جرم کا نوٹس لینے سے نہیں روکا گیا تھا۔

لہٰذا، اپیل منظور کر لی گئی
**M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
کیس کا پس منظر 
(Background of the Case)
اس کیس میں اپیل کنندہ کے خلاف الزام تھا کہ اس نے جھوٹی شکایت دائر کی تھی، جس پر سیشن جج حافظ آباد نے اسے دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان کے تحت سزا دی۔
دفعہ 182 PPC کے مطابق اگر کوئی شخص جان بوجھ کر کسی سرکاری ملازم کو جھوٹی اطلاع دے تاکہ کسی بے گناہ کو نقصان پہنچے یا اس کے خلاف کارروائی ہو تو یہ جرم ہے۔

لیکن سوال یہ پیدا ہوا کہ آیا عدالت خود اس جرم کا نوٹس لے سکتی ہے یا اس کے لیے متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم کی شکایت ضروری ہے؟
اسی قانونی نکتے پر لاہور ہائی کورٹ نے تفصیل سے فیصلہ دیا۔
قانونی تجزیہ 
(Legal Analysis with Bare Act Wording)
1- دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان 
(False Information)
"Whoever gives to any public servant any information which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause such public servant—
(a) to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, or
(b) to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person,
shall be punished…"

جو کوئی کسی سرکاری ملازم کو جان بوجھ کر غلط اطلاع دے، اس نیت سے کہ وہ ملازم کسی ایسے کام کو کر ڈالے یا چھوڑ دے جو اسے نہیں کرنا چاہئے، یا کسی شخص کو نقصان پہنچانے کے لیے اپنے اختیارات استعمال کرے، وہ سزا کا مستحق ہوگا۔

2- دفعہ 195(1)(a) ضابطہ فوجداری 
(Cognizance of Offences)
"No Court shall take cognizance—
(a) of any offence punishable under Sections 172 to 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code… except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned or of some other public servant to whom he is subordinate."
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
کوئی عدالت ان جرائم کا نوٹس نہیں لے سکتی جو تعزیراتِ پاکستان کی دفعات 172 تا 188 کے تحت قابل سزا ہوں، سوائے اس صورت میں جب متعلقہ سرکاری افسر یا اس کا ماتحت تحریری شکایت کرے۔

3- دفعہ 476 ضابطہ فوجداری
یہ دفعہ اس وقت لاگو ہوتی ہے جب عدالت کو معلوم ہو کہ عدالت کے سامنے مقدمے کی کارروائی کے دوران کسی شخص نے جھوٹا ثبوت دیا یا عدالت کی توہین کی وغیرہ (جرائم جو دفعہ 
195(1)(b) 
اور
 (c) میں درج ہیں)
۔

اہم نکتہ
یہ دفعہ صرف 195(1)(b) اور (c) کے جرائم پر لاگو ہے، 195(1)(a) کے جرائم پر نہیں۔

ہائی کورٹ کا فیصلہ
سیشن جج نے اپیل کنندہ کو دفعہ 182 PPC کے تحت سزا سنائی تھی، لیکن کوئی تحریری شکایت کسی سرکاری ملازم نے درج نہیں کرائی تھی۔

اس لیے یہ سزا قانونی طور پر درست نہیں تھی کیونکہ عدالت خود دفعہ 195(1)(a) کے تحت کارروائی شروع نہیں کر سکتی۔

البتہ، ڈسٹرکٹ اینڈ سیشن جج قانون کے مطابق مجاز مجسٹریٹ کے سامنے شکایت دائر کر سکتے تھے، لیکن ایسا نہیں کیا گیا۔

نتیجتاً لاہور ہائی کورٹ نے سزا کو کالعدم قرار دیا اور اپیل منظور کر لی۔

(Legal Position)
دفعہ 182 PPC کے تحت جھوٹی اطلاع دینا جرم ہے۔

لیکن اس جرم کا نوٹس عدالت ازخود نہیں لے سکتی۔

صرف متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم یا اس کا ماتحت تحریری شکایت دے تو مقدمہ بنے گا۔

عدالت کا دفعہ
 476 Cr.P.C
 کے تحت شکایت دینا غیر قانونی ہے کیونکہ یہ صرف 195(1)
(b) 
اور
 (c) 
کے جرائم تک محدود ہے

سزا ختم کر دی گئی اور اپیل کنندہ کو ریلیف ملا۔

یہ فیصلہ آپ کے مقدمات میں اس وقت بطور دلیل استعمال ہو سکتا ہے جب جھوٹی شکایت یا جھوٹی اطلاع پر کارروائی سرکاری ملازم کی شکایت کے بغیر شروع کی گئی ہو۔

⚖️ اہم عدالتی اصول

1. اصل دستاویز ضائع ہونا "اپنی لاپرواہی" سے ہو تو ثانوی شہادت نہیں ملے گی۔
➝ ICI Pakistan Ltd. v. Al-Abid Silk Mills (2025 CLC 1224)

2. اگر مخالف فریق عدالت میں یا کسی سابق مقدمے میں خود اقرار کر لے، تو پھر گواہوں کی ضرورت نہیں۔
➝ Muhammad Islam v. Bagh Ali (2025 CLC 1291)

3. عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ ثانوی شہادت "استثنائی اصول" ہے، عام قاعدہ نہیں۔
➝ Akhtar Sultana v. Muzaffar Khan Malik (PLD 2021 SC 715, para 11)

---

📌 خلاصہ:

ثانوی شہادت صرف انہی حالات میں قبول ہوگی جہاں قانون اجازت دیتا ہے اور فریق نے بغیر کوتاہی کے اصل دستاویز کھوئی ہو۔

اگر فریق نے اپنی غفلت یا mismanagement کی وجہ سے دستاویز گم کی، تو عدالت ثانوی شہادت نہیں دے گی۔

اگر مخالف نے اقرار کر لیا ہو، تو پھر دوسرے گواہ کی ضرورت نہیں (Art. 81 exception to Art. 79)۔

So the basic contract is the solemnization of a valid Nikah. But if a valid Nikah is not solemnized then the question of Dower became invalid and such Deed which is dependant on a future event you cannot claim any right on the basis of such deed. In other words such deed is a void deed in absence of a valid Nikah.

جہاں کم عمر ملزم کی عمر تقریباً 11 سال ہو اور اس پر سنگین جرم کا الزام ہو،تو وہ ضمانت کو بطورِ حق طلب نہیں کر سکتا، جیسا کہ الفاظ "he may not be released on bail" سے ظاہر ہوتا ہے۔
سپریم کورٹ 

1. سیکشن 6(3) جے جے ایس اے 2018:

صرف minor اور major جرائم کو قابلِ ضمانت قرار دیتا ہے۔ سنگین جرم heinous offence  کا اس میں ذکر نہیں۔
لہٰذا سولہ سال سے کم عمر بچے کا سنگین جرم اس شق میں براہِ راست نہیں آتا۔

2. سیکشن 6(4):

صرف اس کم عمر (juvenile) پر لاگو ہے جو سولہ سال سے زیادہ عمر کا ہو اور سنگین جرم کا ملزم ہو۔ ایسی صورت میں ضمانت حق کے طور پر نہیں بلکہ عدالت کے اختیار (discretion) پر ہے۔

3. کم عمر (16 سال سے کم) اور سنگین جرم:

اگر ملزم کی عمر 16 سال سے کم ہے اور الزام heinous ہے تو معاملہ 6(3) یا 6(4) میں واضح طور پر نہیں آتا۔
م عدالت کو میرٹ پر فیصلہ کرنا ہو گا کہ ضمانت دی جائے یا نہیں۔

4. چھ ماہ قید کی شرط (سیکشن 6(5)):

اگر جیوینائل 6 ماہ سے زیادہ زیرِ حراست رہے اور تاخیر اس کے اپنے سبب نہ ہو تو ضمانت لازمی ہو گی۔

5. قانون کی تشریح کے اصول:

قانون ساز کے الفاظ کو غیر ضروری یا بے معنی نہیں سمجھا جا سکتا۔ عدالتیں ایسے نتائج سے بچتی ہیں جو غیر منطقی، غیر معقول یا ناقابلِ عمل ہوں۔

6. مقصدِ قانون:

  سنگین heinous جرم میں ضمانت کیس کے حقائق، بچے کی عمر، حالات اور عوامی تحفظ کو دیکھ کر دی جائے گی۔

(Sindh Legal Help Group)

---S. 498-A---Pre-arrest bail petition---Accused not present before the Court at the time of hearing of his pre-arrest bail petition---Effect---In case the petitioner-accused was not personally present in Court, the Court was not authorized to grant him (pre-arrest) bail and the petition was to be dismissed for his lack of presence in Court---However, in case some explanation was furnished for his non-appearance, the Court may, if it found that explanation to be satisfactory, exempt his presence for that day and adjourn the hearing of the petition for a short period---Court could not, in the absence of the personal appearance of the petitioner, travel further into the case and examine the merits of the case---Abdul Rehman v. State 1981 PCr.LJ 61; Salima Bibi v. State 2000 PCr.LJ 138; Abdul Rashid v. State 2006 YLR 2058 and Tariq Hanif v. State 2021 PCr.LJ 250 not approved.

       After the insertion of section 498-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 ("Cr.P.C.") if the accused, seeking pre-arrest bail, was not present before the Court, the Court was not authorized to grant bail to such an accused and therefore, the (bail) petition was liable to be dismissed in the light of the said statutory provision.

       Section 498-A, Cr.P.C. created a statutory fetter or a statutory precondition requiring the presence of the petitioner (accused) in person in Court for the exercise of jurisdiction by the court for granting pre-arrest bail. In case the petitioner was not personally present in Court, the Court was not authorized to grant him bail and the petition was to be dismissed for his lack of presence in Court. However, in case some explanation was furnished for his non-appearance, the Court may, if it found that explanation to be satisfactory, exempt his presence for that day and adjourn the hearing of the petition for a short period. The Court could not, in the absence of the personal appearance of the petitioner, travel further into the case and examine the merits of the case. In fact the examination of the merits of the case in the absence of the accused totally defeated the intent and purpose of the section 498-A, Cr.P.C. This was because once the Court proceeded to examine the merits of the case, then the Court had the option to either dismiss or allow the bail petition, while under section 498-A, Cr.P.C. the Court was not authorized to admit the accused to bail in his absence.

       Abdul Rehman v. State 1981 PCr.LJ 61; Salima Bibi v. State 2000 PCr.LJ 138; Abdul Rashid v. State 2006 YLR 2058 and Tariq Hanif v. State 2021 PCr.LJ 250 not approved.

       Umra Khan v. State PLD 1980 Pesh. 145; Shabbir Ahmad v. State PLD 1981 Lah. 599 (FB); Kalan Khan v. State 1982 PCr.LJ 149 and Zeeshan Kazmi v. State 1997 MLD 273 approved.

       In case the petition was dismissed for non-appearance of the accused in a pre-arrest bail matter under section 498-A, Cr.P.C., the petitioner could file a fresh bail petition before the same Court provided that he furnished sufficient explanation for his non-appearance in the earlier bail petition and the Court was satisfied with his said explanation. But if he failed to furnish any satisfactory explanation, his second bail petition was liable to be dismissed on account of his conduct of misusing the process of Court disentitling him to the grant of discretionary relief of pre-arrest bail.

       Mukhtar Ahmad v. State 2016 SCMR 2064 ref.

       Ad interim bail granted in a pre-arrest application on the first hearing was to simply ensure that the petitioner was present on all the subsequent dates of hearing in the pre-arrest bail matter. Petitioner’s presence was, therefore, required throughout the proceedings of the pre-arrest bail petition and the fact that he appeared on the first date when ad interim bail was granted did not in any manner lessen the rigours of section 498-A, Cr.P.C. or absolve the responsibility of the accused from appearing in person before the court.

[9/16/25, 11:03:56 PM] ~ Muhammad Jamil Khan AHC ☺️: 👌 Pre-arrest bail 👌
1. No bail to be granted to a person not in custody, in Court or against whom no case was registered, etc

2. Once pre-arrest bail application was admitted, then same must be decided on merits in all eventualities.

3. Policy of law was that bail should be decided within shortest possible time and frequent dismissals of bail application for non-prosecution was abuse of process of law and a dilatory tactic which could not be permitted.

4. Pre-arrest bail was not to be used as substitute or alternative for post-arrest bail and accused person must surrender before court and physically appear not only at time of first hearing but also on all subsequent hearings till bail application had been decided unless accused person's attendance was dispensed with.

Dismissal of application for bail for non-prosecution --Absence of accused from Court premises.

Policy of law on adjudication of bail applications.

Scope--Accused/applicant impugned order of court below whereby his application for pre-arrest bail was dismissed on ground of non-prosecution due to his absence from court despite fact that accused subsequently filed miscellaneous application explaining that he had been picked up by police on day of such hearing---Validity.

bail before arrest was an extraordinary relief which was granted in special circumstances to protect innocent persons from victimization though abuse of law for ulterior motives.

Pre-arrest bail was not to be used as substitute or alternative for post-arrest bail and accused person must surrender before court and physically appear not only at time of first hearing but also on all subsequent hearings till bail application had been decided unless accused person's attendance was dispensed with.

Where accused was absent for a genuine cause, then court must show indulgence.

Policy of law was that bail should be decided within shortest possible time and frequent dismissals of bail application for non-prosecution was abuse of process of law and a dilatory tactic which could not be permitted.

Once pre-arrest bail application was admitted, then same must be decided on merits in all eventualities.

Impugned order could not be sustained as court below dismissed pre-arrest bail application of accused for non-prosecution instead of deciding same on merits; and did not wait for reply of State on accused's application alleging pickup by police.

Impugned order was set aside and matter was remanded to court below to decide accused's application for pre-arrest bail on merits and in accordance with law.

Revision was allowed, accordingly.

 (پشاور کے عوام کے لیے خصوصی پیغام کے ساتھ)

بسم اللہ الرحمن الرحیم
السلام علیکم ورحمة الله وبرکاته

اہم اطلاع ۔ 
افواہوں سے بچیں
 اور حق کو پہچانیں۔

کچھ دنوں سے ایک پیغام پھیل رہا ہے
 کہ کل سے ملک بھر میں بازاروں 
اور چیک پوسٹوں پر شناختی کارڈ یا سٹوڈنٹ کارڈ نہ رکھنے پر فوراً کارروائی ہوگی۔

یہ پیغام کسی بھی سرکاری ادارے کی طرف سے جاری نہیں ہوا۔
 براہِ کرم ایسے جھوٹے اور غیر مصدقہ پیغامات آگے نہ بڑھائیں۔

⚠️ یاد رکھیں:

پشاور کے لوگ پہلے ہی
 “سیلاب کی جنگ” 
سے گزر چکے ہیں،
 ان کا کاروبار اور روزگار تباہ و برباد ہوا۔

پھر افغان مہاجرین کے بوجھ اور مسائل کی وجہ سے بھی پشاور کے شہریوں کی زندگی مشکل ہوئی، 
کاروبار بیٹھ گئے۔

پشاور میں 98 فیصد لوگ نیک، شریف اور امن پسند ہیں، 
جبکہ برے لوگ صرف 2 فیصد ہیں۔ براہِ کرم ان 98 فیصد کو نہ ستائیں، 
نہ ان کا حوصلہ توڑیں۔

پولیس اور آرمی ہمارے لیے قابلِ احترام ہیں۔
 یہ ہماری حفاظت اور امن کے ضامن ہیں۔ لیکن براہِ کرم پشاور کے عام اور غریب عوام کو غیر ضروری تنگ نہ کیا جائے۔
💔 حقیقت یہ ہے
 کہ امیر طبقے کے لوگوں کو کوئی نہیں پوچھتا، 
نہ ان کے شناختی کارڈ چیک ہوتے ہیں، 
نہ کاغذات، نہ لائسنس۔ 
ان کے پاس سہولتیں اور طاقت ہوتی ہیں۔
لیکن ہر بار نشانہ بنتا ہے
 صرف غریب پشاور کا شہری،
 کہ اس کا شناختی کارڈ نہیں
، یہ کاغذ نہیں،
 وہ لائسنس نہیں۔

🕊️ اللہ تعالیٰ فرماتے ہیں:
“وَلَا تَبْخَسُوا النَّاسَ أَشْيَاءَهُمْ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا فِي الْأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ”
(لوگوں کا حق نہ مارو
 اور زمین میں فساد نہ پھیلاؤ۔)

آئیے! انتشار نہ پھیلائیں،
 خوف نہ پھیلائیں،
 بلکہ انصاف، امن اور محبت کو عام کریں۔

خیراندیش،
غریب کی آواز

Cross-examination.
---Voluntary statement---Scope---Voluntary statement by a witness in cross-examination has no legal evidentiary value---Witness is not permitted to foist into his answer, any statement/material which is not in answer to or explanatory of his answer to the questions put to him---Such voluntary evidence is denominated as "irresponsive" testimony and introduction of such evidence is against the rule of re-examination as contemplated under Art.133 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984.

Voluntary statement by a witness in cross‑examination has no legal evidentiary value‑‑‑Witness is not permitted to foist into his answer statement any material which is not in answer to or explanatory of his answer to the questions put to him‑‑‑Such voluntary evidence is denominated as "irresponsive" testimony and the introduction of such evidence shall be against the rule of re­-examination as contemplated under Art.133 of Qanun‑e‑Shahadat, 1984‑‑‑Principles.

 According to Article 133 of the Qanun‑e‑Shahadat Order, 1984, the order of examination of witnesses has been set down. The witnesses shall be first examined‑in‑chief and then if the adverse party so desires shall be cross‑examined. The re‑examination, however, is limited to the explanation of matters referred to in‑cross‑examination and if permission in this respect is granted by the Court. It would thus, be seen that the voluntary statement by a witness in cross-­examination has no legal evidentiary value. It is not permissible for a witness to foist into his answer statement any material which is not in answer to or explanatory of his answer to the questions put to him. In jurisprudence, such voluntary evidence is denominated as "irresponsive" testimony and the introduction of such evidence shall be against the rule of re‑examination as contemplated under Article 133 of the Qanun‑e‑Shahadat Order, 1984.

 (1) When does a Muslim woman become entitled to maintenance within a marriage?  

Answer to Question No.1   
-----------------
A holistic reading of the contemporary Islamic principles, constitutional and statutory protections, and judicial precedents affirms that the right to maintenance flows unconditionally from the solemnization of a valid marriage and constitutes a binding legal duty.  

Rukhsati, in our social fabric, is a customary practice marking the bride’s departure from her parental home to join her husband. The term rukhsati literally means “to depart” or “to take leave,” and while culturally significant, it holds no independent legal status under Islamic or statutory law. While the solemnization of marriage marks the formal commencement of the marital relationship, it also carries immediate legal consequences under Islamic law, our jurisprudence and the statutory framework of Pakistan. A valid marriage is not a mere ritual or symbolic act; it is the point from which the spouses assume legal status and corresponding rights and obligations. The expression of acceptance at the time of marriage is the ultimate evidence of a woman’s willingness to enter into the marital relationship and to discharge her matrimonial obligations. A wife’s right to maintenance becomes absolute when she demonstrates such willingness, which is reinforced from her waiting for rukhsati to be effected. To condition a wife’s entitlement to maintenance on rukhsati or consummation undermines legal certainty and enables husbands to evade their financial responsibilities by invoking social customs or delaying performance. Such an approach imposes an unconstitutional burden on women and reinforces patriarchal norms that make a woman’s financial rights contingent upon her physical availability or subservience. This is incompatible with the dignity and equality promised under the Constitution.

(2) Under what circumstances, if any, may a husband be excused from his marital obligation to pay maintenance to his wife? 

(3) Judges, particularly in family law matters, are not merely arbiters of individual disputes; they are reformers and thought leaders capable of guiding society toward progressive and inclusive thinking. They bear a constitutional and ethical duty to adopt gender-sensitive, rights-based language that affirms the equal legal status of women as full and autonomous persons. 

(4) The institution of amicus is essential - to ensuring that adjudication remains informed, inclusive, and principled. The amicus curiae serve as a vital bridge between law and justice, local realities and global perspectives, the bench and the academy. Embracing this inclusive model of judicial deliberation enhances not only the legitimacy and quality of judgments, but also affirms the judiciary’s commitment to learning, openness, and constitutional dialogue.

فیصلہ ۔۔۔
تین طلاقوں کا تصور — یعنی بیک وقت تین طلاقیں دینا — نہ قرآنِ پاک میں جڑیں رکھتا ہے اور نہ ہی صحیح احادیث میں اس کی بنیاد موجود ہے۔ یہی وجہ ہے کہ مختلف فقہی مکاتبِ فکر میں اس پر شدید اختلاف پایا جاتا ہے۔ فقہ جعفریہ اور مالکی فقہ اس طریقے کو درست تسلیم نہیں کرتیں، جب کہ شافعی مکتبِ فکر بھی اس سے متفق ہے۔ البتہ فقہ حنبلی کے نزدیک اگر نکاح مکمل ہو چکا ہو اور مخصوص انداز میں طلاق دی جائے تو تین طلاقیں ایک طلاق شمار کی جاتی ہیں۔

ان اختلافات اور فوری و یک طرفہ طلاق کے سماجی اثرات نے قانون ساز اداروں کو اس مسئلے میں مداخلت پر مجبور کیا، جس کا نتیجہ "مسلم فیملی لاز آرڈیننس 1961" کے سیکشن 7 کی ذیلی شق (3) کی صورت میں سامنے آیا۔ اس شق کے مطابق جب تک طلاق کا نوٹس یونین کونسل کے چیئرمین کو نہ دیا جائے اور نوے دن کی مدت نہ گزر جائے، طلاق نافذ نہیں ہوتی۔ اس مدت میں میاں بیوی کا ازدواجی رشتہ برقرار رہتا ہے تاکہ صلح و رجوع کا موقع مل سکے۔

قانون کی اس حکمت عملی کا مقصد جلد بازی میں دی جانے والی طلاقوں کی حوصلہ شکنی کرنا ہے اور یہ اسلام کے اصولوں سے ہم آہنگ ہے۔ قرآن مجید سورہ البقرہ میں واضح طور پر طلاق سے پہلے عدت و غور و فکر کی مدت مقرر کرتا ہے تاکہ نکاح جیسے مقدس بندھن کو فوری طور پر ختم نہ کیا جائے۔

اسلام نے اگرچہ ناگزیر حالات میں نکاح کو ختم کرنے کی اجازت دی ہے، لیکن یہ عمل ناپسندیدہ اور ناپسندیدہ ترین چیزوں میں شمار ہوتا ہے۔ طلاق کے نفاذ کے لیے قرآن نے ایک باقاعدہ طریقہ کار تجویز کیا ہے، جس میں عدت کی پابندی لازم ہے — خواہ طلاق ہو یا شوہر کا انتقال۔ عدت کا دورانیہ محض رسمی نہیں بلکہ اس کا مقصد رجوع، غور و فکر اور جذباتی فیصلوں پر نظرِ ثانی کا موقع فراہم کرنا ہے۔ مگر طلاقِ بدعت کو فوری نافذ العمل تسلیم کرنا ان مقاصد کو زائل کر دیتا ہے اور قرآن کی تعلیمات سے ٹکراتا ہے، جو نکاح اور اس کے خاتمے کو سنجیدگی سے لینے کا حکم دیتا ہے۔

محمد آصف خان کھوسہ ایڈووکیٹ ہائی کورٹ ملتان کنسلٹنٹ فیملی لاءز اینڈ چائلڈ کسٹڈی میٹر03321600744
محمڈن لاء اور عائلی قوانین کا اسلامی و قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ سپریم کورٹ کے حالیہ فیصلہ کی روشنی میں 
1. تعارف
محمڈن لاء (Mohammadan Law) برصغیر میں مسلمانوں کے لیے عائلی معاملات (نکاح، طلاق، وراثت، نان نفقہ، عدت، ولایت) کو منظم کرنے والا فقہی و روایتی نظام ہے، جو قرآن و سنت، اجماع، قیاس اور مختلف فقہی مکاتبِ فکر پر مبنی ہے۔ پاکستان میں یہ قوانین "مسلم فیملی لاز آرڈیننس 1961" اور دیگر ذیلی قوانین کے تحت عملی جامہ پہنتے ہیں۔

2. نکاح اور اس کی شرعی حیثیت
نکاح اسلامی معاشرت کی بنیاد ہے، جو قرآن میں "میثاقِ غلیظ" (پکا عہد) قرار دیا گیا ہے (النساء:21)۔

فقہی اعتبار سے نکاح ایک عقدِ لازم (binding contract) ہے، جو ایجاب و قبول، گواہوں اور مہر پر مشتمل ہوتا ہے۔

پاکستان میں نکاح کا اندراج مسلم فیملی لاز آرڈیننس 1961 کے تحت لازمی قرار دیا گیا ہے (سیکشن 5)۔

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
3. طلاق اور اس کا طریقہ کار
اسلام میں طلاق ایک ناپسندیدہ لیکن جائز عمل ہے۔

قرآن میں طلاق کے لیے تین مراحل (طلاقِ رجعی، عدت، طلاقِ بائن) بیان کیے گئے ہیں (البقرہ: 229-231)۔

فقہی طور پر طلاق کو متعدد اقسام میں تقسیم کیا گیا ہے: رجعی، بائن، مغلظہ، اور طلاقِ بدعت۔

طلاقِ بدعت (یعنی بیک وقت تین طلاقیں دینا) کو بیشتر مکاتبِ فکر (مالکی، شافعی، جعفری) نے غیر شرعی اور خلافِ قرآن قرار دیا ہے۔

پاکستان میں سیکشن 7 (1) مسلم فیملی لاز آرڈیننس 1961 کے تحت طلاق کا نوٹس چیئرمین یونین کونسل کو دینا اور 90 دن کی عدت کا انتظار لازم ہے۔ اس دوران صلح کی کوشش کی جاتی ہے۔

4. عدت (Iddah) اور اس کی اہمیت
عدت قرآن کی واضح ہدایت ہے (البقرہ: 234، 228)۔

طلاق یا شوہر کی وفات کی صورت میں عورت کو عدت گزارنا لازم ہے۔

طلاق کی صورت میں تین حیض یا تین ماہ (اگر حیض نہ آتا ہو) اور وفات کی صورت میں چار ماہ دس دن۔

عدت میں وراثت کے حقوق بھی محفوظ رہتے ہیں، جیسا کہ عدالت عظمیٰ نے حالیہ فیصلے (CPLA 181/2023) میں قرار دیا کہ اگر شوہر کی وفات عدت کے دوران ہو جائے تو عورت وراثت کی حق دار ہو گی۔

5. وراثت (Inheritance)
اسلامی قانونِ وراثت نہایت مفصل اور عادلانہ ہے (النساء: 11، 12)۔

عورت کو بیٹی، بیوی، ماں، بہن کی حیثیت سے حصہ دیا گیا ہے۔

فقہ کے مطابق عدت میں موجود بیوی کو شوہر کی وفات پر وراثت ملتی ہے، چاہے طلاق دی گئی ہو، بشرطیکہ عدت باقی ہو۔

6. قانون اور فقہ کا باہمی تعلق
پاکستان کا عائلی قانون فقہ حنفی کو بنیادی حوالہ مانتا ہے، مگر آئینی طور پر "اسلامی اصولوں سے ہم آہنگ قانون سازی" کا تقاضا کرتا ہے (آرٹیکل 227، آئین پاکستان)۔

عدالتیں فقہ، قرآن، سنت، اور قانون کا مشترکہ جائزہ لیتی ہیں۔

تین طلاقوں کے خلاف قانون سازی اسلامی اصولوں سے متصادم نہیں بلکہ عین موافق ہے، جیسا کہ عدالتی فیصلوں میں قرار دیا گیا ہے۔

7. حالیہ عدالتی نظائر
مسرت کیس (CPLA 181/2023): تین طلاقوں کے باوجود عورت کا عدت میں ہونے کی وجہ سے شوہر کی وراثت میں حصہ دار ہونا تسلیم کیا گیا۔

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ طلاقِ بدعت فوری نافذ العمل نہیں، بلکہ نوے دن کا انتظار اور مصالحتی عمل لازم ہے۔

نتیجتاً مختصراً ۔۔۔۔۔
اسلامی عائلی قوانین قرآن و سنت پر مبنی ہیں اور ان میں انسانی ہمدردی، عدل اور معاشرتی استحکام کا بھرپور لحاظ رکھا گیا ہے۔ پاکستان کے مسلم فیملی لاز بھی انہی اصولوں کو قانونی شکل دیتے ہیں، جس میں طلاق، نکاح، عدت، وراثت جیسے حساس معاملات کو فقہی اور قرآنی روشنی میں حل کیا جاتا ہے۔ تاہم، جدید حالات میں قانونی تحفظات، مصالحتی کوششیں، اور عدالتی نگرانی اسلامی اصولوں کے ساتھ مطابقت رکھتے ہوئے ایک مؤثر نظام فراہم کرتی ہیں۔

---

🔹 مقدمہ کے حقائق (Case Background)

مدعیہ کی بہن (مرحومہ) کی موت بظاہر قدرتی موت ظاہر کی گئی۔

تاہم اس کے بھائی (مدعی/ریسپانڈنٹ) نے الزام لگایا کہ اس کی بہن کو زہر دے کر ہلاک کیا گیا۔

اس مقصد کے لیے مدعی نے عدالت میں درخواست دائر کی کہ مرحومہ کی قبر کشائی (Exhumation) کر کے پوسٹ مارٹم کیا جائے تاکہ موت کی اصل وجہ سامنے آ سکے۔

جوڈیشل مجسٹریٹ نے قبر کشائی کا حکم جاری کیا۔

اس حکم کو ریویژنل کورٹ نے بھی برقرار رکھا۔

ملزم (محمد زریں) نے اس حکم کو لاہور ہائی کورٹ میں چیلنج کیا اور اسے کالعدم قرار دینے کی استدعا کی۔

---

🔹 فریقین کے مؤقف (Parties’ Versions)

درخواست گزار/ملزم (Petitioner – محمد زریں):

یہ مؤقف اختیار کیا کہ:

مرحومہ کو دفن کیے کافی وقت گزر چکا ہے۔

قبر کشائی مردہ جسم کی بے حرمتی اور عدم احترام ہے۔

اس لیے قبر کشائی کا حکم غیر ضروری اور غیر قانونی ہے۔

مدعی/ریسپانڈنٹ (Respondent – مرحومہ کا بھائی):

شدید شک ظاہر کیا کہ اس کی بہن کو زہر دے کر قتل کیا گیا۔

اس نے کہا کہ وہ بہن کی موت کی اصل وجہ جاننے کا بنیادی حق رکھتا ہے۔

اس کے بغیر انصاف کے تقاضے پورے نہیں ہو سکتے۔

---

🔹 قانونی سوال (Legal Issue)

کیا کسی میت کی قبر کشائی اس بنیاد پر کی جا سکتی ہے کہ قریبی رشتہ دار نے مشتبہ موت پر شک ظاہر کیا ہے، حالانکہ میت پہلے ہی دفنائی جا چکی ہے؟

🔹 عدالت کے مشاہدات (Court’s Observations)

1. انصاف کی فراہمی کے لیے قبر کشائی ضروری ہو سکتی ہے۔

جب کسی قریبی عزیز کو موت کے بارے میں سنجیدہ شبہ ہو تو عدالت کا فرض ہے کہ موت کی اصل وجہ جاننے کے لیے تمام قانونی راستے اپنائے۔

2. قبر کشائی مردہ جسم کی توہین نہیں۔

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ صرف یہ دلیل کہ مردہ جسم دفنایا جا چکا ہے اور قبر کشائی سے بے حرمتی ہوگی، انصاف کے تقاضے روکنے کے لیے کافی نہیں ہے۔

3. قریبی عزیز کا حق۔

چونکہ درخواست گزار خود مرحومہ کا حقیقی بھائی ہے، اس لیے اسے یہ حق حاصل ہے کہ وہ اپنی بہن کی موت کی حقیقت جان سکے۔

4. مقدمے کی نوعیت۔

جب شک زہر دینے جیسے سنگین الزام پر ہو تو پوسٹ مارٹم کے ذریعے اصل حقیقت جاننا زیادہ مقدس اور ضروری ہے۔

---

🔹 عدالت کا فیصلہ (Court’s Conclusion)

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ:

نچلی عدالتوں نے بالکل درست فیصلہ کیا کہ قبر کشائی انصاف کے تقاضوں کے لیے لازمی ہے۔

مدعی (مرحومہ کے بھائی) کی درخواست بالکل جائز اور قانونی ہے۔

محمد زریں کی درخواست ابتدائی سماعت (in limine) میں ہی مسترد کر دی گئی کیونکہ اس میں کوئی قانونی وزن نہیں تھا۔

---

🔹 اصول قانون (Principle of Law Laid Down)

قبر کشائی کا حکم اس وقت جائز اور قانونی ہوگا جب موت کے بارے میں سنجیدہ شبہ ظاہر کیا جائے۔

میت کی بے حرمتی کا جواز محض دفنائے جانے کی بنیاد پر نہیں دیا جا سکتا۔

انصاف کی فراہمی اور سچائی تک پہنچنا زیادہ مقدس اصول ہے جو دیگر تمام مصلحتوں پر مقدم ہے۔

📌 خلاصہ:
یہ فیصلہ واضح کرتا ہے کہ اگر میت کی موت پر زہر دینے یا غیر فطری موت کا معقول شک ہو، تو عدالت قبر کشائی کا حکم دے سکتی ہے۔ میت کی عزت اور حرمت اپنی جگہ اہم ہے لیکن جب معاملہ انصاف اور سچائی کے تعین کا ہو تو عدالت کو انصاف کے تقاضوں کو ترجیح دینی ہوگی۔

Control of Narcotic Substances Act (XXV of 1997)---

----S. 9(c)---Possession of narcotic substance---Appreciation of evidence---Prosecution case was that 1455-grams heroin powder was recovered from the possession of accused---In narcotic cases, it was crucial to establish the charge of possession of narcotic recovered from the accused while strictly observing that the contraband was searched and seized by an officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector, that samples from each packet must be collected and sent for chemical analysis, that samples should be forwarded to the Forensic Science Laboratory within reasonable time of the seizure; and that ensuring the proper sending and safe transmission of the sample to the Forensic Science Laboratory was also vital---In the present case, all of the said legal requirements had been properly adhered to---Under S.29, Control of Narcotic Substances Act, a presumption is attached in trials regarding the possession of illicit articles of which accused has failed to account satisfactorily, unless and until contrary is proved by the appellant---Said burden was also not contradicted or disproven by the appellant/convict, who failed to explain his possession of such a large quantity of narcotic or his presence at the scene---Circumstances established that the prosecution had proved through cogent, credible and reliable evidence that police had recovered 1455 grams of heroin from the appellant and brought home the charge against him---Appeal

Generally, a person burdened with the allegation of shouting Lalkara was granted post-arrest bail but that was not an inflexible rule of the subject---For a just decision of post arrest bail in such cases, the court had to tentatively see the back ground in which a perpetrator shouted Lalkara , his interest in the crime and the quantum of influence which he exerted upon his co-assailants---For that material, the court could draw an opinion about the existence or non-existence of reasonable grounds in terms of S. 497(1), Cr.P.C., so as to decide the bail plea of such an accused---If it had arisen from the record that the accused shouting Lalkara had some deep-rooted interest in crime and was in a position to influence his co-accused so as to control his aggression, the concession of post-arrest bail could be withheld from him---Shouting of Lalkara by a person in commanding and overwhelming position was a sufficient overt act towards the commission of crime---Expression "Lalkara " stand for utterance of words by an overzealous accused at the crime scene, inciting others to commit an offence---Since the accused-petitioner was in dominance over his co-accused, hence, the "Lalkara " raised by him could in no manner be treated as proverbial, rather it could best be defined as commanding in nature---Despite being in a position of influence, accused-petitioner made no effort to calm down the situation rather ignited it through an overzealous shouting of "Lalkara ", culminating into the death of two real brothers---Plea of petitioner for post-arrest bail merits no acceptance, same was turned down---Petition was dismissed accordingly

[9/19/25, 9:11:36 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Investigation cannot be changed after framing of charge 

The order for further investigation / reinvestigation / transfer of ongoing investigation should be passed not as a routine matter. It should not be passed merely on the ground that one party was dissatisfied by the opinion of the Investigating Officer. It cannot be passed to oblige the one party to the detrimental of the other party. It has to be passed sparingly and in exceptional cases, where it appears that;  

i.  certain aspects regarding basic constituting elements of the offence, or version of the accused could not be investigated. 

ii.new facts / better evidence or further information has become available, which has direct essential / vital nexus with the alleged crime. 

iii.some proclaimed offender in the case has been arrested and important piece of evidence like recovery of weapon of offence has to be collected and other allied matters has to be investigated. 

iv. defects of vital nature in the already conducted investigation has been marked / detected/ pointed out. 

v. already conducted investigation remained unsatisfactory due to nonavailability of required evidence. 

vi. initial investigating officer has extended undue favour to one party by induction of false evidence, or causing some material piece of evidence to disappear or otherwise happens to be biased or partial. 

 vii. Investigating Officer happens to be negligent, incompetent or has failed to perform his duty properly.

 viii. investigation needs to be transferred to some other forum or team due to some technical/sensitive issues.

 ix. there is any other compelling circumstance, which makes it necessary that investigation should be transferred to some other officer. 

So far as passing of order for further investigation/reinvestigation after framing of the formal charge is concerned, scope for the same slims down and stands confined to limited circumstances, because when investigation has been completed regarding an accused person and report under Section 173 of Cr.P.C. has been submitted regarding him, it indicates that each and every aspect of the case regarding the said accused has already been probed into and material produced by both the sides has already been collected and brought on file and I.O has also rendered opinion, therefore, such like order may be passed in very exceptional circumstances and in rarest of rare case, where some new information emerges, which requires further probe/clarification necessitating the supplementary investigation for the collection of more evidence.

*False FIR under Section 182 PPC — Scope of Sections 173, 190 & 195 CrPC اور سپریم کورٹ آف پاکستان کا تجزیاتی فیصلہ"*

**M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*

PRESENT: Mr. Justice Irfan Saadat Khan Mr. Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi Cr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 (Against order dated 29.5.2025, in Criminal Misc. Application.No.655/2024, passed by Single Judge High Court of Sindh, Karachi)

فیصلہ کا خلاصہ یہ ہے کہ دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان کے تحت کسی عدالت کو اس وقت تک کسی جرم کا نوٹس لینے کا اختیار نہیں ہے جب تک کہ متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم یا اس کا اعلیٰ افسر تحریری شکایت درج نہ کرے۔ اس سلسلے میں عدالتِ عالیہ کے مقدمہ عبدالرحمٰن بنام ریاست (1968 P Cr. L J 215) پر انحصار کیا جا سکتا ہے۔ مزید براں، بھارتی عدالتِ عظمیٰ کے مقدمات سلونی اروڑہ بنام ریاست دہلی (AIR 2017 SC 391) اور دولت رام بنام ریاست پنجاب (1962 AIR 28) بھی حوالہ کے طور پر دیے جا سکتے ہیں۔ دی گئی صورتحال میں صرف متعلقہ پولیس افسر کی تحریری شکایت پر مجسٹریٹ کارروائی کر سکتا تھا، جبکہ مجسٹریٹ یا ایکس آفیسیو جسٹس آف پیس کے پاس اس ضمن میں شکایت درج کرنے یا ہدایت جاری کرنے کا کوئی اختیار نہیں تھا۔

زیر نظر کیس میں یہ بات سامنے آئی کہ نہ تو تفتیشی افسر (I.O) نے یہ رائے دی کہ شکایت کنندہ کی اطلاع جھوٹی تھی اور نہ ہی دفعہ 173 ض فوجداری کے تحت مقدمہ ’’بی کلاس‘‘ میں خارج کرنے کے لیے مجسٹریٹ کے سامنے رپورٹ پیش کی، بلکہ ’’سی کلاس‘‘ میں خارج کرنے کی سفارش کی گئی۔ اس کے باوجود مجسٹریٹ نے معاملے کا نوٹس لیا اور ملزمان کو عدالتی کارروائی کے ذریعے سزا دی۔ اس فیصلے کو اپیل میں چیلنج کیا گیا جہاں اپیلٹ فورم نے ٹرائل کورٹ کے تضادات کی بنیاد پر ملزمان کو بری کر دیا۔ تاہم، اپیلٹ کورٹ نے یہ قرار نہیں دیا کہ شکایت کنندہ کی طرف سے پولیس کو دی گئی اطلاع جھوٹی تھی۔

چونکہ نہ تو تفتیشی افسر کی رائے اور نہ ہی کسی عدالتی فورم کی یہ قرار داد موجود ہے کہ شکایت کنندہ کی اطلاع جھوٹی تھی، لہٰذا دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان اس کیس پر لاگو نہیں ہوتی۔ بصورتِ دیگر، قانون کی اس تشریح سے ایک ہی فوجداری کارروائی سے متعدد مقدمات جنم لیں گے اور ہر اس کیس میں جہاں شکایت کنندہ ناکام ہو جائے، خواہ وہ دائرہ اختیار کی کمی، مدت کی پابندی، ناکافی شواہد یا فائدہ بہ شک کے سبب ہو، جھوٹا مقدمہ قرار دے کر بے بنیاد فوجداری کارروائیوں کا سیلاب شروع ہو جائے 
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*

قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ تیار کر دیتا ہوں جس میں:

دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان (PPC) کی Bare Act Wording (اصل عبارت + اردو ترجمہ)

دفعہ 195 ض فوجداری (CrPC) کی Bare Act Wording (اصل عبارت + اردو ترجمہ)

دونوں دفعات کا قانونی تجزیہ اور تقابل

عدالتی نظائر (پاکستانی اور بھارتی)

اس فیصلے سے اخذ کردہ قانونی اصول

دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان (PPC)

Bare Act Wording:
"False information, with intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person.
Whoever gives to any public servant any information which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant—
(a) to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, or
(b) to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to three thousand rupees, or with both."

جو شخص کسی سرکاری ملازم کو ایسی اطلاع دے جس کے متعلق وہ جانتا یا یقین رکھتا ہو کہ وہ جھوٹی ہے، اور اس نیت سے کہ وہ سرکاری ملازم:
(a) ایسا کوئی فعل کرے یا نہ کرے جو صحیح حقائق معلوم ہونے کی صورت میں وہ نہ کرتا، یا
(b) اپنے قانونی اختیارات کو کسی شخص کے نقصان یا ایذا کے لیے استعمال کرے،
تو اسے چھ ماہ تک قید یا تین ہزار روپے تک جرمانہ یا دونوں سزائیں دی جا سکتی ہیں۔

دفعہ 195 ض فوجداری (CrPC)

Bare Act Wording (relevant portion):
"No Court shall take cognizance—
(a) of any offence punishable under Sections 172 to 188 (both inclusive) of the Pakistan Penal Code, except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned, or of some other public servant to whom he is administratively subordinate;"
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
کوئی عدالت ان جرائم کا نوٹس نہیں لے گی جو تعزیراتِ پاکستان کی دفعات 172 سے 188 تک میں قابلِ سزا ہیں، سوائے اس صورت کے کہ متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم یا اس کا کوئی بالا افسر تحریری شکایت کرے۔

قانونی تجزیہ

دفعہ 182، PPC صرف اس وقت لاگو ہو سکتی ہے جب:

اطلاع جھوٹی ثابت ہو عدالتی کارروائی کے ذریعے؛

اطلاع دینے والے کا علم یا یقین جھوٹ پر مبنی ہو؛

اطلاع کا مقصد یا امکان یہ ہو کہ سرکاری ملازم اپنے اختیارات کا غلط استعمال کرے۔

دفعہ 195، CrPC اس بات کی شرط لگاتی ہے کہ عدالت ازخود اس جرم کا نوٹس نہیں لے سکتی۔ شکایت صرف وہی سرکاری ملازم کر سکتا ہے جس کے سامنے جھوٹی اطلاع دی گئی تھی، یا اس کا بالا افسر۔
اس لیے اگر محض شکایت کنندہ اپنے الزامات ثابت نہ کر سکے تو اسے جھوٹا قرار نہیں دیا جا سکتا۔ اسے صرف ’’Not proved‘‘ کہا جائے گا، ’’False‘‘ نہیں۔

عدالت کا اختیار (Cognizance) محدود ہے: بغیر متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم کی تحریری شکایت کے مجسٹریٹ یا جسٹس آف پیس کارروائی شروع نہیں کر سکتا۔

۔ عدالتی نظائر (Case Law)

عبدالرحمٰن بنام ریاست (1968 P Cr. L J 215):
عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ دفعہ 182، PPC کے تحت کارروائی صرف متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم کی تحریری شکایت پر ہو سکتی ہے

Supreme Court of India – Saloni Arora Vs. State of NCT Delhi (AIR 2017 SC 391):
محض ناکافی ثبوت یا benefit of doubt جھوٹی اطلاع کے مترادف نہیں۔

Daulat Ram Vs. State of Punjab (1962 AIR 28):
یہ واضح کیا گیا کہ مجسٹریٹ ازخود دفعہ 182 کے مقدمہ کا اختیار نہیں رکھتا۔

اخذ کردہ اصول

دفعہ 182 PPC کا اطلاق صرف اس وقت ہوگا جب:

جھوٹ عدالتی فیصلے سے ثابت ہو۔

اطلاع دانستہ اور بدنیتی پر مبنی دی گئی ہو۔

دفعہ 195 CrPC عدالت کو اس جرم کا نوٹس لینے سے روکتی ہے، جب تک متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم تحریری شکایت نہ کرے۔

محض یہ کہ شکایت کنندہ اپنے الزامات ثابت نہ کر سکا، اسے جھوٹا نہیں کہا جا سکتا۔

اگر اس اصول پر عمل نہ کیا جائے تو ہر ناکام فوجداری مقدمہ کے بعد شکایت کنندہ پر دفعہ 182 PPC لگا کر فالتو اور انتقامی مقدمات کا سیلاب آ جائے گا۔

قانونی پوزیشن (Summary Note for Court):

مجسٹریٹ یا جسٹس آف پیس دفعہ 182 PPC کے مقدمے کا نوٹس ازخود نہیں لے سکتا۔

شرط یہ ہے کہ متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم تحریری شکایت کرے (سیکشن 195 CrPC)۔

جب تک عدالتی فیصلے میں شکایت کو ’’جھوٹی‘‘ قرار نہ دیا جائے، دفعہ 182 PPC لاگو نہیں ہو سکتی۔

ناکافی شواہد، دائرہ اختیار کی کمی، مدت کی پابندی یا benefit of doubt کو جھوٹی اطلاع نہیں کہا جا سکتا۔

دفعہ 173 ض فوجداری – پولیس افسر کی رپورٹ

اس باب کے تحت ہر تفتیش غیر ضروری تاخیر کے بغیر مکمل کی جائے گی اور جوں ہی مکمل ہو، تھانہ انچارج افسر کو چاہیے کہ [سرکاری وکیل کے ذریعے] درج ذیل رپورٹ مجسٹریٹ کو پیش کرے جو پولیس رپورٹ پر مقدمہ سننے کا اختیار رکھتا ہے:

(الف) ایسی رپورٹ جو صوبائی حکومت کی مقرر کردہ صورت میں ہو، جس میں فریقین کے نام، معلومات کی نوعیت، ان افراد کے نام جو واقعات سے واقف معلوم ہوتے ہیں، اور یہ وضاحت ہو کہ ملزم (اگر گرفتار ہے) تو اسے حراست میں بھیجا گیا ہے یا ضمانت پر رہا کیا گیا ہے، اور اگر رہا کیا گیا ہے تو ضامن کے ساتھ یا بغیر۔

دفعہ 190 ض فوجداری – مجسٹریٹ کی طرف سے جرائم پر کارروائی

تمام فرسٹ کلاس مجسٹریٹ یا کوئی بھی دوسرا مجسٹریٹ جسے صوبائی حکومت ہائی کورٹ کی سفارش پر خصوصی اختیار دے، کسی بھی جرم پر کارروائی کر سکتا ہے:

(الف) ایسے حقائق کی شکایت موصول ہونے پر جو کسی جرم کا ارتکاب ظاہر کرتے ہوں؛
(ب) کسی پولیس افسر کی جانب سے ایسے حقائق کی تحریری رپورٹ پر؛
(ج) کسی شخص (پولیس افسر کے علاوہ) سے موصولہ اطلاع، یا اپنی معلومات یا شبہ کی بنیاد پر کہ کوئی جرم ہوا ہے، جسے وہ خود سن سکتا ہے یا سیشن کورٹ کو بھیج سکتا ہے۔

اگر ایسا جرم جس پر کارروائی ہو صرف سیشن کورٹ کے دائرہ اختیار میں ہے، تو مجسٹریٹ صرف مقدمہ سیشن کورٹ کو بھیجے گا، بغیر شواہد ریکارڈ کیے۔

دفعہ 195 ض فوجداری – سرکاری ملازمین کے قانونی اختیارات کی توہین پر کارروائی وغیرہ

کوئی عدالت درج ذیل صورت میں کارروائی نہیں کر سکتی:

(الف) تعزیرات پاکستان کی دفعات 172 سے [187] تک کے تحت قابل سزا کسی بھی جرم پر، سوائے اس کے کہ متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم خود تحریری شکایت کرے یا کوئی دوسرا سرکاری ملازم جو اس کا ماتحت ہو، شکایت کرے۔

اہم قانونی نکتہ:

دفعہ 173 کے تحت پولیس رپورٹ (چالان، یا بی/سی/ای کلاس رپورٹ) مجسٹریٹ کو بھیجتی ہے۔

دفعہ 190 کے تحت مجسٹریٹ فیصلہ کرتا ہے کہ وہ مقدمہ سن سکتا ہے یا آگے بھیج سکتا ہے۔

دفعہ 195 ایک بار (bar of cognizance) لگاتی ہے کہ مخصوص جرائم (مثلاً دفعہ 182 پی پی سی) پر کارروائی صرف سرکاری ملازم کی شکایت پر ہی ممکن ہے، کسی نجی فرد یا عدالتی حکم پر نہیں۔

دفعہ 182 پی پی سی جھوٹی اطلاع دینے کو جرم بناتی ہے، لیکن اس پر براہِ راست کارروائی عدالت نہیں کر سکتی جب تک کہ متعلقہ سرکاری افسر خود شکایت نہ کرے۔

تفتیشی افسر (I.O) تفتیش مکمل کرنے کے بعد پولیس رولز 1934 کے رول 24.7 کے تحت کسی ایف آئی آر کے اخراج کی سفارش درج ذیل انداز میں کر سکتا ہے:

کلاس "A": اگر مقدمہ سچا ہے لیکن ملزم ناقابلِ سراغ (Untraceable) ہے۔

کلاس "B": اگر پولیس کو دی گئی اطلاع بدنیتی پر مبنی جھوٹی ثابت ہو۔

کلاس "C": اگر معاملہ ناقابلِ دست اندازی پولیس (Non-cognizable) ہو، یا محض دیوانی دعویٰ ہو، یا حقائق کی غلطی کی بنیاد پر مقدمہ درج ہوا ہو۔

اس حوالے سے مقدمہ سید قمبر علی شاہ بنام صوبہ سندھ و دیگر (2024 SCMR 1123) پر انحصار کیا جا سکتا ہے۔

جب ایسی رپورٹ متعلقہ مجسٹریٹ اول (First Class) یا کسی اور مجسٹریٹ کے سامنے پیش کی جاتی ہے جسے صوبائی حکومت نے ہائی کورٹ کی سفارش پر خصوصی طور پر بااختیار بنایا ہو، تو ایسے مجسٹریٹ کے پاس یہ اختیار ہوتا ہے کہ وہ:

رپورٹ کو قبول کرے، یا

رپورٹ کردہ جرم پر نوٹس (Cognizance) لے، یا

تفتیشی افسر کو مزید تفتیش (Reinvestigation) کی ہدایت دے اور مقررہ مدت میں نئی رپورٹ طلب کرے۔

تاہم، مجسٹریٹ کے پاس یہ اختیار نہیں ہوتا کہ وہ تفتیشی افسر کو حکم دے کہ ایف آئی آر کو کلاس "A"، "B" یا "C" میں خارج کرے۔

I.O کا اختیار: A / B / C کلاس (Rule 24.7 — Police Rules, 1934)

تفتیش مکمل ہونے پر تفتیشی افسر Police Rules, 1934 (Rule 24.7) وغیرہ کے تحت ایف آئی آر کی disposal کے لیے سفارش کر سکتا ہے:

Class A — کیس سچا مگر ملزم ناقابلِ سراغ؛

Class B — اطلاع بدنیتی پر مبنی/maliciously false (=> ممکنہ 182 کے لیے بنیاد)؛

Class C — غیر قابلِ دست اندازی/دیوانی نوعیت/غلط فہمی وغیرہ۔ 

جب I.O نے C-class سفارش کی ہو تو اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ معلومات کو جھوٹا ثابت کرنے کی بنیاد موجود نہیں — صرف ثبوت ناکافی/غلط فہمی کا امکان۔ ایسی صورت میں عدالتی حکم سے براہِ راست 182 کی کارروائی کا حکم دینا غلط استعمالِ عملِ عدل ہوگا

موجودہ کیس پر تفصیلی تجزیہ (Issue-wise)

کیا مجسٹریٹ/Ex-Officio JP 182 کی کارروائی کا حکم دے سکتا تھا؟
— قانوناً نہیں (قابلِ اعتراض) کیونکہ دفعہ 195 نے express bar رکھی ہے اور 182 کی شروعات عمومی طور پر اُس public servant یا superior police officer کی شِکایت/رائے سے ممکن ہے جو اصل اطلاع پر عمل کیا۔ عدالتی ہدایت بذاتِ خود اس بار کو عبور نہیں کر سکتی

کیا I.O کی C-class سفارش کے باوجود مجسٹریٹ نے اطلاقِ اختیار کر لیا؟
— اگر مجسٹریٹ نے IO-کی C-class رپورٹ کو نظر انداز کر کے ازخود B-class یا 182 کارروائی کا حکم دیا تو وہ اختیار سے تجاوز سمجھا جائے گا۔ مجسٹریٹ کو I.O کی رائے پر سمجھی ہوئی کارروائی کی توضیح کرنی چاہیے اور صرف جائز/قابلِ عمل شواہد کی بنیاد پر ہی cognizance لینا چاہیے۔ 

دیر سے رابطہ (≈15 سال) اور civil remedy پہلے سے اختیار کرنے کا اثر؟
— عدالت نے اس کو weight دیا: دیر سے رجوع اور civil remedies پہلے اپنانے کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ مدعی نے مقدماتی چارہ جوئی/نزاع کو عدالتی/دیوانی راہ سے حل کرنے کی کوشش کی اور پھر بعد ازاں اسی فعل کو فوجداری شکل دینے کی کوشش کی — یہ motives کو مشکوک بناتا ہے اور Ex-Officio JP کو محتاط رکھنے کی وجہ بنتا ہے۔
(Case law میں اسی طرزِ عمل کو ملازمِ سنگینی سے دیکھا گیا)۔

کیا 182 کے لیے show-cause یا IO-opinion ضروری ہے؟
— ججوں کی رخ صحیح روایات میں یہ پایا گیا کہ 182 کی کارروائی عام طور پر صرف اس وقت قابلِ اقدام ہوتی ہے جب: (a) FIR واقعی رجسٹر، تفتیش اور عدالتی عمل کے نتیجے میں false ثابت ہو؛ یا (b) I.O واضح طور پر maliciously false ہونے کی رائے دے اور پھر relevant public servant شکایت کرے۔ اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ مجسٹریٹ کی جانب سے ازخود 182 کی شروعات عموماً غیر مناسب سمجھی گئی ہے۔

بی کلاس (B-Class) رپورٹ

مفہوم:
ایسی رپورٹ جس میں پولیس یہ نتیجہ اخذ کرے کہ مقدمہ جھوٹا یا بے بنیاد ہے، اور شکایت کنندہ نے دانستہ طور پر جھوٹا مقدمہ بنایا۔

قانونی اثر:

اگر مجسٹریٹ اس رپورٹ کو منظور کر لے تو مقدمہ جھوٹا قرار پاتا ہے۔

ایسی صورت میں شکایت کنندہ پر دفعہ 182 PPC یا دیگر قانونی کارروائی کا دروازہ کھل سکتا ہے، لیکن صرف اسی صورت میں جب متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم تحریری شکایت کرے (سیکشن 195
 CrPC)۔

سی کلاس (C-Class) رپورٹ

مفہوم:
ایسی رپورٹ جس میں پولیس یہ نتیجہ اخذ کرے کہ مقدمہ بلا ارادہ، بے دلیلی یا غلط فہمی پر مبنی تھا، لیکن اسے جھوٹا نہیں کہا جا سکتا۔

قانونی اثر:

مقدمہ خارج ہو جاتا ہے، لیکن شکایت کنندہ پر جھوٹے مقدمے (False case) کا الزام نہیں لگتا۔

شکایت کو ’’Not Proved‘‘ سمجھا جاتا ہے، ’’False‘‘ نہیں۔

شکایت کنندہ کے خلاف دفعہ 182 PPC یا دیگر فوجداری کارروائی نہیں ہو سکتی کیونکہ اطلاع بدنیتی سے جھوٹی ثابت نہیں ہوئی۔

قانونی نکتہ (Court Argument Style):

’’معزز عدالت، تفتیشی افسر نے دفعہ 173 ض فوجداری کے تحت مقدمہ بی کلاس میں جھوٹا قرار دینے کی بجائے سی کلاس میں خارج کرنے کی سفارش کی، جو اس امر کا واضح ثبوت ہے کہ شکایت کنندہ کی طرف سے دی گئی اطلاع جھوٹی نہیں بلکہ ناقابلِ ثبوت تھی۔ چونکہ بی کلاس رپورٹ موجود نہیں ہے اور کسی عدالتی فورم نے بھی اطلاع کو جھوٹا قرار نہیں دیا، اس لیے دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان بالکل لاگو نہیں ہوتی۔ کسی اور تعبیر کو تسلیم کرنا قانون کے خلاف اور فالتو فوجداری مقدمات کے دروازے کھولنے کے مترادف ہوگا۔‘‘

[9/19/25, 5:29:45 PM] ~ Muhammad Jamil Khan AHC ☺️: قبر کشائی کے قوانین اور طریقہ کار
کسی بھی مقتول کی موت کی وجہ معلوم کرنے اور تحقیات کرانے کے لیے مجسٹریٹ کو درخواست زیر دفعہ 176 ضابطہ فوجداری گزاری جاسکتی ہے جس پر مجسٹریٹ انکوائری تشکیل دینے کاحکم دے سکتا ہے
جب کہ انصاف کے تقاضوں کو مدنظر رکھتے ہوے ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 176(2)کے تحت درخواست گزار کر قبر کشائی کراے جانے کی استدعا کی جاسکتی ہے
جس پر مجسٹریٹ درخواست منظور کرکے اپنی نگرانی پر قبر کشائی کرانے کے بعد لاش کا پوسٹ مارٹم کرنے کا حکم دے سکتا ہے تاکہ وجہ موت کا ٹھیک طرح پتہ چل سکے
اعلی عدلیہ نے اپنے فیصلہ میں قرار دیا ہے کہ قبر کشائی کی درخواست زائد المعیاد ہو تب بھی مجسٹریٹ درخواست کو خارج نہیں کرسکتا
ایک اور مقدمہ میں قرار دیا گیا ہے کہ اگرمقدمہ عدالت میں چل رہا ہو اور کوئی فریق قبر کشائی کی درخواست گزارے تو دوسرے فریق کو سنے بغیر درخواست منظور نہ کی جاے
اگر ایک بار پوسٹ مارٹم ہوجاے اور تدفین ہوجاے تو دوبارہ قبر کشائی کرنے کے بعد دوبارہ پوسٹ مارٹم کیا جاسکتا ہے
قبر کشائی کی درخواست یا قتل کی تحقیات کی درخواست گزارنے پر کوئی معیاد لاگو نہیں ہوتی یہ درخواست کبھی بھی دی جاسکتی ہے

قبر کشائی کی درخواست اور موت کی وجوہات کی تحقیات کی درخواست کوئی بھی دے سکتا ہے حتی کہ اجنبی شخص بھی مجسٹریٹ کو درخواست دے کر قانون کو حرکت میں لاسکتا ہے
جب ایک بار مجسٹریٹ کرادے تو گورنمنٹ یا پولیس دوبارہ انکوائری نہیں کراسکتی اور نہ ہی قبر کشائی کرا سکتی ہے
ایک اور فیصلہ میں سپریم کورٹ نے قرار دیا کہ پولیس کی قید میں کوئی بھی شخص پولیس کی ذمہ داری میں پر ہوتا ہے اگر وہ قیدی کو جعلی مقابلہ میں ماردے اور اگر پولیس کے خلاف کاروائی نہ ہوئی تو یہی سمجھا جاے گا کہ ملک میں جنگل کا قانون نافذ ہے

الف ) کیا بار ایسوسی ایشنز کی جانب سے ایسا اعلامیہ جاری کرنا کہ جس میں وکلاء کو مختلف مقدمات کی پیروی سے منع کیا گیا ہو تو ایسے اعلامیہ کی آئینی و قانونی حیثیت کیا ہے ؟

عدالت عالیہ کے سامنے موجود سوال کی وضاحت کے بعد مقدمے کے مختصر حقائق کچھ یوں ہیں کہ : 

درخواست گزار شبیر خان جو کہ ضلع مردان کے تھانہ پار ہوتی میں درج ایک ایف آئی آر میں مثتغیث بھی ہیں جس میں یاد رہے کہ جو ملزمان نامزد کئے گئے ہیں تو ان کا تعلق مردان بار ایسوسی ایشن سے ہے اور انھوں نے مردان کے مقامی ایڈیشنل سیشن جج کی عدالت میں ضمانت قبل از گرفتاری کی درخواست دائر کر رکھی ہے جس کے خلاف درخواست گزار نے مذکورہ بالا ضمانت قبل از گرفتاری کی درخواست کو مردان کی بجائے کسی بھی دوسرے ضلع بالخصوص ہری پور، مانسہرہ یا ایبٹ آباد منتقل کرنے کے لیے عدالت عالیہ سے بدیں وجہ رجوع کیا کہ ایک تو نامزد ملزمان کا تعلق مردان بار ایسوسی ایشن سے ہے اور دوسرا مردان بار ایسوسی ایشن کی جانب سے جاری کی گئی ایک پریس ریلیز کہ جس میں تمام معزز ممبران مردان بار ایسوسی ایشن کو مثتغیث کی وکالت سے منع کیا گیا تھا۔

مقدمے کی حساسیت کو دیکھتے ہوئے عدالت عالیہ نے مردان بار ایسوسی ایشن کے صدر اور جنرل سیکرٹری ، ضلع مردان سے خیبرپختونخوا بار کونسل کے ممبر ، وائس چیئرمین اور چئیر مین ایکزیکٹیو خیبرپختونخوا بار کونسل اور ہائ کورٹ بار ایسوسی ایشن کے صدر اور جنرل سیکرٹری کو عدالت عالیہ کے سامنے پیش ہونے کا حکم دیا گیا جس کے بعد فریقین کے وکلاء سمیت وکلاء برادری نے عدالت عالیہ کے سامنے سیر حاصل بحث کی۔

عدالت عالیہ کے سامنے سب سے پہلی بات تو یہ رکھی گئی کہ مذکورہ بالا پریس ریلیز سے مردان بار ایسوسی ایشن دستبردار ہو چکی ہے اور اس ضمن میں عدالت عالیہ کے سامنے دستبرداری کا نوٹس پیش کیا گیا جس کو عدالت کی جانب سے سراہا گیا جس کے بعد عدالت عالیہ نے اپنے فیصلے کا آغاز قانون کی حکمرانی کی اہمیت سے کیا اور اس حوالے سے یہ قرار دیا کہ بار ایسوسی ایشن محض پیشہ ورانہ تنظیمیں نہیں بلکہ عدلیہ کی آزادی کی سرپرست ہیں اور ان کا کردار براہ راست نظام عدل پر پڑتا ہے۔ اس کے بعد آرٹیکل دس-اے کی تشریح کرتے ہوئے عدالت عالیہ نے واضح طور پر قرار دیا کہ فئر ٹرائل میں سب سے اہم چیز منصفانہ حق سماعت اور اپنے لئے اپنی مرضی کا وکیل مقرر کرنا ہے۔ اس حوالے سے عدالت نے نہ صرف کئ ایک مشہور اور تاریخ ساز عدالتی نظائر بلکہ ساتھ ہی ساتھ بین الاقوامی معاہدوں کا زکر بھی کیا ہے جو کہ یقینا نہایت ہی اہمیت کا حامل ہے۔ یاد رہے کہ عدالت عالیہ نے اپنے فیصلے میں بار ایسوسی ایشنز کے مختلف کارنامہ ہائے بالخصوص آمر پرویز مشرف کے خلاف وکلاء تحریک کا زکر سنہری الفاظ میں کیا ہے۔ فیصلے کے آخر میں عدالت عالیہ نے قرار دیا کہ چونکہ مردان بار ایسوسی ایشن اپنے پریس ریلیز سے دستبردار ہو چکی ہے تو اس لئے درخواست گزار کی شکایت کا ازالہ ہوچکا ہے تو بدیں وجہ مزید کاروائی کی کوئ ضرورت چنداں نہیں رہتی۔ 

اس انتہائی اہم فیصلے کا خلاصہ یہ ہے کہ بار ایسوسی ایشنز کی جانب سے ایسی کوئ بھی ہدایات جو کہ منصفانہ حق سماعت میں رکاوٹ بنے تو وہ نہ صرف غیر اخلاقی، غیر قانونی اور غیر آئینی بھی ہے ۔ 

عدالت عالیہ کا یہ انتہائی اہم فیصلہ چیف جسٹس ایس ایم عتیق شاہ صاحب نے لکھا ہے جو کہ عدالت عالیہ کی ویب سائٹ پر Cr. M (Transfer Application ) No. 34-P/2025 پڑھا اور دیکھا جا سکتا ہے 

یاد رہے کہ اس فیصلے میں عدالت کے لئے تحقیقی معاونت کا فریضہ ہمارے نہایت ہی قابل قدر سر مظہر علی خان ؛ ریسرچ اینڈ ریفرنس آفیسر پشاور ہائی کورٹ نے سر انجام دیا ہے۔

💔 وادی تیراہ سے افسوسناک خبر ہے کہ مبینہ بمباری میں بچوں اور خواتین سمیت کئی بے گناہ جانیں ضائع ہو گئیں۔
 ان ننھے پھولوں کا قصور کیا تھا؟ 
کیا ان کے ہاتھوں میں کھلونے کے بجائے بارود تھا؟ 
کیا ان کی آنکھوں میں خواب کے بجائے نفرت تھی؟
 ہرگز نہیں!
 وہ تو صرف زندگی چاہتے تھے، 
کھیل کود چاہتے تھے، 
ہنسی بانٹنا چاہتے تھے۔

🌹 جذباتی نظم

یہ بچے تو خوابوں کے تھے مسافر، 
نہ بندوق ان کے ہاتھ، 
نہ کوئی خنجر۔ 
ہنسی کے گلاب تھے،
 امن کے سفیر، 
لیکن ظلم نے ان کو مٹا دیا بے ضمیر۔

✊ ظلم کے خلاف آواز

یہ معصوم کسی جنگ کے فریق نہیں تھے۔ 
یہ کسی طاقت کے ایجنڈے کے ساتھی نہیں تھے۔ 
ان پر بم برسانے والے ادارے کو یاد رکھنا ہوگا 
کہ انسانیت سب س

✅ فوری اور شفاف تحقیقات ہوں۔ 
✅ ذمہ داروں کو قانون کے کٹہرے میں لایا جائے۔
 ✅ متاثرہ خاندانوں کو فوری امداد اور انصاف دیا جائے۔ 
✅ آئندہ شہری علاقوں کو نشانہ بنانے سے پہلے ان کی حفاظت یقینی بنائی جائے۔

جج: جناب جسٹس میاںگل حسن اورنگ زیب
فیصلہ کی تاریخ: 11-09-2025*

اس عدالت کو یہ طے کرنا ہے کہ آیا کرایہ دار عدالت 
(Rent Controller)، اپیلٹ کورٹ اور ہائی کورٹ نے درست طور پر یہ قرار دیا کہ درخواست گزار یہ ثابت کرنے میں ناکام رہی کہ اس اور مدعا علیہ نمبر 1 کے درمیان مالک اور کرایہ دار کا تعلق موجود ہے یا نہیں۔ درخواست گزار نے بے دخلی کی درخواست دائر کی جس میں اس نے مدعا علیہ نمبر 1 کے ساتھ زبانی کرایہ داری معاہدے کا دعویٰ کیا۔ کرایہ دار عدالت، اپیلٹ کورٹ اور ہائی کورٹ—تینوں نے متفقہ طور پر یہ قرار دیا کہ نہ تو درخواست گزار زبانی معاہدے کا وجود ثابت کرسکی اور نہ ہی کسی مرحلے پر مدعا علیہ نمبر 1 کی جانب سے کرایہ ادا کرنے کا ثبوت پیش کرسکی۔ ہم ان تین عدالتوں کے اس نتیجے کو شواہد کی غلط یا غیر قرأت (misreading/non-reading) کا نتیجہ قرار نہیں دیتے، اس لیے اس میں مداخلت کی کوئی ضرورت نہیں۔

2009ء کا ایکٹ اس مفروضے پر مبنی ہے کہ بے دخلی کی درخواست میں فریقین کے درمیان مالک اور کرایہ دار کا تعلق موجود ہے۔ اس ایکٹ کا مقصد مالک اور کرایہ دار کے مابین تعلقات کو منظم کرنا اور ان کے تنازعات کے فوری اور کم خرچ تصفیے کا طریقہ کار فراہم کرنا ہے۔ تاہم اگر مالک اور کرایہ دار کا تعلق ہی ثابت نہ ہو تو کرایہ دار عدالت کو اس معاملے میں کوئی دائرہ اختیار حاصل نہیں۔ مقدمہ میاں عمر اکرم الحق بنام ڈاکٹر شاہدہ حسنین (2016 SCMR 2186) میں عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ اگر کرایہ کے کسی معاملے میں مدعا علیہ کرایہ داری کے تعلق سے انکار کرے تو ایک "jurisdictional fact" کا سوال پیدا ہوتا ہے، اور عدالت کا دائرہ اختیار ایسے حقائق کے تعین پر منحصر ہوتا ہے۔

اس ضمن میں قرار دیا گیا

اس سیاق و سباق میں دائرہ اختیار کا بنیادی سوال یہ ہوگا کہ آیا فریقین کے درمیان مالک اور کرایہ دار کا تعلق موجود ہے یا نہیں۔ اگر کرایہ دار عدالت حقائق کی جانچ کے ذریعے اس تعلق کے وجود کو یقینی طور پر ثابت کرلے تو اسے دائرہ اختیار حاصل ہوگا، بصورت دیگر درخواست مسترد ہوگی کیونکہ ایسی صورت میں عدالت کو فریقین پر کوئی دائرہ اختیار حاصل نہیں ہوگا۔"

یہ قانون کا مسلمہ اصول ہے کہ مالک پر یہ ذمہ داری (onus) ہے کہ وہ مالک اور کرایہ دار کے تعلق کا وجود ثابت کرے اگر وہ کرایہ دار کی بے دخلی چاہتا ہے۔ 2009ء کے ایکٹ کی دفعہ 2(1) کے مطابق "کرایہ دار" کی تعریف یہ ہے:
"2(1) 'کرایہ دار' سے مراد وہ شخص ہے جو کسی احاطے میں قبضے یا سکونت کے عوض کرایہ ادا کرنے پر متفق ہو یا اس کا پابند ہو، خواہ اپنے لیے یا کسی دوسرے شخص کی طرف سے، اور اس میں یہ شامل ہیں:
(i) ایسا شخص جو اپنی کرایہ داری کے خاتمے کے بعد بھی احاطے پر قابض رہے، بشرطیکہ یہ کارروائی اس ایکٹ کے تحت ہو؛
(ii) کرایہ دار کی وفات کی صورت میں اس کے قانونی ورثاء جو احاطے پر قابض رہیں؛
(iii) سب کرایہ دار (sub-tenant) جو مالک کی تحریری اجازت سے احاطے یا اس کے کسی حصے پر قابض ہو۔"

لہٰذا کرایہ دار عدالت کے سامنے بے دخلی کی کارروائی اس
وقت تک نہیں کی جاسکتی جب تک مالک اور کرایہ دار کے تعلق کو ثابت نہ کیا جائے۔ یہ تعلق کرایہ داری کے معاہدے کے نتیجے میں پیدا ہوتا ہے۔ اس تعلق کے قیام کا ایک اہم ثبوت کرایہ کی ادائیگی ہے۔ اگر کوئی شخص کسی احاطے پر قابض ہو لیکن کرایہ ادا نہ کرے تو یہ اس تعلق کے وجود کی نفی کرے گا۔ کرایہ کی ادائیگی صرف کرایہ داری کا معمولی پہلو نہیں بلکہ یہ مالک اور کرایہ دار کے تعلق کے لیے ایک بنیادی شرط (sine qua non) ہے۔ مدعا علیہ نمبر 1 کو کرایہ دار ثابت کرنے کے لیے درخواست گزار کو دکھانا تھا کہ مدعا علیہ نمبر 1 یا تو کرایہ ادا کرنے پر متفق تھا یا اس کا پابند تھا۔ یہ کرایہ داری کی رسیدوں یا ایسے گواہوں کے ذریعے کیا جاسکتا تھا جو مدعا علیہ نمبر 1 کی جانب سے کرایہ کی ادائیگی کے گواہ ہوتے۔

اگرچہ درخواست گزار نے مرزا فدا لطیف کو بطور AW-1 بنیادی گواہ پیش کیا لیکن جرح میں اس نے تسلیم کیا کہ کرایہ کی کوئی رسید پیش نہیں کی گئی۔ اس نے یہ بھی کہا کہ مدعا علیہ نمبر 1 کو عدم ادائیگیِ کرایہ کے بارے میں کوئی نوٹس جاری نہیں کیا گیا۔ ایسی صورت میں یہ نہیں کہا جاسکتا کہ مدعا علیہ نمبر 1 نے کسی مرحلے پر درخواست گزار کو کرایہ ادا کیا تھا۔

البتہ، اگر کوئی کرایہ داری معاہدہ (خواہ زبانی یا تحریری) موجود ہو تو صرف عدم ادائیگی کرایہ کو بنیاد بنا کر یہ نہیں کہا جاسکتا کہ مالک اور کرایہ دار کا تعلق نہیں۔ ایسا تعلق کرایہ داری کے معاہدے کے انعقاد پر وجود میں آتا ہے۔ لیکن درخواست گزار اس بات کے گواہ پیش نہ کرسکی کہ مدعا علیہ نمبر 1 کے ساتھ کرایہ داری کا معاہدہ کس کے سامنے وجود میں آیا تھا۔

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 

بنیادی قانونی سوال

اس کیس میں اصل سوال یہ تھا کہ آیا مالک اور کرایہ دار کا تعلق (landlord–tenant relationship) وجود رکھتا ہے یا نہیں۔ کیونکہ اگر یہ تعلق ہی ثابت نہ ہو تو کرایہ دار عدالت (Rent Controller) کو دائرہ اختیار (jurisdiction) حاصل نہیں۔

سپریم کورٹ نے واضح کیا کہ

کرایہ دار عدالت، اپیلٹ فورم اور ہائی کورٹ—تینوں نے درست طور پر یہ نتیجہ اخذ کیا کہ درخواست گزار کرایہ داری معاہدہ (oral/written) یا کرایہ کی ادائیگی کا کوئی ثبوت فراہم نہیں کر سکی۔

اس بنیاد پر تینوں عدالتوں کی
 findings 
کسی 
misreading
 یا 
non-reading of evidence
 پر مبنی نہیں، لہٰذا مداخلت کی ضرورت نہیں۔

2009
ء کا قانون
 (Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009)
 کی روح

یہ قانون مالک–
کرایہ داری تعلق کو 
presuppose 
کرتا ہے۔

دفعہ 2(1) میں "کرایہ دار" کی تعریف کے مطابق، کرایہ داری کا تعلق قبضہ + کرایہ کی ادائیگی یا اس کی پابندی سے قائم ہوتا ہے۔

اس قانون کا مقصد یہ ہے کہ اگر تعلق ثابت ہو تو فوری اور کم خرچ تصفیہ ممکن ہو، لیکن اگر تعلق ہی ثابت نہ ہو تو عدالت کا دائرہ اختیار نہیں بنتا۔

Jurisdictional Fact
 کا تصور

فیصلہ میاں عمر اکرم الحق بنام ڈاکٹر شاہدہ حسنین 
(2016 SCMR 2186)
 پر انحصار کرتا ہے۔ اس میں قرار دیا گیا تھا کہ

اگر مدعا علیہ کرایہ داری کے تعلق سے ہی انکار کرے تو یہ ایک
 jurisdictional fact 
بنتا ہے۔

عدالت کا دائرہ اختیار اسی حقیقت کے تعین پر منحصر ہوگا۔

جب تک
 landlord-tenant 
تعلق قائم نہ ہو
، eviction application
 قابل رواں 
 نہیں ہوگی۔

برڈن اف پروف 
(Onus of Proof)

قانون کا مسلمہ اصول ہے:

اگر کوئی مالک کرایہ دار کی بے دخلی چاہتا ہے تو مالک پر بوجھِ ثبوت ہے کہ وہ کرایہ داری کا تعلق ثابت کرے۔

یہ تعلق ثابت کرنے کے طریقے:

تحریری یا زبانی کرایہ داری معاہدہ کے ثبوت یا گواہ،

کرایہ کی رسیدیں،

کرایہ کی ادائیگی کے گواہ،

کرایہ کی عدم ادائیگی پر قانونی نوٹس۔

اس کیس میں

کوئی رسید یا تحریری معاہدہ پیش نہیں کیا گیا،

AW-1 (مرزا فدا لطیف) نے جرح میں تسلیم کیا کہ نہ رسید ہے نہ نوٹس،

کوئی گواہ بھی نہیں جو زبانی معاہدے یا ادائیگی کی تصدیق کرے۔

لہٰذا درخواست گزار بوجھِ ثبوت پورا کرنے میں ناکام رہی
اہم قانونی نکات

کرایہ داری تعلق کا ثبوت
قبضہ بذاتِ خود
 tenancy establish
 نہیں کرتا، جب تک اس کے ساتھ کرایہ کی ادائیگی یا وعدہ نہ ہو۔

عدم ادائیگی کرایہ
اگر
 tenancy
 ثابت ہو جائے تو صرف کرایہ نہ دینے پر یہ نہیں کہا جا سکتا
 کہ تعلق ختم ہوگیا، لیکن
 tenancy
 ثابت کرنا 
landlord 
کی ذمہ داری ہے۔

Rent Controller 
کا دائرہ اختیار

تبھی
establish
ہو گا 
 landlord–tenant
 تعلق واضح طور پر ثابت ہو۔

بصورت دیگر مقدمہ خارج ہو جائے گا۔

Sine Qua Non 
(بنیادی شرط)
کرایہ کی ادائیگی
 tenancy
 تعلق کے لیے لازمی شرط ہے۔

فیصلے کی قانونی اہمیت

یہ فیصلہ تین اصولوں کو مزید مضبوط کرتا ہے:

Jurisdictional Fact Doctrine
: Rent Controller
 کا اختیار اسی وقت فعال ہوگا 
جب تک 
landlord–tenant 
تعلق قائم نہ ہو ۔

eviction application maintainable
 نہیں ہوگی۔

Burden of Proof on Landlord:
 eviction proceedings
 میں ہمیشہ مالک کو 
tenancy establish 
کرنی ہوگی۔

Strict Proof Requirement: 
محض دعویٰ یا قبضہ کافی نہیں، 
tenancy 
کے ٹھوس ثبوت (کرایہ، نوٹس، گواہ) لازمی ہیں۔

مجوزہ قانونی اثرات

مستقبل میں کرایہ داری تنازعات میں 
landlords
 کو 
eviction 
سے قبل 
tenancy
 کا ٹھوس ثبوت جمع کرنا پڑے گا۔

Rent Controllers
 اور
 appellate courts 
کے لیے یہ فیصلہ 
binding precedent 
ہوگا کہ ابتدائی تعلق ثابت کیے بغیر
 eviction petitions
 ناقابلِ سماعت ہیں۔

وکلاء کو
 tenancy establish 
کرنے کے لیے 
documentary + oral evidence
 پہلے مرحلے پر ہیtenancy
بنانا ہو گا 

نتیجاً مختصراً ۔۔۔۔۔۔
سپریم کورٹ نے درست طور پر lower courts کے فیصلے کو برقرار رکھا اور یہ واضح کر دیا کہ جب تک landlord–tenant 
تعلق کے ثبوت موجود نہ ہوں،
 Rent Controller 
کو
 eviction proceedings entertain 
کرنے کا کوئی دائرہ اختیار حاصل نہیں۔

درخواست گزار کے وکیل نے دلائل دیتے ہوئے کہا کہ تمام ماتحت عدالتیں اس پہلو کو سمجھنے میں ناکام رہیں کہ ابتدا میں استغاثہ کا مقدمہ نامعلوم افراد کے خلاف تھا، اور درخواست گزار کو بعد ازاں ایک ضمنی بیان کے ذریعے ملوث کیا گیا، جو بذاتِ خود مزید تفتیش/تحقیق (Further Inquiry) کا کیس بناتا ہے۔ درحقیقت، شکایت کنندہ نے اس ضمنی بیان میں کسی ماخذ (Source) کا ذکر تک نہیں کیا۔

عدالت نے فریقین کے دلائل سنے۔ یہ تسلیم شدہ حقیقت ہے کہ 31.08.2024 کو درج کی گئی ایف آئی آر میں کسی شخص کا نام شامل نہیں تھا، مگر دس دن بعد پولیس نے شکایت کنندہ کا ضمنی بیان قلمبند کیا، جس میں پہلی مرتبہ موجودہ درخواست گزار کو مبینہ طور پر کسی "قابلِ بھروسہ ذریعے" سے ملی اطلاع کی بنیاد پر ملوث کیا گیا۔ تاہم اس "ذریعۂ اطلاع" کا نام نہ تو ضمنی بیان میں ظاہر کیا گیا اور نہ ہی پولیس کے سامنے پیش کیا گیا۔

ہمارے نزدیک یہ کیس مزید تفتیش کا متقاضی ہے اور جب تک ٹرائل مکمل نہ ہو، موجودہ درخواست گزار کی مجرمانہ ذمہ داری ثابت نہیں ہو سکتی۔ صرف یہ بیان کہ "درخواست گزار دیگر مشابہہ مقدمات میں بھی ملوث ہے"، استغاثہ یا اے پی جی کی جانب سے قابلِ اعتبار نہیں، کیونکہ اس بارے میں نہ تو تحقیقاتی افسر اور نہ ہی اے پی جی کی جانب سے کوئی ٹھوس مواد عدالت کے سامنے پیش کیا گیا۔

اصطلاح "مزید تفتیش" (Further Inquiry) کا تصور دراصل مقدمے کے نتیجے سے کسی نہ کسی تعلق کا متقاضی ہوتا ہے اور اس میں وہ عارضی جائزہ شامل ہے جو کسی ملزم کے ملوث ہونے پر شک یا شبہ پیدا کرتا ہو۔ دوسری طرف "معقول بنیادیں" (Reasonable Grounds) ایسے دلائل و ثبوت کو کہا جاتا ہے جو قانونی طور پر درست ہوں، شہادت میں قابلِ قبول ہوں، اور ایک معقول عدالتی ذہن کو اپیل کریں — نہ کہ وہم، قیاس یا خودساختہ مفروضات پر مبنی ہوں۔

استغاثہ پر لازم ہے کہ وہ ایسے کافی مواد و شواہد پیش کرے جو یہ ظاہر کریں کہ ملزم نے ایسا جرم کیا ہے جو ضابطہ فوجداری 1898 کی دفعہ 497 کے "ممنوعہ حصے" (Prohibitory Clause) میں آتا ہے۔ جبکہ ملزم کو ضمانت کے لیے یہ دکھانا ہوتا ہے کہ استغاثہ کے پیش کردہ مواد یا دفاع میں اس کے مؤقف سے ایسے شکوک و شبہات پیدا ہوتے ہیں جو استغاثہ کے کیس کو کمزور کر دیں، اور اس بنیاد پر ملزم ضمانت کا حق دار ہے۔

بنیادی تصور یہی ہے کہ ملزم کو اپنے خلاف فوجداری مقدمے کا سامنا کرنے کا موقع ملے، بجائے اس کے کہ وہ محض جیل میں سڑتا رہے۔ یہ اصول کہ "ضمانت قاعدہ ہے اور جیل استثنا" عدالت عظمیٰ کی بارہا کی گئی تشریحات و فیصلوں سے پوری طرح تسلیم شدہ ہے۔

---

قابل زکر نکات 

1. صرف اے پی جی کا یہ بیان کہ درخواست گزار دیگر مقدمات میں بھی ملوث ہے، کسی ثبوت کے بغیر قابلِ اعتبار نہیں۔

2. "مزید تفتیش" کا سوال مقدمے کے نتیجے سے براہِ راست تعلق رکھتا ہے، جبکہ "معقول بنیادیں" ایسے دلائل ہیں جو قانونی طور پر درست، شہادت میں قابلِ قبول اور عدالتی ذہن کو اپیل کرنے والے ہوں۔

قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 

کیس: Bail After Arrest
Crl.P.L.A.745/2025, Abid v. The State
فیصلہ: جسٹس محمد علی مظہر

---

1. ابتدائی صورتحال (FIR اور ضمنی بیان کا مسئلہ)

ایف آئی آر (31.08.2024) نامعلوم افراد کے خلاف درج ہوئی۔

10 دن بعد شکایت کنندہ نے پولیس کے سامنے ضمنی بیان (Supplementary Statement) دیا جس میں پہلی بار درخواست گزار کو ملوث کیا۔

کسی "قابلِ بھروسہ ذریعے" (Reliable Source) کا حوالہ دیا گیا لیکن نہ نام ظاہر کیا گیا نہ کوئی شواہد فراہم کیے گئے۔

قانونی اہمیت:

ایف آئی آر میں نام نہ ہونا اور بعد ازاں محض ایک مبہم بیان کے ذریعے ملزم کو شامل کرنا مزید تفتیش (Further Inquiry) کا کیس بنتا ہے (Section 497(2) Cr.P.C.)۔

سپریم کورٹ اور ہائی کورٹ کے متعدد فیصلوں کے مطابق، ایسی صورتحال میں ملزم ضمانت کا حقدار ہوتا ہے۔

---

2. مزید تفتیش
 (Further Inquiry) 
بمقابلہ معقول بنیادیں
 (Reasonable Grounds)

مزید تفتیش
 (Further Inquiry)

ایسا مرحلہ جہاں مقدمے کے مواد سے ملزم کی ملوثیت پر شک یا شبہ پیدا ہو۔

ٹرائل
 مکمل ہونے تک اس کے ملوث ہونے کی حتمی حیثیت ثابت نہیں کی جاسکتی۔

معقول بنیادیں 
(Reasonable Grounds):

ایسی وجوہات جو قانونی طور پر درست ہوں۔

شہادت میں قابلِ قبول ہوں۔

ایک معقول عدالتی ذہن کو اپیل کریں، نہ کہ وہم، قیاس یا خودساختہ مفروضے ہوں۔

---

3. دیگر مقدمات میں ملوث ہونے کا دعویٰ

اے پی جی نے کہا کہ ملزم دیگر مشابہہ مقدمات میں بھی ملوث ہے۔

مگر عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ اس دعویٰ کی کوئی دستاویزی یا شہادت پیش نہیں کی گئی۔

صرف زبانی دعویٰ ضمانت روکنے کے لیے کافی نہیں۔

قانونی اصول:

"ہر مقدمہ اپنی بنیاد پر طے کیا جاتا ہے" 
(Case to Case Basis)۔

سابقہ یا دیگر الزامات کے ثبوت کے بغیر محض رائے یا افواہ ضمانت کے حق کو متاثر نہیں کر سکتی۔

---

4. ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 497 Cr.P.C.

Prohibitory Clause: 
ایسے مقدمات جہاں سزا موت، عمر قید یا دس سال سے زیادہ ہو۔

استغاثہ پر لازم ہے کہ وہ "معقول بنیادیں"
 (Reasonable Grounds) 
ثابت کرے۔

Non-Prohibitory Clause: 
جہاں سزا کم ہو، وہاں عام اصول یہی ہے کہ ضمانت دے دی جائے، سوائے استثنائی حالات میں۔

Section 497(2) Cr.P.C.:
 اگر کیس مزید تفتیش کا متقاضی ہو تو ضمانت دینا لازمی ہے۔

---

5. عدالت کا مشاہدہ:
 Bail is Rule, Jail is Exception

عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ:

ضمانت قاعدہ ہے۔

جیل صرف استثنائی حالات میں۔

اس اصول کو عدالت عظمیٰ نے بارہا اپنے فیصلوں میں تسلیم کیا ہے
 (مثلاً: PLD 2001 SC 147, PLD 2020 SC 456 وغیرہ)۔

---

6. بنیادی فلسفہ

ملزم کو مقدمے کا سامنا کرنے کا حق دیا جائے۔

جب تک جرم ثابت نہ ہو، اسے محض قید میں رکھنا انصاف کے بنیادی اصولوں کے خلاف ہے۔

فوجداری انصاف کا مقصد ملزم کو ٹرائل کے ذریعے سزا دلوانا ہے، نہ کہ بلاوجہ جیل میں سڑنے دینا۔

---
نتیجاً مختصراً ۔۔۔۔

1. درخواست گزار کا کیس مزید تفتیش کے زمرے میں آتا ہے (S.497(2) Cr.P.C.)۔

2. صرف ضمنی بیان اور نامعلوم ماخذ پر انحصار کرنا قابلِ اعتماد شہادت نہیں۔

3. اے پی جی کا دیگر مقدمات میں ملوث ہونے کا دعویٰ بغیر ثبوت کے ناقابلِ قبول ہے۔

4. عدالت نے اصول واضح کیا کہ بنیادی قاعدہ ضمانت ہے، قید استثنا ہے۔

5. استغاثہ کی ناکامی کہ وہ "معقول بنیادیں" پیش کرے، ملزم کو ضمانت کے حق دار بناتی ہے۔

---

 اہم حوالہ جاتی نکات 
(Bail Principles)

"Further Inquiry" شک و شبہ۔۔ ضمانت دینا لازمی۔

"Reasonable Grounds" = مضبوط، قانونی اور شہادت پر مبنی دلائل ۔۔۔۔ ضمانت روکنے کے لیے ضروری۔

صرف افواہ، قیاس یا زبانی دعویٰ ضمانت روکنے کے لیے کافی نہیں۔

ضمانت قاعدہ ہے، جیل استثنا ہے۔

پری اریسٹ بیل سپریم کورٹ 

Rent/Default in Payment of Rent C.P.L.A.5516/2024 Mst. Shaista Hussain v. Farzana Naheed and others Mr. Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb 
11-09-2025
 19-09-2025

(Crl. P. No. 39-K/2025)
رقم روپے 30,00,000/- اور دیگر تین چیکس رقم روپے 15,00,000/- کے جو ملزم نے بطور ادائیگی واجب الادا فیس ادا کرنے کے لیے جاری کیے تھے، جو کہ پیشہ ورانہ فیس (professional fees) کے بقایاجات کو پورا کرنے کے لیے تھے۔

ہمارے سامنے سوال یہ ہے کہ آیا کوئی وکیل اپنے مؤکل کے خلاف واجب الادا پیشہ ورانہ فیس کی عدم ادائیگی پر فوجداری کارروائی (criminal proceedings) شروع کر سکتا ہے یا نہیں، خصوصاً تعزیراتِ پاکستان کی دفعہ 489-F کے تناظر میں۔ اس سوال کا جواب دیتے وقت عدالت کو وکیل اور مؤکل کے تعلق کی حرمت، باہمی اعتماد و راز داری کے اصول، اور وہ قانونی نتائج مدنظر رکھنے ہوں گے جو مؤکل کی جانب سے فیس کی عدم ادائیگی سے پیدا ہوتے ہیں۔

یہ بھی قابل ذکر ہے کہ درخواست گزار کے وکیل نے 7 نومبر 2024 کے فیصلے (آئینی درخواست نمبر D-2230/2024، سندھ ہائیکورٹ) کی کاپی جمع کروائی، جس میں وکلاء کی جانب سے اپنے مؤکلین کے خلاف درج مقدمات کی تفصیل بیان کی گئی ہے۔ یہ ایک اہم معاملہ ہے جس پر فوری توجہ درکار ہے۔ ہائیکورٹ میں پیش کردہ AIGP لیگل رپورٹ درج ذیل ہے:

رپورٹ: وکلاء/ایڈووکیٹس کی جانب سے درج کرائی گئی ایف آئی آرز
(الف) اپنے مؤکلین کے خلاف، (ب) تیسرے فریق کے خلاف، (ج) پولیس اہلکاروں کے خلاف – مدت: 01.01.2024 سے 31.10.2024 تک

(یہی جدول ترجمہ: مشرقی ضلع میں 3 ایف آئی آرز مؤکلین کے خلاف، 73 تیسرے فریق کے خلاف، 1 پولیس اہلکار کے خلاف، کل 77۔ … وغیرہ۔

)
قانونی پیشہ کے یہ ضابطے پیشہ ورانہ دیانت، رازداری اور اقدار کے اعلیٰ معیار کو بھی لازم قرار دیتے ہیں۔ پاکستان لیگل پریکٹیشنرز اینڈ بار کونسلز رولز 1976 کا قاعدہ 155 یوں ہے:

قاعدہ 155: فیس کے معاملے میں مؤکل کے ساتھ تنازع سے حتی الامکان بچنا چاہیے، بشرطیکہ یہ وکیل کی عزتِ نفس اور معقول معاوضہ لینے کے حق کے منافی نہ ہو۔ مؤکل کے خلاف مقدمہ صرف ناانصافی، دھوکہ دہی یا جبر کو روکنے کے لیے ہونا چاہیے۔

اسی طرح امریکن بار ایسوسی ایشن ماڈل کوڈ آف پروفیشنل ریسپانسبلٹی کہتا ہے:

EC 2-23: وکیل کو مؤکل کے ساتھ فیس کے تنازع سے بچنے کی ہر ممکن کوشش کرنی چاہیے اور ایسے اختلافات کو خوش اسلوبی سے حل کرنا چاہیے۔ اسے صرف اس وقت مؤکل پر مقدمہ کرنا چاہیے جب دھوکہ دہی یا جبر کو روکنے کے لیے ناگزیر ہو۔

اسی طرح قانون شہادت آرڈر 1984 کا آرٹیکل 9 یوں ہے:

آرٹیکل 9: پیشہ ورانہ ابلاغ (Professional communications): کوئی وکیل مؤکل کی رضامندی کے بغیر اپنے مؤکل کی طرف سے دورانِ پیشہ ورانہ ملازمت دی گئی معلومات ظاہر نہیں کرے گا، نہ ہی کسی دستاویز کے مندرجات یا مشورہ بیان کرے گا۔ البتہ مندرجہ ذیل استثنیٰ حاصل ہوگا:

وہ معلومات جو کسی غیرقانونی مقصد کے لیے دی گئی ہو۔

وہ حقائق جو وکیل نے دورانِ ملازمت کسی جرم یا دھوکہ دہی کے ارتکاب سے متعلق دیکھے ہوں۔

وکیل اور مؤکل کا رشتہ امانت و اعتماد (fiduciary) کی بنیاد پر ہے۔ کسی بھی طرح وکیل کو مجبور کر کے اپنے مؤکل کی رازدارانہ معلومات ظاہر کروانا یا عدم ادائیگی فیس پر اس کے خلاف فوجداری کارروائی شروع کروانا انصاف اور منصفانہ اصولوں کے منافی ہے۔ عمومی طور پر وکیل مؤکل کے خلاف فیس کی عدم ادائیگی پر فوجداری کارروائی شروع نہیں کر سکتا، کیونکہ یہ تنازعات سول نوعیت کے ہیں۔ ان کا حل صرف دیوانی چارہ جوئی یا ثالثی (dispute resolution) کے ذریعے ممکن ہے۔

اخلاقی خلاف ورزیوں، مفادات کے ٹکراؤ یا ساکھ کو نقصان سے بچنے کے لیے وکیل کو احتیاط برتنی چاہیے۔ عمل کا غلط استعمال (abuse of process) وہ ہے جب کریمنل کارروائی یا اس کی دھمکی صرف فیس کی وصولی کے لیے استعمال ہو۔ وکیل عدم ادائیگی پر معقول اطلاع دے کر وکالت سے دستبردار ہو سکتا ہے، لیکن وہ مؤکل پر دباؤ ڈالنے کے لیے فوجداری کارروائی کا سہارا نہیں لے سکتا۔

موجودہ مقدمے میں اگر مؤکل نے مکمل فیس ادا نہیں کی تو یہ رقم دیوانی چارہ جوئی کے ذریعے وصول کی جا سکتی ہے۔ اپنے ہی مؤکل کے خلاف فوجداری مقدمہ صرف اس وقت ہو سکتا ہے جب کوئی دوسرا راستہ باقی نہ ہو۔ محض فیس کی عدم ادائیگی تعزیری نتائج پیدا نہیں کرتی۔ تعزیراتی ذمہ داری کے لیے ’’بدنیتی‘‘ (dishonest intent) ثابت ہونا ضروری ہے۔

جعلی یا بدنیتی پر مبنی چیک جاری کرنا دفعہ 489-F تعزیراتِ پاکستان کے تحت تین سال قید تک کی سزا رکھتا ہے، لیکن عدالتیں ہمیشہ اس جرم کو سخت جانچ کے بعد ہی ثابت کرتی ہیں۔ متبادل دیوانی چارہ جوئی دستیاب ہے، جیسے کہ معاہدے کی خلاف ورزی پر نقصانات کا دعویٰ (سیکشن 73، کنٹریکٹ ایکٹ 1872) یا دیوانی مقدمہ برائے ریکوری (سول پروسیجر کوڈ 1908 کے تحت)۔

489-F پی پی سی کا مقصد دھوکہ دہی سے بچاؤ ہے، نہ کہ محض دیوانی ریکوری کو فوجداری لبادہ پہنانا۔ بدنیتی ثابت ہونا لازم ہے، ورنہ فوجداری مقدمہ نہیں بنے گا۔ (2023 SCMR 1948 اور 2013 SCMR 51 پر انحصار کیا گیا)۔

آخر میں یہ نوٹ کرنا ضروری ہے کہ ایک تشویشناک رجحان ابھر رہا ہے کہ بعض وکلاء فوجداری کارروائی کو دباؤ ڈالنے کا ہتھیار سمجھنے لگے ہیں، بجائے اس کے کہ اسے انصاف کا ذریعہ بنایا جائے۔ وکیل نہ صرف اپنے مؤکل کا نمائندہ ہوتا ہے بلکہ عدالت کا افسر اور عوامی مفاد کا خادم بھی ہوتا ہے۔ یہ دوہرا کردار اس بات کا متقاضی ہے کہ مؤکل کے حقوق کے تحفظ اور عدلیہ کے وقار میں توازن قائم رکھا جائے۔ افسوس کہ حالیہ عمل سے یہ توازن بعض اوقات بگڑتا دکھائی دیتا ہے۔
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ
1. بنیادی سوال

عدالت کے سامنے یہ سوال ہے کہ آیا وکیل اپنے مؤکل کے خلاف صرف فیس کی عدم ادائیگی پر تعزیراتِ پاکستان کی دفعہ 489-F PPC کے تحت فوجداری کارروائی شروع کر سکتا ہے یا نہیں۔

اہم نقطہ: فیس کی عدم ادائیگی بذاتِ خود فوجداری جرم نہیں ہے، بلکہ یہ دیوانی تنازعہ ہے۔

قانونی معیار: دفعہ 489-F صرف تب لاگو ہوگی جب چیک بدنیتی (dishonest intent) اور دھوکہ دہی کے مقصد کے ساتھ جاری کیا گیا ہو۔

2. وکیل اور مؤکل کا تعلق

وکیل اور مؤکل کے درمیان رشتہ اعتماد، امانت اور راز داری (fiduciary relationship)
 پر قائم ہے۔

پاکستان لیگل پریکٹیشنرز رولز 1976 (قاعدہ 155): فیس کے معاملات کو ممکنہ طور پر خوش اسلوبی سے حل کیا جائے، مقدمہ صرف ناانصافی یا دھوکہ دہی روکنے کے لیے ہو۔

ABA Model Code EC 2-23
 بھی یہی اصول واضح کرتا ہے۔
امریکن بار ایکٹ 

اس سے واضح ہوتا ہے کہ قانون اور اخلاقیات دونوں وکیل کو پابند کرتے ہیں کہ وہ مؤکل کے ساتھ فیس کا تنازعہ عدالت سے باہر یا دیوانی کارروائی کے ذریعے حل کرے، نہ کہ فوجداری دباؤ کے ذریعے۔

3. قانون شہادت اور راز داری

آرٹیکل 9، قانون شہادت آرڈر 1984 کے تحت وکیل مؤکل کی معلومات اور ابلاغ ظاہر نہیں کر سکتا۔

اگر وکیل مؤکل کے خلاف فوجداری کارروائی کرے تو اس میں مؤکل کی خفیہ معلومات اور اعتماد کی خلاف ورزی کا خطرہ ہے، جو قانونی و اخلاقی طور پر درست نہیں۔

4. دفعہ 489-F PPC
 کی نوعیت

دفعہ 489-F 
کا مقصد دھوکہ دہی (cheating) اور بدنیتی سے دیے گئے چیک کے ذریعے نقصان سے بچانا ہے۔

اگر صرف فیس کی عدم ادائیگی ہو اور بدنیتی ثابت نہ کی جا سکے تو 489-F لاگو نہیں ہوگا۔

سابقہ عدالتی نظائر:

2023 SCMR 1948: بدنیتی ثابت نہ ہو تو مقدمہ خارج ہوگا۔

2013 SCMR 51: ہر دیوانی تنازع کو فوجداری جامہ پہنانا عدالت کے نزدیک غلط ہے۔

5. متبادل قانونی چارہ جوئی

اگر مؤکل فیس ادا نہ کرے تو وکیل کے پاس یہ آپشن موجود ہیں:

سول مقدمہ برائے ریکوری (CPC کے تحت)۔

کنٹریکٹ ایکٹ 1872 سیکشن 73 کے تحت ہرجانہ برائے breach of contract۔

ثالثی یا بار کونسل کے ذریعے dispute resolution۔

6. اصولی نتیجہ

فوجداری کارروائی کا سہارا لینا abuse of process ہے اگر مقصد صرف فیس کی وصولی ہو۔

وکیل اپنی فیس کے تنازع پر مؤکل کے خلاف 489-F PPC کے تحت مقدمہ درج نہیں کرا سکتا، جب تک بدنیتی یا دھوکہ دہی کے واضح شواہد نہ ہوں۔

عدالت نے درست نشاندہی کی کہ یہ رجحان خطرناک ہے کہ وکلاء فوجداری کارروائی کو دباؤ ڈالنے کے لیے استعمال کریں، حالانکہ ان کا بنیادی کردار عدالت کے افسر اور انصاف کی فراہمی میں معاونت ہے۔

نتیجاً مختصراً 

فیس کی عدم ادائیگی = سول تنازعہ
 (civil dispute)

فوجداری کارروائی صرف بدنیتی/دھوکہ دہی کی موجودگی میں

وکیل کو فوجداری کارروائی سے گریز کرنا چاہیے تاکہ اعتماد، رازداری اور عدالتی وقار محفوظ رہے۔

قانونی چارہ جوئی کا درست راستہ = سول عدالت یا بار کونسل/ثالثی۔

2025 P Cr. LJ 1202
2025 LHC 29
فیصلہ کا خلاصہ ۔۔۔۔
محبوس (Detenue)
 کو پولیس کی تحویل میں پایا گیا اور متعلقہ پولیس افسر نے بیان دیا کہ محبوس کو اس وجہ سے گرفتار کیا گیا کہ مدعی نے اپنے "ضمنی بیان" میں محبوس پر شبہ ظاہر کیا تھا اور وقوعہ کے دوران مبینہ طور پر چھینی گئی موٹر سائیکل بھی محبوس سے برآمد کی گئی ہے۔
بیلف نے رپورٹ دی کہ محبوس کو عدالت میں بروقت پیش نہیں کیا گیا۔
پولیس محبوس کو عدالت میں بغیر تاخیر پیش کرنے میں ناکام رہی۔
موٹر سائیکل کی برآمدگی مشکوک قرار دی گئی کیونکہ اس کا مناسب ریکارڈ نہیں رکھا گیا اور نہ ہی قانونی طریقہ کار اختیار کیا گیا۔
مزید یہ کہ محبوس کو ایک ضمنی بیان کے ذریعے ملوث کیا گیا مگر اس ضمنی بیان کو حبسِ بے جا کی کارروائی کے دوران تصدیق کے لیے پیش نہیں کیا گیا۔

ہائی کورٹ ایسے حالات میں بااختیار ہے کہ ایک قسم کی کارروائی کو دوسری قسم کی کارروائی میں تبدیل کرسکے، جس میں حبسِ بے جا کی درخواست کو ضمانت کی درخواست میں تبدیل کرنے کا اختیار بھی شامل ہے۔
جہاں عدالت اس نتیجے پر پہنچے کہ کسی شخص کی حراست جواز طلب ہے یا یہ حراست غیر قانونی اور بلااختیار ہے یا محض شبہ کی بنیاد پر عمل میں لائی گئی ہے۔

چنانچہ، حبسِ بے جا کو ضمانت کی درخواست میں تبدیل کیا گیا اور محبوس کو ضمانت پر رہا کرنے کا حکم دیا گیا تاکہ وہ مناسب عدالت سے اپنی ضمانت کی توثیق کرواسکے۔
اس طرح حبسِ بے جا کی درخواست نمٹا دی گئی۔

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*

قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ
1. حبسِ بے جا (Habeas Corpus) 
کا دائرہ کار
آئینِ پاکستان کا آرٹیکل 199(1)(b)(i) 
کسی شہری کو غیر قانونی حراست یا نظربندی سے تحفظ فراہم کرتا ہے۔

جب کوئی شخص بغیر عدالتی اختیار کے، یا محض شبہ کی بنیاد پر گرفتار ہو تو عدالت اس کی رہائی کے لیے حبسِ بے جا کی درخواست سن سکتی ہے۔

2. حبسِ بے جا کو ضمانت کی درخواست میں تبدیل کرنے کا اختیار
یہ فیصلہ اس اصول کو واضح کرتا ہے کہ ہائی کورٹ کے پاس یہ باقاعدہ اختیار ہے کہ وہ حبسِ بے جا کو ضمانت کی درخواست میں تبدیل کرسکتی ہے۔

خاص طور پر جب عدالت دیکھے کہ حراست غیر قانونی، بلاجواز یا محض شبہ کی بنیاد پر عمل میں لائی گئی ہے۔

اس طرح عدالت نہ صرف غیر قانونی حراست ختم کرسکتی ہے بلکہ ملزم کو ضمانت پر بھی رہا کر سکتی ہے تاکہ وہ باقاعدہ فوجداری عدالت میں اپنی ضمانت کی توثیق کروائے۔

3. پولیس کی کوتاہیاں اور قانونی اصول
پولیس نے محبوس کو بروقت عدالت کے روبرو پیش نہیں کیا، جو کہ بنیادی آئینی حق کی خلاف ورزی ہے (آئین آرٹیکل 10 اور CrPC سیکشن 61 کے تحت ہر ملزم کو 24 گھنٹے میں عدالت میں پیش کرنا لازم ہے)۔

برآمد شدہ موٹر سائیکل کا ریکارڈ اور قانونی طریقہ کار پورا نہ کرنا اس بات کو ظاہر کرتا ہے کہ پولیس کی کارروائی شفاف اور قانونی تقاضوں کے مطابق نہیں تھی۔

ضمنی بیان (Supplementary Statement) جس کی بنیاد پر محبوس کو ملوث کیا گیا، عدالت کے سامنے تصدیق کے لیے پیش نہیں کیا گیا، اس لیے یہ گرفتاری غیر مضبوط شواہد پر مبنی قرار پائی۔

4. ضابطہ فوجداری (CrPC) سیکشن 497 کا اطلاق
ضمانت کے اصول کے مطابق، جب شواہد ابتدائی مرحلے پر کمزور یا مشکوک ہوں تو ملزم کو ضمانت دینا انصاف کے تقاضوں کے مطابق ہے۔

عدالت نے یہی اصول اپنایا اور یہ طے کیا کہ جب محض شبہ کی بنیاد پر حراست رکھی گئی ہے تو ایسی گرفتاری پر حبسِ بے جا کو ضمانت میں تبدیل کیا جاسکتا ہے۔

5. فیصلے کے قانونی اثرات
اس فیصلے سے یہ نظیر 
(precedent)
 قائم ہوئی کہ آئینی عدالتیں (ہائی کورٹس) فوجداری عدلیہ کے دائرہ کار کو تقویت دینے کے لیے اپنی آئینی اختیارات استعمال کر سکتی ہیں۔

پولیس کی جانب سے محض شبہ پر گرفتاری اور بروقت عدالتی پیشی نہ کرنا آئندہ بھی عدالتوں میں ناجائز حراست کے زمرے میں آئے گا۔

یہ فیصلہ شہری آزادیوں 
(Fundamental Rights)
 اور فوجداری انصاف کے نظام میں توازن قائم کرنے کی ایک بڑی مثال ہے۔

6. بین الاقوامی تناظر
دنیا بھر میں "حبسِ بے جا" کو بنیادی انسانی حق سمجھا جاتا ہے 
(Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 9)۔

پاکستانی ہائی کورٹ نے اسی بین الاقوامی اصول کو اپنے آئینی فریم ورک کے اندر نافذ کیا ہے تاکہ شہری کو پولیس کے استبداد سے بچایا جا سکے۔

نتیجاً ۔۔مختصراً ۔۔
یہ فیصلہ اس بات کو واضح کرتا ہے کہ

اگر پولیس بغیر قانونی تقاضے پورے کیے کسی شخص کو گرفتار کرے تو یہ حبسِ بے جا ہے۔

عدالت ایسے کیس میں محض رہائی کا حکم دینے پر اکتفا نہیں کرے گی بلکہ اس کے پاس اختیار ہے کہ معاملے کو ضمانت کی درخواست میں بدل کر فوری ریلیف فراہم کرے۔

یہ آئینی عدالت کے کردار کو مزید مضبوط کرتا ہے تاکہ شہریوں کے بنیادی حقوق محفوظ رہیں اور پولیس کی من مانی پر قدغن لگے۔

سپریم کورٹ کا آج مورخہ 22 ستمبر 2025 کا نہایت معلوماتی اور رہنما فیصلہ

We are constrained to record our observations regarding the systemic phenomenon of refusal or delay relating to registration of a criminal case or FIR in accordance with the statutory duty imposed upon an in charge of a police station under section 154 of Cr.P.C. This phenomenon appears to be widespread because it has been persistently observed in most of the criminal cases. The case before us is a classic case, highlighting dereliction of duty by the in charge of police station and lack of accountability. It has been observed that this phenomenon is generally prevalent in cases relating to vulnerable and marginalised classes. The registration of a criminal case under section 154 of the Cr.P.C is exclusively an executive function and violation of the statutory duty imposed there under has profound consequences for the parties involved in a criminal case. A functional and effective criminal justice system is premised on the foundation of fairness, integrity and impartiality of registration of information regarding the commission of a cognizable offence, generally termed as FIR, under section 154 of the Cr.P.C and the pursuing investigation. These two executive functions are so crucial that they ultimately determine whether justice would be served. Whether the actual perpetrator of a crime will be held accountable, or rather making an innocent person to suffer the unimaginable agony of carrying the stigma of being an accused, essentially depends on the prompt registration of a criminal case followed by fair, honest, impartial and professional investigation. The bed rock of constitutional governance and rule of law is profoundly undermined when there is dereliction of the two aforementioned statutory duties vested exclusively in the Executive branch of the State. It is an onerous duty of the State and its functionaries to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens by protecting them from being victims of crime and if a crime takes place, then to hold the perpetrator accountable. Many factors could be involved in the inability or failure on part of an in charge of police station in refusing or delaying the registration of a criminal case regarding a cognisable offence. It may be an attempt to avoid adding further burden to the workload, concealing the deterioration of law and order, the inability to prevent crime, corruption or abuse of the statutory powers for the benefit or at the instance of politically and socially influential persons or classes of the area. No reason whatsoever can justify dereliction of the mandatory statutory duty imposed on the in charge of police under section 154 of the Cr.P.C. The violation of this duty has profound consequences for the citizens and their fundamental rights besides eroding the public trust of the people in the criminal justice system. A citizen would be justified in perceiving that the criminal justice system merely serves the interests of the privileged and those who wield political and social power. The phenomenon also gives rise to the perception that the registration of a criminal case is subject to seeking permission from the superior officials or the politically or socially powerful persons of the area. If so, then it erodes rule of law and amounts to grave violation of a mandatory statutory duty. It is an onerous task of each provincial government to dispel such perception by ensuring that in each case there is no dereliction of the statutory duty imposed under section 154 of the Cr.P.C and, in case of violation, to take such appropriate action which creates deterrence for the future. It is noted that Article 4 of the Constitution declares and guarantees that to enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law is the inalienable right of every citizen where ever he or she may be and every other person for the time being within Pakistan. A dysfunctional criminal justice system for citizens who are not privileged or powerful manifests lack of constitutional governance. The onus is on the respective governments to establish that every citizen is dealt with in accordance with the obligation enshrined under Article 4 of the Constitution. The respective provincial governments are, therefore, expected to take effective measures to ensure that the statutory duties imposed under section 154 of the Cr.P.C followed by fair, impartial and professional investigation in each case are carried out strictly in accordance with law and without fear or favour.  


 It is settled law that a crime report or information entered in the prescribed book for the purpose of section 154 of the Cr.P.C. is not a substantive piece of evidence. Nonetheless, delay in the registration of an FIR may give the complainant and the police officials an opportunity to falsely nominate an accused or manipulate the evidence as a result of consultation and deliberations. The registration of a criminal case is the first step to put the proceedings in motion and to enable the in charge of a police station to secure the crime scene and collect the evidence before it is manipulated or loses its evidentiary value. The registration of a criminal case without delay has significance for the complainant as well as an accused. (naeem)The delay raises the probability of false implication of an accused and to manage the evidence to bring it in line with the prosecution’s story. The promptness eliminates the chances of such prior consultation and deliberation and raises a presumption of credibility and bona fides. It is noted that, under the scheme of the Cr.P.C, the entry of information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence other than in the manner prescribed under section 154 ibid is not contemplated. The entry made in a daily or station diary in such an eventuality is a dereliction of the mandatory statutory duty imposed under section 154 of the Cr.P.C. This Court has consistently held that an officer in charge of a police station has no authority, nor does any such authority vest with any other person, to refuse to register an information under section 154 when it discloses the commission of a cognizable offence. The officer in charge of a police station is also not vested with authority to embark upon an inquiry regarding the correctness or otherwise of the information which has been given for the purposes of registration of a case under section 154 of the Cr.P.C. It has been held by this Court that any investigation or inquiry in the nature of determining the correctness or otherwise of the information prior to registration of the FIR will be hit by the provisions of section 162 of the Cr.P.C. It is a statutory duty of the in charge of a police station to carry out investigation after a case has been registered under section 154 of the Cr.P.C, except in those eventualities which have been explicitly provided therein.

The principles and law regarding the testimony of a witness who falls in this category have been recently highlighted by this Court and the same is reiterated. "The persons who are competent to appear in the witness box as witnesses fall in various categories and one of them is a 'chance witness'. A chance witness, in legal terms, is a witness who claims that he or she was present at the crime scene at the fateful time and that his presence there was by sheer chance while in the ordinary course of business, place of residence and in the normal course of events he or she was not supposed to be present at the scene. It has been observed by this Court that ordinarily the evidence of such a witness is not accepted unless justifiable reasons were shown to establish his/her presence at the crime scene at the relevant time. In the normal course, the presumption that would operate would be that such witness was absent from the crime scene. However, in rare cases, the evidence of a chance witness may be relied upon, provided some convincing explanation appealing to a prudent mind of his presence at the crime scene has been put forth, otherwise the evidence would be seen as suspicious evidence and, therefore, it would not be safe to be relied upon. The admissibility and evidentiary value of the testimony of a witness who falls in the category of a chance witness essentially depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and no hard and fast rule can be laid down in this regard. The crime scene could be a dwelling house, a place of business or a public road or highway. A brother who was living at a distance of twenty miles and was visiting his sister was considered as a reliable witness in the facts and circumstances of that particular case because he had offered a plausible explanation for his presence. The testimony of a visiting son-in-law was not considered reliable because his explanation was not found to be convincing. Residents of the same vicinity are ordinarily not considered as chance witnesses but the eye witnesses in a case were considered as chance witnesses because they were inmates of other houses in the vicinity and not the house where the occurrence had taken place late at night. A witness lived nine kilometres from the place of occurrence and he claimed to have been present at the crime scene on a working day without giving a plausible explanation and, in the facts and circumstances of that case, the Court observed that his statement warranted careful and cautious scrutiny. If the offence takes place in a public place, e.g a thoroughfare, then generally the presence of a passerby cannot be out rightly rejected by declaring him or her as a chance witness, unless the latter cannot give a plausible and convincing explanation for being present at the crime scene at the relevant time. The presence of disciples at the crime scene who were visiting a spiritual personality was not doubted because it was not something that was unusual. In case of conviction on a capital charge and when the evidence includes the testimony of a chance witness then the court ought to exercise utmost care and be on guard by seeking corroboration before placing reliance on such evidence. The testimony of a chance witness cannot be disbelieved merely because her or his presence at the relevant time and place was per chance. Any doubt that would reasonably suggest that the witness was not present at the relevant time at the crime scene would be sufficient to discard the deposition and it includes a witness who is a chance witness. The admissibility and evidentiary value of a witness falling in the category of a chance witness, therefore, depends on the explanation given by the witness regarding his or her presence and to what extent a court would find it plausible, convincing and the testimony of such a witness to be confidence inspiring. The testimony of a chance witness requires strong corroboration. The evidentiary value of a witness would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case."

Contradictions in the statement of Investigating Officer-Accused persons were charged for committing accused persons for gati-i-amd and sentenced them to imprisonment for murder of the son of complainant by firing---Trial Court convicted the Investigating Officer stated during cross-examination that in the FIR, a life---High Court maintained the conviction and sentence---Validity---bulb had been mentioned as the source of light and then corrected himself by stating that the light source was a torch---In the same breath, the Investigating Officer sought to explain the apparent contradiction by stating that there was no difference between the two---Investigating Officer then stated that there was a difference between a bulb and a torch but argued that the witnesses were illiterate and did not know the difference between the two---At the very outset, the Investigating Officer's explanation in regards the light source being mentioned as a bulb at one place and a torch at the other, was self-contradictory---Highlighting that contradiction further, eye-witness had mentioned a bulb as the light source, despite having earlier stated before the police that it was a torch---Evidenced by the fact that during cross-examination said witness denied that he mentioned a torch as the light source in his statement to the police but when the record was referred to, it was shown to be otherwise---Said facts constituted yet another doubt in regard the identification of the petitioners---

Murder of wife committed in the house of accused-Onus on accused/husband to explain circumstances leading to death---Accused was alleged to have committed murder of his wife---Trial Court convicted the accused and sentenced him to death---High Court converted the death sentence into imprisonment for life---Validity---Appellant also failed to give any plausible explanation regarding the murder of his wife in his house-In criminal cases, it is for the prosecution to establish its case against an accused, however, in the instant case deceased was a vulnerable dependent of the appellant, as such, some part of the onus had shifted to the appellant to explain the circumstances in which his wife had died an unnatural death in his house during the fateful night which part of the onus had not been discharged by the appellant---Undoubtedly, the accused was not required to take a special plea, but where the only alternative theory to his guilt was a remote possibility which, if correct, he was in a position to explain, the absence of any explanation must be considered in determining whether the possibility should be disregarded or taken into account. Appellant absconded and was arrested on 15.08.2010, i.e. after a period about 37 days of his wife's death---It was strange and astonishing that neither the appellant reported the matter to the police authorities nor participated in the last rites of the deceased---

Altaf Hussain Vs The State
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
[9/26/25, 8:16:22 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 302(C)
On a meticulous appraisal of the evidence on record, it is evident that the occurrence took place at the spur of the moment without any premeditation or prior enmity between the deceased and the petitioner/convict. It was the deceased who, accompanied by his brothers and cousin, approached the petitioner's shop and initiated a confrontation that escalated into physical grappling. In an instinctive reaction to the perceived threat to his person, the petitioner resorted to the use of a firearm. However, as the deceased was unarmed at the time of the occurrence, therefore, the act of firing a shot even if in self-defence exceeded the bounds of lawful self-defence as contemplated under the law. This Court has consistently held that in cases where the accused, while acting in self-defence or under sudden provocation, causes the death of a person, such circumstances may justify a conviction under Section 302(c) of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860. Yet there is another fact that if the deceased had not visited the shop of the petitioner/convict, the occurrence would not have taken place. The case in hand was surely a case of lack of premeditation, the incident was one of a sudden fight which was a result of heat of passion developed upon a sudden quarrel and no undue advantage had been taken by the petitioner/convict nor had he acted in brutal or unusual manner. In the circumstances Exception 4 contained in the erstwhile section 300 PPC squarely stood attracted to the case.
In view of the totality of circumstances discussed above including the absence of premeditation, the sudden and spontaneous nature of the occurrence, the fact that only a single shot was fired by the petitioner/convict, the unarmed status of the deceased, and the consistency between the ocular and medical evidence, we are persuaded to hold that the case of the petitioner squarely falls within the ambit of Section 302(c) of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860. Consequently, the instant jail petition is converted into an appeal and is partly allowed. The conviction of the petitioner/convict recorded under Section 302(b) PPC through the impugned judgment is hereby altered to one under Section 302(c) PPC. Accordingly, the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to the petitioner/convict is reduced to rigorous imprisonment for fourteen years. The direction for payment of compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased, as stipulated in the impugned judgment, along with the consequences of default thereof, shall remain intact and enforceable in accordance with law.

Whether such a witness can be declared hostile, once his cross-examination has been conducted by the opposite party?. 

The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order is also silent on this score, however, as per practice, the stage to declare the witness hostile, is during his examination- in-chief where it can be alleged that the witness is deviating from his previous statement or is suppressing the truth or is otherwise un-cooperative. In this respect, the superior court has settled the issue that if a witness in examination-in-chief makes a statement adverse to the interest of the party calling him as witness, the court can exercise the discretion under Article 150 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, however, once the cross-examination is recorded, there is no concept of declaring a witness as hostile

[9/29/25, 10:48:29 AM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: ٹاؤٹ ازم – غریب کی آواز دبانے کی سب سے بڑی سازش

ٹاؤٹ ازم کسی کا باپ بھی ختم نہیں کرسکتا، کیونکہ یہ اب ایک ناسور بن چکا ہے۔ کبھی پرانے وقتوں میں ایسا ہوتا تھا کہ گاؤں کا کوئی آدمی وکیل کو پرسنٹیج پر کیس دلواتا تو اسے ٹاؤٹ کہا جاتا تھا۔ لیکن وقت کے ساتھ یہ لفظ صرف گاؤں تک محدود نہیں رہا۔ اب یہ وبا کچہری کے گیٹ، گیلریوں اور عدالت کے ہر دروازے تک پھیل چکی ہے۔ بہت سے وکلاء نے اپنے لوگ بٹھا رکھے ہیں جو پولیس کے چالان اور مقدمے ڈھونڈ کر ان کو لا کر دیتے ہیں۔

یہاں تک کہ اب ٹاؤٹ ازم جیلوں، عدالتوں، اے سی ڈی سی کے دفاتر اور پولیس کے نظام تک جا پہنچا ہے۔ لیکن یہ بھی آخری حد نہیں تھی، سب سے خطرناک صورت یہ بنی کہ سیاسی جماعتوں نے بھی اپنے ٹاؤٹ پیدا کر لیے۔ یہ سیاسی ٹاؤٹ عام ٹاؤٹ سے کہیں زیادہ خطرناک ہیں، کیونکہ یہ صرف مقدمے ہی نہیں بیچتے بلکہ قوم کا مستقبل بیچتے ہیں۔ یہی وہ ٹاؤٹ ہیں جنہوں نے وکالت جیسے مقدس پیشے کو داغدار کر دیا اور وکلاء کو آپس میں بانٹ کر کمزور کر دیا۔

آج یہ صورتحال ہے کہ بڑا وکیل بننے کا خواب بھی انہی ٹاؤٹوں کے نیٹ ورک کے بغیر ممکن نہیں رہا۔ یہاں تک کہ بار کونسل اور بار ایسوسی ایشن کے الیکشن بھی ان کے سہارے کے بغیر جیتے نہیں جا سکتے۔ یوں لگتا ہے کہ ٹاؤٹ ازم اب باقاعدہ وکالت کا حصہ بن گیا ہے، اور اس کے بغیر کامیابی کا تصور بھی محال ہے۔

اصل ظلم یہ ہے کہ غریب کی آواز کو ہر جگہ دبایا جا رہا ہے۔ غریب جب انصاف مانگنے آتا ہے تو ٹاؤٹ اپنی مرضی سے کھیل کھیلتے ہیں اور اس کی فریاد کو دبا دیتے ہیں۔ ہم جیسے لوگ جو غریبوں کے ساتھ کھڑے ہیں، ان کی آواز بننے کی کوشش کرتے ہیں، انہیں بھی دبانے کی سازشیں کی جاتی ہیں۔ لیکن ہم یہ واضح کرتے ہیں کہ ہم وکلاء کے ساتھ ہیں، عدلیہ اور پولیس کا احترام کرتے ہیں، کیونکہ ہم اداروں کے خلاف نہیں بلکہ ان ناسوروں کے خلاف ہیں جنہوں نے اداروں کے نام کو بدنام کیا ہے۔

ہمارا اصول یہ ہے کہ جرم سے نفرت ہے مگر انسان سے محبت ہے۔ چاہے وہ مجرم ہی کیوں نہ ہو، ہم اسے بطور انسان برا نہیں کہتے، لیکن جرم کو ہم کبھی برداشت نہیں کرتے۔ یہی اصل انصاف ہے، اور یہی اصل انسانیت ہے۔

اسی لیے میں پورے یقین سے کہتا ہوں کہ ٹاؤٹ ازم کسی کا باپ بھی ختم نہیں کرسکتا۔ لیکن ہم ’’غریب کی آواز‘‘ ہیں، اور ہماری یہ آواز کبھی دبائی نہیں جا سکتی۔ ہم ہر حال میں سچ کہیں گے، اور غریب کے ساتھ کھڑے رہیں گے۔

[9/30/25, 11:45:42 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Approach of court while conducting criminal trial must be inquisitorial for searching of truth and if memos of recoveries of articles taken into possession from the place of occurrence by the police do not reflect the name of accused, rather said column is left blank, then it is sufficient to entertain reasonable doubt that that name of the accused was yet not finalized. --------------

 If inquest report is prepared in the case does not contain details of the occurrence (which details have been claimed as have come on the surface), then it leads to irresistible conclusion that the prosecution story was still not finalized and ante-time has been shown in the record regarding registration of the case. --------------

If it is the case of the prosecution that case property was re-deposited in the Malkhana, then entry in said regard must have been made, in case of omission in said record, it would raise question mark on the recovery as well as safe custody of the case property.

[9/30/25, 11:45:42 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 15 سالہ لڑکی کا نکاح درست : 
لاہور ہائیکورٹ نے والد کی بازیابی کی درخواست خارج کر دی-
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
درخواست گزار نے بیٹی (زینب، عمر تقریباً 15 سال 8 ماہ) کی بازیابی غیر قانونی حراست سے مانگی۔ بیٹی عدالت میں پیش ہوئی اور کہا کہ وہ اپنی مرضی سے نکاح کر کے شوہر کے ساتھ رہنا چاہتی ہے۔ عدالت نے غور کیا کہ اگرچہ “چائلڈ میرج ریسٹرینٹ ایکٹ 1929” میں شادی کی کم از کم عمر مقرر کی گئی ہے (لڑکی کے لیے 16 سال)، مگر اس ایکٹ کے تحت نکاح کو کالعدم یا غیر مؤثر قرار نہیں دیا گیا بلکہ صرف سزا دی جا سکتی ہے۔

اسلامی/محمدن لاء کے مطابق شادی کی اہلیت کے لیے دو شرطیں ہیں:
 1. عاقل ہونا
 2. بلوغت (puberty)

زینب نے بلوغت پا لی تھی اور اپنی مرضی ظاہر کی، اس لیے عدالت نے مانا کہ نکاح محمدن لاء کے مطابق درست ہے۔ سپریم کورٹ اور ہائی کورٹ کے پرانے فیصلوں میں بھی یہی قرار دیا گیا کہ بلوغت کے بعد نکاح درست ہوتا ہے، چاہے عمر 16 سال سے کم ہو۔

نتیجہ: عدالت نے درخواست خارج (dismiss) کر دی اور لڑکی کو شوہر کے ساتھ رہنے کی اجازت برقرار رکھی۔

By now it is well settled that First Information Report (Crime report) is the cornerstone and foundational element of the case of prosecution and if same has not been recorded promptly after the occurrence, then superstructure raised  on the basis of said FIR in the form of case of  prosecution is bound to fall.
If complainant being eye witness of the occurrence states in his examination-in-chief that he submitted the application for registration of case but takes absolute somersault in cross-examination and denies submission of said application, then testimony of such witness who makes inconsistent statements on oath, cannot be relied rather to be kept out of consideration.
It is also well settled that when there is delay in reporting the incident to the police, then prosecution is under obligation to explain such delay and failure to do that will badly reflect upon the credibility of prosecution version and same is fatal for the case of prosecution.
No material is available on record to establish presence of the complainant at the time and place of occurrence, hence, his testimony is “suspect” evidence and cannot be accepted without pinch of salt;
By now it is well settled that witnesses who introduce dishonest improvement or omission for strengthening the case, cannot be relied.
So far as recovery of half-brick/brickbat at the pointing out of appellant is concerned, suffice it to say that as per own case of prosecution, occurrence took place on 07.04.2019 whereas said bloodstained half-brick was recovered on 12.06.2019 after more than two months of the occurrence and that, too, from vacant place. By now it is well settled that human blood disintegrates within three weeks, therefore, report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore regarding availability of human blood on the said brickbat is of no avail to the prosecution.

There is no bar to the simultaneous institution of both civil as well as criminal proceedings regarding the same matter. According to the guiding principles laid down by august Supreme Court of Pakistan in number of the judgments, where criminal liability is dependent upon or connected with the result of civil proceedings and it is difficult to draw a line between a bonafide claim and criminal act alleged, the trial court may postpone the criminal proceedings till the conclusion of civil proceedings. The court should exercise the discretion in this regard keeping in view the circumstances of the case. The court should see as to whether the accused was likely to be prejudiced in case criminal proceedings are not stayed.

Said Nikah Nama was subject matter of civil litigation between the parties. Genuineness or otherwise of the Nikah Nama has to be determined by the learned civil court, as such fate of the criminal case depends upon the fate of civil cases, therefore, propriety demands that the learned trial court should not finalize the proceedings till the disposal of the civil/family cases between the parties.

[10/2/25, 4:39:10 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: When there is no apprehension of arrest, pre-arrest bail is not maintainable.
It is a well-settled principle of law that the sine qua non for the grant of pre-arrest bail is the existence of a reasonable apprehension of arrest, not for the legitimate purpose of investigation, but one motivated by mala fide intent or driven by ulterior motives, such as to humiliate, harass, or exact personal vengeance under the cloak of legal process. It necessarily implies that in the absence of any reasonable apprehension of arrest, the prayer of pre-arrest bail becomes legally untenable and is not maintainable, as the foundational ground for invoking the court’s extraordinary discretionary jurisdiction simply does not exist.

 Once the Investigating Officer stated that the arrest of respondents No.1 and 2 was not required, the proper course for the learned court below was to dispose of the bail application by recording the said stance, rather than dilating upon the merits of the case and proceeding to confirm the pre-arrest bail. In the absence of a reasonable apprehension of arrest, a petition for pre-arrest bail is not maintainable, as where there exists no apprehension of arrest, the question of granting prearrest bail does not arise. 

 In view of the foregoing, I am of the considered view that the learned Judge, while confirming the pre-arrest bail petition, travelled beyond the scope of jurisdiction by unnecessarily delving into matters not warranted at that stage. Learned counsel for both parties, as well as the learned Law Officer, conceded to the aforesaid proposition of law and expressed no objection to the setting aside of the impugned order, whereby pre-arrest bail was confirmed in favour of respondents No. 1 & 2. Accordingly, this petition is allowed, and the impugned order is hereby set aside with the observation that, if at any subsequent stage the investigating agency considers the respondents’ arrest necessary, they shall be at liberty to approach the court of first instance for prearrest bail, which shall be decided afresh, strictly on its own merits and in accordance with the law.

Muhammad Arif Tarar v. Matloob Ahmad Warraich and others
[10/2/25, 4:39:11 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Grant of Bail on Ground of Statutory Delay.

The 3rd proviso to sub-section (1) of section 497 of the Cr.P.C. governs the statutory right to claim release on bail on the ground of delay in the conclusion of trial. The legislature has explicitly used the expression 'shall' in the 3rd proviso and it creates a right in favour of an accused to be released on bail provided the conditions stipulated for claiming such a right have been fulfilled. The 3rd proviso sets out the conditions for being released on bail on the ground of statutory delay. While the 4th proviso has described three distinct exceptions. Even if the conditions specified in the 3rd proviso are met but the case falls in one of the exceptions set out in the 4th proviso, the accused would not be entitled to claim bail on statutory ground as of right. The right would come into existence if the conditions explicitly set out in the 3rd proviso have been met and the exceptions in the 4th proviso are not attracted. The ground is solely based on the delay in conclusion of trial. If an accused has been alleged to have committed an offence punishable with death, e.g under section 302 (a) or (b) of the PPC, then he or she becomes entitled to seek bail under the 3rd proviso if the detention is for a continuous period exceeding two years and, in the case of a woman, exceeding one year and the trial has not concluded. The period of continuous detention prescribed for an offence not punishable with death is one year and for a woman it is six months. The aforementioned delay must not be attributed to the accused nor to any act or omission of any other person acting on his or her behalf, as the case may be. However, the exception incorporated in the 4th proviso must not exist so that the right could be exercised. The three exceptions are; if the accused is a previously convicted offender for an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or 'in the opinion of the court' is a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal or is accused of an act of terrorism punishable with death or imprisonment for life. If one of the three exceptions stipulated in the 4th proviso is attracted then the right contemplated in the 3rd proviso could not be given effect to though the delay may not be attributable to the accused and the prescribed period of detention has been completed. The 4th proviso is an exception and controls the bail granting power contemplated under the 3rd proviso. In this case, we are required to examine the scope and meaning of the expression “hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal”. The other two exceptions are straight forward. The opinion regarding the expression has to be formed by the court. Is the court only to confine itself to the material collected during investigation or may also consider other material not related to the alleged offence but which enables it to form an opinion whether an accused is a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal.

[10/2/25, 4:39:12 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The scope and effect of the expression in the 4th proviso i.e hardened, dangerous or desperate criminal is distinct from the restriction on the power and discretion of a court under sub section (1) of section 497 of the Cr.P.C not to release an accused on bail if there appears reasonable grounds for believing that the accused may be guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or for ten years. This distinction highlights that the exception in the 4th proviso is not in the context of the merits of the case i.e forming an opinion whether reasonable grounds exist for believing that an accused may have been guilty of one of the offences specified by the legislature. Bail may have been declined on merits in terms of forming an opinion under sub section (1) of section 497 but if the conditions specified under the 3rd proviso are met and the case does not attract one of the exceptions specifically mentioned in the 4th proviso then it entitles an accused to claim bail on the basis of statutory delay as a fresh and independent ground. The exception of being a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal contains four distinct expressions. Hardened, desperate or dangerous' have been used by the legislature disjunctively and cannot be construed as conjunctive and they precede the expression 'criminal'. There must be sufficient material placed before the court by the prosecution to enable it to form an opinion that if the accused is released on bail under the 3rd proviso, then there would be a substantial risk or it would be highly probable that he or she would cause serious harm to the society and its members because of being a hardened, dangerous or desperate criminal. An accused may not have been convicted in the past and yet the court may form an opinion on the basis of sufficient material that the accused falls within one of the aforementioned classes. An accused may have a previous conviction but yet the court, on the basis of material placed before it, form an opinion that the accused does not fall within the meaning of the expression of being a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal. The gravity of the crime alleged to have been committed by an accused could be a factor to be taken into consideration. There may be material indicating the accused’s history of being involved in violence and threatening witnesses, prosecutors etc. The prosecution may place before the court material to demonstrably show that, if released, the accused could interfere with or influence the investigation by threatening or harming the witnesses or the members of law enforcement agencies. There could be several factors which the court may take into consideration in forming an opinion whether an accused seeking bail under the 4th proviso is a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal. No general rule can be laid down as to how a court is to form an opinion because it would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. However, the opinion cannot be based on mere presumptions, conjectures or subjective basis. The court essentially has to from an opinion that there is substantial risk or a real and high likelihood of harm to the society, if the accused is released on bail on statutory ground. This opinion must be based on the material placed by the prosecution before the court. A history of being involved in violent crimes, disregard for humans or other living beings, risk of abscondence and many other factors may enable the court to form an opinion. An accused suffering from a pedophilic disorder, for example, would be a substantial risk leading to harm but it would require an opinion of a medical practitioner so that the court may enable itself to form an opinion. The expression hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal has a nexus with substantial risk and high likelihood of harm to the society or its members or a class of members and not to the merits of the case though that may also be considered. The court must not exclude from consideration the principle that an accused is innocent until proven guilty and the right that accrues under the 3rd proviso of section 497 (1) can only be denied when the court, on the basis of material placed before it, forms an opinion that the accused would pose a substantial risk of harm to the society, public or its members, if released on bail. This opinion must be formed on the basis of credible material and not on a subjective basis. The material may not be confined to the case because the prosecution has to show to the court that the accused seeking bail is not an ordinary criminal but a hardened, dangerous or desperate i.e someone who would be a substantial risk of causing harm to others and is a person who has disregard for the law and human life.

The 3rd proviso to sub-section (1) of section 497 of the Cr.P.C. governs the statutory right to claim release on bail on the ground of delay in the conclusion of trial. The legislature has explicitly used the expression 'shall' in the 3rd proviso and it creates a right in favour of an accused to be released on bail provided the conditions stipulated for claiming such a right have been fulfilled. The 3rd proviso sets out the conditions for being released on bail on the ground of statutory delay. While the 4th proviso has described three distinct exceptions. Even if the conditions specified in the 3rd proviso are met but the case falls in one of the exceptions set out in the 4th proviso, the accused would not be entitled to claim bail on statutory ground as of right. The right would come into existence if the conditions explicitly set out in the 3rd proviso have been met and the exceptions in the 4th proviso are not attracted. The ground is solely based on the delay in conclusion of trial. If an accused has been alleged to have committed an offence punishable with death, e.g under section 302 (a) or (b) of the PPC, then he or she becomes entitled to seek bail under the 3rd proviso if the detention is for a continuous period exceeding two years and, in the case of a woman, exceeding one year and the trial has not concluded. The period of continuous detention prescribed for an offence not punishable with death is one year and for a woman it is six months. The aforementioned delay must not be attributed to the accused nor to any act or omission of any other person acting on his or her behalf, as the case may be. However, the exception incorporated in the 4th proviso must not exist so that the right could be exercised. The three exceptions are; if the accused is a previously convicted offender for an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or 'in the opinion of the court' is a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal or is accused of an act of terrorism punishable with death or imprisonment for life. If one of the three exceptions stipulated in the 4th proviso is attracted then the right contemplated in the 3rd proviso could not be given effect to though the delay may not be attributable to the accused and the prescribed period of detention has been completed. The 4th proviso is an exception and controls the bail granting power contemplated under the 3rd proviso. In this case, we are required to examine the scope and meaning of the expression “hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal”. The other two exceptions are straight forward. The opinion regarding the expression has to be formed by the court. Is the court only to confine itself to the material collected during investigation or may also consider other material not related to the alleged offence but which enables it to form an opinion whether an accused is a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal.

[10/3/25, 4:45:48 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The scope and effect of the expression in the 4th proviso i.e hardened, dangerous or desperate criminal is distinct from the restriction on the power and discretion of a court under sub section (1) of section 497 of the Cr.P.C not to release an accused on bail if there appears reasonable grounds for believing that the accused may be guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or for ten years. This distinction highlights that the exception in the 4th proviso is not in the context of the merits of the case i.e forming an opinion whether reasonable grounds exist for believing that an accused may have been guilty of one of the offences specified by the legislature. Bail may have been declined on merits in terms of forming an opinion under sub section (1) of section 497 but if the conditions specified under the 3rd proviso are met and the case does not attract one of the exceptions specifically mentioned in the 4th proviso then it entitles an accused to claim bail on the basis of statutory delay as a fresh and independent ground. The exception of being a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal contains four distinct expressions. Hardened, desperate or dangerous' have been used by the legislature disjunctively and cannot be construed as conjunctive and they precede the expression 'criminal'. There must be sufficient material placed before the court by the prosecution to enable it to form an opinion that if the accused is released on bail under the 3rd proviso, then there would be a substantial risk or it would be highly probable that he or she would cause serious harm to the society and its members because of being a hardened, dangerous or desperate criminal. An accused may not have been convicted in the past and yet the court may form an opinion on the basis of sufficient material that the accused falls within one of the aforementioned classes. An accused may have a previous conviction but yet the court, on the basis of material placed before it, form an opinion that the accused does not fall within the meaning of the expression of being a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal. The gravity of the crime alleged to have been committed by an accused could be a factor to be taken into consideration. There may be material indicating the accused’s history of being involved in violence and threatening witnesses, prosecutors etc. The prosecution may place before the court material to demonstrably show that, if released, the accused could interfere with or influence the investigation by threatening or harming the witnesses or the members of law enforcement agencies. There could be several factors which the court may take into consideration in forming an opinion whether an accused seeking bail under the 4th proviso is a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal. No general rule can be laid down as to how a court is to form an opinion because it would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. However, the opinion cannot be based on mere presumptions, conjectures or subjective basis. The court essentially has to from an opinion that there is substantial risk or a real and high likelihood of harm to the society, if the accused is released on bail on statutory ground. This opinion must be based on the material placed by the prosecution before the court. A history of being involved in violent crimes, disregard for humans or other living beings, risk of abscondence and many other factors may enable the court to form an opinion. An accused suffering from a pedophilic disorder, for example, would be a substantial risk leading to harm but it would require an opinion of a medical practitioner so that the court may enable itself to form an opinion. The expression hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal has a nexus with substantial risk and high likelihood of harm to the society or its members or a class of members and not to the merits of the case though that may also be considered. The court must not exclude from consideration the principle that an accused is innocent until proven guilty and the right that accrues under the 3rd proviso of section 497 (1) can only be denied when the court, on the basis of material placed before it, forms an opinion that the accused would pose a substantial risk of harm to the society, public or its members, if released on bail. This opinion must be formed on the basis of credible material and not on a subjective basis. The material may not be confined to the case because the prosecution has to show to the court that the accused seeking bail is not an ordinary criminal but a hardened, dangerous or desperate i.e someone who would be a substantial risk of causing harm to others and is a person who has disregard for the law and human life.

Principles relating to the offence of rape stated.

(i) The sole testimony of a victim in a case of sexual abuse, where such testimony is independent, unbiased, straightforward and reliable, is sufficient to support conviction, as it is understood that offences of sexual assault transpire in private, for which reason they are mostly not witnessed by others.

(ii) The exception to the rule, that the sole testimony of the victim of an offence of sexual abuse needs no corroboration, are cases where there exists evidence of enmity or a prior grudge between the complainant and the accused. In such cases a court must be cautious in relying on the sole testimony of the complainant, where such testimony is not corroborated by other evidence establishing a link between the accused and the offence he/she has been charged with.

(iii) Where corroboration is required, the focus of such corroboration is to determine whether the accused is linked to the offence he/she has been charged with and/or can be placed at the place of occurrence, to ensure that the complainant does not falsely allege that an occurrence took place involving the accused, which never did.

(iv) In view of prevalent social realities that inform individual reactions, there can be no presumption that a rape victim would falsely identify an innocent person for the criminal and violent act of a third person who actually committed the offence.

(v) Any delay in reporting of an offence of sexual abuse, if not accompanied by facts and circumstances that create reasonable doubt about the occurrence itself, will not create a presumption that the complaint was false in view of a natural inclination of victims of sexual abuse to never report the offence at all.

(vi) The evidentiary and probative burden of establishing the actus reus of rape and that intercourse took place without the consent of the victim is on the prosecution. And where the actus reus has been proven beyond doubt, the sole testimony of the victim, when found truthful and reliable by the Court in face of cross-examination, may be sufficient to discharge the onus of proving the mens rea of rape.

(vii) Where the fact that intercourse took place is established, and the complainant testifies that the intercourse was against her will and without her consent, the defendant not pleading that intercourse was a consequence of consent granted by the complainant is at his own peril. While the evidentiary burden of proving mens rea remains on the prosecution, the threshold for discharging probative burden is low and can be discharged on the basis of the testimony of the complainant, unless the accused can establish on a balance of probabilities that the complainant granted consent, after which the burden would shift back to the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant had not granted consent for intercourse as claimed by the accused.

(viii) Use of force is not a necessary ingredient of the offence of rape and intercourse against the will of the victim or in the absence of her consent is in itself sufficient to constitute rape.

(ix) While consent may involve submission, submission does not necessarily imply consent and therefore passive submission by a victim, out of fear, without putting up physical resistance, cannot be mistaken for grant of consent.

پاکستانی فیملی لاء میں "خلع بشرطِ واپسی مہر" کے عدالتی نفاذ (Execution of Decree) پر ایک نہایت اہم نظیر ہے۔
اس فیصلے میں عدالت نے واضح طور پر قرار دیا کہ اگر خلع کی ڈگری مہر کی واپسی سے مشروط ہو، تو شوہر اس ڈگری کی بنیاد پر مہر کی واپسی کیلئے "اجراء (Execution Petition)" دائر کر سکتا ہے۔

🏛️ 2023 CLC 1285 — Muhammad Khalid v. Mst. (Respondent Wife)

عدالت: لاہور ہائی کورٹ، راولپنڈی بنچ
جج: (Single Bench)
فیصلہ: 22 ستمبر 2016

قانونی موضوع: تنسیخِ نکاح بربنائے خلع، بشرط واپسی مہر

Posted by Legal Luminaries 
---

⚖️ متعلقہ دفعات و قواعد (Relevant Legal Provisions):

1. فیملی کورٹس ایکٹ 1964 (Family Courts Act, 1964)

سیکشن 10(4): خلع کے ذریعہ ازدواجی رشتہ ختم کرنے کا اختیار

سیکشن 13: عدالتی ڈگری کے نفاذ (Execution) کا طریقہ

2. فیملی کورٹس رولز 1965 (Family Court Rules, 1965)

رول 16 & 17: ڈگری کی شکل (Form) اور اندراج (Register) کا طریقہ

3. آئینِ پاکستان 1973، آرٹیکل 199:
آئینی دائرہ اختیار (Writ Jurisdiction) کے تحت نظرِ ثانی کا اختیار

---

📜 پس منظرِ مقدمہ (Case Background):

شوہر (درخواست گزار) اور بیوی (مدعا علیہہ) میں ازدواجی اختلافات پیدا ہوئے۔

بیوی نے خلع کی بنیاد پر تنسیخِ نکاح کا دعویٰ دائر کیا۔

فیملی کورٹ نے 8 دسمبر 2010 کو خلع کی ڈگری جاری کی بشرط واپسی حقِ مہر (۴ تولہ سونا)۔

بعد ازاں شوہر نے اجراء کی درخواست (Execution Petition) دائر کی تاکہ مہر واپس لیا جا سکے۔

---

🧾 عدالتی کارروائی (Procedural History):

عدالت فیصلہ نتیجہ

فیملی کورٹ (راولپنڈی) بیوی کو 4 تولہ سونا واپس کرنے کا حکم دیا شوہر کے حق میں فیصلہ
ایڈیشنل ڈسٹرکٹ جج (اپیل/ریویژن) فیملی کورٹ کا حکم کالعدم قرار دیا بیوی کے حق میں فیصلہ
لاہور ہائی کورٹ (W.P.) اپیل منظور کی — شوہر کو حقِ اجراء دیا ADJ کا فیصلہ کالعدم

---

⚖️ فریقین کے مؤقف (Arguments of the Parties):

درخواست گزار (شوہر):

خلع کی ڈگری میں واضح طور پر لکھا ہے کہ “خلع بشرطِ واپسی مہر منظور کی جاتی ہے”۔

لہٰذا یہ ایک مکمل ڈگری (compound decree) ہے جو قابلِ نفاذ (executable) ہے۔

فیملی کورٹ کا فیصلہ درست اور قانونی ہے۔

مدعا علیہہ (بیوی):

اجراء کی درخواست ناقابلِ سماعت ہے۔

صرف "خلع" دی گئی ہے، مہر کی واپسی کے لیے الگ دعویٰ دائر کرنا ضروری ہے۔

ریویژن کورٹ (ADJ) کا فیصلہ درست تھا۔

---

📖 عدالتی مشاہدات (Court’s Observations):

1. خلع بشرطِ واپسی مہر "Compound Decree" ہے

عدالت نے کہا کہ جب فیملی کورٹ خلع دیتے ہوئے واپسیِ مہر کی شرط لگاتی ہے،
تو یہ فیصلہ دو حصوں پر مشتمل ہوتا ہے:
1️⃣ نکاح کی تنسیخ
2️⃣ مہر کی واپسی

لہٰذا یہ ایک مکمل ڈگری ہے جس کا نفاذ ممکن ہے۔

> "Such a decree dissolves marriage and simultaneously directs the return of dower — hence it is executable in law."

---

2. سیکشن 13 (فیملی کورٹ ایکٹ 1964) کے تحت نفاذ کا حق

عدالت نے سیکشن 13 کا حوالہ دیتے ہوئے کہا کہ
اگر کسی ڈگری میں مالی ادائیگی یا واپسی کا ذکر ہو،
تو عدالت اس کے نفاذ کیلئے اجراء کے طریقہ کار اختیار کر سکتی ہے۔

مہر چونکہ مالی حق ہے، لہٰذا اسی ڈگری کی بنیاد پر شوہر کو اجراء کا حق حاصل ہے۔

---

3. مناسب عدالتی فارم اور رجسٹریشن (Rules 16 & 17 FCR 1965)

عدالت نے کہا کہ خلع کی ڈگری فارم I کے مطابق تیار کی گئی،
جس میں مہر کی واپسی کی شرط درج ہے،
اس لیے یہ ایک قاعدہ 16 کے مطابق مکمل ڈگری ہے۔

---

4. سابقہ نظیر (Distinction from Nadia Bibi Case, PLD 2013 Lahore 41)

عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ Mst. Nadia Bibi Case میں خلع بغیر کسی شرط کے دی گئی تھی،
اس لیے وہاں اجراء ممکن نہیں تھا۔

مگر موجودہ کیس میں واپسی مہر کی شرط موجود ہے،
اس لیے یہ قابلِ نفاذ ڈگری ہے۔

---

⚖️ عدالتی فیصلہ (Judgment):

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ:

خلع بشرط واپسی مہر ایک قابلِ نفاذ ڈگری ہے۔

شوہر کو اجراء (Execution Petition) دائر کرنے کا مکمل حق حاصل ہے۔

ایڈیشنل ڈسٹرکٹ جج کا فیصلہ غلط اور غیرقانونی تھا۔

نتیجتاً، ہائی کورٹ نے ریویژن کورٹ کا فیصلہ کالعدم قرار دے کر شوہر کی درخواست منظور کر لی۔

🟩 نتیجہ:

> “Execution petition for recovery of dower based on Khula decree is maintainable in law.”

---

📚 قانونی نکات (Legal Principles Established):

نمبر اصول وضاحت

1 خلع بشرط واپسی مہر ایک Compound Decree ہے یہ نکاح کے خاتمے اور مالی ذمہ داری دونوں کو طے کرتی ہے۔
2 سیکشن 13، فیملی کورٹ ایکٹ 1964 خلع کی ڈگری اگر مہر کی واپسی سے مشروط ہو تو اجراء ممکن ہے۔
3 Rule 16 & 17, Family Court Rules 1965 ڈگری فارم I کے مطابق ہو تو قابل نفاذ ہوتی ہے۔
4 نادیہ بی بی کیس کا فرق صرف خلع (بغیر شرط) غیرقابلِ نفاذ، خلع بشرطِ مہر قابلِ نفاذ۔

---

💡 نتیجہ (Conclusion):

عدالتِ عالیہ نے یہ اصول قائم کیا کہ
اگر عورت کو خلع کی ڈگری مہر کی واپسی کی شرط پر دی جائے،
تو شوہر بغیر نیا مقدمہ دائر کیے
اسی ڈگری کے تحت فیملی کورٹ میں اجراء کی درخواست دے سکتا ہے۔
ایسی ڈگری دونوں فریقین کے حقوق و فرائض کو مکمل طور پر متعین کرتی ہے۔

یہ فیصلہ منشیات کے مقدمات (Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997) میں شک کے فائدے (Benefit of Doubt) اور شواہد کی ناقص نوعیت (Defective Evidence) کے حوالے سے ایک اہم عدالتی نظیر ہے۔

---

🏛️ 2025 YLR 1694 (بلوچستان)

عدالت: ہائی کورٹ آف بلوچستان، کوئٹہ
بینچ:

جناب جسٹس عبداللہ بلوچ

جناب جسٹس اقبال احمد قاضی

فریقین:
اپیل کنندہ (Appellant): شوقت علی
جواب دہندہ (Respondent): ریاست

مقدمہ: Criminal Appeal No. 25 of 2025
تاریخِ فیصلہ: 14 مارچ 2025

---

⚖️ متعلقہ قانون (Relevant Statutes):

1. کنٹرول آف نارکوٹک سبسٹنسز ایکٹ، 1997 (CNSA)

دفعہ 9(1)، شق 3(a):
منشیات رکھنے یا منتقل کرنے کی سزا۔
230 گرام چرس رکھنے پر اگر جرم ثابت ہو جائے تو ملزم سزا کا مستحق ہوتا ہے۔

---

🧾 پس منظرِ مقدمہ (Case Background):

پولیس کے مطابق 17 جولائی 2023 کو ملزم شوقت علی کو روکا گیا اور اس کی تلاشی کے دوران 230 گرام بیکڈ چرس (baked charas) برآمد ہوئی۔
پولیس نے 20 گرام بطور نمونہ (sample) الگ کیا اور باقی کو سیل پیک (sealed parcel) کر دیا۔
ملزم کے خلاف دفعہ 9(1) کے تحت مقدمہ درج کیا گیا۔
ٹرائل کورٹ نے ملزم کو سزا سنائی، جس کے خلاف اس نے ہائی کورٹ میں اپیل دائر کی۔

---

⚖️ اہم قانونی سوالات (Legal Issues):

1. کیا پولیس کے گواہوں کے بیانات آپس میں مطابقت رکھتے ہیں؟

2. کیا برآمد شدہ منشیات کی محفوظ ترسیل (safe custody & transmission) ثابت ہوئی؟

3. کیا کیمیکل ایگزامینر کی رپورٹ درست طور پر عدالت میں پیش اور نمائش (exhibit) کی گئی؟

4. کیا ان تمام کمزوریوں کے باعث شک کا فائدہ (Benefit of Doubt) دیا جا سکتا ہے؟

---

💬 دلائل (Arguments):

مدعیہ / استغاثہ (Prosecution):

پولیس نے موقع پر ملزم کو قابو کیا۔

چرس برآمد ہوئی، نمونے لئے گئے، رپورٹ مثبت آئی۔

ملزم نے کوئی دفاعی گواہ پیش نہیں کیا۔

ملزم / اپیل کنندہ (Defense):

گواہوں کے بیانات متضاد ہیں؛ کبھی تفتیشی افسر، کبھی شکایت کنندہ خود وزن کرنے کا دعویٰ کرتے ہیں۔

رپورٹ نمائش نہیں کی گئی؛ قانونی تقاضے پورے نہیں ہوئے۔

منشیات کے نمونے کی ترسیل محفوظ نہیں تھی؛ متعلقہ کانسٹیبل کو عدالت میں بلایا ہی نہیں گیا۔

لہٰذا مقدمہ شک کی بنیاد پر قابلِ رد ہے۔

---

🧠 عدالتِ عالیہ کا تجزیہ (Court’s Analysis):

1️⃣ گواہوں کے بیانات میں تضاد

مدعی نے کہا: “میں نے خود وزن کیا اور نمونے لئے۔”

تفتیشی افسر نے کہا: “میں نے وزن کیا اور نمونے لئے۔”
➡️ عدالت نے کہا کہ یہ بنیادی تضاد ہے، جس سے استغاثہ کا کیس مشکوک (unreliable) ہو جاتا ہے۔

---

2️⃣ محفوظ ترسیل کا فقدان (Safe Transmission Missing)

نمونہ کیمیکل ایگزامینر کو بھیجنے کے لیے ایک پولیس کانسٹیبل کے حوالے کیا گیا،
مگر:

اس کا بیان 161 Cr.P.C کے تحت ریکارڈ نہیں کیا گیا،

نہ ہی وہ عدالت میں بطور گواہ پیش ہوا۔
➡️ عدالت نے کہا: یہ اہم خلا ہے، جس سے ترسیل کی حفاظت مشکوک ہو گئی۔

---

3️⃣ کیمیکل ایگزامینر کی رپورٹ نمائش نہیں کی گئی

رپورٹ مقدمے کے ریکارڈ کے ساتھ موجود تھی،

----S. 9(1), Sr. No. 3(a)---Possession and transportation of narcotic substances---Appreciation of evidence---Contradiction in the statements of witnesses---Prosecution case was that the accused was found in possession of 230-grams baked charas---Complainant, in his deposition stated that on 17.07.2023, the appellant was overpowered and his personal search was conducted by him, as a result whereof, 230-grams of baked charas was recovered from his possession and he separated 20-grams charas as representative sample and prepared the parcels---On the contrary, Investigating Officer deposed that he weighed the recovered charas, separated the representative samples and prepared the parcels---Such glaring contradiction in the evidence brought on record by the prosecution against the appellant was not trustworthy to inspire confidence, and it could not be relied upon and could not be made the basis for awarding a sentence---Appeal against conviction was allowed, in circumstances. [Balochistan](a) 1694

---S. 9(1), Sr. No. 3(a)---Possession and transportation of narcotic substances---Appreciation of evidence---Safe transmission of the recovered substance doubtful---Prosecution case was that the accused was found in possession of 230-grams baked charas---As per prosecution version, after recovery of the alleged contraband material and separation, the representative samples were handed over to a Police Constable for its transmission to the Chemical Examiner, while his name was also appearing in the Forensic Science Laboratory Report, but neither the statement of said Police Constable was recorded under S.161, Cr.P.C nor he was produced before the Court as a witness, thus, inference could easily been drawn that the prosecution had failed to prove the element of safe transmission---As a result, the prosecution failed to prove that the sample parcels were handled carefully and sent securely---Said flaw on the side of the prosecution was enough to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt---Appeal against conviction was allowed, in circumstances. [Balochistan](b) 1694

----S. 9(1), Sr. No. 3(a)---Possession and transportation of narcotic substances---Appreciation of evidence---Non-exhibiting report of chemical examiner during trial---Effect---Prosecution case was that the accused was found in possession of 230-grams baked charas---Record reflected that though the report of the Chemical Examiner had been annexed with the record of the Trial Court, however, it was not exhibited during the course of trial---Document could only be exhibited when it was relevant and admissible in evidence---Prior to exhibition of a document, question of its admissibility must be decided by the Trial Court---Law provided a procedure for exhibiting a document to be read in evidence, which had been blatantly overlooked in the instant case by the Trial Court---Undeniably, the report of Chemical Examiner could not be exhibited during the course of trial, therefore, the same could not be taken into consideration to maintain conviction of the appellant---Appeal

against conviction was allowed, in circumstances. [Balochistan](c) 1694

Date of hearing: 28th January, 2020.
JUDGMENT
SHAHID BILAL HASSAN, J.--Precisely, the petitioner contracted marriage with lmdad Ullah/respondent No.3, who is residing in USA. The respondent No.3 sent a visa to the petitioner and her real daughter aged 5 years, so they could settled there (USA). Allegedly, the respondent No.3 on the instigation of respondent No.4, his brother, prepared a fake, forged and bogus divorce deed in the name of the petitioner and then sent her back to Pakistan; that the divorce deed was not in the knowledge of the petitioner and her daughter, which fact was intimated to them after four months of returning back to Pakistan, hence, the petitioner enquired about the said fact from the Union Council concerned, then on query it was informed that the divorce had been confirmed ex parte, allegedly, in connivance of respondents Nos.1 and 4 without issuing any notice to the petitioner or her family members including her father, because the respondents Nos.1 and 2 did not serve any notice to the petitioner or her family members. The respondent No.3 issued a Salsee Nama in favour of respondent No.4 regarding performance of his role as Arbitrator (Salis) in this matter on 20.11.2013. Allegedly, the respondent No.3 through his brother respondent No.4 had written a divorce deed on a blank paper on 01.08.2018, while the respondent No.3 had not affixed his thumb impressions or his signatures upon the said divorce deed, however, the respondent No.4 affixed his thumb impressions and signatures upon the same. Upon said divorce deed, the respondent No.1 issued notice of divorce through respondent No.4 and then through respondent No.1 himself on 01.08.2018 on the same date; that on 01.10.2018, the respondent No.1 again issued a notice for 01.11.2018 in the name of the petitioner. On 14.11.2018, the respondent No.1/The Chairman, Reconciliation Committee, Union Council Chak No.94/NP, Khanpur, District Rahim Yar Khan passed an ex parte order for confirmation of divorce to the petitioner on behalf of respondent No.3 through respondent No.4, wherein presence of respondent No.3 was never shown; that the Secretary, Union Council ibid issued impugned divorce registration certificate bearing No.Z10224574 on 21.01.2019. Through the instant constitutional petition, the impugned divorce registration certificate dated 21.01.2019 and impugned order of confirmation dated 14.11.2018, have been challenged contending the same to be illegal, void ab initio, against the facts, ex parte, without any notice to the petitioner or her father and hence, liable to be set aside.
2. Heard.
3. The only point in issue is the assumption of jurisdiction by the respondent No.1/Chairman, Union Council Chak No.94/NP, Khanpur, District Rahim Yar Khan in order to pass the impugned order dated 14.11.2018 and to issue the impugned divorce registration certificate dated 21.01.2019. Sections 2(b) and 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 and Rule 3(b) of the West Pakistan Rules under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 are necessary to be reproduced, which read:-
'Section 2(b):- "Chairman" means the Chairman of the Union Council or a person appointed by the Federal Government in the Cantonment areas or by the Provincial Government in other areas or by any officer authorized in that behalf by any such Government to discharge the functions of Chairman under this Ordinance. '
'7. "Talaq". (1) Any man who wishes to divorce his wife shall, as soon as may be after the pronouncement of talaq in any form whatsoever, give the chairman a notice in writing of his having done so, and shall supply a copy thereof to the wife.
(2) Whoever, contravenes the provisions of subsection (1) shall be punishable with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to five thousand rupees, or with both.
(3) Save a provided in subsection (5) a Talaq, unless revoked earlier, expressly or otherwise, shall not be effective until the expiration of ninety days from the day on which notice under subsection (1) is delivered to the Chairman.
(4) Within thirty days of the receipt of notice under Subsection (1) the Chairman shall constitute an Arbitration Council for the purpose of bringing about a reconciliation between the parties, and the Arbitration Council shall take all steps necessary to bring about such reconciliation.
(5) If the wife be pregnant at the time talaq is pronounced, talaq shall not be effective until the period mentioned in subsection (3) or the pregnancy, whichever be later, ends.
In order to resolve the matter in hand, as the respondent No.3 is permanently residing in USA and petitioner was also there at the time of alleged Talaq, Notification/S.R.O.No.1086(K)61 dated 09.11.1961 is also relevant, which reads:-
'In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (b) of section 2 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (VIII of 1961), the Central Government is pleased to authorize the Director General (Administration) Ministry of External Affairs to appoint officers of Pakistan Mission abroad to discharge the functions of Chairman under the aforesaid Ordinance. '
Rule 3(b) of the Rules provides:-
Rule 3. The Union Council which shall have jurisdiction in the matter for the purpose of clause (d) of section 2 shall be as follows, namely:-
(a) .
(b) in the case of notice of talaq under subsection (1) of section 7, it shall be the Union Council of the Union or Town where the wife in relation to whom talaq has been pronounced was residing, at the time of the pronouncement of talaq:
Provided that if at the time of pronouncement of talaq such wife was not residing in any part of West Pakistan, the Union Council that shall have jurisdiction shall be -
(i) in case such wife was at any time residing with the person pronouncing the Talaq in any part of West Pakistan, the Union Council of the Union or Town where such wife so last resided with such person; and
(ii) in any other case, the Union Council of the Union or Town where the person pronouncing the talaq is permanently residing in West Pakistan; '
In view of the above said provisions of law, the Union Council and/or the Chairman, which would have jurisdiction in the matter would be the Union Council and/or the Chairman within whose territorial jurisdiction the wife was residing at the time of pronouncement of divorce. Reliance is placed on Mt. Sharifan v. Abdul Khaliq and another (1983 CLC 1296) and Ms. Sadaf Munir Khan v. Chairman, Reconciliation Committee and 2 others (PLD 2019 Lahore 285). The petitioner has categorically asserted in the instant constitutional petition which is supported by an affidavit that at the time of alleged pronouncement of talaq she was residing in USA, so as per Notification/S.R.O.No. 1086(K)61 dated 09.11.1961, officers of Pakistan Mission abroad are authorized to discharge, the functions of Chairman under the aforesaid Ordinance. Meaning thereby the Chairman, Union Council Chak No.94/NP, Khanpur, District Rahim Yar Khan had no authority to exercise that authority which he has exercised, because in absence of a counter affidavit or other material in rebuttal, the averments of facts made in a petition, which is supported by an affidavit, the same is to be accepted as correct as has been held in Islamic Republic of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Government of Pakistan, Rawalpindi and another v. Amjad Ali Mirza (PLD 1977 Supreme Court 182) and followed by this Court in the judgment of Ms. Sadat Munir Khan ibid.
In addition to the above, it is an admitted fact on record that Imdad Ullah-respondent No.3, husband of the petitioner, is permanently residing in USA, so any affidavit or divorce deed, allegedly executed by him or any authority letter or Salsee Nama, rendered and executed by him in favour of respondent No.4 must have been attested by the Consulate of Pakistan at USA, but the record shows that such procedure has not been adopted and affidavit allegedly executed by him (Imdad Ullah) on 01.04.2019 is on a simple paper and seems to be a fax copy, without being attested by the Consulate of United States of USA and same is the position in case of Talaq Narna, which is on simple paper and that too without any date that on what date the pronouncement of talaq was made; thus, the said documents could not be considered and relied upon. Moreover, all the proceedings were conducted and joined by Hammad Ullah, brother of Imdad Ullah, who was not authorized person as has been observed above, because if a husband is a Pakistani national, he can divorce in Pakistan. Even if a husband is not a Pakistani National or even if both husband and wife are not Pakistani national they can get divorce in Pakistan provided that the marriage is registered in Pakistan by adopting following procedure, in case of husband:-
1. Husband will send a power of attorney to his lawyer;
2. Power of attorney should be attested from the Pakistani embassy or consulate of the country where he is residing;
3. Where a lawyer receives the power of attorney, he will proceed according to law;
4. Proceedings of overseas divorce in Pakistan are conducted in Arbitration council;
5. Minimum 90 days proceedings will be conducted by lawyer in arbitration council;
6. After the proceedings of overseas divorce in Pakistan, a divorce certificate will be issued by NADRA through arbitration council and this certificate is considered as sole and only proof of divorce.
In the present case as stated above, the process provided under law has been bypassed; thus, the impugned divorce registration certificate dated 21.01.2019 and impugned order of confirmation dated 14.11.2018 are declared to be of no legal effect and value, set aside, accordingly, by allowing the constitutional petition in hand.

JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD HASHIM KHAN KAKAR, J.---The petitioner while invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 185(3) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and has questioned the order dated 22.01.2025 of the Lahore High Court, Lahore whereby his application for bail after arrest in FIR No.1508/24 dated 09.12.2024 for the offence under Section 9(1)6(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 ("Act of 1997") registered at Police Station Chowk Azam, Layyah was dismissed.

2. Precisely the facts necessary for the disposal of the instant bail petition are that allegedly, on 09.12.2024, at 04:49 p.m, upon receipt of spy information, the petitioner was apprehended by the police party when he was present at Chak No. 353/TDA and the complainant recovered "Heroin" weighing 1100 grams, which the petitioner kept in his possession for the purpose of sale; hence this case.

3. Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, learned counsel for the petitioner, contended that the petitioner is innocent and has falsely been implicated in the case by the police authorities on the basis of fake and fictitious story; that the petitioner is behind the bars since his arrest; investigation has been completed and corpus of the petitioner is no more required to the police for further investigation; that no private witness was associated by the local police at the time of alleged recovery which is clear violation of section 103 Cr.P.C; the raiding party failed to record the recovery process on video despite clear and repeated directions from this Court to do so; and, the petitioner is previously a non-convict, therefore, he may be granted post arrest bail.

4. On the other hand, Mr. Rai Akhter Hussain, Additional Prosecutor General, appearing on behalf of the State opposed this petition with the arguments that the petitioner is nominated in the FIR; that the petitioner was caught red-handed at the spot and the recovery of "Heroin" has been effected from his possession, therefore, there is no ground for grant of post arrest bail in favour of the petitioner.

5. At the very outset, it would be relevant to state that the Act of 1997 prescribes severe punishments for the possession and sale of narcotic substances. Given the gravity of the penalties, the standard of proof required to establish guilt must be correspondingly high. The prosecution must demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that the petitioner was in possession of narcotic substance and that it was intended for sale. Article 164 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 emphasizes the importance of modern devices and techniques in the collection of evidence. It provides that evidence obtained through modern devices, such as video recordings, should be given due weight in judicial proceedings. This provision underscores the need for law enforcing agencies to adopt contemporary methods to ensure the accuracy and reliability of evidence. In this regard, in a criminal case titled Zahid Sarfaraz Gill v. State (2024 SCMR 934), this Court had granted bail after arrest to an accused carrying 1833 grams of charas which, as per the table in section 9(1) of the Act of 1997, comes under clause (c) of its third category and prescribes a minimum imprisonment of nine years and a maximum of fourteen years and fine, on the ground that why the police and members of the Anti-Narcotics Force do not record or take photographs when search, seizure and/or arrest is made. Article 164 of the Order, 1984 specially permits the use of any evidence that may have become available because of modern devices or techniques, and its Article 165 overrides all other laws. This Court had sent the copy of the order ibid to the Secretary, Ministry of Narcotics Control, Government of Pakistan, Director General Anti-Narcotics Force, the Secretaries of the Home Departments of all Provinces, Inspector Generals of Police of all the provinces and of the Islamabad Capital Territory to consider whether they want to amend the ANF/Police rules to ensure making video recordings/taking photographs whenever possible with regard to capturing, preserving and using such evidence at trial.

6. In the present case neither any video in the shape of recording and photographs of the alleged recovery has been collected by the police nor any private witness from the locality was associated to prove the alleged recovery from the possession of the petitioner. As stated above, the use of modern devices during recoveries is not merely a procedural formality but a crucial safeguard to protect innocent persons from potential police atrocities. It provides an objective and unbiased account of the recovery process, reducing the risk of false implications and ensuring that the rights of the accused are protected. In the cases of stringent punishments, the prosecution must present clear, cogent and reliable evidence to prove the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of video evidence and independent witnesses, the prosecution's case relies heavily on the testimony of the police officers involved in the raid, which is insufficient to meet the required standard of proof.

7. We strongly recognize the need to combat the menace of narcotics, however, it must also be ensured that the rights of the accused are protected. The failure to record the recovery on video, non-association of private witnesses and failure to adhere clear judicial directives, tilts the balance in favour of the petitioner.

8. It is also a golden principle of administration of criminal justice that ultimate conviction and incarceration of a guilty person can repair the wrong caused by a mistaken relief of interim bail granted to him, but no satisfactory reparation can be offered to an innocent man for his unjustified incarceration at any stage of the case albeit his acquittal in the long run. In this regard reference can be made to the case of Manzoor v. State (PLD 1972 SC 81).

9. For the foregoing reasons, whilst setting aside the impugned order, this petition is converted into an appeal and allowed. The petitioner is admitted to post arrest bail subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/-(Rupees two hundred thousand only) with two sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. Needless to mention that any observations made in this order are tentative in nature and shall not influence the Trial.

MH/M-20/SC Bail allowed.

For the purpose of s. 497(1), the maximum punishment prescribed by law is to be considered

موضوع:

خصوصی مختار (Special Attorney) کی ذمہ داری — نان و نفقہ کی ڈگری کی ریکوری — پاور آف اٹارنی کے دائرۂ اختیار کی وضاحت

---

متعلقہ دفعات:

خاندانی عدالتیں ایکٹ 1964ء — دفعات 5، شیڈول، 13(3)

عقدہ جات کا قانون 1872ء (Contract Act) — دفعہ 230

آئینِ پاکستان 1973ء — آرٹیکل 199

---

حقائقِ مقدمہ:

مدعا علیہہ نمبر 5 (بیوی) نے اپنے شوہر (مدیون / Judgment Debtor) کے خلاف نان و نفقہ کی ڈگری حاصل کی۔

درخواست گزار عبدالحق اپنے بھائی (مدیون) کا خصوصی مختار نامہ (Special Power of Attorney) تھا۔

نان و نفقہ کی ڈگری پر عمل درآمد کے دوران، حکام نے درخواست گزار کی جائیداد ضبط کرنے کا حکم دیا، یہ کہہ کر کہ چونکہ وہ مختار ہے، لہٰذا وہ بھی ذمہ دار ہے۔

درخواست گزار نے لاہور ہائی کورٹ سے رجوع کیا اور مؤقف اختیار کیا کہ وہ ذاتی طور پر کسی قسم کی ادائیگی یا ذمہ داری کا پابند نہیں۔

---

قانونی نکتہ برائے فیصلہ:

> کیا کوئی خصوصی مختار (Special Attorney) اپنے موکل (Principal) کے خلاف جاری کردہ نان و نفقہ کے فیصلے کی ادائیگی کا ذاتی طور پر ذمہ دار ٹھہرایا جا سکتا ہے؟

---

فیصلہ:

⚖️ (1) پاور آف اٹارنی کا دائرۂ اختیار محدود ہوتا ہے۔

پاور آف اٹارنی کو ہمیشہ سخت معنوں میں پڑھا جائے گا۔ مختار صرف وہی کام انجام دے سکتا ہے جو دستاویز میں واضح طور پر درج ہوں۔
کوئی ضمنی یا مفروضہ ذمہ داری اس پر عائد نہیں کی جا سکتی۔

⚖️ (2) مختار محض نمائندہ ہوتا ہے، مقروض کا متبادل نہیں۔

دفعہ 230 عقدہ جات کا قانون 1872ء کے مطابق، کوئی ایجنٹ یا مختار اپنے موکل کی طرف سے کئے گئے افعال کا ذاتی طور پر ذمہ دار نہیں ہوتا، جب تک وہ خود صراحتاً اس ذمہ داری کو قبول نہ کرے۔

⚖️ (3) اس مقدمہ میں:

پاور آف اٹارنی میں کسی قسم کی ادائیگی یا ڈگری کی تکمیل کی اجازت درج نہ تھی۔

درخواست گزار نے صرف نمائندہ حیثیت میں اپنے بھائی کی طرف سے کارروائی کی۔

اس لیے اس پر کوئی ذاتی مالی ذمہ داری عائد نہیں کی جا سکتی۔

⚖️ (4) درخواست گزار کے خلاف ریکوری کی کارروائی غیر قانونی قرار۔

درخواست گزار کی جائیداد ضبط کرنے کا اقدام اختیارات سے تجاوز، غیر قانونی اور ناقابلِ جواز قرار پایا۔

⚖️ (5) اصل ذمہ داری مدیون (شوہر) پر باقی۔

نان و نفقہ کی رقم کی ریکوری صرف مدیون (شوہر) سے کی جا سکتی ہے۔
اگر وہ بیرونِ ملک ہے یا ریکوری سے بچ رہا ہے تو خاندانی عدالتیں ایکٹ 1964ء کی دفعہ 13(3) کے تحت رقم کو محصولاتِ اراضی (Land Revenue) کی طرح وصول کیا جا سکتا ہے۔

---

نتیجہ:

✅ آئینی درخواست منظور۔

حکام کو ہدایت کی گئی کہ وہ درخواست گزار کی جائیداد ضبط یا ریکوری نہ کریں۔

ڈگری صرف اصل مدیون (شوہر) کے خلاف قابلِ نفاذ رہے گی۔

---

اہم اصول:

1. پاور آف اٹارنی کا مطلب صرف وہی اختیارات ہیں جو تحریری طور پر دئیے گئے ہوں۔

2. ایجنٹ یا مختار خود ذاتی طور پر ذمہ دار نہیں ٹھہرتا۔

3. ریکوری ہمیشہ مدیون کے خلاف ہوگی، مختار کے خلاف نہیں۔

4. تفویض کردہ اختیار ذاتی ذمہ داری پیدا نہیں کرتا۔

5. درخواست گزار کے خلاف کارروائی قانونی اختیار سے تجاوز اور آئینی خلاف ورزی تھی۔

---

نتیجہ:

🟩 آئینی درخواست منظور۔
🟩 مدعا علیہان کو نان و نفقہ کی رقم درخواست گزار سے وصول کرنے سے روکا گیا۔
🟩 ڈگری صرف اصل شوہر (مدیون) کے خلاف نافذ العمل قرار دی گئی۔

Before Muhammad Sajid Mehmood Sethi, J

ABDUL HAQ---Petitioner

versus

PROVINCE OF THE PUNJAB through District Revenue Officer/Collector, Gujrat and 4 others---Respondents

Family Courts Act (XXXV of 1964)---

---Ss.5, Sched. & 13(3)---Contract Act (IX of 1872), S.230---Recovering maintenance allowance from special attorney(brother of judgment debtor)---Liability of special attorney in execution proceedings---Scope---Petitioner sought direction from the High Court against respondents, restraining them from recovering the decretal amount of maintenance allowance from petitioner (special attorney) or from attaching the immovable property of petitioner being Special Attorney of the principal---Respondent No.5 (wife of judgment debtor) filed application for recovery of maintenance allowance against petitioner's brother (judgment debtor), which was allowed Respondents were then adamant to initiate recovery proceedings against the petitioner being Special Attorney by way of attachment of nis immovable property, therefore in such circumstances the petitioner filed the present petition---The primary question for determination before the High Court was "whether the petitioner, acting as the special attorney, was legally bound to satisfy the decree, or whether it was the judgment debtor himself (the husband of Respondent No.5) who was solely liable to satisfy the same"---Held: The liability of special attorney in execution proceedings must be determined with reference to the specific contents and scope of the power of attorney executed in his favor- --Power of attorney must be construed strictly, and only those acts, duties, and obligations that were expressly conferred upon the attorney would be lawfully performed by him---This principle ensured that no implied or assumed obligation could be fastened upon an agent beyond what had been clearly and expressly delegated---Where a power of attorney was silent with respect to payment obligations and the attorney had merely acted in a procedural or representational capacity, no independent liability could be imposed upon him in execution proceedings---Attorney functioned as an agent, not as a substitute for the principal and in the absence of express or implied authority to bind him personally, the general rule under S.230 of the Contract Act, 1872 applied, whereby, agent was not personally liable for acts performed on behalf of the principal---Petitioner, acting as a special attorney, neither made any substantive commitment to satisfy the decree nor exceeded the scope of authority conferred by the power of attorney, therefore, no coercive action could lawfully be directed against him as doing so would amount to an excess of jurisdiction and a violation of the fundamental principle that delegated authority did not create personal liability unless expressly undertaken---Accordingly, the impugned actions of the respondents in proceedings against the petitioner, who was not the judgment-debtor, were ultra vires, without lawful authority, and contrary to settled legal norms---The decree remaind enforceable solely against the judgment-debtor---If the judgment-debtor was residing abroad or was otherwise avoiding execution, the proper legal recourse lay under S.13(3) of the Family Courts Act, 1964, which permitted the recovery of the decretal amount as arrears of land revenue---Respondents were restrained from recovering the decretal amount of maintenance allowance of respondent No.5(wife of judgment debtor) from the petitioner, or from attaching the petitioner's immovable property, merely on account of his status as the special attorney of the principal---Constitutional petition was allowed, in circumstances.

This constitutional petition  decided an important question of law with regard to procedure provided for fixing maintenance allowance enacted in shape of Section 17A(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964 (the “Act”) which is being ignored frequently by the Family Courts resulting into arbitrarily fixing amount of maintenance and passing of stereotype orders/judgments eventuating in serious miscarriage of justice in utter disregard of intent of Statute; pathology of Section 17A(4) of the Act; anatomy of Schedule under Section 5, Part-1 and judicial anthology of the decisions of apex as well as this Court which are binding on the Family Courts under Article 189 and 201 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”).  The Issue.

 The subject matter, is of great technical complexity, but the legal question which falls for determination by this Court is the fixing of maintenance allowance by the Family Court without considering the provisions of law and how it can be applied for the benefit of parties at lis. 

Section 17-A of the “Act” was amended in 2015, wherein Section 17-A(1) starts with the words “suit for maintenance” and it deals with the interim maintenance of wife and the child, whereas Section 17-A(4) deals with final maintenance allowance. In order to elucidate and interpret Section 17-A(1) ibid the legislature has emphasized to pay interim maintenance on first appearance of the defendant. Upon assiduous perusal of the provisions of Section 17-A ibid, it can be gleaned that the use of the terms “fix” and “fixing” in sub-section 1 and 4 of the said Section 17-A is of much relevance. The term “fix” in itself is defined by the Black’s Law Dictionary as “to liquidate or render certain”. Whereas, “fixing” is the act of doing so. The, use of both said terms “fix” and “fixing” respectively arise in Section17-A (1) of the “Act” to fix interim maintenance and in Section17-A (4) of the “Act” for fixing final maintenance. 13. The question now arises whether the Family Court has unguided un-fettered and un-bridled and arbitrary powers to fix maintenance while employing its discretionary dominion at its discretion or is it required to proceed on pragmatic, rational and judicial basis? The answer, of course, is that it should proceed on the later. Family Court should adopt an objective approach and broadly look into the social status of the parties, the earning of the defendant, his capacity to pay and most importantly, the requirements of the claimants while fixing the maintenance. 

It can not be denied at all that a husband is under legal, moral religious obligation to maintain his legally wedded wife. Section 272 of Mohammdan Law by Mullah provides that husband is bound to maintain his wife so long she is faithful to him and obeys his reasonable orders but he is not bound to maintain her if she refuses herself to him or otherwise disobeys. Section 278 postulates that if a husb and refuses to maintain his wife, she may sue for maintenance. Nafqa Hence, it is t he obligation of husband to pay or maintenance, if construed in accordance with the principles as laid down in "HIDAYA" Hamilton in Chapter XV such as "Nafqa" translated by Charles , in the language of law, signifies all those things which are necessary to support of life, such as food, clothes and lodging. Moreover, it is further demonstrated that when a woman surrenders herself into the custody of her husband, it is incumbe nt upon him to supply her with food, clothing and lodging, whether she be a Muslim or an infidel, because maintenance is a recompense for matrimonial restrain, whence it is that where a person is in the custody of another on account of any demand, or so fo rth, his subsistence is incumbent upon the other. demonstrates that The jurisprudence developed by Islam it is the duty of a Muslim wife to perform her part of obligation first for setting in with claim of maintenance. The husband may refuse to maintain hi s wife when she refuses to 5 . live with him and if a wife refuses to live in the house of her husband and not ready to perform her part of duty and denies to live with him as his wife, she is not entitled for maintenance. 
 In Islamic law, a father is under legal, moral and obligation to maintain his children till the religious age specified by law/sharia and it shall not be out of context to mention here that his such obligation originates from esteemed dictates of Holy Quran.
This Court is in no doubt that the Family Court should keep in consideration the following aspects and legal requisites before passing the interim and final maintenance allowance under Section 17-A(1and 4) ibid:  (i) Basis of averments in plaint;  (ii) other supporting documents on record;  (iii) summoning all relevant documentary evidence;  (iv) determining the estate; and (v) determining resources of the defendant.  

Procedure to be followed by the Family Courts 
.............
 For implementation of purpose of the “Act” aimed at much needed expeditious disposal of disputes, the “Act” has brought in certain powers, procedure and parameters for the Family Courts for being adhered to. Hence, there can be no qualms about the fact that the Family Court has to exercise its powers so conferred vide provision of Section 17-A of the “Act”. Thus, the Family Court is legally obliged to assess the quantum of maintenance as per dictate and criteria mentioned in Section 17-A(4) of the “Act”. 

In connection thereto, time and again formulated guidelines as well as principles settled by superior courts are overlooked by the Family Court. In a bright/clear situation of abovementioned inability of Respondent and shortfall on his part, Family Court itself was empowered to step ahead with procedure enunciated in sections 17 (4) and 17B ofA the “Act” for requisite inquiry destined for absolute and unambiguous determination of his ‘estate’ and ‘resources’ including his salary/monthly income to finally fix maintenance allowance in issue. Nonsettled adherence of law, formulated guidelines and principles thus can’t be guarded for being allowed to breath any further.

Judicial resources need to be promptly and consistently available to litigants for the core functions of fact finding, particularly when law itself is available for rescue. Therefore, in all cases where the occupation, job or source of income of the person is definite and identified and of such a n ature remuneration, income or earnings wherefrom can be traced in a documented form then by all extent and measures, it is the duty of the Family Court to ascertain the ‘estate’ and ‘resources’ of the defendant defined above, in all such cases where the sa me stands undetermined or pleadings are evasive or just formal without substantive or believable proof in this regard and by way of summoning the relevant documentary evidence instead to settling with sole reliance upon the pleadings/averments of the parti es without due application of mind and exercise of its powers specifically conferred by way of legislation. It is neither unusual nor whimsical for the Family Courts to delve into the relevant documentary evidence dealing with the financial status of the d . efendant to determine the maintenance.

It is well established that the procedural laws are enacted to advance ca use of justice and not to thwart the same, which intent of law is no doubt always aimed at the welfare of its subjects. So, it is need of the day to employ legislated processes that are more accessible and more responsive for children, parents, and familie s. The Family Courts must adopt therapeutic and holistic approach to the Court structure and processes, as well as to decision making in family disputes.
The Registrar of this Court is also directed to make sure transmission of copy of this judgment to all District Judges of the Punjab for its circulation amongst Family Courts discharging duties under their supervision for strictly following provisions of the “Act” in true spirit whilst dealing with issue of fixing maintenance allowance. A copy of this judgment shall also be sent to Director General, Punjab Judicial Academy which functions under Section 4 of the Punjab Judicial Academy Act, 2007 and prescribes manner of training to judicial officers in terms of Section 5 of the Act ibid.  
Writ Petition No.359 of 2022   
Marriam Bibi and others V/S Azhar Iqbal and others.
[10/10/25, 3:08:49 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The practice of conducting media interviews of accused persons while in custody, and exposing them in a manner that subjects them to public humiliation, is strongly deprecated.


I. No law enforcement agency shall permit or facilitate media interviews, especially involving confessional statements of an under-custody accused, as such exposure gravely tarnishes and compromises their dignity, self-respect, and future course of life. It constitutes a (naeem)clear violation of fundamental rights and invites unwarranted public prejudice, declining the very essence of fair trial and due process. 

 II. Any violation in this regard shall constitute misconduct, and the officer found responsible shall be proceeded against in accordance with (naeem)the relevant law. The heads of investigating agencies shall bear responsibility for ensuring strict compliance and shall not disregard or condone any act of misconduct committed by their subordinates. 

III. It is high time that the role of media be effectively regulated by the competent (naeem)regulatory authorities to ensure that its unchecked conduct neither transgresses the limits of law nor encroaches upon the fundamental rights, dignity, and liberties of citizens. 

IV. The humiliation of citizens at pickets and checkpoints established by law enforcement agencies, through their exposure to the media for showcasing performance, stands strongly deprecated. Although law enforcement agencies remain empowered to take action against individuals found involved in violation of the law, any attempt to secure media attention at the (naeem)cost of the dignity, respect, or privacy of citizens shall not be permitted.

Even  at  bail  stage, Courts are  not  bound  by  the  provisions  of  law  applied  in  the FIR  rather  have  to  see  the  offence  applicable  from  the  contents  of  prosecution  case.

There  is  no  cavil  to  the  proposition  that  courts,  by  virtue  of  very  purpose  of  their creation,  are  required  to  do  justice.  The  expression  “justice”  in  its  broadest  sense,  is  the principle  that  every  individual  must  receive  which  he  deserves  according  to  law.  Justice  is  a notion  described  as  constant  perpetual  will  to  allot  to  every  man  what  is  due  to  him.  Every criminal  wrong  must  be  reciprocated  with  procedural  stringency  and  penal  consequences. The  allegations  embodied  in  FIR,  prima  facie,  attract  the  mischief  of  Section  458  PPC, which  is  titled  as  “lurking  house-trespass  or  house  breaking  by  night  after  preparation  forhurt,  assault  or  wrongful  restraint”  and  is  accordingly  made  punishable  with  imprisonment upto  14-years.  Unfortunately,  neither  any  section  for  trespass  was  applied  in  the  FIR  nor  the penal  provision  for  causing  hurt  to  the  complainant  was  mentioned  therein.  It  goes  without saying  that  courts,  even  at  bail  stage,  are  not  bound  by  the  provisions  of  law  applied  in  the FIR  rather  have  to  see  the  offence  applicable  from  the  contents  of  prosecution  case.

After  having  arrived  at  an  irresistible  conclusion  that  the  bail  granting  orders  passed in  favour  of  accused  suffer  from  perversity  and  call  for  an interference  from  this  Court,  the  question  of  foremost  importance  arises  that  under  what provision  of  law  these  orders  can  be  set-aside  in  the  absence  of  any  petition  for  cancellation of  bail.  A  peep  through  the  constitutional  history  of  subcontinent  reveals  that  High  Courts are  always  bestowed  with  powers  to  supervise  and  control  subordinate  courts.  Such  powers found  place  in  Section  15  of  the  Indian  High  Courts  Act,  1861  as  well  as  in  Section  107  of the  Government  of  India  Act,  1915.  Similarly,  through  Article  227  of  Indian  Constitution, High  Courts  have  power  of  superintendence  over  subordinate  courts  and  tribunals.    Even under Article 102 of  the Constitution  of  Pakistan, 1962,  the  High  Courts of  our country  were equipped  with  such  powers.  The  Constitution  of  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973 (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  “Constitution”)  is  no  exception  and  each  High  Court  is empowered  under  Article  203  to  supervise  and  control  all  courts  subordinate  to  it.  The powers  under  Article  203  of  the  Constitution  are  primarily  aimed  at  enabling  the  respective High  Courts  to  uproot  gross  injustice  committed  by  any  subordinate  Court.  The  powers  of High  Court  under  Article  203  of  the  Constitution  are  not  to  be  exercised  in  every  run  of  the mill  case,  rather  the  jurisdiction  under  the  foregoing  provision  is  to  be  invoked  in  cases  of exceptional  nature  more  importantly  against  orders  passed  in  flagrant  abuse  of  statutory  and judicial  directions.  It  needs  no  mention  that  the  sole  purpose  of  establishing  judicial  system is  to  impart  justice.  The  purity  of  administering  justice,  if  gets  polluted  due  to  erroneous decisions  or  for  extraneous  considerations,  the  litigants  are  likely  to  lose  faith  in  courts. Article  203  of  the  Constitution  enables  a  High  Court  to  supervise  and  control  the subordinate  courts  on  judicial  as  well  as  on  administrative  side.  The  powers  under  Article 203 of  the Constitution  can be  exercised in  appropriate cases as  suo  moto by  the  High  Court. 

In  addition  to  the  jurisdiction  under  Article  203  of  the  Constitution,  this  Court  can also  correct  a  wrong  done  by  an  inferior  criminal  Court  through  the  powers  of  revision bestowed  by  Sections  435  &  439  of  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  1898  (Cr.P.C).  For  the clarity  of  proposition,  it  is  being  mentioned  that  High  Court  under  Section  435  Cr.P.C.  can call  for  and  examine  the  record  of  any  proceedings  of  subordinate  criminal  Courts  to  satisfy itself  about  the  correctness,  legality  or  propriety  of  any  finding,  sentence  or  order.  From  the expression  “may  call  for  and  examine  the  record  of  any  proceedings  before  any  inferior criminal  court”  used  in  Section  435  Cr.P.C.,  it  implies  firstly  that  for  exercising  revisional powers,  there  is  no  need  of  any  formal  application  and  secondly  it  is  applicable  against  an order  as  well.  The  language  of  Section  435  Cr.P.C.  is  explicit  in  nature  and  it  exudes therefrom  that  High  Court  can  examine  the  vires  of  an  order  passed  even  under  Section  497 Cr.P.C. 

The  expression  “reasonable  grounds”  used  in  Section  497  (1)  Cr.P.C.  is  of  paramount importance  and  it  came  under  discussion  before  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in case  reported  as  Ch.Abdul  Malik  v.  The  State  (PLD  1968  Supreme  Court  349)  and  was defined  as  grounds  which  attract  every  prudent  mind.  If  upon  the  touchstone  of  tentative assessment,  reasonable  grounds  to  connect  an  accused  with  commission  of  crime  entailing punishment  of  10-years  and  above  are  found  from  record,  then  concession  of  post  arrest  bail is  to  be  withheld.    From  the  impeccable  identification  proceedings,  supporting  medical report,  recovery  of  robbed  articles  and  chequered  criminal  antecedents  of  all  the  four accused,  reasonable  grounds  to  connect  them  with  the  commission  of  crime  are  found  in existence.  Even  otherwise,  the  cases  of  dacoity  and  robbery  can,  by  no  stretch,  be  placed  at lower  pedestal  so  as  to  grant  bail  in  such  cases  on  artificially  stretched  reasoning,  more importantly  if  sufficient  incriminating  material  is  available  on  record.  The  dacoits  and robbers  have  embittered  the  lives  of  innocent  persons  and  they  oftenly  deprive  innocent citizens  of  their  hard  earned  resources,  thus  the  fate  of  bail  applications  moved  by  such outlaws  are  to  be  decided  with  pragmatic  approach,  rather  than  in  an  impassive  manner. Likewise,  the  grant  of  bail  to  Bakht  Taj  (under  notice)  by  learned  ASJ  after  the  dismissal  of his  earlier  post-arrest  bail  petition  can,  in  no  manner,  be  justified.  It  goes  without  saying  that an  erroneous  decision,  besides  causing  miscarriage  of  justice  also  brings  disrepute  to  the judicature, thus is to be  uprooted and set-aside.

*"دفعہ 489-F PPC میں ضمانت بطورِ اصول دی جائے گی، خواہ رقم کتنی ہی زیادہ ہو،*

فوجداری پٹیشن نمبر: 129-K/2025
(حکم مورخہ 26.05.2025 کے خلاف، جو کریمنل بیل درخواست نمبر S-107/2025 میں
ہائی کورٹ سندھ، میرپور خاص سرکٹ کی سنگل بینچ نے جاری کیا)
جرم کے قانون کے مطابق سزا تین سال سے زیادہ نہیں، اس لیے یہ ناقابل ضمانت (non-bailable) کی فہرست میں شامل نہیں۔

اگر جرم میں صرف جرمانہ کی سزا ممکن ہو، تو وہ جرم قابل ضمانت (bailable) بھی سمجھا جا سکتا ہے۔

دفعہ 506 PPC بھی Prohibitory Clause میں شامل نہیں۔

پاکستان کی عدالتی نظائر (jurisprudence) کے مطابق:

"ضمانت دینا اصول (Rule) ہے، اور انکار کرنا استثناء (Exception)۔"

ریکارڈ میں کوئی ایسی خاص وجوہات نہیں جو ضمانت سے انکار کا جواز بن سکیں۔

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
قانونی نکات 
(Legal Points)

Section 489-F PPC
 (Dishonoured Cheque)
 سزا تین سال یا جرمانہ یا دونوں؛ اس لیے
 Prohibitory Clause 
میں شامل نہیں۔

دفعہ 489-F تعزیراتِ پاکستان (PPC)

“جو کوئی کسی شخص کو کوئی چیک اس نیت سے دیتا ہے کہ وہ کسی مالی ذمہ داری کی ادائیگی کے لیے استعمال ہو، اور وہ چیک بعد میں رقم کی کمی یا کسی اور وجہ سے ڈِش آنر ہو جائے، تو اسے تین سال تک قید، یا جرمانہ، یا دونوں سزائیں دی جا سکتی ہیں۔”

قانونی نکتہ

یہ دفعہ مخلوط سزا
 (imprisonment OR fine OR both) 
فراہم کرتی ہے۔
جب کسی جرم میں صرف جرمانہ یا قید دونوں میں سے کوئی ایک سزا ہو،
تو قانون کے مطابق وہ جرم "Non-Prohibitory" سمجھا جاتا ہے —
یعنی ضمانت بنیادی حق ہے،
جبکہ انکار استثنائی صورت میں ممکن ہے۔

دفعہ 506 تعزیراتِ پاکستان (PPC)

“جو کوئی کسی کو جرم کرنے کی دھمکی دے کر خوف یا نقصان پہنچانے کی نیت رکھے، وہ اس جرم کا مرتکب ہو گا جس کی سزا دو سال تک قید، یا جرمانہ، یا دونوں ہو سکتی ہے۔”

قانونی نکتہ:

یہ جرم بھی غیر ممانعتی (Non-Prohibitory) زمرے میں آتا ہے۔
لہٰذا اس کے تحت بھی ضمانت بطورِ اصول دی جاتی ہے۔

دفعہ 497 ضابطہ فوجداری (Cr.P.C.) — Bail in Non-Bailable Offences
Prohibitory Clause:

اگر کسی جرم کی سزا موت، عمر قید، یا دس سال سے زائد ہو،
تو وہ Prohibitory Clause میں آتا ہے اور ضمانت صرف استثنائی حالات میں دی جا سکتی ہے۔

Non-Prohibitory Clause:

جب سزا اس سے کم ہو (جیسے 489-F یا 506 میں)،
تو عدالتوں نے متعدد فیصلوں میں اصول وضع کیا ہے کہ:

“In such offences, grant of bail is a rule, and refusal is an exception.”
(PLD 2020 SC 456 – Muhammad Tanveer vs The State)
(PLD 2019 SC 527 – Talib Hussain vs The State)
Section 497 Cr.P.C. — ایسے جرائم میں ضمانت عام طور پر حق ہے، انکار صرف استثنائی حالات میں۔

Principle: اگر جرم کی سزا تین سال یا کم ہو، تو ضمانت دینے کو ترجیح دی جائے گی۔

سپریم کورٹ کا قانونی استدلال (Reasoning of Supreme Court)
1. جرم کی نوعیت اور سزا کی حد

عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ 489-F PPC میں زیادہ سے زیادہ سزا تین سال ہے۔
لہٰذا یہ غیر ممانعتی جرم ہے۔
اسی اصول پر دفعہ 506 PPC بھی غیر ممانعتی شمار ہوئی۔

ضمانت دینے کا عمومی اصول

عدالت نے کہا کہ:

“Regardless of the magnitude of the transaction involved, the Court cannot exceed the maximum punishment prescribed under law.”
یعنی رقم زیادہ ہونے کے باوجود عدالت کو سزا کی زیادہ سے زیادہ حد (تین سال) سے تجاوز کا اختیار نہیں۔

جرمانہ بطور سزا — ضمانت کا حق

اگر کسی جرم میں صرف جرمانہ کی سزا ممکن ہو،
تو عدالتوں نے اسے deemed bailable offence تصور کیا ہے۔
(PLD 2020 SC 127 – Muhammad Bashir vs The State)

اسی اصول کی بنیاد پر سپریم کورٹ نے کہا کہ:

“If punishment of fine alone is taken into account, the offence would even be deemed bailable.”

کوئی غیر معمولی یا استثنائی وجہ موجود نہیں

عدالت نے ریکارڈ کا جائزہ لے کر کہا:

“There appears to be no exceptional circumstance emerging from the record, which may disentitle the petitioner to the concession of bail.”

یعنی ملزم کے خلاف ایسا کوئی عنصر نہیں جو اسے ضمانت سے محروم کرے،
لہٰذا ضمانت اصول کے طور پر دی گئی۔

مختصراً 

یہ فیصلہ واضح کرتا ہے کہ چیک ڈس آنر یا دھمکی جیسے جرائم میں عدالت ضمانت دینے کی پابند ہے جب تک کوئی غیر معمولی وجوہات (مثلاً سنگین ریکارڈ یا فرار کا خطرہ) سامنے نہ ہوں۔

*(ضبط شدہ مال کی فروخت کی رقم کی وصولی ۔ کسٹمز ایکٹ 1969 کی دفعہ 169(5) کے تحت غلط ضبطی کے عدالتی اعلان کی لازمی شرط)*
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
Supreme Court .... 
Mr. Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui 25-09-2025
 
فیصلہ۔۔۔۔۔
ریکارڈ سے ظاہر ہوتا ہے کہ درخواست گزار نے 
22.01.2021
 کو کلیکٹر کسٹمز پریوینٹو، ایم سی سی پشاور کے روبرو "بلیک ٹی" (کالی چائے) کی فروخت کی رقم کی وصولی کا دعویٰ دائر کیا۔ مذکورہ خط میں درخواست گزار نے متعلقہ چائے کی فروخت کی رقم کا دعویٰ درج ذیل طور پر کیا۔

کسٹمز عملے نے مذکورہ غیر ملکی ساختہ اسمگل شدہ بلیک ٹی اور متعلقہ گاڑی کو کسٹمز ایکٹ 1969 کی دفعہ 168 کے تحت ضبط کیا کیونکہ یہ دفعات 2(s)، 16 اور 157 کی خلاف ورزی میں تھی، جو کہ امیپورٹس اینڈ ایکسپورٹس (کنٹرول) ایکٹ 1950 کی دفعہ 3(1) کے ساتھ ملا کر لاگو ہوتی ہیں۔ یہ جرم کسٹمز ایکٹ 1969 کی دفعہ 156(1)(8)(89) کے تحت قابلِ سزا تھا جو مذکورہ امیپورٹس اینڈ ایکسپورٹس (کنٹرول) ایکٹ 1950 کی دفعہ 3(3) کے ساتھ ملا کر پڑھا جاتا ہے۔

ضروری کارروائی مکمل ہونے کے بعد کیس ڈپٹی کلیکٹر کسٹمز اینٹی اسمگلنگ ڈویژن، پشاور کے سامنے رکھا گیا، جنہوں نے آرڈر اِن اوریجنل نمبر 123/2011 مؤرخہ 19.08.2011 کے تحت ضبط شدہ چائے کو بحقِ سرکار ضبط (Confiscate) کر لیا اور گاڑی کو بینک گارنٹی نمبر 20/2011 مؤرخہ 09.03.2011 کے عوض 1,30,000 روپے پر رہا کر دیا۔

3. فروخت کی رقم (sale proceeds) کا مطالبہ کسٹمز ایکٹ 1969 کی دفعہ 169(5) کے تحت کیا جا رہا تھا، جس میں یہ بیان کیا گیا ہے کہ اگر عدالتی یا اپیلی کارروائی میں یہ ثابت ہو جائے کہ ضبط شدہ سامان دراصل ضبطی کے قابل نہیں تھا، تو اس کی فروخت سے حاصل شدہ مکمل رقم (محصولات یا واجبات منہا کر کے) مالک کو ادا کی جائے گی۔
تاہم، درخواست گزار نے ابھی تک ایسا کوئی عدالتی یا اپیلی فیصلہ حاصل نہیں کیا جس میں یہ قرار دیا گیا ہو کہ سامان غلطی سے ضبط کیا گیا تھا، بلکہ وہ براہِ راست فروخت کی رقم کا مطالبہ کر رہا ہے۔

ریفرنس دائرہ اختیار میں دیے گئے Custom Reference No. 27-P of 2018 کے فیصلے میں ضبطی و ضبط شدگی کی قانونی حیثیت کو حتمی طور پر طے کر دیا گیا ہے۔ اس فیصلے کے خلاف Civil Appeal No.176 of 2020 دائر کی گئی تھی جو خارج کر دی گئی۔

4. لہٰذا، کسٹمز ایکٹ کے تحت فروخت کی رقم حاصل کرنے کے لیے ضروری ہے کہ یہ اعلان یا فیصلہ حاصل کیا جائے کہ ضبط شدہ سامان غلطی سے ضبط کیا گیا تھا۔
یہ رقم صرف اسی وقت مالک کو دی جا سکتی ہے جب وہ کسی عدالتی، اپیلی یا دادرسی کارروائی میں یہ ثابت کر دے کہ سامان ضبطی کے قابل نہیں تھا۔

مذکورہ صورتحال میں سی پی ایل اے (CPLA) میں کوئی وزن نہیں بنتا، لہٰذا درخواست ناقابلِ غور قرار دے کر مسترد کی جاتی ہے اور اجازتِ اپیل (leave to appeal) دینے سے انکار کیا جاتا ہے۔

خلاصہ برائے فہمِ عام 
عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ جب تک درخواست گزار یہ ثابت نہیں کرتا کہ ضبط شدہ چائے غلطی سے ضبط کی گئی تھی، وہ اس کی فروخت سے حاصل شدہ رقم کا حقدار نہیں۔ کیونکہ پہلے کے فیصلوں میں ضبطی درست قرار دی جا چکی ہے، لہٰذا عدالت نے درخواست ناقابلِ سماعت قرار دے کر خارج کر دی۔

قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 
(Analytical Legal Review) 
 1. Customs Act, 1969
Section 2(s) — “smuggle”
Bare Act Wording:

“Smuggle” means to bring into or take out of Pakistan, in breach of any prohibition or restriction for the time being in force, or evading payment of customs duties or taxes, any goods; and includes any act or omission which renders such goods liable to confiscation under this Act.
“اسمگل” سے مراد کسی بھی ایسی شے کو پاکستان میں لانا یا پاکستان سے باہر لے جانا ہے جو کسی مروجہ ممانعت یا پابندی کی خلاف ورزی کرتے ہوئے یا کسٹمز ڈیوٹی یا ٹیکس کی ادائیگی سے بچتے ہوئے ہو۔ اس میں وہ تمام اعمال یا کوتاہیاں بھی شامل ہیں جن سے وہ مال ضبطی کے قابل ہو جائے۔

قانونی تجزیہ:

یہ تعریف “اسمگلنگ” کے تصور کو بہت وسیع کرتی ہے۔

صرف غیر قانونی درآمد یا برآمد ہی نہیں بلکہ ڈیوٹی کی ادائیگی سے بچنے یا کسی لائسنس کی خلاف ورزی کو بھی اسمگلنگ قرار دیا گیا ہے۔

لہٰذا اگر چائے (Tea) ایسی ہو جو بغیر قانونی درآمدی دستاویزات کے ملک میں داخل کی گئی، تو وہ “اسمگل شدہ مال” قرار پاتی ہے۔

Section 16 — Prohibitions and restrictions
Bare Act Wording:

No goods specified in the rules or notified by the Federal Government shall be imported or exported except in accordance with the conditions prescribed thereunder.
ایسے تمام مال جو حکومتِ پاکستان کی طرف سے نوٹیفائی یا قواعد میں بیان کیے گئے ہوں، ان کی درآمد یا برآمد صرف انہی شرائط کے مطابق ہو سکتی ہے جو حکومت نے مقرر کی ہوں۔

قانونی تجزیہ:

یہ دفعہ درآمد و برآمد پر حکومتی کنٹرول کو مضبوط کرتی ہے۔

اگر کوئی مال (مثلاً چائے) ایسی کیٹیگری میں آتا ہے جس کے لیے درآمدی پرمٹ یا لائسنس درکار ہے، تو اس کے بغیر درآمد کرنا قانونی خلاف ورزی شمار ہوگی۔

موجودہ کیس میں، “Black Tea of foreign origin” بغیر درآمدی دستاویز کے لائی گئی تھی، لہٰذا یہ دفعہ 16 کی خلاف ورزی ہے۔

Section 157 — Liability of agent and owner
Bare Act Wording:
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
When any person is liable to any penalty under this Act, every person who was knowingly concerned in the act or omission shall also be liable to such penalty.
اگر کوئی شخص اس ایکٹ کے تحت کسی سزا یا جرمانے کا ذمہ دار ہے تو وہ تمام افراد جو اس عمل یا کوتاہی میں جان بوجھ کر شریک ہوں، وہ بھی اسی سزا یا جرمانے کے ذمہ دار ہوں گے۔

قانونی تجزیہ:

یہ ذمہ داری کی توسیع کا اصول ہے۔

یعنی اگر گاڑی کا مالک، ڈرائیور یا مالکِ چائے تینوں میں سے کوئی بھی اس عمل میں شامل ہو، سب ذمہ دار قرار دیے جا سکتے ہیں۔

اس کیس میں اگر گاڑی کے مالک نے علم کے باوجود اسمگل شدہ مال کی نقل و حمل کی اجازت دی، تو وہ بھی شریکِ جرم ہے۔

Section 156(1)(8) and (89) — Offences and penalties
Bare Act Wording (Relevant Clauses):

(8) If any goods are imported or exported contrary to any prohibition or restriction imposed by or under this Act or any other law, such goods shall be liable to confiscation and the person concerned shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten times the value of the goods.

(89) If any person acquires possession of, or is in any way concerned in carrying, removing, depositing, harboring, keeping, or dealing with goods which he knows or has reason to believe are liable to confiscation under this Act, he shall be liable to a penalty and such goods shall be liable to confiscation.

(8) اگر کوئی سامان ایسی ممانعت یا پابندی کے خلاف درآمد یا برآمد کیا جائے جو اس قانون یا کسی دوسرے قانون کے تحت عائد ہو، تو وہ سامان ضبطی کے قابل ہوگا اور ملوث شخص پر اس کی مالیت کے دس گنا تک جرمانہ عائد کیا جا سکتا ہے۔
(89) اگر کوئی شخص ایسا سامان حاصل کرے، منتقل کرے، ذخیرہ کرے یا اس سے کسی بھی طور پر معاملہ کرے، جس کے متعلق اسے معلوم ہو یا یقین ہو کہ وہ ضبطی کے قابل ہے، تو وہ بھی قابلِ سزا ہوگا اور سامان ضبط کیا جائے گا۔

قانونی تجزیہ:

دفعہ 156 اسمگلنگ سے متعلق سزا و ضبطی کی بنیادی دفعہ ہے۔

یہاں دو پہلو نمایاں ہیں:

پابندی کے خلاف درآمد یا برآمد

علم کے باوجود ضبطی کے قابل مال سے تعلق

لہٰذا اگر کسی شخص کے علم میں ہو کہ یہ چائے اسمگل شدہ ہے، تب بھی وہ قابلِ سزا ہے۔

Section 168 — Seizure of goods liable to confiscation
Bare Act Wording:

Any officer of Customs duly authorized may seize any goods which he has reason to believe are liable to confiscation under this Act.
کوئی بھی مجاز کسٹمز افسر اگر یہ یقین رکھتا ہو کہ کوئی سامان اس قانون کے تحت ضبطی کے قابل ہے، تو وہ اسے ضبط کر سکتا ہے۔

قانونی تجزیہ:

یہ ضبطی کی ابتدائی قانونی بنیاد ہے۔

محض “reason to believe” کافی ہے — مکمل ثبوت کی ضرورت نہیں۔

لہٰذا کسٹمز عملے کی جانب سے چائے ضبط کرنا قانون کے مطابق تھا۔

Section 169(5) — Disposal of confiscated goods
Bare Act Wording:

If on such adjudication or in an appeal or proceedings in court, the goods sold are found not liable to confiscation, the entire sale proceeds after necessary deductions shall be handed over to the owner.

اگر عدالتی یا اپیلی کارروائی میں یہ طے ہو جائے کہ فروخت شدہ سامان ضبطی کے قابل نہیں تھا، تو اس کی فروخت سے حاصل شدہ رقم (واجبات منہا کر کے) مالک کو واپس کر دی جائے گی۔

قانونی تجزیہ:

یہ ریفنڈ یا کلیم کا قانونی حق ہے۔

لیکن یہ حق مشروط ہے کہ عدالت یا اپیل میں پہلے یہ ثابت ہو کہ ضبطی غلط تھی۔

موجودہ کیس میں درخواست گزار نے یہ فیصلہ حاصل کیے بغیر براہِ راست رقم مانگی، لہٰذا درخواست ناقابلِ قبول تھی۔

 2. Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1950
Section 3(1)
Bare Act Wording:

The Federal Government may, by order published in the official Gazette, prohibit, restrict or otherwise control the import or export of any goods.
وفاقی حکومت سرکاری گزٹ میں حکم جاری کر کے کسی بھی مال کی درآمد یا برآمد پر پابندی، تحدید یا کنٹرول عائد کر سکتی ہے۔

Section 3(3)
Bare Act Wording:

If any person contravenes any order made under this section, he shall be deemed to have committed an offence punishable under the Customs Act, 1969.

اگر کوئی شخص اس دفعہ کے تحت جاری کردہ کسی حکم کی خلاف ورزی کرے، تو اسے کسٹمز ایکٹ 1969 کے تحت قابلِ سزا جرم سمجھا جائے گا۔

قانونی تجزیہ:

یہ دفعات امیپورٹس/ایکسپورٹس کے کنٹرول کو کسٹمز ایکٹ کے ساتھ منسلک کرتی ہیں۔

مطلب یہ کہ اگر کوئی ممنوعہ شے بغیر اجازت درآمد کی جائے، تو وہ کسٹمز جرم کے زمرے میں آتی ہے۔

اس کیس میں “foreign origin black tea” ایک ایسی شے تھی جو درآمدی اجازت کے بغیر ملک میں لائی گئی، اس لیے یہ خلاف ورزی ثابت ہوئی۔
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
 (Comprehensive Legal Review)
پہلو قانونی نتیجہ
اسمگل شدہ مال کی تعریف (S.2(s)) چائے غیر قانونی طور پر لائی گئی، لہٰذا اسمگل شدہ قرار پاتی ہے۔
درآمد پر حکومتی کنٹرول (S.16 + Imports Act S.3) بغیر اجازت درآمد قانوناً ممنوع تھی۔
ضبطی (S.168) کسٹمز کو مال ضبط کرنے کا قانونی اختیار حاصل تھا۔
سزا اور ضبطی (S.156) ضبطی کے ساتھ ساتھ جرمانہ بھی قانونی طور پر جائز تھا۔
رقم کی واپسی (S.169(5)) رقم صرف تب دی جا سکتی ہے جب عدالت یہ طے کرے کہ ضبطی غلط تھی — جو اس کیس میں نہیں ہوا۔
عدالتی نتیجہ درخواست گزار کا دعویٰ قبل از وقت (premature) اور ناقابلِ سماعت تھا۔

مختصراً ۔۔۔۔

عدالت نے درست طور پر قرار دیا کہ:

ضبطی کسٹمز ایکٹ کے مطابق تھی۔

درخواست گزار کو پہلے adjudication یا appeal میں یہ ثابت کرنا ہوگا کہ سامان ضبطی کے قابل نہیں تھا۔

جب تک ایسا فیصلہ نہیں آتا، Section 169(5) کے تحت فروخت کی رقم نہیں دی جا سکتی۔

اس لیے CPLA کا دائر کرنا قبل از وقت تھا اور عدالت نے درست طور پر leave to appeal مسترد کر دی۔

Chemical formula of Heroin is C21H23NO5, its Molecular weight is 369.417 g/mol., its chemical name is diacetylmorphine and also known as diamorphine.

Heroin does not have a single “Chemical Code”, rather it is identified by several standardized chemical codes and names. The technical, scientific/systematic name as per International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) for Heroin is (5a,6a)-7,8-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-17-methylmorphinan-3,6-diol diacetate. It is a semi-synthetic opioid. It is manufactured from morphine, a natural substance extracted from the seed pod of the opium poppy. When Heroin enters the body it is quickly metabolized into other compounds. It is first broken down into                     6-monoacetylmorphine (6 MAM) and then further into morphine which then binds to opioid receptors in the brain.

 Substance usually may be organic or inorganic; laboratory through analysis can determine that it is organic or inorganic substance and furthermore can also see its chemical composition. Now question does arise that if substance sent in this case to Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore was not found as Heroin then what was it? What was its chemical composition/formula, structure, molecular weight and chemical code as well as properties/sedative or toxic effect? But report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore in this case is silent on these vital aspects.

 Therefore, Director General of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore will ensure in future that chemical composition/formula, chemical name, structure, molecular weight, chemical code and chemical properties/sedative or toxic effect of the substance will be mentioned in the report in crystal clear manner i.e. in black and white. And if for any valid reason, it is not possible for the laboratory to determine the exact nature of the substance or detail of its components, then laboratory has to give comprehensive detail as well as reasons in the report, in this regard. Investigating Agencies of the narcotics cases shall emphasis for and get the report containing aforementioned details from the laboratory.

Registrar of this Court will send copy of this order to Director General of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, Director General of Anti-Narcotics Force and Inspector General of Police, Punjab Lahore for information as well as compliance, after due process.

If the leave is granted, the second phase follows, in which the suit is treated as a regular/ordinary trial: issues are framed, parties adduce their evidence, the burden of proof is determined in the light of those issues, and the case is decided on merits, in accordance with the general procedure of the CPC and law of evidence.

Can a Court dismiss the objections to the award but at the same time refuse to make the award a Rule of the Court on the ground that the application to that effect was not within limitation? Held: The law of limitation contemplates general principle of administration of justice, which has the effect of preventing a party from having recourse to redressal of rights through judicial process even where such rights subsist and therefore, any law whereby the recourse to the Court(s) is restricted, must be construed strictly. This Court is of the view that once an award is before the Court, either through the Arbitrator(s) or any party (for example the respondent), then in terms of Section 17 of the Arbitration Act 1940, it is the duty of Court to examine the same and see whether it suffers from any patent illegality or if there is any cause to remit the award to the Arbitrator(s) irrespective of the fact that opposite party (the petitioner in present case) has not approached the Court within time. Furthermore, it is the duty of the Court to scrutinize the award, which is independent of the fact whether any side has objected to the same or not or the application of one of the parties to arbitration proceedings is time barred.

A perusal of the record reveals that though the petitioner had been arrested by Sajid Abbas, SI, who had with him a mobile phone device having a camera module, the phone number of which mobile phone device has been mentioned in the F.I.R, still neither Sajid Abbas, SI nor the Investigating Officer of the case made any effort to record the incident of arrest of the petitioner and the recovery from him. Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, Order 1984 permits the use of any evidence that may have become available because of modern devices or techniques; however, the policing authorities continue to not use the said modern devices and techniques resulting in loss of credible evidence. Had the complainant or the Investigating Officer of the case recorded the incident of recovery from the petitioner, the said video footage would have provided the best evidence against the petitioner, however, for reasons best known to the complainant and the Investigating Officer of the case, the cameras, though available with the complainant and the Investigating Officer of the case, were not used for the said purpose.

VVVI.MUST READ JUDGEMENT

 Whether the evidence of a witness who is not physically present in court can be recorded in a civil case by using the modern technology of video conferencing, within the existing legal framework.?

Rule 4 of Order 18 of the CPC (“Rule 4”), provides that the evidence of the witnesses in attendance shall be taken orally in open court in the presence and under the personal direction and superintendence of the judge. Although the expression “witnesses in attendance” used in Rule 4 is not followed by the words “in court”, the reading of the Rule as a whole leaves little room to doubt that the attendance of the witnesses referred to therein means the attendance of the witnesses in court. However, what is unclear is whether this “attendance” means only “physical attendance” or may include “virtual attendance” by video conferencing. Can the word “attendance” used in Rule 4 be extended to “virtual attendance”?

  In order to answer the above question it is important to highlight the conceptual role of a court in a constitutional democracy.   The role of a judge is to understand the purpose of law in the society and to help the law achieve its purpose. Law is a living organism and must respond to the changing social realities of the time. Indeed when social reality changes, the law must change too. Just as the change in social reality is the law of life, responsiveness to change in social reality is the life of the law. Legislative intent must be viewed in its changing environment by treating the statute as a living organism. The court cannot be insensitive to the system in which the statute operates. If the statute or the legislative intent is to be viewed as at the time of its origin, it freezes the meaning of the statute at the historical moment of its legislation, which may no longer be relevant to the meaning of the statute in modern times. To limit the meaning of the statute to its original legislative intent only reduces the judge into a historian and an archaeologist whereby he looks backward instead of forward. Sterility and stagnation defeat the purpose of law and defy its organic character. The best way forward to assess the legislative intent of a law is to examine its purpose today by considering its objectives, the goals, the interests, the values, the policy, and the function that the statute is designed to actualize. Change in social reality today also depends on the rapid development of technology to which the law cannot shut its eyes. While law develops gradually and technology is often far ahead of the legislature and the judicature, both these institutions must move forward and ackownledge the technological advances in developing the law, which cannot stand still and must adapt to the changes in society. In the process of interpreting laws, judges must endeavor to bridge the gap between law and society. The intersection of law and technology not only requires the law to regulate technology but also to employ technology to make laws more at home with the technology-savvy society.

When we examine the question as to extending the word “attendance” used in Rule 4 to “virtual attendance” in light of the above principle of updating construction, there remains no difficulty to find the right answer. What we need to do is to see: what are the legislative purpose and policy in requiring the attendance of a witness in court for recording his evidence, and whether extending the word “attendance” used in Rule 4 to “virtual attendance” would fulfill or defeat that purpose and policy. The legislative purpose, in this regard, is evident from Rule 4 itself, that is, the evidence of the witness is to be recorded: (i) in open court, and (ii) under the personal superintendence of the judge. It is also not hard to discern the legislative policy. The recording of evidence of a witness in an open court under the personal superintendence of the judge ensures that the witness may give the evidence, of his free will as per his conscience without being under the influence of any other person.  

The “virtual attendance” of a witness in court through the medium of video conferencing enables the judge and other persons present in court to see the witness and hear what he says, and vice versa. Such an attendance is thus, in effect, in open court, and his evidence is also recorded under the personal superintendence of the judge. The judge under whose superintendence the evidence through video conferencing is recorded can satisfy himself about the free will of the witness present on screen as he does about the witness present physically in court by questioning him in this regard and ensuring that he is not under the immediate influence of any other person. Needless to say that a court can ensure the independence of a witness only from the immediate influence, not from any covert influence, of any other person in both situations whether he is physically present or virtually present in court. In the latter situation, the court can ensure that there is no other person in the room where the witness is sitting, while his evidence is being recorded, by asking him to provide a full view of that room on the screen. The identity of the witness, if disputed, can also be verified by the judge through appropriate means. The witness can be confronted on screen with documents produced or sought to be produced in court by any of the parties or, if needed, the scanned copies of such documents can be sent to him through modern means of communication. In all such necessary matters as to the recording of evidence, the physical attendance and the virtual attendance of a witness in court do not differ.The virtual attendance of a witness in court, thus, appears to be the species of the genus of “attendance” required under Rule 4 and fulfills the legislative purpose and policy in requiring the attendance of a witness in court for recording his evidence. Therefore, we can legitimately conclude that the word “attendance” used in Rule 4 can be extended to “virtual attendance”, and the word “attendance” mentioned in this Rule does not mean only “physical attendance” but includes “virtual attendance” made possible by the modern technology of video conferencing.  

Next, we proceed to examine under which provision of the CPC can a court make an order for the virtual attendance of a witness as there is no such provision in Order XVI of the CPC, which relates to ‘Summoning and Attendance of Witnesses’. Whether a court can make such an order, in the exercise of its inherent powers under Section 151 of the CPC.  
  
Admittedly, the CPC is silent on the matter of evidence recording through video conferencing: there is no express provision either allowing or prohibiting such procedure of recording evidence. And regarding the procedural law, it is a well-settled principle that the ‘courts are not to act upon the principle that every procedure is to be taken to be prohibited unless it is expressly provided for by the Code [of Civil Procedure], but on the converse principle that every procedure is to be understood as permissible till it is shown to be prohibited by law. As a matter of general principle, prohibition cannot be presumed.The provisions of Section 151, which empowers the civil courts to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the court, are intended to preclude the possibility of the civil courts being stuck in a situation for any omission in the CPC. The inherent powers of the civil courts saved by Section 151 are thus supplementary to their powers stated expressly in the CPC and are to be exercised where the situation is not covered by any provision of the CPC. It hardly needs lengthy arguments to establish that when in the circumstances of a case, requiring physical attendance of a witness in court will incur an unnecessary amount of delay, expense or inconvenience, the order of the court allowing virtual attendance of a witness through video conferencing is for the ends of justice, and the rejection of an unjustifiable insistence of the opposing party on securing physical attendance of such witness in court is to prevent abuse of the process of the court. An order allowing virtual attendance of the witness in such circumstances thus squarely falls within the scope of Section 151 of the CPC.  

Article 164 of the QSO provides that in such cases as the court may consider appropriate, the court may allow to be produced any evidence that may have become available because of modern devices or techniques. The QSO is mainly a procedural law; its provisions are therefore to be construed liberally, not restrictively, to advance the remedy. As per Article 2(1)(c) of the QSO, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context, the term "evidence" used in the QSO is to include: (i) all statements which the Court permits or requires be made before it by witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under inquiry - such statements are called oral evidence; and (ii) all documents produced for the inspection of the Court - such documents are called documentary evidence. 

The oral evidence of a witness that may become available because of the modern technique of video conferencing, does fall within the scope of the provisions of Article 164 of the QSO.  Article 164 of the QSO is actually our gateway to allowing modern science and technology to come into our courtrooms. ‘If justice is to be done, then law must not become stagnant or archaic while society moves forward. It must be accessible, intelligible and must change with the time, responding to the realities of modern life.’ In the present age of information technology, no one can dispute the advantages of the use of this technology in courts for improving the efficiency of the judicial process and reducing the delay in the dispensation of justice. As the ultimate objective of the law is to serve society, the courts need to embrace and use technological developments with a pragmatic and dynamic approach in case management and court proceedings, for dispensing justice more efficiently and expeditiously. The above interpretation of the various provisions of law allowing modern technology of video conferencing to be read into the exiting enactments enhances access to justice, promotes fair trial and introduces inexpensive and expeditious justice thereby advancing the fundamental rights under articles 9 and 10A and principle of policy under article 37(d) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 

We find it necessary to underline here that although the powers conferred by Section 151 of the CPC and Article 164 of the QSO are discretionary, the courts are to exercise them judiciously, not arbitrarily or mechanically, on the filing of an application in this regard by a party to the proceedings. This discretion, like all other discretions, is to be exercised judiciously for valid reasons by considering the circumstances of the case. In exercising the discretion, the courts are to see: (i) whether the evidence of the witness appears essential to the just decision of the case, and (ii) whether requiring physical attendance of the witness in court would incur unreasonable delay, expense or inconvenience. We have inferred the standard of “unreasonable delay, expense or inconvenience” from the legislature’s wisdom. The standard of unreasonable “delay or expense” for relaxing adherence to certain general rules of the law of evidence has been provided in Articles 46, 47 and 71 of the QSO, while Sections 503 and 512 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 add the ground of unreasonable “inconvenience” to the said two grounds for creating exceptions to some general rules of recording the evidence of witnesses.

کسی گاڑی یا جائیداد کو اسی وقت ضبط کیا جا سکتا ہے جب یہ ثابت ہو جائے کہ مالک کو علم تھا کہ اس کی گاڑی یا جائیداد منشیات کی ترسیل کے لیے استعمال ہو رہی ہے۔

اردو تعریف:

> اگر مالک کو جرم کا علم نہ ہو، تو اس کی گاڑی ضبط نہیں کی جا سکتی۔

---

🔹 دفعہ 516-A – ضابطہ فوجداری 1898 (Criminal Procedure Code)

موضوع: عدالتی تحویل (Superdari) میں مال یا جائیداد دینا
مفہوم:
اگر کسی مقدمے میں کوئی گاڑی یا مال بطور ثبوت ضبط کیا گیا ہو، تو عدالت مقدمہ ختم ہونے سے پہلے اسے عارضی طور پر مالک کے سپرد (Superdari) کر سکتی ہے، بشرطیکہ مناسب ضمانت (Surety) دی جائے۔

اردو تعریف:

> عدالت کسی گاڑی کو مقدمہ ختم ہونے سے پہلے اس کے اصل مالک کے حوالے کر سکتی ہے تاکہ وہ ضائع نہ ہو۔

---

📄 مقدمے کے حقائق (Facts of the Case):

1. پولیس نے ایک ٹرک سے منشیات (Opium) برآمد کی۔

2. یہ گاڑی محمد اسد کے نام پر 18 نومبر 2020 سے رجسٹرڈ تھی۔

3. تاہم، محمد اسد کو ملزم یا شریکِ جرم نہیں بنایا گیا۔

4. مقدمے کے دوران محمد اسد نے عدالت سے درخواست دی کہ اس کی گاڑی اسے عارضی طور پر واپس (Superdari) دی جائے۔

5. ٹرائل کورٹ نے یہ درخواست رد کر دی۔

6. اس فیصلے کے خلاف اسد نے ہائی کورٹ بلوچستان میں اپیل دائر کی۔

---

⚖️ قانونی سوالات (Legal Issues):

1. کیا عدالت ٹرائل مکمل ہونے سے پہلے گاڑی کو مالک کے سپرد کر سکتی ہے؟

2. کیا ضبطی (Confiscation) صرف اسی صورت میں ممکن ہے جب مالک کو جرم کا علم ہو؟

3. اگر مالک کا جرم میں کوئی کردار نہیں، تو کیا اس کی گاڑی ضبط رہ سکتی ہے؟

---

🧾 عدالت کے مشاہدات (Court’s Observations):

🔸 1. گاڑی کی ملکیت (Ownership) تسلیم شدہ تھی:

عدالت نے نوٹ کیا کہ:

> “گاڑی محمد اسد کے نام پر باقاعدہ رجسٹرڈ تھی، اور یہ رجسٹریشن منشیات کی برآمدگی سے پہلے کی تھی۔”

---

🔸 2. مالک کا جرم میں کوئی کردار ثابت نہیں ہوا:

> “استغاثہ (Prosecution) یہ ثابت کرنے میں ناکام رہا کہ مالک کو علم تھا کہ اس کی گاڑی منشیات کی ترسیل کے لیے استعمال ہو رہی ہے۔”

---

🔸 3. ضبطی کی قانونی شرائط پوری نہیں ہوئیں:

دفعہ 34 کے مطابق:

> "کوئی گاڑی ضبط نہیں کی جا سکتی جب تک یہ ثابت نہ ہو جائے کہ مالک کو جرم کا علم تھا۔"

---

🔸 4. ٹرائل کورٹ کا حکم “غیر قانونی اور غیر مدلل” تھا:

ہائی کورٹ نے کہا کہ:

> “ٹرائل کورٹ نے گاڑی ضبط رکھنے کا جو حکم دیا، وہ Non-Speaking Order تھا — یعنی اس میں کوئی واضح وجہ بیان نہیں کی گئی۔”

---

🏛️ فیصلہ (Judgment):

ٹرائل کورٹ کا فیصلہ مورخہ 20.07.2024 منسوخ (Set Aside)

گاڑی (Truck) محمد اسد کے حوالے کرنے کا حکم دیا گیا،
بشرطیکہ متعلقہ محکمے (Excise, Police) سے تصدیق و فزیکل ویریفکیشن کر لی جائے۔

استغاثہ (Prosecution) گاڑی ضبط رکھنے کی کوئی ٹھوس وجہ پیش نہ کر سکا۔

اپیل منظور (Appeal Allowed)

---

📚 عدالتی اصول (Legal Principles Settled):

نکتہ وضاحت

🔹 مالک کی لاعلمی (Lack of Knowledge) اگر مالک کو جرم کا علم نہ ہو تو گاڑی ضبط نہیں کی جا سکتی۔
🔹 Superdari کا حق ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 516-A کے تحت، عدالت مقدمہ ختم ہونے سے پہلے گاڑی واپس کر سکتی ہے۔
🔹 Prosecution کا بوجھِ ثبوت (Burden of Proof) یہ ثابت کرنا استغاثہ کی ذمہ داری ہے کہ مالک کو علم تھا کہ گاڑی منشیات کے لیے استعمال ہو رہی ہے۔
🔹 Non-Speaking Order ایسا عدالتی حکم جس میں وجوہات بیان نہ کی گئی ہوں، قانوناً برقرار نہیں رہ سکتا۔

---

🧠 **خلاصہ (Summary in Urdu):

بلوچستان ہائی کورٹ نے قرار دیا کہ اگر کوئی گاڑی منشیات کی ترسیل کے دوران پکڑی جائے مگر مالک کے خلاف کوئی ثبوت نہ ہو کہ اسے جرم کا علم تھا، تو اس کی گاڑی ضبط نہیں کی جا سکتی۔
مزید یہ کہ ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 516-A کے تحت عدالت گاڑی کو Superdari پر مالک کے حوالے کر سکتی ہے تاکہ وہ ضائع نہ ہو۔

Before Rozi Khan Barrech and Shaukat Ali Rakhshani, JJ

MUHAMMAD ASAD---Appellant

versus

The STATE---Respondent

Criminal CNS Appeal No. 364 of 2024, decided on 10th March, 2025.

Control of Narcotic Substances Act (XXV of 1997)---

----Ss. 9(c) & 34---Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898), S. 516-A---Transportation of narcotics---Articles connected with narcotics---Order for custody and disposal of property pending trial in certain cases---Scope---Appellant assailed order passed by Trial Court whereby his application for superdari of vehicle, from which narcotics was recovered, was dismissed---Validity---Admittedly, the vehicle in question was registered in the name of appellant way back on 18.11.2020, even before the seizure of vehicle in the crime ibid, but the appellant was neither booked in the instant case as a co-accused nor figured anywhere as an absconder---Albeit, there was sluggishness on the part of applicant to approach the Court in time during the trial, but merely on such ground, the appellant could not be deprived of his vehicle, more particularly, when he had not been attributed any role in the instant case---Appellant claimed that he had rented out the vehicle in question to accused and he was absolutely unaware about the said narcotics concealed and transported in his vehicle---Clause (2) of Section ibid empowers the Trial Court to confiscate the vehicle on conclusion of the trial, provided no vehicle or conveyance shall be confiscated unless it is proved that owner thereof knows that the offence is being or was to be committed---Thus, it was the duty of the prosecution to establish that the owner of the vehicle was having knowledge about the presence of the narcotics in his vehicle, which was not the case---Besides, the impugned order dated 20.07.2024 was also contrary to law and non-speaking. which could not be allowed to hold field---Impugned judgment dated 19.08.2022 passed by the Trial Court to the extent of confiscation of truck was set aside and the vehicle in question was ordered to be released to the appellant, after due verification and physical examination from the concerned departments---Appeal was allowed, in circumstances.

Criminal Appeals Nos.56 of 1999 and 288 of 2004, decided on 9th February, 2010.

(a) Malicious prosecution---

Remedies in civil and criminal law.

Distinction---In domain of civil law, the person wronged can file a suit for damages for malicious prosecution.

Such is a personal action and dies with death of either of the parties.

Libel or defamation in criminal law, besides being personal injury is an offence against society as it may have potential of disturbing public peace.

Such action survives death of complainant if imputation not only harms reputation of that person but is also intended to be hurtful to his family members or force or institution of which the deceased was member. 

Ss.500, 501 & 502--- Defamation.

Death of complainant---Impleading of legal heirs---Principle---Person specific and transaction specific complaint---Effect.

Complainant filed private complaint under Ss.500, 501 and 502, P.P.C. against accused for publishing report against him in his newspaper.

Complainant died during pendency of proceedings and his legal heirs were impleaded as complainants in the case---Validity.

Held, it was not a case which fell in the category of cases where complaint would survive the complainant.

Libel published in the newspaper was directed against the person of complainant alone.

Publication could be wrong and scandalous but the fact remained that it was person specific and transaction specific.

In the complaint filed by complainant and statement made by him before Trial Court, there was no allegation that libel had in any manner injured reputation of his family or relatives.

Order passed by High Court was set aside and complaints subject-matter of appeal pending in Trial Court were declared to have abated.

Registration of FIR or initiation of criminal proceedings through attorney are permissible under the law.

An attorney of a person can lodge an FIR with the police and can also initiate criminal proceedings before a Court for the interest of his Principal. If the proceedings before the court were initiated by the principal, and he becomes unavailable or incapacitated, the attorney can also continue it on his behalf with the permission of the Court. Court should also encourage such practice keeping in view the hardships involved in the case to reduce delays in(naeem) the criminal process which would restore the confidence of public on the courts of law for acquisition or regulation of their rights. There is no doubt that Court shall decide the matter on production of relevant evidence only that can also be recorded by using modern techniques like through online applications. Misuse of process by attorney, through registration of false FIR or filing of private complaint, can well be met through sound remedial measures including action pursuant to sections 181, 182, 211, 213 and 250 of the Pakistan Penal Code(naeem) 1860. Thus, contention of learned counsel for the petitioners that FIR cannot be registered through attorney is nothing but farce.

فیصلہ ۔،
قرار دیا گیا کہ آرڈر XXXVII سی۔پی۔سی کے تحت ایک سمری سوٹ (Summary Suit) عام طور پر دو مراحل پر مشتمل ہوتا ہے

پہلا مرحلہ: یہ وہ مرحلہ ہے جو مقدمہ دائر ہونے سے شروع ہوتا ہے اور Leave to Defend (دفاع کی اجازت) پر فیصلہ ہونے تک جاری رہتا ہے۔
اگر عدالت دائرہ اختیار (jurisdiction) کی بنیاد پر دعویٰ واپس کر دے یا دفاع کی اجازت (leave) دینے سے انکار کر دے، تو مقدمہ اسی مرحلے پر ختم ہو جاتا ہے۔

دوسرا مرحلہ: اگر دفاع کی اجازت (leave to defend) دے دی جائے، تو اس کے بعد مقدمہ ایک معمول کے ٹرائل (regular/ordinary trial) کی صورت اختیار کر لیتا ہے۔
اس میں:

فریم آف ایشوز (Issues Framed) کیے جاتے ہیں،

فریقین اپنا ثبوت پیش کرتے ہیں،

بوجھِ ثبوت
 (Burden of Proof)
 طے کیا جاتا ہے،
اور

مقدمہ کوئین آف ایویڈنس (قانونِ شہادت) اور سی۔پی۔سی کے عمومی طریقہ کار کے مطابق اصولی طور پر میرٹس پر فیصلہ کیا جاتا ہے۔
قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 
Order XXXVII – Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
یہ آرڈر اُن معاملات کے لیے بنایا گیا ہے جہاں فریقِ مدعی کے پاس واضح اور تحریری ثبوت موجود ہو (جیسے Promissory Note, Bill of Exchange, Cheque وغیرہ)، اور جہاں عدالت جلد فیصلہ دے سکتی ہے بغیر طویل ٹرائل کے۔

یہ رول طے کرتا ہے کہ کن اقسام کے مقدمات Summary Suits کے زمرے میں آتے ہیں، جیسے:

Negotiable Instruments (Bills of Exchange, Hundis, Promissory Notes)

Written Contracts where money is due

 قانونی نکتہ
یہ دفعہ محدود دائرہ کار فراہم کرتی ہے تاکہ صرف وہ مقدمات اس طریقہ کار کے تحت آئیں جن میں دعویٰ واضح، تحریری اور غیر متنازع ہو۔

Rule 2 – Institution of Summary Suit
مدعی دعویٰ دائر کرتا ہے اور دعویٰ کے ساتھ واضح طور پر یہ ذکر کرتا ہے کہ یہ Order XXXVII CPC کے تحت ہے۔

قانونی نکتہ
یہاں عدالت صرف Summons for Judgment جاری کرتی ہے — یعنی مدعا علیہ کو یہ بتاتی ہے کہ اگر وہ دفاع کرنا چاہتا ہے تو Leave to Defend حاصل کرے۔

Rule 3 – Leave to Defend
یہ سمری مقدمات کا سب سے اہم مرحلہ ہے۔

(1) Summons for Judgment
مدعا علیہ کو طلبی کا نوٹس بھیجا جاتا ہے۔

(5) Grant or Refusal of Leave to Defend
اگر مدعا علیہ ایسا دفاع پیش کرے جو bona fide (حقیقی) اور معقول بنیادوں پر ہو تو عدالت Leave to Defend دے سکتی ہے۔
اگر دفاع frivolous (غیر سنجیدہ) یا sham (فرضی) ہو تو عدالت Leave to Defend مسترد کر سکتی ہے۔

قانونی نکتہ

Leave to Defend دینا یا نہ دینا ایک judicial discretion ہے۔

اگر Leave دے دی جائے تو مقدمہ ایک regular civil suit بن جاتا ہے۔

اگر Leave مسترد ہو جائے تو عدالت فوری طور پر decree (ڈگری) جاری کر دیتی ہے۔

 عدالت کا تجزیہ (Court’s Analytical Framework)
پہلا مرحلہ: Summary Proceedings
یہ مرحلہ دعویٰ کے دائر ہونے سے شروع ہوتا ہے اور Leave to Defend پر فیصلے تک محدود رہتا ہے۔

عدالت محض یہ دیکھتی ہے کہ مدعا علیہ کا دفاع بادی النظر میں ٹھوس ہے یا محض وقت ضائع کرنے کے لیے ہے۔

اگر Leave نہ دیا جائے تو مقدمہ ختم، اور ڈگری جاری ہو جاتی ہے۔

 قانونی اصول
 Defendant must show a substantial defence or raise a triable issue.
(Ref: M/s Shalimar Recording Co. v. Universal Film Distributors, 1982 SCMR 305)

دوسرا مرحلہ: Regular Trial
اگر Leave to Defend دے دیا جائے:

مقدمہ عام دعووں کی طرح چلایا جاتا ہے۔

Issues تیار کیے جاتے ہیں (Order XIV CPC کے تحت)

Evidence پیش کی جاتی ہے (Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 کے مطابق)

Burden of Proof مدعی پر ہوتا ہے کہ وہ اپنے دعوے کو ثابت کرے (Article 117, QSO)

قانونی اصول
 Once leave is granted, the suit loses its summary character and proceeds as an ordinary civil suit.
(Ref: PLD 1987 Karachi 426; 2008 CLC 1409 Lahore)

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
 عدالتی فیصلہ کی قانونی توجیہ 
(Legal Justification)
عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ:

If the plaint is returned for lack of jurisdiction — the case ends;
(Ref: Section 15–20 CPC on territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction)

If leave is refused — decree follows without evidence;
(Ref: Order XXXVII Rule 3(6))

If leave is granted — case proceeds as ordinary trial with framing of issues and evidence;
(Ref: Order XIV CPC; Qanun-e-Shahadat Order)

مختصراً۔۔۔۔۔
1st Phase Leave to Defend Stage Order XXXVII Rule 3(5)-(6) اگر Leave مسترد ہو تو ڈگری فوراً
2nd Phase Regular Trial Order XIV–XX CPC & QSO 1984 اگر Leave مل جائے تو مکمل ٹرائل

عملی اثرات (Practical Implications)
مدعی کو واضح تحریری ثبوت دینا لازمی ہے۔

مدعا علیہ کو صرف وہی دفاع پیش کرنا چاہیے جو حقیقی ہو — جھوٹے یا غیر سنجیدہ دفاع پر Leave مسترد ہو سکتی ہے۔

Leave ملنے کے بعد مدعی پر وہی بوجھِ ثبوت ہوتا ہے جو کسی عام سول مقدمے میں ہوتا ہے۔

متعلقہ نظائر
 (Relevant Case Law)
PLD 2008 Lahore 522 — “Once leave to defend is granted, case becomes an ordinary suit.”

2002 SCMR 908 (Pakistan Industrial Credit & Investment Corp. v. Crescent Mills) — “Summary jurisdiction is strict; defendant must raise genuine triable issues.”

1985 CLC 278 (Lahore) — “Order XXXVII’s object is to prevent dilatory tactics in liquidated claims.”

مختصراً۔۔۔۔
عدالت نے درست طور پر قرار دیا کہ Order XXXVII CPC کے تحت مقدمہ دو مرحلوں پر مشتمل ہوتا ہے۔
پہلے مرحلے میں اگر Leave to Defend مسترد ہو جائے تو مقدمہ وہیں ختم ہو جاتا ہے،
لیکن اگر Leave منظور ہو جائے تو معاملہ مکمل Trial کی شکل اختیار کر لیتا ہے —
جہاں Evidence, Cross-examination, Framing of Issues اور Merits-based Decision لازم ہیں۔

Mr. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar

Upliaded 11-10-2025
Q1: کیا Rule of Parity کا اطلاق ہر مقدمے میں یکساں طور پر ہوتا ہے؟

نہیں، عدالت ہر مقدمے میں شریک ملزمان کے کردار کا الگ الگ جائزہ لیتی ہے۔ اگر کردار اور حالات بالکل یکساں ہوں تو ہی Rule of Parity لاگو ہوتا ہے۔

Q2: “مزید تفتیش” (Further Inquiry) کے اصول کا مقصد کیا ہے؟

اس اصول کا مقصد یہ دیکھنا ہے کہ آیا شواہد میں ایسا شک موجود ہے جس سے ملزم کی ملوث ہونے کی نوعیت غیر واضح ہو، تاکہ ملزم کو ٹرائل تک ضمانت پر رکھا جا سکے۔

Q3: کیا عدالت جرم کی سنگینی کو بالکل نظر انداز کرتی ہے؟

 نہیں، عدالت جرم کی سنگینی کو مدِنظر رکھتی ہے، لیکن اگر ثبوت مشکوک ہوں یا مزید تحقیق ضروری ہو، تو صرف جرم کی شدت کی بنیاد پر ضمانت رد نہیں کی جاتی۔
قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 

1. ضابطہ فوجداری 
(Criminal Procedure Code, 1898)
دفعات 497 اور 498 Cr.P.C.

یہ دونوں دفعات ضمانت کے بنیادی اصولوں کا تعین کرتی ہیں۔

سیکشن 497(1):
اگر جرم قابلِ دست اندازی پولیس ہو اور شواہد ایسے ہوں کہ ملزم کے خلاف جرم ثابت ہونے کے امکانات ہوں تو ضمانت نہیں دی جاتی۔
مگر اگر مقدمہ مزید تفتیش
 (Further Inquiry) 
کا متقاضی ہو تو عدالت ضمانت دینے کی پابند ہے۔

“If there appear reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty, or that the case calls for further inquiry, the accused shall be released on bail.”
سیکشن 498 Cr.P.C.
عدالتِ عالیہ یا سیشن عدالت کو اختیار دیتی ہے کہ قبل از گرفتاری ضمانت (Pre-arrest Bail) دے سکتی ہے اگر گرفتاری بدنیتی پر مبنی ہو یا مقدمہ مشکوک ہو۔

(1) Further Inquiry — مزید تفتیش کا اصول

عدالت نے تسلیم کیا کہ شواہد ایسے ہیں جو ابتدائی مرحلے پر شک پیدا کرتے ہیں کہ آیا ملزم واقعی مجرمانہ لاپرواہی (Criminal Negligence) کا مرتکب ہے یا نہیں۔

سیکشن 497(2) Cr.P.C. کے مطابق، جب مقدمہ مزید تفتیش کا متقاضی ہو تو ضمانت لازمی ہوتی ہے۔

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ mens rea (نیتِ جرم) کا تعین ٹرائل کے بغیر ممکن نہیں، اس لیے ملزم کو اس مرحلے پر ضمانت دی گئی۔

(2) Rule of Parity — برابری کا اصول

قانون کے تحت، اگر شریک ملزم کو ضمانت مل چکی ہو اور دوسرے ملزم کا کردار اس سے مشابہ یا مساوی ہو، تو دوسرے کو بھی برابری کی بنیاد پر ضمانت دی جاتی ہے۔

یہ اصول 
Article 25 of the Constitution of Pakistan 
(برابری کا آئینی حق) سے ماخوذ ہے، جو کہتا ہے کہ

“All citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law.”

عدالت نے اسی اصول پر عمل کرتے ہوئے قرار دیا کہ چونکہ شریک ملزم کو ضمانت دی گئی ہے، لہٰذا درخواست گزار کو بھی اسی رعایت کا حقدار سمجھا جائے گا۔

(3) جرم کی سنگینی کا اثر
 (Gravity of Offence)

عدالت نے وضاحت کی کہ جرم کی سنگینی بذاتِ خود ضمانت کے انکار کی بنیاد نہیں بن سکتی۔

اگر شواہد میں تضاد ہو یا مقدمہ مزید تفتیش کا محتاج ہو، تو عدالت ضمانت دینے کی مجاز ہے۔

یہ اصول 
PLD 2021 SC 708 (Muhammad Tanveer v. State) اور
 2020 SCMR 1615 (Muhammad Imran v. State) میں سپریم کورٹ نے واضح کیا کہ

“Mere heinousness of the offence is not sufficient for refusal of bail when the case calls for further inquiry.”

(4) Mens Rea (نیتِ جرم) 
اور
 Negligence

چونکہ مقدمہ غفلت یا لاپرواہی سے موت واقع ہونے (مثلاً سیکشن 322 یا 279 PPC) سے متعلق ہے،
اس میں نیتِ جرم (mens rea) یا ارادے کی موجودگی یا غیر موجودگی کا تعین شہادت کے مکمل ہونے کے بعد ہی ممکن ہے۔

اس لیے عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ اس مرحلے پر سزا کا فیصلہ نہیں دیا جا سکتا، اور ملزم کو ٹرائل مکمل ہونے تک ضمانت پر رکھا جائے۔

(5) عدالت کی رہنمائی اور شرائط

عدالت نے ہدایت دی کہ ملزم:

تفتیش میں مکمل تعاون کرے،

ٹرائل کورٹ کی ہر پیشی پر حاضر ہو،

اور اگر ضمانت کے شرائط کی خلاف ورزی کرے تو ٹرائل کورٹ کو ضمانت منسوخ کرنے کا اختیار حاصل ہو گا۔

یہ ہدایات PLD 2019 SC 527 (Talib Hussain v. The State) کے فیصلے کے مطابق ہیں۔

عدالت نے سیکشن
 497(2) Cr.Pc
. کے تحت مزید تفتیش کی بنیاد پر ضمانت برقرار رکھی۔

Rule of Parity
 کے تحت شریک ملزم کو ملنے والی رعایت کو درخواست گزار تک بڑھایا۔

جرم کی سنگینی یا عوامی جذبات کو ضمانت کے انکار کی وجہ نہیں بنایا۔

نیتِ جرم (mens rea)، 
غفلت، اور مجرمانہ ذمہ داری کے تعین کو ٹرائل کے نتیجے تک مؤخر کیا۔

Mr. Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui 06-10-2025 
Upladed 10-10-2025

محمد شفیع صدیقی، جج: ہم نے فریقین کے وکلاء کے دلائل سنے اور ریکارڈ پر موجود مواد کا بغور جائزہ لیا۔

پیرا 2:
اس درخواست میں بنیادی سوال یہ اُبھرتا ہے کہ آیا کسٹمز ایکٹ 1969ء (جسے آگے "ایکٹ" کہا جائے گا) کی دفعہ 179(3) کے تحت آرڈر اِن اوریجنل (Order-in-Original) مقررہ مدت کے اندر جاری کیا گیا تھا یا نہیں۔

پیرا 3:
کسٹمز اپیلیٹ ٹربیونل اسلام آباد بنچ II (جسے آگے "ٹربیونل" کہا جائے گا) کے ممبر جوڈیشل اور ممبر ٹیکنیکل کے مابین تقسیم شدہ فیصلہ (split judgment) تھا، لہٰذا معاملہ ٹربیونل کے ریفری ممبر کو بھیجا گیا۔
ممبر (جوڈیشل) نے قرار دیا کہ آرڈر اِن اوریجنل مقررہ مدت کے بعد جاری کیا گیا، جبکہ ممبر (ٹیکنیکل) کی رائے تھی کہ یہ آرڈر وقت پر جاری ہوا۔ ریفری ممبر نے ممبر (جوڈیشل) سے اتفاق کیا۔

ریکارڈ کے مطابق شوکاز نوٹس 27.04.2020 کو جاری ہوا اور آرڈر اِن اوریجنل جاری کرنے کے لیے 90 دن کی مدت 26.07.2020 کو ختم ہوگئی۔ آرڈر اِن اوریجنل 10.08.2020 کو جاری ہوا، لہٰذا یہ وقت کی پابندی سے باہر (time-barred) تھا۔ ایسا معلوم ہوتا ہے کہ کلیکٹر (ایڈجوڈیکیشن) نے خود ہی بغیر کسی وجہ ریکارڈ کیے مدت میں توسیع دے دی، جو کسی بھی صورت میں قانونی طور پر درست توسیع نہیں مانی جا سکتی۔ علاوہ ازیں یہ توسیع قانوناً قابلِ اطلاق بھی نہیں تھی۔

پیرا 4:
یہ سوال کہ دفعہ 179(3) کے تحت مدت کا تعین کس طرح ہوگا، جب کہ دفعہ 2(s) کو نافذ کیا گیا ہو، قانون کے الفاظ سے واضح ہے۔
جہاں دفعہ 2(s) کے تحت کارروائی کی گئی ہو، وہاں شوکاز نوٹس کے اجراء کی تاریخ سے 30 دن کے اندر آرڈر اِن اوریجنل جاری کرنا لازمی ہے، اور اس صورت میں کلیکٹر کو مدت میں توسیع کا کوئی اختیار حاصل نہیں۔

چونکہ اس کیس میں شوکاز نوٹس دفعہ 2(s) کے تحت 27.04.2020 کو جاری ہوا، اور آرڈر اِن اوریجنل 10.08.2020 کو جاری کیا گیا، لہٰذا یہ واضح طور پر تاخیر سے جاری ہوا۔ کلیکٹر (ایڈجوڈیکیشن) اور ٹربیونل نے غلطی سے یہ فرض کرلیا کہ دفعہ 179(3) کے تحت ایسے مقدمات میں بھی 90 دن کی مدت لاگو ہوتی ہے، حالانکہ یہ غلط ہے۔

برائے سہولت، دفعہ 179(3) اور اس کا پرویزو (proviso) درج ذیل ہے:

"(3) مقدمات کو شوکاز نوٹس کے اجرا کے 90 دنوں کے اندر فیصلہ کیا جائے گا یا ایسی مدت کے اندر جس میں کلیکٹر تحریری طور پر وجوہ درج کرتے ہوئے توسیع دے سکتا ہے،
تاہم یہ توسیع کسی صورت 60 دن سے زیادہ نہیں ہوگی۔
بشرطِ یہ کہ جہاں دفعہ 2 کی شق (s) کو نافذ کیا گیا ہو، وہاں ایسے مقدمات کو شوکاز نوٹس کے اجرا کے 30 دنوں کے اندر فیصلہ کیا جائے گا۔"

پیرا 5:
لہٰذا مذکورہ پرویزو سے بالکل واضح ہے کہ دفعہ 2(s) کے تحت آنے والی اشیاء سے متعلق مقدمات میں آرڈر اِن اوریجنل جاری کرنے کی قانونی مدت 30 دن ہے، اور اس میں کسی قسم کی توسیع کی اجازت قانون میں نہیں ہے۔

پیرا 6:
مندرجہ بالا وجوہات کی بنا پر ہم ہائی کورٹ کے متنازعہ فیصلے میں مداخلت کے خواہاں نہیں ہیں۔ نتیجتاً، یہ درخواست مسترد کی جاتی ہے اور اپیل کی اجازت (leave to appeal) دینے سے انکار کیا جاتا ہے۔
خلاصہ ۔۔۔۔۔
یہ کیس اس بات سے متعلق تھا کہ آیا آرڈر اِن اوریجنل (Order-in-Original) مقررہ مدت کے اندر جاری ہوا یا نہیں۔

کسٹمز ایکٹ 1969ء کی دفعہ 179(3) کے مطابق عام طور پر آرڈر اِن اوریجنل 90 دن میں جاری کرنا ہوتا ہے، جس میں کلیکٹر زیادہ سے زیادہ 60 دن کی توسیع دے سکتا ہے۔

لیکن اگر کیس دفعہ 2(s) (اسمگل شدہ مال یا غیر قانونی درآمد شدہ سامان سے متعلق) کے تحت ہو تو قانون کے مطابق یہ آرڈر 30 دن کے اندر جاری کرنا لازمی ہے، اور اس میں کسی قسم کی توسیع ممکن نہیں۔

اس کیس میں:

شوکاز نوٹس 27 اپریل 2020 کو جاری ہوا۔

30 دن کی مدت 27 مئی 2020 کو ختم ہوگئی۔

آرڈر اِن اوریجنل 10 اگست 2020 کو جاری کیا گیا۔

لہٰذا آرڈر قانونی مدت سے باہر (time-barred) تھا۔ کلیکٹر (Adjudication) کی جانب سے خود ساختہ توسیع غیر قانونی قرار پائی۔

ٹربیونل کے ریفری ممبر نے یہی مؤقف درست تسلیم کیا، اور سپریم کورٹ نے بھی قرار دیا کہ ہائی کورٹ کا فیصلہ درست ہے۔

آرڈر اِن اوریجنل مقررہ 30 دن کی مدت سے تجاوز کرنے کی وجہ سے غیر مؤثر (invalid) قرار پایا۔

سپریم کورٹ نے اپیل کی اجازت (leave to appeal) دینے سے انکار کر دیا۔

درخواست مسترد کر دی گئی۔

قانونی نکتہ:
دفعہ 2(s) کے تحت آنے والے مقدمات میں آرڈر اِن اوریجنل لازمی طور پر 30 دن کے اندر دیا جائے گا، اس میں کسی قسم کی توسیع کلیکٹر نہیں دے سکتا۔

حدودِ وقت سے تجاوز کرتے ہوئے جاری کیا گیا Order-in-Original — دفعہ 179(3) Customs Act, 1969 کے تحت غیر مؤثر قرار

 پس منظر
 (Background)
درخواست گزار نے یہ مؤقف اختیار کیا کہ کسٹمز حکام نے شوکاز نوٹس کے بعد Order-in-Original مقررہ مدت سے بہت بعد جاری کیا، جو دفعہ 179(3) کی خلاف ورزی ہے۔
جس مال پر کارروائی ہوئی تھی وہ دفعہ 2(s) کے زمرے میں آتا ہے یعنی "اسمگل شدہ مال"۔

 مرکزی قانونی سوال
 (Legal Question)
کیا Collector (Adjudication) کو دفعہ 179(3) کے تحت دفعہ 2(s) سے متعلق مقدمات میں مدت میں توسیع کا اختیار حاصل ہے یا نہیں؟
متعلقہ قانونی دفعات 
(Relevant Provisions)
 Section 179(3), Customs Act, 1969
(3) The cases shall be decided within ninety days of the issuance of show cause notice or within such period extended by the Collector for which reasons shall be recorded in writing, but such extended period shall in no case exceed sixty days.
Provided that in cases, wherein the provision of clause (s) of section 2 have been invoked, such cases shall be decided within a period of thirty days of the issuance of show cause notice.

تمام مقدمات کو شوکاز نوٹس کے اجراء کے نوّے (90)
 دن کے اندر فیصلہ کیا جائے گا
یا ایسی مدت کے اندر جس میں کلیکٹر تحریری وجوہات درج کرتے ہوئے توسیع دے سکتا ہے،
لیکن یہ توسیع ساٹھ (60) دن سے زیادہ نہیں ہو سکتی۔

بشرطِ یہ کہ جہاں دفعہ 2 کی شق (s) کو نافذ کیا گیا ہو،
وہاں ایسے مقدمات کا فیصلہ شوکاز نوٹس کے اجرا کے تیس (30) دن کے اندر کیا جائے گا۔

Section 2(s), Customs Act, 1969 — Definition of "Smuggling"
2(s) “smuggling” means bringing into or taking out of Pakistan, in any manner whatsoever, goods, the importation or exportation of which is prohibited or restricted under this Act or any other law for the time being in force, or evasion of duties, taxes or prohibitions, or any act which renders such goods liable to confiscation under this Act.

"اسمگلنگ" سے مراد ہے:
پاکستان میں کسی بھی طریقے سے ایسی اشیاء کو لانا یا باہر لے جانا جن کی درآمد یا برآمد قانوناً ممنوع یا محدود ہو،
یا ڈیوٹی یا ٹیکس سے بچنے کی نیت سے ایسی کوئی کارروائی کرنا،
یا کوئی ایسا عمل کرنا جس سے وہ مال ضبطی کے قابل ہو جائے۔

 قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ
 (Legal Analytical Review)

 آرڈر اِن اوریجنل کی مدت کا قانونی دائرہ:
دفعہ 179(3) کے تحت عام اصول یہ ہے کہ:

90 دن کے اندر فیصلہ کیا جائے۔

کلیکٹر مزید 60 دن کی توسیع دے سکتا ہے، بشرطِ تحریری وجوہات۔

لیکن Proviso میں ایک خصوصی استثنا (exception) ہے:

اگر معاملہ دفعہ 2(s) یعنی اسمگل شدہ اشیاء سے متعلق ہو تو
فیصلہ صرف 30 دن کے اندر لازمی ہے —
اور اس میں کوئی توسیع ممکن نہیں۔

 کیس میں حقائق کا اطلاق
عنصر تفصیل
شوکاز نوٹس 27 اپریل 2020
30 دن کی مدت ختم 27 مئی 2020
آرڈر اِن اوریجنل جاری 10 اگست 2020
تاخیر تقریباً 75 دن زائد
یعنی Collector نے آرڈر قانونی مدت (30 دن) سے بہت بعد جاری کیا۔

Collector 
کی جانب سے توسیع
Collector نے ازخود مدت میں توسیع دی، بغیر کسی تحریری وجہ کے۔
عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ:

“Collector کو دفعہ 2(s) کے تحت مقدمات میں توسیع دینے کا اختیار ہی حاصل نہیں۔
اس لیے اس کی دی گئی توسیع غیر مؤثر (invalid) ہے۔”

Tribunal 
کا فیصلہ اور سپریم کورٹ کا موقف
Member (Judicial)
آرڈر تاخیر سے جاری ہوا  وقت سے باہر  غیر مؤثر۔

Member (Technical)
 سمجھا کہ 90 دن کی مدت لاگو
 ہوتی ہے  درست۔

Referee Member:
ممبر (Judicial)
 سے اتفاق کیا۔

سپریم کورٹ نے کہا:

“چونکہ یہ مقدمہ دفعہ 2
(s)
 کے زمرے میں آتا ہے،
لہٰذا مقررہ مدت 30 دن ہے۔
Collector یا Tribunal 
کا یہ سمجھنا کہ
 90 
دن کا قانون لاگو ہوتا ہے، غلط فہمی ہے۔”

 قانونی اصول
 (Doctrine established):
قانونی نظیر (Precedent):

جہاں اسمگلنگ (Section 2(s)) کا الزام ہو، وہاں
Order-in-Original کو 30 دن کے اندر جاری کرنا لازم ہے۔
اس مدت میں توسیع غیر قانونی ہوگی۔
تاخیر سے جاری شدہ آرڈر وقت گزیدہ (Time-barred) اور ناقابلِ عمل (void ab initio) ہوگا۔

 عدالتی نتیجہ 
(Outcome)
ہائی کورٹ کا فیصلہ درست قرار دیا گیا۔

سپریم کورٹ نے Leave to Appeal دینے سے انکار کیا۔

نتیجتاً، Collector کا آرڈر باطل (invalid) قرار پایا۔

 خلاصۂ قانون
دفعہ قانونی حکم مدت توسیع کی اجازت
179(3) عام مقدمات 90 دن زیادہ سے زیادہ 60 دن
Proviso to 179(3) اگر دفعہ 2(s) لاگو ہو (اسمگلنگ کیس) 30 دن نہیں

 قانونی اثرات 
(Legal Implications)
Adjudication process میں مقررہ مدت سے تجاوز کرنے والا فیصلہ غیر مؤثر سمجھا جائے گا۔

Collector کو jurisdictional error تصور کیا جائے گا۔

ایسی تاخیر سے جاری کردہ کارروائی void ab initio (شروع سے ہی کالعدم) مانی جائے گی۔

آئندہ تمام اسمگلنگ کیسز میں محکمہ کسٹمز کو 30 دن کی پابندی لازم ہے۔

(1) اگر کسی قانونی (statutory) ٹریبونل کو کسی تنازعے کا فیصلہ کرنے اور اس پر حکم جاری کرنے کا اختیار دیا گیا ہے،
تو یہ بھی سمجھا جائے گا کہ اسے اپنے جاری کردہ حکم کو نافذ (implement) کرنے کا بھی اختیار حاصل ہے۔
خواہ یہ اختیار قانون میں صراحتاً (explicitly) درج نہ ہو، اسے بالواسطہ طور پر (impliedly) تسلیم کیا جائے گا۔

(2) کسٹمز اپیلیٹ ٹریبونل کو اپنے اپیلیٹ دائرۂ اختیار کے تحت سیکشن 194-A اور 194-B کسٹمز ایکٹ 1969 کے مطابق دیے گئے احکامات کو عملی طور پر نافذ (execute) کرنے کا اختیار حاصل ہے۔

لہٰذا جب قانون کے تحت مناسب اور مؤثر قانونی راستہ (adequate remedy) موجود ہے،
تو ان احکامات پر عملدرآمد کے لیے ہائی کورٹ کا رِٹ دائرہ اختیار (writ jurisdiction) استعمال نہیں کیا جا سکتا۔

“Statutory Tribunal’s Implied Power to Execute Its Own Orders — Legal Analysis under Customs Act, 1969 & General Clauses Act, 1897”

(قانونی ٹریبونل کے اپنے احکامات کے نفاذ کا بالواسطہ اختیار — ایک تجزیاتی جائزہ)

 بنیادی اصول 
(Judicial Principle by Justice Mansoor Ali Shah):
“A statutory tribunal that has been conferred the power to adjudicate a dispute and pass an order on it also has the power to implement that order, even if not expressly mentioned in the statute.”

یعنی
اگر قانون کسی ادارے کو فیصلہ کرنے (adjudicate) اور حکم دینے (order) کا اختیار دیتا ہے،
تو یہ بالواسطہ سمجھا جائے گا کہ وہ اپنے حکم پر عملدرآمد (execution) بھی کر سکتا ہے —
ورنہ انصاف بے معنی ہو جائے گا۔

 متعلقہ دفعات
 (Relevant Statutory Provisions)
1. Customs Act, 1969
Section 194-A – Appellate Tribunal
“The Federal Government shall constitute an Appellate Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction, powers and authority conferred by or under this Act.”

وفاقی حکومت ایک اپیلیٹ ٹریبونل قائم کرے گی جو اس ایکٹ کے تحت دیے گئے تمام اختیارات اور دائرہ اختیار استعمال کرے گا۔

 تجزیہ
یہ دفعہ “powers and authority conferred by or under this Act” کہتی ہے،
جس میں “under this Act” کے الفاظ وسیع مفہوم رکھتے ہیں —
یعنی وہ تمام اختیارات جو اس ایکٹ کے مقاصد کے لیے ضروری یا ضمنی (incidental or ancillary) ہوں،
چاہے وہ صراحتاً درج نہ ہوں۔

Section 194-B – Powers of the Appellate Tribunal
“The Appellate Tribunal shall have the same powers as are vested in a court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, when trying a suit, in respect of receiving evidence, enforcing attendance of persons, compelling production of documents and other matters.”

اپیلیٹ ٹریبونل کو وہی اختیارات حاصل ہوں گے جو کسی عدالت کو سول پروسیجر کوڈ 1908 کے تحت مقدمہ کی سماعت کے دوران حاصل ہوتے ہیں،
بشمول گواہی لینا، حاضری یقینی بنانا، دستاویزات طلب کرنا وغیرہ۔

 تجزیہ
جب ٹریبونل کو عدالت جیسے اختیارات دیے گئے ہیں،
تو فیصلے کے نفاذ (execution) کا اختیار بھی انہی عدالتی اختیارات کے دائرے میں شامل سمجھا جاتا ہے —
کیونکہ فیصلہ بے اثر رہے گا اگر اسے نافذ نہ کیا جا سکے۔

 General Clauses Act, 1897 – Section 22
“Where, by any Central Act or Regulation, a power to issue orders, rules, or notifications is conferred, then that power includes the power to add to, amend, vary, or rescind such orders, rules, or notifications.”

جب کسی مرکزی قانون کے تحت کسی کو احکامات جاری کرنے کا اختیار دیا جائے،
تو اس میں یہ اختیار بھی شامل ہوگا کہ وہ احکامات میں تبدیلی یا نفاذ سے متعلق اقدامات بھی کر سکے۔

 تجزیہ
یہ دفعہ "implied power doctrine" کی بنیاد فراہم کرتی ہے۔
یعنی جب قانون کسی اتھارٹی کو کوئی عمل کرنے کا اختیار دیتا ہے،
تو اس کے لیے درکار تمام ضروری اقدامات کرنے کا اختیار خود بخود (by implication) شامل سمجھا جاتا ہے۔
اسی اصول کو جسٹس منصور علی شاہ نے اپنے فیصلے میں اپنایا۔

 آئینی تناظر 
(Constitutional Context – Article 199)
Article 199 empowers High Courts to issue writs only when no adequate remedy is provided by law.

 تجزیہ
چونکہ Customs Act میں Appellate Tribunal کو اپنے احکامات کے نفاذ کا adequate remedy دیا گیا ہے،
لہٰذا ہائی کورٹ کے پاس رِٹ جُرِسڈِکشن (writ jurisdiction) استعمال کرنے کی ضرورت یا جواز نہیں رہتا۔
یعنی:
“Where there is a remedy provided by statute, the writ jurisdiction cannot be invoked.”

 عدالتی نظائر
 (Judicial Precedents)
PLD 2023 SC 145 (Justice Mansoor Ali Shah Judgment)
Tribunal’s power of self-execution upheld; writ jurisdiction excluded.

2022 SCMR 1847 – Collector of Customs vs. Pakistan Steel Mills
Tribunal deemed competent to enforce its own appellate orders.

PLD 2010 SC 265 (Federation v. Afaq Ahmad)
“When a statutory forum is created by law for redress, constitutional jurisdiction is barred unless there is lack of jurisdiction or mala fide.”

*"نکاح نامہ کی بطور ازدواجی و معاہداتی دستاویز تشریح اور قانونی حیثیت"/"نکاح نامہ بطور عوامی دستاویز: دائرۂ اطلاق، عدالتی تشریح اور تعبیر کی حدود"*
PLD 2025 SC 262
Dr. Faryal Maqsood & another v. Khurram Shehzad Durrani & others

نکاح ایک ایسا معاشرتی معاہدہ (social contract) ہے جو ایک مرد اور عورت کے درمیان طے پاتا ہے، اور جس کے تمام شرائط و ضوابط "نکاح نامہ" میں درج ہوتے ہیں۔ ان شرائط و ضوابط کا مقصد میاں بیوی دونوں کے حقوق اور نیتوں (intentions) کو محفوظ بنانا ہوتا ہے۔

یہ قانونی طور پر طے شدہ اصول ہے کہ نکاح نامہ کے مندرجات کے ساتھ سچائی کا ایک قانونی قرینہ (presumption of truth) منسلک ہوتا ہے، اور نکاح نامہ ایک عوامی دستاویز (public document) کا درجہ رکھتا ہے۔ اس میں درج تمام اندراجات (entries) کو درست اور معتبر تصور کیا جاتا ہے، جب تک اس کے برعکس کوئی مضبوط ثبوت پیش نہ کیا جائے۔

نکاح نامہ کے کالم نمبر 13 تا 16 عموماً حقِ مہر (dower) سے متعلق ہوتے ہیں، جبکہ کالم نمبر 17 کا عنوان "خصوصی شرائط اگر کوئی ہوں" (special conditions, if any) ہوتا ہے۔

تاہم، عدالت عظمیٰ نے قرار دیا ہے کہ نکاح نامہ کے کالموں کے عنوانات یا فارم کا ڈیزائن بذاتِ خود فریقین کی نیت (intention) کے تعین کے لیے حتمی نہیں۔

عدالتِ عظمیٰ نے "حسین اللہ کیس" میں یہ اصول طے کیا تھا کہ نکاح نامہ دراصل فریقین کے مابین ازدواجی معاہدہ کی دستاویز (deed of marriage contract) ہے، اور اس کی تمام شقوں، کالموں اور مندرجات کو فریقین کی نیت کے تناظر میں تشریح (interpretation) کیا جائے گا۔

مزید برآں، کنٹریکٹ کی تشریح کے اصول کے مطابق عدالت ایسی کسی شق یا مفہوم کو فرض نہیں کر سکتی جو تحریری معاہدہ کی واضح شرائط کے منافی ہو۔
اسی طرح کوئی ایسی بات جو تحریری معاہدہ میں درج نہ ہو، اسے صرف اس وجہ سے شامل نہیں کیا جا سکتا کہ وہ عدالت کو معقول یا مناسب لگے۔

 قانونی نکتہ خلاصہ*

*نکاح نامہ ایک عوامی دستاویز ہے، جسے درست اور سچ مانا جاتا ہے۔*

*اس کی تشریح کرتے وقت فریقین کی نیت کو مرکزی حیثیت حاصل ہے۔*

*عدالت نہ تو کوئی اضافی مطلب داخل کر سکتی ہے اور نہ ہی ایسی شرط فرض کر سکتی ہے جو تحریری طور پر موجود نہ ہو۔*

*کالم کے عنوانات (headings) صرف رہنمائی فراہم کرتے ہیں، نیت یا معنی طے نہیں کرتے۔*
 بنیادی قانونی اصول
نکاح ایک سماجی و قانونی معاہدہ 
(social and legal contract) 
ہے۔
اس میں درج شرائط و ضوابط فریقین کے ارادے، نیت، اور باہمی رضا کو ظاہر کرتے ہیں۔
اس دستاویز کی قانونی حیثیت ایک 
"public document" 
کی ہے، جس کے ساتھ 
presumption of correctness and truth
 منسلک ہے۔

1. Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961
Section 5 — Registration of Marriage
Bare Act ...
(1) Every marriage solemnized under Muslim Law shall be registered in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(2) For the purpose of registration of marriages under this Ordinance, the Union Council shall grant licences to one or more persons to be called Nikah Registrars.
(3) Whoever contravenes the provisions of this section shall be punishable with simple imprisonment or fine or both.

ہر نکاح جو مسلم قانون کے تحت انجام پائے گا، اس آرڈیننس کے مطابق رجسٹر کیا جائے گا۔
یونین کونسل اس مقصد کے لیے نکاح رجسٹرار کو لائسنس دے گی۔
خلاف ورزی کی صورت میں سزا یا جرمانہ ہوگا۔

نکاح نامہ نہ صرف ایک معاشرتی معاہدہ ہے بلکہ رجسٹرڈ قانونی دستاویز ہے، جسے Evidence Act کے تحت Public Document کا درجہ حاصل ہے۔

2. Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (Law of Evidence)
Article 85 — Presumption as to documents produced as record of evidence
Bare Act (English):
The Court shall presume that every document purporting to be a record or memorandum of an act of a public officer was so recorded by the public officer in the discharge of his official duty.

عدالت یہ قرینہ (presumption) رکھے گی کہ ہر وہ دستاویز جو کسی سرکاری اہلکار کے عمل یا یادداشت کے طور پر پیش کی جائے، وہ اپنے سرکاری فرائض کے مطابق تیار کی گئی ہے۔

نکاح نامہ چونکہ رجسٹرارِ نکاح (سرکاری اہلکار) کی تحریر کے تحت تیار ہوتا ہے، لہٰذا اس پر presumption of truth لاگو ہوتا ہے۔
یعنی جب تک خلافِ حقیقت کوئی مضبوط ثبوت نہ دیا جائے، اس کے اندراجات درست سمجھے جائیں گے۔

3. Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984
Article 129(f) — Presumption as to regularity of official acts
Bare Act (English):
The Court may presume that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed.

عدالت یہ قرینہ رکھ سکتی ہے کہ عدالتی اور سرکاری کارروائیاں باقاعدگی سے انجام دی گئی ہیں۔

نکاح رجسٹریشن کے وقت کی گئی اندراجی کارروائی درست اور مکمل مانی جاتی ہے۔

4. Contract Act, 1872
Section 10 — What agreements are contracts
Bare Act (English):
All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void.

ہر وہ معاہدہ جو اہل فریقین کے آزاد رضامندی سے، جائز معاوضہ اور قانونی مقصد کے لیے کیا جائے، قانونی طور پر قابلِ نفاذ
 (enforceable contract) 
ہوتا ہے۔

نکاح نامہ اسی اصول کے تحت ایک 
valid contract
 ہے
 فریقین بالغ، عاقل، اور رضامندی سے شامل ہوں تو نکاح نامہ 
binding contract
 بن جاتا ہے۔

Section 92 — Exclusion of oral evidence by documentary evidence
Bare Act (English):
When the terms of any contract have been reduced to the form of a document, no evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such contract except the document itself.

جب کسی معاہدہ کی شرائط کو تحریری شکل دی جا چکی ہو، تو اس کی شرائط کے ثبوت میں زبانی گواہی قابلِ قبول نہیں ہوگی، سوائے اس تحریری دستاویز کے۔

نکاح نامہ چونکہ تحریری معاہدہ ہے، اس لیے کسی فریق کی طرف سے بعد میں دی گئی زبانی وضاحت یا دعویٰ (کہ نیت کچھ اور تھی) کو قابلِ قبول نہیں سمجھا جائے گا، الا یہ کہ تحریری ثبوت موجود ہو۔

5. General Clauses Act, 1897
Section 14 — Powers conferred to be exercisable from time to time
Bare Act (English):
Where, by any Central Act or Regulation, a power is conferred, then unless a different intention appears, that power may be exercised from time to time as occasion requires.

جب کسی قانون کے تحت کوئی اختیار دیا گیا ہو، تو جب تک کوئی مختلف نیت ظاہر نہ ہو، یہ اختیار ضرورت کے مطابق بار بار استعمال کیا جا سکتا ہے۔

عدالت کو اختیار ہے کہ نکاح نامہ کی تشریح وقتاً فوقتاً فریقین کی نیت، حالات، اور ثبوت کی بنیاد پر کرے — مگر تحریری نیت کو اولیت حاصل ہے۔
 (Supreme Court Observations)
Nikah Nama = Deed of Contract
عدالتِ عظمیٰ نے قرار دیا کہ نکاح نامہ ازدواجی معاہدہ کی دستاویز ہے، اس کی تشریح عام معاہداتی اصولوں (contractual principles) کے مطابق کی جائے گی۔

Presumption of Truth:
چونکہ نکاح نامہ public document ہے، اس میں درج اندراجات کو درست اور سچ مانا جاتا ہے جب تک خلافِ حقیقت کوئی قوی ثبوت نہ ہو۔

Intention Over Headings
نکاح نامہ کے کالموں کے عنوانات صرف رہنمائی کے لیے ہیں، ان سے فریقین کی نیت یا شرائط کا حتمی تعین نہیں کیا جا سکتا۔

No Implied Terms
عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ کوئی بھی ایسی شرط جو تحریری طور پر درج نہ ہو، عدالت محض معقولیت کی بنیاد پر شامل نہیں کر سکتی۔

Interpretation Principle
ہر معاہدہ کی تشریح نیتِ فریقین (intention of parties) اور الفاظ کے واضح مفہوم کے مطابق ہوگی، نہ کہ مفروضات یا بعد کی تاویلوں پر۔

 قانونی نتیجہ
 (Legal Conclusion)
نکتہ عدالتی اصول متعلقہ قانون
نکاح نامہ ایک معاہدہ ہے ازدواجی معاہدہ تحریری دستاویز ہے Contract Act, 1872 s.10
نکاح نامہ درست مانا جاتا ہے Presumption of truth attaches QSO, 1984 Arts. 85 & 129(f)

مختصراً۔۔
نکاح نامہ ایک مکمل
 binding social contract
 ہے۔
اس کی قانونی حیثیت
 public document
 کی ہے،
جس میں درج شرائط کو درست تصور کیا جاتا ہے۔
عدالت صرف انہی شرائط کی پابند ہے جو تحریری طور پر درج ہوں،
اور نیت یا مقصد کی تشریح الفاظ کے مفہوم سے کی جائے گی،
نہ کہ بعد کی زبانی وضاحت یا مفروضہ نیکیوں سے۔

فیصلہ ۔۔۔
مسافر کی جانب سے کسٹمز ایکٹ 1969 کی دفعہ 139 کے تحت اعلان (Declaration) دینا، دفعہ 142 کے نفاذ کے لیے بنیادی شرط (sine qua non) ہے۔
مسافر پر یہ لازم ہے کہ وہ سچّا اور درست اعلان کرے جیسا کہ دفعہ 139 میں متعین ہے۔
کسٹمز حکام پر یہ ذمہ داری عائد نہیں ہوتی کہ وہ ہر مسافر سے علیحدہ طور پر جا کر اعلان طلب کریں۔
تاہم، مسافر کو اعلان کرنے کا موقع فراہم کیا جانا ضروری ہے۔

سادہ الفاظ میں عام فہم  مفہوم
قانون کے مطابق، اگر کوئی مسافر اپنے سامان یا غیر ملکی زرِمبادلہ وغیرہ کا درست اعلان نہیں کرتا تو بعد میں کسٹمز والے دفعہ 142 (ضبطی یا کارروائی) لاگو نہیں کر سکتے، جب تک یہ ثابت نہ ہو کہ مسافر کو اعلان کا موقع دیا گیا تھا۔
یعنی پہلے موقع دینا لازم ہے، پھر ہی کارروائی ہو سکتی ہے
متعلقہ قانون: Customs Act, 1969
Section 139 – Declaration by Passengers

Bare Act Wording (English):

139. Declaration by Passengers.—
Every passenger arriving in or departing from Pakistan shall, on arrival or departure, as the case may be, declare to the appropriate officer such dutiable or prohibited goods or such currency or negotiable instruments in such form and manner as may be prescribed

دفعہ 139 — مسافروں کی طرف سے اعلان:
ہر وہ مسافر جو پاکستان میں داخل ہو رہا ہو یا پاکستان سے باہر جا رہا ہو، وہ اپنی آمد یا روانگی کے وقت متعلقہ کسٹمز افسر کے سامنے،
ان تمام ڈیوٹی لگنے والی (dutiable) یا ممنوعہ اشیاء (prohibited goods)، یا
زرِمبادلہ (currency) یا قابلِ منتقلی دستاویزات (negotiable instruments) کا اعلان کرے،
جس طریقہ اور فارم میں حکومت کے قواعد کے مطابق مقرر کیا گیا ہو۔

Section 142 – Confiscation of Undeclared or Prohibited Goods

Bare Act Wording (English):

142. Confiscation of undeclared goods.—
Any goods or currency or negotiable instruments which a passenger fails to declare under section 139 shall be liable to confiscation, and the passenger shall also be liable to such penalty as may be prescribed.

دفعہ 142 — غیر اعلانیہ اشیاء کی ضبطی:
کوئی بھی مال، زرِمبادلہ یا قابلِ منتقلی دستاویزات جن کا مسافر دفعہ 139 کے تحت اعلان کرنے میں ناکام ہو جائے،
وہ ضبطی (confiscation) کے قابل ہوں گے،
اور ایسے مسافر پر مزید وہ جرمانہ بھی عائد کیا جا سکتا ہے جو قواعد میں مقرر کیا گیا 
قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ
 (Legal Analytical Review)

1. بنیادی قانونی اصول (Sine Qua Non)

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ دفعہ 142 کا نفاذ صرف اسی صورت میں ممکن ہے جب پہلے دفعہ 139 کے تقاضے پورے کیے گئے ہوں۔
یعنی اگر اعلان (declaration) لیا ہی نہیں گیا یا موقع نہیں دیا گیا، تو ضبطی یا سزا غیر قانونی ہوگی۔

2. Onus (ذمہ داری کا بوجھ)

قانون کے مطابق، مسافر خود ذمہ دار ہے کہ وہ اعلان کرے۔
کسٹمز حکام پر یہ ذمہ داری عائد نہیں ہوتی کہ وہ ہر مسافر سے جا کر اعلان طلب کریں۔

البتہ، قانونی موقع فراہم کرنا لازم ہے — یعنی ایسا نظام یا طریقہ کار موجود ہو جس سے مسافر اعلان کر سکے (مثلاً کسٹمز ڈیسک، فارم، یا زبانی سوال)۔

3. Declaration کی اہمیت

یہ خود انکشاف (self-declaration) کا اصول ہے، جو دنیا کے تمام کسٹمز قوانین میں موجود ہے۔
یہ شفافیت اور دیانت داری پر مبنی نظام ہے، تاکہ مسافر اپنے سامان کے متعلق درست معلومات دے سکے۔

4. Due Process & Natural Justice

عدالت نے اس اصول کو Natural Justice کے تناظر میں بھی دیکھا —
کہ اگر مسافر کو اعلان کا موقع ہی نہ دیا جائے اور براہِ راست ضبطی کر لی جائے، تو یہ آئین کے آرٹیکل 10-A (Fair Trial) کے خلاف ہوگا۔

5. Burden of Proof

اگر کسٹمز حکام ضبطی کی کارروائی کرنا چاہیں تو ان پر یہ ثابت کرنا لازم ہے کہ:

مسافر کو اعلان کرنے کا واضح موقع دیا گیا تھا، اور

اس کے باوجود اُس نے اعلان نہیں کیا۔

ورنہ ضبطی اور جرمانہ غیر قانونی تصور ہوگا۔

6. عدالتی تشریح (Judicial Interpretation):

2025 LHC 5283 (Justice Khalid Ishaq) میں عدالت نے واضح طور پر کہا:

“Declaration by the passenger under Section 139 is a sine qua non for invocation of Section 142.”
یعنی جب تک مسافر سے باضابطہ طور پر اعلان نہیں لیا جاتا، کسٹمز حکام Section 142 کے تحت کسی چیز کو ضبط نہیں کر سکتے۔

7. بین الاقوامی موازنہ (Comparative Note):

عالمی سطح پر (مثلاً U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or EU Customs Code) میں بھی یہی اصول لاگو ہوتا ہے —
کہ voluntary declaration کے بغیر کوئی ضبطی کارروائی قانونی حیثیت نہیں رکھتی، جب تک
passenger کو informed اور facilitated
 نہ کیا گیا ہو۔

مختصراً۔۔۔۔۔
(Summary)
قانونی دفعہ عنوان قانونی اثر
Section 139 مسافر کی طرف سے اعلان مسافر پر لازم ہے کہ وہ اشیاء، زرِمبادلہ یا دستاویزات کا سچّا اعلان کرے۔
Section 142 غیر اعلانیہ اشیاء کی ضبطی صرف اس وقت قابلِ نفاذ ہے جب مسافر کو اعلان کا موقع دیا گیا ہو مگر اس نے جان بوجھ کر اعلان نہ کیا ہو۔

Section 12A of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 makes it obligatory for the Trial Court to decide/dispose of a case/family suit within a period of six months from the date of institution. Indeed(naeem), it is a right of every litigant to cross-examine the witnesses deposing evidence, but that cannot be stretched down to an unreasonable desire of the counsel and litigant seeking adjournments one after the other and the reasons which were not found sufficient by the Trial Court, as could be seen that numerous opportunities were provided.  
Another aspect of the case is that the aforesaid special law restricts and prohibits a challenge made to an interim/interlocutory order in terms of section 14(3) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964. Though there is none but even the jurisdictional defect could also be placed before the court adjudicating the trial of a family suit. (naeem)The trial under the special law especially under the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 requires strict adherence which ought to be complied, otherwise the essence and effectiveness of the law will be frustrated. Indeed, if any right is curtailed by any interim order not appealable, it can well be merged with and into final order and would then, if required be available for a challenge alongwith other grounds.

Once pre-arrest bail is declined by a competent court of law and the accused stands exposed to arrest.
At the very outset, we regard such inaction on the part of the investigating authorities a matter of serious concern. Prompt and faithful enforcement of judicial orders is fundamental to the criminal justice system. Once pre-arrest bail is declined by a competent court of law and the accused stands exposed to arrest in accordance with law.  

 It is, therefore, necessary to clarify that any practice whereby police authorities treat the mere filing of a petition before the Supreme Court as an implied stay or bar to arrest, despite the dismissal of pre-arrest bail, indicates a misunderstanding of the purpose of pre-arrest bail. This relief exists as an exceptional measure to protect individuals against arbitrary or mala fide arrest, where circumstances clearly warrant such protection. Once a competent court has declined pre-arrest bail, it has necessarily determined that no such exceptional circumstances exist and arrest is lawful and necessary to ensure an effective investigation. Allowing the mere act of filing another petition to operate as a de facto stay would render that judicial determination meaningless, defeat the objective of ensuring prompt and fair investigation, and risk abuse of process by enabling accused persons to indefinitely evade arrest without any legal basis. Therefore, judicial orders must remain binding and enforceable unless and until a competent court expressly orders otherwise. It must be remembered that interim protection is not automatic; it must be specifically sought and expressly granted. Absent such an order, a refusal of bail remains fully operative and must be implemented promptly and in good faith by investigating authorities. 

In this context, and pursuant to directions issued by this Court, the worthy Inspector General of Police, Punjab, appeared in person to explain the conduct of the investigating authorities. He unequivocally affirmed the legal position set out above, confirming that unless there exists an express injunctive or restraining order from this Court, the mere pendency of a petition before the Supreme Court ought not to be treated as a shield by any accused to avoid arrest. When questioned about the reasons for this extended delay and apparent failure to give effect to the order of the High Court, he submitted that a circular had been issued only a day before the present hearing, directing all police officers to ensure strict compliance with such orders in the future and to execute arrests without delay once pre-arrest bail is refused. He further assured the Court that these instructions would be renewed and recirculated every six months to maintain institutional awareness and discipline within the force.

It bears emphasis that the practice of delaying or avoiding arrest on the pretext of a pending petition raises serious concerns, as it essentially frustrates and weakens ongoing investigations and undermines the authority and finality of judicial orders. In addition, such a practice risks promoting a culture of impunity, enabling accused persons to evade the process of law by exploiting systemic inaction. We find that such conduct cannot be sustained, as it runs counter to the ongoing efforts of the judicial and legal system to not only uphold the rule of law but also to inspire and maintain public confidence in it.  

This Court, therefore, finds it imperative to state clearly that investigating officers and police authorities are legally bound to act upon court orders dismissing pre-arrest bail immediately, without waiting for further instructions or presuming the existence of any stay where none has been granted. Administrative convenience, internal practice, or mere pendency of higher-forum proceedings cannot justify or excuse failure to act in accordance with law.

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
تاریخی و قانونی جائزہ
 (پنجاب، پاکستان)
 تعارف 
(Introduction)
برصغیر میں زمین کی ملکیت، تقسیم اور استعمال کے باقاعدہ قوانین برطانوی عہد میں منظم انداز میں متعارف کرائے گئے۔
انگریز حکومت نے Land Revenue Administration کو مؤثر بنانے کے لیے گاؤں (Deh یا Mauza) کو ایک بنیادی انتظامی اکائی قرار دیا۔
ہر دیہہ (Deh) دو اہم زمروں پر مشتمل تھا:

آبادی دیہہ 
(Abadi Deh)
وہ حصہ جہاں گاؤں کے مکانات، ڈیرے اور رہائشی ڈھانچے موجود ہوں۔

شاملات دیہہ (Shamilat Deh)
وہ زمین جو گاؤں کے اجتماعی استعمال (مثلاً چراگاہ، قبرستان، راستے، تالاب، میدان وغیرہ) کے لیے مخصوص ہو۔

یہی دو اصول آج بھی پنجاب کے ریونیو ریکارڈ اور سول قانون کا بنیادی حصہ ہیں۔

 تاریخی پس منظر
 (Historical Background)
(الف) Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1887
یہ انگریز دور کا بنیادی قانون ہے جو آج بھی نافذ العمل ہے۔
اس کے تحت:

ہر گاؤں (Deh) کی حدبندی، نقشہ بندی (Shajra Parcha) اور ملکیت کا اندراج کیا گیا؛

’’آبادی‘‘ اور ’’شاملات‘‘ کی تفریق باقاعدہ ریونیو ریکارڈ میں متعین کی گئی؛

Khewat, Khasra, Khatooni, Jamabandi 
جیسے رجسٹر متعارف ہوئے۔

 Section 3(2) of the Punjab Land Revenue Act defines “estate” as including all lands in a village, including abadi and shamilat lands.

(ب) سیٹلمنٹ رولز و تنسیخ اراضی
 (Settlement Rules and Tenancy System)
سیٹلمنٹ رولز کے ذریعے زمینوں کی پیمائش اور ریکارڈ مرتب کیا گیا۔
ہر گاؤں کے ریکارڈ میں Shamilat Deh کو علیحدہ زمرے میں ظاہر کیا گیا۔
اسی بنیاد پر Superior Owners (اعلیٰ مالکان) اور Inferior Owners (ادنیٰ مالکان یا کاشتکار) کے حقوق متعین ہوئے۔

(ج) Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1959 (as amended 1961, 1975, 1998, 2001)
قیامِ پاکستان کے بعد جب شاملات زمینوں پر قبضے اور تقسیم کے تنازعات بڑھے، تو حکومتِ پنجاب نے اس قانون کے ذریعے ان زمینوں کے استعمال، ملکیت اور انتظام کے اصول طے کیے۔

اہم دفعات درج ذیل ہیں

Section 3:
تعریف کرتا ہے کہ کون سی زمین 
“Shamilat Deh” 
کہلائے گی۔
مثلاً چراگاہیں، قبرستان، تالاب، میدان، راستے، یا وہ زمین جو اجتماعی مفاد کے لیے مختص ہو۔

Section 4
ایسی زمین ریاست کی ملکیت قرار دی گئی مگر گاؤں کے رہائشیوں کے اجتماعی استعمال کے لیے مخصوص ہے۔

Section 5
شاملات کی الاٹمنٹ یا لیز صرف کمیونٹی مفاد
 (public purpose)
 کے لیے ممکن ہے۔

Section 7
اگر کوئی شخص ناجائز قبضہ کرے تو
 Collector / Assistant Commissioner 
اسے ختم کر سکتا ہے۔

Section 8
گاؤں کے رہائشیوں کے حقوق کو تحفظ حاصل ہے؛ نجی فروخت یا انفرادی ملکیت ناقابلِ قبول ہے۔

 برطانوی نظام میں ملکیت کا تصور
(الف) اعلیٰ مالک (Superior Owner / Aala Malik)
زمین کا اصل مالک، جو حکومت کو مال گزاری (Revenue) ادا کرتا تھا۔
یہ طبقہ قانونی طور پر landlord کہلاتا تھا۔

(ب) ادنیٰ مالک
 (Inferior Owner / Tenant / Occupant)
زمین کاشت کرنے والا شخص، جو زمین پر قابض تھا اور مال گزاری یا پیداوار کا حصہ مالکِ اعلیٰ کو دیتا تھا۔
اسے بعض صورتوں میں occupancy rights بھی مل جاتے تھے، جو موروثی نوعیت کے ہوتے۔

 آبادی و شاملات کی ملکیت
 (Ownership Distinction)
نوعیت وضاحت ملکیت / حق
آبادی دیہہ (Abadi Deh) گاؤں کے مکانات و رہائشی علاقے انفرادی ملکیت، فروخت/منتقلی ممکن
شاملات دیہہ (Shamilat Deh) مشترکہ استعمال کی زمینیں اجتماعی ملکیت، فروخت ممنوع
 

انتظامی و عدالتی حیثیت
(الف) ریونیو ڈیپارٹمنٹ
زمین کا ریکارڈ تیار کرتا اور ملکیت کا تعین کرتا ہے۔
شاملات پر ناجائز قبضہ ہو تو Collector اسے واگزار کرانے کا مجاز ہے۔

(ب) لوکل گورنمنٹ ادارے
2001، 2013 اور 2019 کے Punjab Local Government Acts کے بعد
شاملات کی دیکھ بھال (maintenance, lease for communal purpose) یونین کونسل یا تحصیل کونسل کو تفویض کی گئی۔

(ج) عدالتیں
اگر شاملات فروخت کی جائے یا ناجائز قبضہ ہو تو عدالتیں ہمیشہ اجتماعی حق کو ترجیح دیتی ہیں۔

 عدالتی نظائر
 (Case Law)
PLD 1975 Lahore 65
Held: Shamilat Deh cannot be treated as private property; it belongs to the village community.

1983 SCMR 1692
Held: Any allotment or sale of Shamilat lands without lawful authority is void ab initio.

2007 YLR 2140 (Lahore)
Held: Collector was directed to remove encroachments over Shamilat Deh; community rights are paramount.

2019 SCMR 512
Held: Conversion of graveyards or grazing lands for commercial use is against constitutional fundamental rights (Articles 9 & 23).

 اسلامی و آئینی تناظر 
(Constitutional & Islamic Perspective)
آئینِ پاکستان کا آرٹیکل 9: زندگی کے حق میں صاف ماحول اور قبرستان تک رسائی شامل ہے۔

آرٹیکل 23: ملکیت کے حق کا تحفظ، مگر عوامی مفاد کی زمین پر قبضہ کی اجازت نہیں۔

اسلامی اصول:
قبرستان، چراگاہ، راستہ، یا پانی کا ذخیرہ وقفِ عام تصور ہوتا ہے، اس پر نجی ملکیت کا دعویٰ شرعاً ناجائز ہے۔

 موجودہ قانونی حیثیت (Current Legal Position  2025)
شاملات دیہہ
 (Shamilat Deh)

اجتماعی ملکیت 
(community ownership)۔

قانونی کنٹرول
Revenue Department + Local Government Authority۔

انفرادی فروخت یا الاٹمنٹ غیر قانونی
 (except public purpose under Section 5 of 1959 Act)۔

آبادی دیہہ 
(Abadi Deh)

انفرادی رہائشی ملکیت۔

فروخت و منتقلی ممکن، ریونیو ریکارڈ میں مالکانہ اندراج موجود ہوتا ہے۔

قانونی دائرہ اختیار

ناجائز قبضے کے مقدمات: Collector/Assistant Commissioner (Revenue Jurisdiction)۔

عنوانی تنازعے: Civil Courts۔

 خلاصہ کلام ۔۔۔۔
 (Summary)
اصطلاح نوعیت ملکیت استعمال
آبادی دیہہ (Abadi Deh) انفرادی رہائش ذاتی ملکیت رہائش، تعمیر، فروخت
شاملات دیہہ (Shamilat Deh) اجتماعی زمین کمیونٹی / ریاست قبرستان، چراگاہ، راستہ، حوض وغیرہ
 قانونی بنیادیں:

Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1887

Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1959 (amended)

Punjab Local Government Act, 2019

Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 (Articles 9 & 23)

 مختصراً۔۔۔۔
 Conclusion
انگریز دور کے زمین داری نظام نے ’’آبادی‘‘ اور ’’شاملات‘‘ کی تفریق کو متعارف کرایا جو آج بھی ریونیو قانون، لوکل گورننس، اور عدالتی فیصلوں کی بنیاد ہے۔
عدالتوں نے ہمیشہ اس اصول کی پاسداری کی کہ:

“Shamilat Deh is meant for the collective benefit of the inhabitants of the village and cannot be converted into private ownership under any pretext.”
(2019 SCMR 512)

چنانچہ

آبادی = انفرادی رہائشی ملکیت

شاملات = اجتماعی اور ناقابلِ فروخت زمین

یہ فرق نہ صرف انتظامی بلکہ قانونی و اخلاقی لحاظ سے بھی بنیادی اور دائمی حیثیت رکھتا ہ

مطلقہ بیٹی فیملی پنشن کی حقدار ہے
Family pension is a daughter’s right under the law. Tying it to marital status entrenches structural inequality and reflects patriarchal assumptions, not constitutional principles.

Under the Rules, whether the daughter is unmarried or divorced, she is entitled to the pension of the deceased civil servant in this case being the father’s family pension. However, the Circular gives a narrow interpretation of Rule 4.10(2)(B)(v)7 and (vi) as it restricts the grant of pension to surviving daughters of pensioners based on their marital status at the time of death of the pensioner. This is contrary to the right prescribed under the Act of 1973 and the Rules which imposes no such condition. In our opinion, the Circular adopts an overly rigid approach making a woman’s entitlement to family pension strictly contingent on whether her status as a widow or divorcee was established prior to or at the exact time of the pensioner’s death. 
Even a change in status occurring a single day after the death of the pensioner is treated as a complete bar to family pension. The Circular therefore does not clarify Rule 4.10(2) (A) or (B) but rather it imposes a condition of status at the time of death of the pensioner which is totally beyond the intent of the Act of 1973 and the Rules. 

  It is settled law that executive clarifications in the form of circulars and administrative directives cannot override, amend or curtail the scope of the statute itself or the rules framed thereunder.

Birth during marriage conclusive proof of legitimacy---DNA test of minor daughter---Petitioner was aggrieved of denial of conducting DNA test to establish paternity of minor daughter---

Validity---Material question relating to paternity of the minor daughter had already been determined by three courts below in earlier round of litigation, on the basis of evidence available on the record---Ex-parte judgment and decree relied upon by petitioner was subsequent to the judgment in family suit and could not nullify earlier judgment, passed by Court of competent jurisdiction, establishing legitimacy of the minor---Supreme Court declined to interfere with the conclusion reached at by High Court which was in favour of legitimacy of minor daughter---Conditions attached to legitimacy are more strict under Muslim Law than under other systems but Muslim jurists and also the Courts have generally been very reluctant to stigmatize a child as illegitimate---As far as possible every presumption is made in favour of legitimacy---Courts are reluctant to declare a child bastard and have generally refused to admit illegitimacy when legitimacy can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances---

ایف آئی آر بذریعہ مختار درج کرائی جاسکتی ہے اور مختار کو دیگر فوجداری کارروائی کرنیکا بھی قانونی اختیار حاصل ہے 
Registration of FIR or initiation of criminal proceedings through attorney are permissible under the law.

An attorney of a person can lodge an FIR with the police and can also initiate criminal proceedings before a Court for the interest of his Principal. If the proceedings before the court were initiated by the principal, and he becomes unavailable or incapacitated, the attorney can also continue it on his behalf with the permission of the Court. Court should also encourage such practice keeping in view the hardships involved in the case to reduce delays in(naeem) the criminal process which would restore the confidence of public on the courts of law for acquisition or regulation of their rights. There is no doubt that Court shall decide the matter on production of relevant evidence only that can also be recorded by using modern techniques like through online applications. Misuse of process by attorney, through registration of false FIR or filing of private complaint, can well be met through sound remedial measures including action pursuant to sections 181, 182, 211, 213 and 250 of the Pakistan Penal Code(naeem) 1860. Thus, contention of learned counsel for the petitioners that FIR cannot be registered through attorney is nothing but farce.

مسٹر جسٹس امجد رفیق 
2025 LHC 5989
سب سے پہلے دیکھیں کہ ایا ۔۔۔۔۔
 کیا ایف۔آئی۔آر 
(FIR) 
کسی اٹارنی
 (Attorney) 
کے ذریعے درج کرائی جا سکتی ہے؟

لیکن اس سے پہلے یہ سمجھنا ضروری ہے کہ پاور آف اٹارنی (Power of Attorney) کا مفہوم کیا ہے۔

پاور آف اٹارنی ایک یا ایک سے زیادہ اشخاص کو یہ قانونی حق دیتی ہے کہ وہ کسی شخص (Principal) کی عدم موجودگی، نااہلی یا کسی مجبوری کی صورت میں اُس کے ایجنٹ (Agent) کے طور پر اس کی جانب سے کام کر سکیں۔ اٹارنی کو اس بات کا اختیار ہوتا ہے کہ وہ محدود یا وسیع اختیارات کے ساتھ اپنے پرنسپل کی نمائندگی کرے۔

پنجاب، پاکستان میں، پاور آف اٹارنی ایکٹ 1882ء کی دفعہ 2 کے تحت، اگر کوئی دستاویز اٹارنی کی جانب سے پرنسپل کی طرف سے انجام دی جائے، تو اسے قانونی حیثیت حاصل ہوتی ہے۔

قانونی اعتبار سے، کنٹریکٹ ایکٹ 1872ء کی دفعہ 182 میں "پرنسپل" اور "ایجنٹ" کی تعریف یوں بیان کی گئی ہے:

دفعہ 182:
"ایجنٹ" وہ شخص ہے جو کسی دوسرے کے لیے کوئی کام کرنے یا تیسرے فریق کے ساتھ معاملات میں اس کی نمائندگی کرنے کے لیے مقرر کیا جائے۔
جس شخص کے لیے یہ کام کیا جائے یا جس کی نمائندگی کی جائے، اسے "پرنسپل" کہا جاتا ہے۔

اسی ایکٹ کی دفعہ 188 ایجنٹ کے اختیار کی وسعت کو ان الفاظ میں بیان کرتی ہے:

دفعہ 188:
کسی کام کو انجام دینے کا اختیار رکھنے والا ایجنٹ اس کام کی تکمیل کے لیے ہر وہ قانونی کام کرنے کا مجاز ہوتا ہے جو اس مقصد کے لیے ضروری ہو۔
اور اگر کسی ایجنٹ کو کاروبار چلانے کا اختیار دیا گیا ہو، تو وہ اس کاروبار کے سلسلے میں ہر وہ قانونی اقدام کر سکتا ہے جو اس مقصد کے لیے ضروری یا معمول کے مطابق ہو۔

مثال:
(الف) اگر A کو B (جو لندن میں مقیم ہے) کی طرف سے کراچی میں واجب الادا رقم کی وصولی کے لیے مقرر کیا گیا ہے، تو A اس رقم کی وصولی کے لیے تمام قانونی اقدامات کر سکتا ہے اور اس کے بدلے میں درست رسید بھی جاری کر سکتا ہے۔

مندرجہ بالا قانونی دفعات اور پاور آف اٹارنی کے تصور سے یہ بات واضح ہوتی ہے کہ اٹارنی کو ہر وہ قانونی کام کرنے کا اختیار ہوتا ہے جو اسے دیے گئے اختیارات کی تکمیل کے لیے ضروری ہو۔
یہ اختیار ان حالات کو بھی شامل کر سکتا ہے جب کسی شخص کی جانب سے اٹارنی کے دائرۂ کار میں رہتے ہوئے جعلسازی یا کوئی جرم واقع ہو جائے جو اس کاروبار سے متعلق ہو جس کے لیے اٹارنی کو مقرر کیا گیا تھا۔

یہ اصول عدالتی نظائر سے بھی تقویت پاتا ہے۔
سندھ ہائی کورٹ نے مقدمہ 
Amanullah Khan v. The State (2011 P Cr. L J 774) میں یہ قرار دیا کہ:

“شکایت کنندہ کے اٹارنی کی جانب سے ایف۔آئی۔آر درج کرانے پر اعتراض بے بنیاد ہے۔
اب یہ اصول طے شدہ ہے کہ ہر شہری کو فوجداری کارروائی شروع کرنے کا حق حاصل ہے،
اور اس میں کوئی قانونی پابندی نہیں کہ صرف متاثرہ شخص ہی شکایت درج کرا سکتا ہے۔”

خلاصہ کلام ۔۔۔۔۔۔
قانونی طور پر ایف۔آئی۔آر اٹارنی کے ذریعے درج کرانا بالکل جائز ہے، بشرطیکہ پاور آف اٹارنی مؤثر طور پر نافذ ہو اور اٹارنی کے اختیارات کے دائرہ میں ہو۔

اس عدالت نے مقدمہ
 “Mian Amer Saeed بنام Station House Officer” (2011 YLR 1567)
 میں یہ اصول درج ذیل الفاظ میں طے کیا ہے

یہ مؤقف کہ دفعہ 22-A اور 22-B ضابطہ فوجداری (Cr.P.C.) کے تحت درخواست مدعا علیہ نمبر 2 اپنے اسپیشل اٹارنی کے ذریعے نہیں دے سکتا، کوئی وزن نہیں رکھتا۔
قانون میں یہ تقاضا نہیں کہ شکایت صرف وہی شخص دے جو کسی جرم کا براہِ راست متاثرہ ہو۔
اگر کسی کے سامنے کوئی جرم وقوع پذیر ہوا ہو، تو وہ شخص پولیس کو اس کی اطلاع دے سکتا ہے۔

درخواست گزار نے چیک جاری کرنے کے معاملے سے انکار نہیں کیا، جو بعد ازاں بینک سے ڈس آنر (عدم ادائیگی) ہوئے، اور بادی النظر میں یہ عمل تعزیراتِ پاکستان کی دفعہ 489-F کے تحت جرم بنتا ہے۔
ڈس آنر شدہ چیکس کی رقم کی بازیابی کے لیے دیوانی مقدمہ دائر کرنے سے، فوجداری کارروائی شروع کرنے میں کوئی قانونی رکاوٹ نہیں بنتی، کیونکہ دیوانی اور فوجداری کارروائیاں ایک ساتھ چل سکتی ہیں۔

دہلی ہائی کورٹ نے مقدمہ
 “Jasbir Singh بنام Deputy Commissioner of Police Crime Branch (EOW)”
[(2013(9) AD(Delhi) 284): (2013(138) DRJ 683): (2013(4) JCC 2638): (2014(12) R.C.R.(Civil) 1461)] میں
یہ قرار دیا کہ پاور آف اٹارنی ہولڈر کی جانب سے درج کی گئی ایف۔آئی۔آر منسوخ نہیں کی جا سکتی۔ عدالت نے کہا:

“موجودہ مقدمے میں بھی ضابطہ فوجداری (Cr.P.C.) کے قواعد لاگو ہوتے ہیں،
اور صرف اس بنیاد پر ایف۔آئی۔آر کو کالعدم قرار نہیں دیا جا سکتا کہ شکایت کنندگان کینیڈا میں مقیم ہیں
اور ذاتی طور پر بھارت آ کر شکایت درج نہیں کر سکتے۔
ان کے پاور آف اٹارنی ہولڈر کے ذریعے دی گئی شکایت پر ایف۔آئی۔آر کا اندراج بالکل درست ہے۔”

اسی طرح بھارتی سپریم کورٹ نے مقدمہ
 “Vinita S. Rao بنام M/s. Essen Corporate Services Pvt. Ltd. and another” 
(2015 AIR (SC) 882) 
میں،
جو کہ نیگوشی ایبل انسٹرومنٹس ایکٹ کی دفعہ 138 سے متعلق تھا،
یہ قرار دیا کہ پاور آف اٹارنی ہولڈر شکایت دائر کر سکتا ہے،
اگرچہ اس قانون کے مطابق شکایت صرف “پیئی” (Payee) ہی دائر کر سکتا ہے۔

عدالت کے مشاہدات درج ذیل ہیں:

“پاور آف اٹارنی ہولڈر عدالت کے روبرو حلفاً بیان دے کر شکایت کے مندرجات کو ثابت کر سکتا ہے۔
تاہم، پاور آف اٹارنی ہولڈر کو یا تو مذکورہ لین دین کا براہِ راست گواہ ہونا چاہیے،
یا پھر اس معاملے کے متعلق مکمل معلومات ہونی چاہئیں۔”

مزید برآں، مقدمہ 
“M/s. Shankar Finance & Investments بنام State of Andhra Pradesh & others”
 (2009 AIR (SC) 422) 
میں
بھارتی سپریم کورٹ نے یہ اصول وضع کیا کہ

“یہ ضروری نہیں کہ کسی واحد مالک (Proprietary Concern) کو ہی
نیگوشی ایبل انسٹرومنٹس ایکٹ کی دفعات 138 اور 142 کے تحت
چیک ڈس آنر ہونے پر شکایت دائر کرنی ہو؛
بلکہ اگر پاور آف اٹارنی ہولڈر پیئی (Payee) کی جانب سے تحریری شکایت دائر کرے،
تو وہ مکمل طور پر قابلِ قبول اور برقرار رکھی جا سکتی ہے۔”

خلاصہ کلام ۔۔۔
ان تمام عدالتی نظائر سے یہ اصول واضح ہوتا ہے کہ
پاور آف اٹارنی ہولڈر کو قانونی طور پر یہ اختیار حاصل ہے
کہ وہ شکایت یا ایف۔آئی۔آر درج کرا سکتا ہے،
بشرطیکہ وہ متعلقہ معاملات سے واقف ہو یا
پرنسپل کی جانب سے بااختیار طور پر کارروائی کر رہا

 1. بنیادی قانونی سوال*
یہ سوال پیدا ہوتا ہے کہ*

کیا کسی اٹارنی (Attorney) کو یہ اختیار حاصل ہے کہ وہ کسی دوسرے شخص (Principal) کی طرف سے ایف۔آئی۔آر درج کرائے، شکایت دے یا عدالت میں کارروائی شروع کرے؟

یہ اصول دراصل Agency Law اور Procedural Law (Cr.P.C. / CPC) کے سنگم پر کھڑا ہے۔

2. قانونی بنیاد
 (Statutory Foundation)
(i) Powers of Attorney Act, 1882 – Section 2
یہ دفعہ اس بات کو تسلیم کرتی ہے کہ اگر کوئی دستاویز یا کارروائی اٹارنی کی جانب سے پرنسپل کی طرف سے کی جائے تو اسے وہی قانونی حیثیت حاصل ہوگی جو پرنسپل کے ذاتی فعل کو حاصل ہوتی۔

یعنی

اٹارنی “قانونی نمائندہ” (legal agent) ہے، جس کا عمل اس کے موکل (Principal) کا عمل سمجھا جاتا ہے۔

(ii) Contract Act, 1872 – Sections 182 & 188
Section 182 پرنسپل اور ایجنٹ کی تعریف دیتا ہے؛

Section 188 کہتا ہے کہ ایجنٹ ہر وہ قانونی عمل کر سکتا ہے جو اپنے اختیار کی تکمیل کے لیے ضروری ہو۔

اس سے صاف ظاہر ہے کہ اگر اٹارنی کو کاروبار، مالیات یا قانونی معاملات کے لیے مقرر کیا گیا ہے، تو اسے ہر وہ عمل کرنے کا اختیار حاصل ہے جو “ضروری یا معمول کے مطابق” ہو۔

 3. عدالتی نظائر (Judicial Precedents) کا تجزیہ
 (a) Mian Amer Saeed v. SHO (2011 YLR 1567)
عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ درخواست 22-A / 22-B Cr.P.C. اٹارنی کے ذریعے دی جا سکتی ہے۔

قانون یہ شرط نہیں لگاتا کہ شکایت صرف متاثرہ شخص ہی دے۔

کوئی بھی شخص جو کسی جرم کے بارے میں معلومات رکھتا ہے، پولیس کو اطلاع دے سکتا ہے۔

 قانونی اثر:
یہ فیصلہ “جرم کی اطلاع دینے” کے عام عوامی حق کو تسلیم کرتا ہے۔
یعنی فوجداری نظامِ انصاف "locus standi" کی قید سے آزاد ہے — کوئی بھی شہری جرم کی اطلاع دے سکتا ہے، چاہے وہ متاثرہ ہو یا نہ ہو۔

 (b) Jasbir Singh v. DCP Crime Branch (Delhi HC, 2013)
شکایت کنندگان بیرونِ ملک (کینیڈا) میں مقیم تھے۔

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ ان کے پاور آف اٹارنی ہولڈر کے ذریعے ایف۔آئی۔آر درج کرانا جائز ہے۔

ایف۔آئی۔آر کو منسوخ کرنے کی درخواست مسترد کر دی گئی۔

قانونی اثر:
عدالت نے عملی انصاف (pragmatic justice) کو ترجیح دی —
اگر اصل فریق ذاتی طور پر حاضر نہیں ہو سکتا، تو اس کا نمائندہ قانونی طور پر کارروائی کر سکتا ہے، بشرطیکہ وہ مجاز ہو۔

 (c) Vinita S. Rao v. Essen Corporate Services (2015 AIR SC 882)
Negotiable Instruments Act, Section 138 (چیک باؤنس کیس) میں،
سپریم کورٹ نے اجازت دی کہ پاور آف اٹارنی ہولڈر شکایت دائر کر سکتا ہے۔

شرط یہ لگائی گئی کہ وہ یا تو معاملہ کا گواہ ہو، یا اس کے بارے میں مکمل معلومات رکھتا ہو۔

 قانونی اثر:
عدالت نے یہاں “knowledge test” متعارف کرائی —
یعنی نمائندہ شکایت دائر تو کر سکتا ہے، مگر صرف اس وقت جب وہ معاملے کے حقائق سے باخبر ہو۔

 (d) Shankar Finance & Investments v. State of Andhra Pradesh (2009 AIR SC 422)
عدالت نے کہا کہ اگر چیک کا پیئی (Payee) کسی کاروباری ادارے کا مالک ہے،
تو پاور آف اٹارنی ہولڈر اس کی طرف سے شکایت دائر کر سکتا ہے۔

شرط یہ نہیں کہ شکایت خود مالک کرے، بلکہ اس کے نام سے Authorized Agent کر سکتا ہے۔

 قانونی اثر:
یہ فیصلہ "Representation by Authorization" کے اصول کو مضبوط کرتا ہے —
یعنی اگر نمائندہ بااختیار ہے، تو اس کی کارروائی موکل کے نام پر مؤثر ہے۔

 4. فوجداری اور دیوانی کاروائی کا امتزاج
عدالتوں نے واضح کیا کہ:

کسی چیک کی رقم کے لیے دیوانی مقدمہ دائر کرنا
فوجداری کارروائی (Section 489-F یا 138 N.I. Act) شروع کرنے میں رکاوٹ نہیں۔

 اصول
Civil and Criminal remedies are concurrent, not mutually exclusive.

 5. اصولی خلاصہ (Doctrinal Summary)
قانونی پہلو اصول
Agency Law اٹارنی کو وہی اختیارات حاصل ہیں جو پرنسپل کے ہوتے ہیں۔
Criminal Law جرم کی اطلاع کوئی بھی شخص دے سکتا ہے؛ لازمی نہیں کہ متاثرہ ہو۔
Procedural Law عدالت میں کارروائی اٹارنی کے ذریعے ممکن ہے بشرطیکہ وہ بااختیار ہو۔
Evidence Rule اٹارنی کو معاملے کے حقائق کا علم ہونا چاہیے تاکہ وہ گواہی دے سکے۔
Concurrent Jurisdiction دیوانی و فوجداری کارروائیاں ساتھ ساتھ چل سکتی ہیں۔
 6. پاکستان میں اس اصول کا اثر
پاکستانی عدلیہ (خصوصاً لاہور و سندھ ہائی کورٹس) نے اب اس بات کو تسلیم کر لیا ہے کہ:

ایف۔آئی۔آر پاور آف اٹارنی کے ذریعے درج ہو سکتی ہے؛

اٹارنی 22-A / 22-B Cr.P.C. کی درخواست دائر کر سکتا ہے؛

شرط یہ ہے کہ پاور آف اٹارنی درست، بااختیار اور مصدقہ ہو۔

 7. ممکنہ حدود 
(Limitations)
اگر پاور آف اٹارنی جعلی یا منسوخ ہو چکا ہو تو کارروائی کالعدم ہو سکتی ہے۔

اگر اٹارنی کو مخصوص کام کے لیے مقرر نہیں کیا گیا (مثلاً کاروبار کے لیے تھا، مگر شکایت درج کر دی) تو اختیار سے تجاوز (ultra vires) شمار ہوگا۔

اٹارنی کو ہمیشہ علمِ واقعات (knowledge of facts) ثابت کرنا ہوگا۔

⚖️ نتیجہ (Legal Conclusion)
ایف۔آئی۔آر یا فوجداری شکایت پاور آف اٹارنی ہولڈر کے ذریعے درج کرانا قانوناً جائز ہے،
بشرطیکہ:

اٹارنی کے پاس مؤثر و مصدقہ اختیارنامہ ہو؛

وہ معاملے سے واقف ہو؛

اور کارروائی پرنسپل کے مفاد میں ہو۔

یہ اصول 
Powers of Attorney Act, 1882، Contract Act, 1872، 
اور عدالتی نظائر کے مطابق ہے،
اور فوجداری انصاف کے عمومی مقصد یعنی “ہر جرم کی اطلاع ملنا اور کارروائی ہونا” کو تقویت دیتا ہے۔

ھیلتھ کیئر کمشن کے انسپکٹر سجاد  صاحب نے ھمارے ایک  معزز ممبر جناب سجاد عادل  کے کلینک کو مورخہ 28 آگست 2025 کو نان رجسٹرڈ ، نان کوالیفائیڈ کے دفعات پر سیل اور انکے خلاف ایف آئی آر درج کیا تھا۔   ایسوسی ایشن نے اپنے ممبر کو سیشن کورٹ مانسھرہ سے  ضمانت پر رھا کیا۔ اور پشاور ھائی کورٹ ایبٹ آباد بینچ کے سامنے  ، اپنے ممبر کے خلاف ایف ائی ار اور کلینک سیلنگ کو کلعدم قرار دینے کے لیے پٹیشن دائر کیا تھا۔ پٹیشن میں یہ موقف اختیار کیا تھا۔ کہ الائیڈ ہیلتھ پروفیشنلز ، الائیڈ ہیلتھ پروفیشنلز کونسل ایکٹ 22 کے بعد  ھیلتھ ڈیلیوری سسٹم میں ایک علحیدہ کمیونٹی ھے۔ نہ یہ ڈاکثرز ھیں اور نہ ڈاکٹرز کے زیرنگرانی کام کرنے کے پابند ھیں۔ بلکہ اپنے سرٹیفکیٹ ، ڈپلومہ اور ڈگری کے بنیاد پر اپنے کونسل کے قوانین کے مطابق ، ازادانہ اپنے جاب ڈسکریپشن اور سکوپ اف ورک کے مطابق کام کرنے کے اھل ھیں۔ انکو اب رجسٹریشن ، لائسنس وغیرہ اپنے کونسل سے جاری ھوگا۔ اور انکے خلاف کوئی بھی قانونی کاروائی یا کونسل خود کرے گا یا کونسل جس کو انکے خلاف کاروائی کرنے کے لیے کسی کو  حکم نامہ جاری کریں۔ 
الائیڈ ہیلتھ پروفیشنلز کونسل ایکٹ 22 کے دفعہ 41 کے مطابق الائیڈ ہیلتھ پروفیشنلز کونسل ایکٹ 22 پھلے سے موجود تمام قوانین پر اوور رائیڈنگ ایفکٹ رکھتا ھے۔ 
چونکہ ھیلتھ کیئر کمشن کے لیگل ایڈوائزری کمیٹی کے ساتھ  خیبرپختونخوا ڈینٹل ٹیکنشنز و ٹیکنالوجسٹ ایسوسی ایشن رجسٹرڈ نے اس سلسلے میں باقاعدہ میٹنگ بھی کیا تھا لیکن وہ اس ایکٹ کو من وعن ماننے اور اس پر عمل کرنے سے مسلسل روگردانی کر رھے تھے ۔ اور انکے انسپکٹر سرے سے کوئی بات بھی نھیں سنتے اور ھمیں یہ مسلسل کھتے ۔ کہ اس ایکٹ میں کھاں لکھا ھے۔ کہ آپ  اب پریکٹس کرنے کے اھل ھیں۔ 
لھذا بامر مجبوری ایسوسی ایشن نے الائیڈ ہیلتھ پروفیشنلز کونسل ایکٹ 22 کے وضاحت عدالت سے سجاد عادل کے کیس میں سننے کے لیے پٹیشن دائر کیا۔ 
اج مورخہ 15 اکتوبر 2025 عدالت نے ھیلتھ کیئر کمشن کے لیگل ٹیم سے استفسار کیا۔ کہ اپ نے اس کلینک کو کس قانون کے تحت بند کیا ھے۔ تو لیگل ٹیم نے جواب دیا کہ ایکٹ 2015 کے مطابق ۔
عدالت نے دوبارہ استفسار کیا کہ الائیڈ ہیلتھ پروفیشنلز کونسل ایکٹ 22 کس لیے بنا ھے۔ تو ھیلتھ کیئر کمشن نے اس ایکٹ کو جاننے سے انکار کیا۔ کھا کہ اس بارے ھمہں کچھ علم نھیں۔ حلانکہ  ھمارے ھر ممبر کے پاس یہ ایکٹ موجود ھے۔ اسے دکھا کر یہاننے سے انکار کرتے۔ 
عدالت نے پوچھا ۔ کہ جب تم کسی کے پاس جاکر انکے کلینک کو بند کرتے ھیں۔ تو اپکو اس کے پورے قانونی پھلو پر عبور حاصل کرنا ضروری ھے۔؟۔ 
ھیلتھ کیئر کمشن نے عدالت کے سامنے اس پر معزرت کی۔ 
عدالت نے سجاد عادل کو فورا اپنے کلینک ڈی سیل کرنے کا ارڈر جاری کیا۔ 
اور  سجاد عادل کے خلاف ایف آئی آر پر جواب دینے کے لیے ھیلتھ کیئر کمشن کو دوبارہ تاریخ دے دیا۔

الائیڈ ہیلتھ پروفیشنلز کونسل کے لیے دیگر پیرامیڈیکل اسٹاف کے ھمراہ خیبرپختونخوا ڈینٹل ٹیکنشنز و ٹیکنالوجسٹ ایسوسی ایشن رجسٹرڈ نے دن رات محنت کرکے اس کو حاصل کیاھے۔ اور اب اگر  اس کونسل کے بننے کے بعد، جب ھم پر ایف آئی آر اور کلینک سیلنگ کا مسلسل اپریشن مسلط کیا،  تو ھمیں یہ فکر شروع ھوئی۔ کہ ھمارے ھاتھوں کے بنے قانون ھمیں کیوں دفاع نھیں دیتے۔
اج الحمدللہ رب العالمین ھمیں یہ معلوم ھوا۔ کہ ھمارے قانونی حیثیت مستحکم ھے۔ بس ھمیں اپنے قانون سے فوائد حاصل کرنے کے لیے منظم اور مستعدی کے ساتھ جدوجھد کرنا چاھیے۔ 
اس اھم موقع پر میں اپنے صوبائی کابینہ اور تمام ممبران کے تعاون اور سپورٹ پر انھیں خراج تحسین پیش کرتا ھوں۔ 
خیبرپختونخوا ڈینٹل ٹیکنشنز و ٹیکنالوجسٹ ایسوسی ایشن رجسٹرڈ واحد ایسوسی ایشن ھے۔ جو اپنے ممبران کے دفاع کے لیے ھر حد تک جاتی ھے۔ اور یہ واحد ایسوسی ایشن ھے۔ جو ھر ایک کے دکھ درد میں پوری طرح شریک ھے۔ 
مجھے فخر ھے اپنے ممبران پر جنھوں نے سجاد عادل کے کیس میں مالی تعاون اور سپورث فراھم کیئے۔ انکے کلینک کے سیل ھونے کے ںعد اسے باقاعدہ گھر کا خرچہ بھی دیا ھے۔ اور انکے ساتھ ساتھ اگے بھی انکے ساتھ شانہ بشانہ کھڑے ھیں۔ 
مجھے سجاد عادل کے مضبوط اعصاب پر بھی فخر ھے۔  جنھوں نے  خوشی کے ساتھ کلینک کو دو مھینے  ایک سچ ثابت کرنے کے لیے  بند رکھ کر بڑی قربانی دے دی۔ 
اور اج الحمدللہ اسے  خود اور ا تمام ایسوسی ایشن کو اس قربانی کا پھل بھی ملا۔

پشتون جرگا — ہماری روایت، ہمارا فخر

پشتون قوم کی پہچان صرف بہادری اور غیرت میں نہیں، بلکہ انصاف، مشاورت اور بھائی چارے میں بھی ہے۔ اسی جذبے سے ہمارے آبا و اجداد نے جرگا سسٹم کو جنم دیا۔ یہ جرگا سسٹم سینکڑوں سال پرانا ہے — جب نہ عدالتیں تھیں، نہ پولیس کے نظام، تب قبائل کے بزرگ آپس میں بیٹھ کر انصاف کرتے تھے۔ یہ انصاف قرآن و سنت کے قریب تر تھا، جس میں نیت خالص، بات سیدھی اور فیصلہ عوام کے سامنے ہوتا تھا۔

جرگا کی اصل روح

جرگا کا مطلب ہے "مشاورت سے فیصلہ"۔ جرگا میں لوگ اپنی عزت، ایمان اور قبیلے کے وقار کی قسم کھا کر بیٹھتے تھے۔ مقصد ہوتا تھا صلح، انصاف اور بھائی چارہ۔ یہ نظام اس وقت کامیاب تھا جب لوگ ایماندار تھے، بزرگوں کا احترام تھا، اور پیسہ یا سفارش فیصلے میں دخل نہیں دیتا تھا۔

آج کا المیہ

اب حالات بدل گئے ہیں۔ پولیس اور سرکاری ادارے اپنی حدود سے تجاوز کر کے خود عدالت بننے لگے ہیں۔ یہی وجہ ہے کہ آج عوام کا اعتماد ٹوٹ رہا ہے۔ پولیس کا کام مجرم پکڑنا، منشیات فروشوں کو ختم کرنا، امن و امان قائم رکھنا اور عوام کی حفاظت کرنا ہے — نہ کہ لوگوں کے گھریلو یا قبائلی فیصلے سنانا۔

جب پولیس خود “جرگا” بنے گی تو طاقتور کا فائدہ ہوگا، غریب کی آواز دب جائے گی، اور انصاف ختم ہو جائے گا۔

جرگا کی عزت، مگر قانون کے مطابق

ہم پشتون اپنی روایات پر فخر کرتے ہیں۔ جرگا ہمارا فخر ہے، مگر اسے اسلامی اور آئینی دائرے میں رہ کر ہونا چاہیے۔ جو فیصلے شریعت یا قانون کے خلاف ہوں، وہ نہ جائز ہیں نہ قابلِ قبول۔ چھوٹے جھگڑے، زمین یا خاندانی معاملات جرگا سے حل ہو سکتے ہیں، مگر قتل، زیادتی، یا قبضے جیسے سنگین کیسز صرف عدالت میں چلنے چاہئیں۔

ہمارا مطالبہ

1. پولیس اپنی حدود میں رہے — صرف قانون نافذ کرے، فیصلے نہ سنائے۔


2. جرگے کی روایت کو برقرار رکھا جائے، مگر شفافیت اور انصاف کے ساتھ۔


3. خواتین اور کمزور طبقات کو بھی بولنے کا حق دیا جائے۔


4. عدالتوں میں انصاف تیز اور سستا کیا جائے تاکہ لوگ خود عدالت کا رخ کریں۔


5. جرگا کو مشورتی حیثیت دی جائے، عدالتی اختیار نہیں۔



اختتامیہ

ہم پختون ہیں، اور پختونوالی کا مطلب ہے غیرت، انصاف، مہمان نوازی اور ایمان داری۔ ہم کسی لادینی قانون کے غلام نہیں — ہم صرف اللہ، اس کے رسول ﷺ اور آئینِ پاکستان کے تابع ہیں۔ ہم چاہتے ہیں کہ پولیس اپنا اصل فرض ادا کرے اور جرگا اپنی روایتی حدود میں رہے۔ جب ہر ادارہ اپنی جگہ پر کام کرے گا، تب ہی انصاف قائم ہوگا، ظلم ختم ہوگا، اور پشتون روایات عزت کے ساتھ قائم رہیں گی۔

Return/recovery of dower---Execution petition---Maintainability---Scope---Suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula was decreed subject to return of dower---Four tolas of gold ornaments was fixed as dower duly entered in Column of Nikah Nama---Executing Court turned down the objection of respondent/ex-wife that execution petition for recovery of Zar-e-Khulla was not maintainable---Appellate Court accepted the version/objection of respondent by allowing her revision petition---Held, that the decision of dissolution of marriage in terms of S.10(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964, was compound, which on the one hand dissolved the marriage inter se parties and, on the other, said dissolution was made subject to return of dower---Manner and form of decree was prescribed in Rr. 16 and 17 of the Family Courts Rules, 1965, in light of which dissolution of marriage, on the basis of Khula subject to return of dower was a decree for all intent and purposes under S.13 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, and thus was executable---

JUDGMENT---This petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 stems out from judgment dated 22nd September, 2016, whereby the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, while allowing the revision petition filed by respondent No.3 (hereinafter referred to as "respondent") set aside the order dated 6th February, 2016 passed by the learned Judge Family Court/ Executing Court, Rawalpindi.

2.    Facts in brief necessary for adjudication of instant petition are that the petitioner was married to the "respondent". On account of differences, a suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula was instituted by the "respondent", which was decreed by way of judgment dated 8th December, 2010, subject to return of dower. The petitioner moved an execution petition seeking return of dower. The execution petition was though objected by the "respondent", however, by way of order dated 6th February, 2016, the objection was turned down and the "respondent" was directed to hand over 4-tola gold in shape of ornaments or its price at the prevailing market rate. Feeling dissatisfied, the "respondent" filed a revision petition before the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, which was accepted through impugned judgment on the ground that execution petition was not competent, in the circumstances.

3.    After having heard learned counsel for the parties at considerable length, I have perused the record.

4.    After having remained in marital tie for some time with the petitioner, the "respondent" in order to part her ways, instituted a suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula before the learned Judge Family Court, Rawalpindi. On failure of pre-trial reconciliation proceedings, suit was finally decreed by way of order dated 8th December, 2010 with the following observations: -

       "3. Considering pre-trial reconciliation proceedings to be failed under proviso of Section 10(4) of Family Courts Act 1964, suit of the plaintiff for dissolution of marriage is hereby decreed on the basis of Khullah, subject to return of dower…"

       (Underlining supplied for emphasis)

5.    This followed an execution petition on behalf of petitioner for the return of 4-tola of gold as part of dower. The "respondent" resisted the execution proceedings and by way of order dated 22nd November, 2011, she was directed to return the four tolas gold ornaments mentioned in Nikahnama or its price mentioned in the receipt at the time of Nikah. Feeling dissatisfied, the petitioner preferred revision petition before the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, which was allowed by way of judgment dated 2nd April, 2012. The "respondent" then filed W.P.No.3002 of 2012, which was accepted with the consent of the parties by way of order dated 15th May, 2015 in the following manner:-

       "With the consensus of the parties, this petition is accepted and set aside the orders dated 25.11.2011 and 02.04.2012 passed by the learned trial Court, with a direction to the learned Executing Court to decide the application of the respondent afresh keeping in view the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in titled "Mst. Ayesha Shaheen v. Khalid Mehmood and another" (2013 SCMR 1049).

6.    In post remand proceedings, the learned Judge Family Court/ Executing Court, by way of order dated 6th February, 2016, directed the "respondent" to hand over 4-tola gold in shape of ornaments or its price at the prevailing market value while discarding her objections. This prompted the "respondent" to file the revision petition before the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, which was allowed through impugned judgment.

7.    It appears from the impugned judgment that the revision petition was accepted on the sole ground that for the recovery of "Zar-e-Khula" in a suit for dissolution of marriage, execution petition was not maintainable. Reliance to this effect was placed on Mst. Nadia Bibi v. Additional District Judge and others (PLD 2013 Lahore 41). From the perusal of the judgment in the case of (Mst. Nadia Bibi) supra; it clearly reveals that in the said matter suit for dissolution of marriage was decreed and marriage was dissolved on the basis of Khula without any condition. In this backdrop, it was held that as there was no decree in favour of respondent No.2 in the petition, so execution proceedings are not maintainable.

8.    The facts in the present case on the contrary are altogether different. In this case, the learned Judge Family Court, while dissolving the marriage on the basis of Khula, directed the "respondent" to return the dower. As per column No.17 of Nikahnama, dower was in the shape of 4-tola gold ornaments, which is even not in dispute. Learned counsel for the "respondent" though submitted that a suit for recovery was instituted by the petitioner to this effect, which was dismissed but from the perusal of record it reveals that suit for recovery was related to some other gold ornaments, having no nexus with the gold ornaments subject matter of the present controversy.

9.    The term "decree" is nowhere defined in the Family Courts Act, 1964. So for this purpose, recourse can be made to section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908), which defines the decree as under:-

       "decree" means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint the determination of any question within section 144 and an order under rules 60, 98, 99, 101 or 103 of Order XXI but shall not include ---

       (a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order; or

       (b) any order of dismissal for default.

After having a glimpse of the definition of decree, no doubt left that a decree means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint the determination of any question within section 144 and an order under Rules 60, 98, 99, 101 or 103 of Order XXI but shall not include any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order or any order of dismissal for default. Suit for dissolution of marriage was decreed in terms of section 10 (4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964. The decision was compound, which on the one hand dissolved the marriage interse parties and on the other dissolution was made subject to return of dower.

10.  Section 13 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 provides the manner of enforcement of decrees, which reads as under: -

       13. Enforcement of decrees.- (1) The Family Court shall pass a decree in such form and in such manner as may be prescribed, and shall enter its particulars in the prescribed register.

       (2) If any money is paid or any property is delivered in the presence of the Family Court, in satisfaction of the decree, it shall enter the fact of payment [or] the delivery of property, as the case may be, in the aforesaid register.

       (3) Where a decree relates to the payment of money and the decretal amount is not paid within time specified by the Court [not exceeding thirty days], the same shall, if the Court so directs be recovered as arrears of land revenue, and on recovery shall be paid to the decree-holder.

       (4) The decree shall be executed by the Court, passing it or by such other Civil Court as the District Judge may, by special or general order, direct.

       (5) A Family Court may, if it so deems fit, direct that any money to be paid under a decree passed by it be paid in such installments as it deems fit.

11.  The manner and form of decree is provided in the West Pakistan Family Court Rules, 1965. Rules 16 and 17, for the said purpose, are more relevant, which are reproduced below:-

       16. In every suit, on passing the judgment, a decree shall be drawn up in Form I and shall be signed by the presiding Judge. The decree shall bear the seal of the Court.

       17. The Court shall maintain a register of decrees and orders in the form prescribed for decrees and orders under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

12.  The above discussion thus leads to irresistible conclusion that the order dated 8th December, 2010 resulting into dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula subject to return of dower, for all intent and purposes, was a decree under section 13 of the "Act, 1964" and was executable.

13.  The crux of above discussion is that the learned Additional District Judge has erred in law while allowing the revision petition. Resultantly, this petition is allowed. Impugned judgment dated 22nd September, 2016 is set aside being illegal and unlawful.

⚖️ قانونی نکات (Legal Points)

1. دفعہ 489-F P.P.C. کے تحت جرم

اگر کوئی شخص بددیانتی سے چیک جاری کرے جو بعد میں بغیر فنڈز یا جعلی ہونے کی وجہ سے باؤنس ہو جائے،
تو یہ جرم S.489-F P.P.C. کے تحت آتا ہے۔

اس کی سزا تین سال تک قید یا جرمانہ یا دونوں ہو سکتے ہیں۔

---

2. ضمانت کا عمومی اصول (Bail Rule)

چونکہ یہ جرم پروبہیبٹری کلاز (Prohibitory Clause) میں نہیں آتا (یعنی 10 سال سے کم سزا والا جرم ہے)،
اس لیے عام طور پر ضمانت دی جا سکتی ہے۔

مگر عدالت نے وضاحت کی کہ:

> “یہ کوئی کلی اصول (universal rule) نہیں کہ ہر غیر پروبہیبٹری مقدمے میں ضمانت لازمی دی جائے۔
اگر کیس کے حالات غیر معمولی ہوں تو عدالت ضمانت مسترد بھی کر سکتی ہے۔”

---

3. ملزم کا فریب دہندہ رویہ (Modus Operandi)

عدالت نے نوٹ کیا کہ ملزم نے:

شکایت کنندہ کو جھوٹے خواب دکھائے (“گلاب کا باغ دکھایا” یعنی فراڈ کیا)،

جعلی بینک لیٹر دیا،

اور پھر جھوٹا چیک جاری کیا۔

یہ تمام کارروائیاں ایک منظم دھوکہ دہی (systematic deception) کو ظاہر کرتی ہیں۔

عدالت نے کہا کہ یہ طرزِ عمل “meaningful and deceptive” ہے اور ضمانت کے حق میں نہیں جاتا۔

---

4. عدالتی اصول

عدالت نے کہا کہ ضمانت ایک رعایت (discretionary relief) ہے،
جو صرف اسی وقت دی جا سکتی ہے جب عدالت کو یقین ہو کہ
ملزم کی بد نیتی (mens rea) اور فراڈ کی نیت واضح نہیں ہے۔

اس مقدمے میں، ملزم کا ارادہ شروع سے فراڈ کرنے کا تھا۔

---

🧾 عدالتی فیصلہ (Judgment)

عدالتِ عالیہ لاہور نے قرار دیا کہ:

> “درخواست گزار نے جھوٹے بہانے سے رقم وصول کی،
جعلی لیٹر جاری کیا،
اور پھر باؤنس ہونے والا چیک دیا۔
اس طرزِ عمل سے ظاہر ہے کہ ملزم کا ارادہ بددیانتی پر مبنی تھا،
لہٰذا اس کے حق میں عدالت اپنا اختیار استعمال نہیں کر سکتی۔”

نتیجہ:

ضمانت کی درخواست مسترد کر دی گئی۔

مدعی مقدمہ (Complainant) کی شکایت کو درست اور معتبر قرار دیا گیا۔

The following queries arise for our consideration: 

Question No= 01
.............................
i)  In the context of capital punishments, is it permissible for convictions to be predicated on circumstantial evidence? 

Answer:
............
In order to adjudicate the question No. (i) supra, it is now widely accepted that punishment can be imposed based on circumstantial evidence; however, it is subject to rigorous standards and principles. Conviction exclusively on the basis of circumstantial evidence is not prohibited by law. Nevertheless, the quality and sufficiency of the evidence are more important than its quantity. The circumstantial evidence must be of a nature that is inconsistent with the accused’s innocence. The accused must be linked to the offense by a complete and unbroken chain of circumstantial evidence. The conclusion of guilt must be reached by the collective application of the various pieces of circumstantial evidence, with one end (naeem)of the chain contacting the deceased individual and the other touching the accused individual’s neck. If any link in this chain is absent, the entire chain is disrupted and no conviction can be recorded in such a situation. 

Question No= 02
...........................
ii) . In a court of law, what is the admissibility of CCTV footage and its evidentiary value?

Answer:
...............
Reverting to question No. (ii) it is worth mentioning that in the case of State v Ahmed Omar Sheikh (2021 SCMR 873), this Court has established a two-step test for the verification of digital evidence regarding CCTV footage. This examination necessitates that the evidence in question be both authentic and pertinent, and that it has been acquired from a trustworthy and dependable source. The list of conditions comprises:

 “i) providing an explanation of how the video was obtained or its source, and

 ii)presenting a forensic report to show that the video has not been altered.” 

 It is a well-known fact that technology has become so ingrained in our lives that everyone is utilizing one form of technology or another. Criminals are also employing this in our society, establishing a trail for digital forensics to follow in order to uncover their crimes. It is important to note that we were unable to capitalize on digital evidence for an extended period of time due to the following factors: Firstly, our courts were previously reliant on traditional methods of evidence collection and presentation. Secondly, digital evidence was admissible only under article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (“QSO of 1984), which allows the court to admit any evidence that is obtained through the use of modern devices if it is deemed appropriate. Thirdly, the evidence was considered hearsay. Nevertheless, in light of the growing (naeem)importance of tracing and identifying the perpetrators, some critical legislative changes were implemented to grant digital evidence the status of primary evidence. The Electronic Transactions Ordinance (ETO) was implemented in 2002 to capitalize on the advantages of information technology. This Ordinance has resulted in modifications to other laws, such as the QSO of 1984, that pertain to the admissibility of digital evidence. It has also designated such evidence as primary evidence.

The CCTV footage may also be admitted under the “Silent witness” theory, which stipulates that the video (naeem)itself functions as evidence without the necessity of a sponsoring witness, provided that the footage is authenticated. It provided unbiased and real-time evidence that is frequently more reliable than human testimony, serving as a potent “Silent Witness”. In Black’s Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, at page 1508, ‘Silent Witness Theory’ is mentioned as under: 

“A method of authenticating and admitting evidence (such as a (naeem)photograph), without the need for a witness to verify its authenticity, upon a sufficient showing of the reliability of the process of producing the evidence, including proof that the evidence has not been altered.

The “Silent Witness theory” is a rule of evidence that allows for the admission of photographic video, or other recorded evidence as substantive proof of what it depicts, without the need for an eyewitness to testify that they personally observed (naeem)the events depicted in the recording (United States v. Harris, 55 M.J.433 (C.A.A.F 2001). Over the last 25 years, the “Silent Witness” theory of authentication has developed in almost all jurisdictions to allow photographs to substantively “speak for themselves” after being authenticated by evidence that supports the reliability of the process or system that produced the photographs. The threshold case for automated camera evidence is United States v. Taylor (530 F.2d 639 (5th Cir 1976)). In that case, footage recording a robbery that was taken after bank employees were locked in the bank vault was admitted, despite the fact that no one could testify as to the events shown. 

The digital evidence has now assumed a crucial role in the courts of law while administrating justice. In the recent past such evidence was treated as hearsay and secondary (naeem)evidence in our country, however, as stated above, keeping in view its importance, particularly in tracing and identifying the culprits, required changes were made in the relevant laws in order to give the status of primary evidence to the digital evidence, thus, being primary evidence, it is admissible. The CCTV footages, if pass the two-fold test, as per dictum laid down by this Court in the case of Ahmad Omar Sheikh (supra), then it does not require any corroboration being primary evidence.

Under Order VII Rule 11(a) CPC, a plaint can only be rejected when it does not disclose a cause of action and if the plaint contains essential facts demonstrating a legal injury, it cannot be rejected summarily under Order VII Rule 11 CPC. Even otherwise, a plaint shall be rejected "where it does not disclose a cause of action." This provision functions as a threshold filter to prevent frivolous, vexatious, or legally untenable claims from being subjected to full trial proceedings. A plaint must discloses, clear legal injury, right enforceable by law, and sufficient factual foundation to warrant judicial examination. Where these elements are present, rejection under Order VII Rule 11(a) CPC is unsustainable and impermissible. Conversely, where a plaint is vague, speculative, or based on irrelevant assertions lacking legal basis, rejection is not only permissible but necessary to prevent judicial abuse. The cause of action doctrine under Order VII Rule 11 CPC is a procedural safeguard grounded in both domestic and international jurisprudence. Courts must exercise this power judiciously, ensuring that genuine claims proceed while legally unsustainable suits are filtered at inception. In the present case, the trial Court correctly held that the plaint contained a clear assertion of legal rights and legal injury, thus satisfying the requirement of a cause of action but the revisional court ignored this fundamental principle and wrongly exercised jurisdiction by treating the application as it was a final determination of the case. It is established principle of law that while dealing with the application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, only the contents of plaint must be examined, and not the defence's stance.

Law is well settled that no one can corroborate his own version, hence, Shan Abbas being recovery witness cannot corroborate his own version which he has deposed as eye-witness i.e. ocular account.     

It is trite law that medical evidence is mere supportive/confirmatory type of evidence; it can tell about locale, nature, magnitude of injury and kind of weapon used for causing injury but it cannot tell about identity of assailant who caused injury; therefore, same is also of no help to prosecution in peculiar facts and circumstances of case.                                                

It is trite law that motive is double-edged weapon and can cut both sides equally and also could be equal reason for false implication of accused.

FIR is always considered a cornerstone of the case of prosecution, however, if complainant immediately after the occurrence meets the police official, narrates entire detail of occurrence to him but it is not recorded then and there rather subsequently on written application or oral statement of the same complainant received at some other place, FIR is recorded then neither it can be termed as First Information Report as mentioned in Section: 154 Cr.P.C. in stricto sensu nor any importance can be attached to the same like promptly recorded FIR.

[10/20/25, 3:12:39 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Under section 42 of Land Revenue Act, 1967, no witnesses or respectables are required either to accompany the person reporting acquisition of such an interest to Patwari nor to witness the entering of a mutation in said connection.

The entries in the mutation register by themselves are not conclusive evidence of the facts which they purport to record. Therefore, date of death mentioned in the said mutations entries have no any evidentiary value. 
Although admission of facts are only relevant and are not conclusive proof of the matters made through said admission. However, such admissions become conclusive and are binding on a party making them only if it amounts to a representation on a matter of fact made to the other party, who in consequence of such representation has altered its 
position. When admission is thus acted upon by the party to whom it is made, it operates as estoppel and becomes in a way conclusive, inasmuch as the party making it is not then permitted to show that the admission was wrong.
As per Section 3 of the West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962, limited interest of female holders terminates and in terms of Section 5 of the Act (ibid) on the termination of the limited estates, the property was to be considered as the ownership of the last full owner and should have devolved upon his legal sharai heirs alive at the time of his death and if anyone of such heir had died prior to the termination of the limited estate his heirs would get the share to which their predecessor would have been entitled if alive.
Accordingly, the limited owners were also entitled to their sharai share whether alive or dead.

Prosecution claimed that the recovery made upon the appellant's disclosure conclusively proved his guilt---There were, however, certain deficiencies in the recovery proceedings as well as the claim that the recovered sota was actually linked to the appellant---Foremost amongst those flaws was that the sota was recovered from an open and public place, i.e. an empty plot adjacent to the deceased/complainant's home---Complainant's cross-examination also highlighted that the spot from where the sota was recovered happened to be a public thoroughfare---Established doubtfulness of that recovery undermined the prosecution case---Undeniable fact that the crime weapon, i.e. the sota, was recovered from an open place accessible to all, which made it unsafe to place reliance upon such recovery---Police neither claimed that the recovered weapon, the sota, was covered in the deceased's blood nor was the sota subjected to any chemical or serologist examination for traces of human blood---In the absence of such testing, the weapon recovered by the police did not advance the prosecution case---

S.162 of Land Revenue  Act clearly manifests that ninety days are prescribed in filing of appeal against the order of the Commissioner to the Board of Revenue.

The exercise of constitutional jurisdiction in terms of Article 199 of the “Constitution” is discretionary which can only be invoked in extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. The Petitioners have badly failed to point out any illegality or material irregularity in the impugned order, warranting interference by this Court in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction. This Court while invoking its constitutional jurisdiction always exercises restraint in interfering with the judgment or order passed in exercise of revisional jurisdiction unless some perversity or patent illegality is floating on the surface of record. The constitutional jurisdiction can only be exercised in such an eventuality if the impugned judgment or order suffers with certain legal infirmities or patent illegalities, resulting into failure of justice.

It is settled principle of law that contents of plaint or written statement do not equate evidence rather the same have to be proved by leading strong and cogent evidence in the shape of oral (witness(es) to depose on oath and also face the cross examination of the rival party) as well as documentary evidence. Moreover, evasive denial is no denial rather it has been disapproved, because Rules 3, 4 and 5 of Order VIII, Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 require specific denial of each allegation of fact.

More than sufficient opportunities have been granted to the petitioner for producing his evidence and despite putting him under warning he did not bother to avail the same. Such like indolent person(s) cannot be allowed to play with the process of the Court and linger on the matter on one pretext or the other, that too, without any plausible and valid reason. It is evident from record that through speaking order(s) the petitioner was granted with absolute last and final opportunities for production of his evidence with clear cut warnings, the petitioner did not pay any heed to the orders and direction of the trial Court, which shows his adamant attitude towards the orders of the trial Court.  The above picture of affairs makes it crystal clear that how the petitioner pursued his case and showed his disobedience and indifferent demeanour towards the orders of the Court; thus, such like indolent person cannot seek favour of law, because law favours the vigilant and not the indolent.

Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, J.--Through the instant petition, the petitioners assail judgment dated 04.12.2023 passed by the Peshawar High Court, whereby writ petition No. 4688-P of 2018 with CM No. 2331-P of 2018 filed by Respondent No. 1, Mst. Raheela, against the concurrent judgments and decrees dated 14.10.2017 and 11.06.2018 passed by the Judge, Family Court and the appellate Court, respectively, was allowed by setting aside the said judgments and decrees and decreeing the suit filed by Respondent No. 1. Vide said judgment and decree dated 11.06.2018, the learned appellate Court had dismissed Respondent No. 1’s appeal against the learned Family Court’s judgment and decree dated 14.10.2017.

2.       On 03.01.2015, Respondent No. 1 instituted a suit for recovery of dower against Petitioner No. 1 before the Family Court at Nowshera. Since Respondent No. 1’s husband had passed away, she had filed the suit against her father-in-law/Petitioner No. 1. Vide judgment and decree dated 14.10.2017, the said suit was dismissed. Respondent No. 1’s appeal against the said judgment and decree was dismissed by the appellate Court vide judgment and decree dated 11.06.2018. The said concurrent judgments and decrees were assailed by Respondent No. 1 in writ petition No. 4688-P/2018 before the Peshawar High Court. After a thorough re-evaluation of the evidence on the record, the High Court allowed the writ petition. The High Court not just set-aside the said judgments and decrees, but proceeded further by decreeing Respondent No. 1’s suit.

3.       Respondent No. 1, in her suit had sought recovery of dower i.e., a house built on 05 marlas of land and a separate 10 marla plot not on the basis of entries in the nikah nama but on the strength of a gift deed/tamleeq nama executed on 26.09.2017 by her father-in-law/Petitioner No. 1 in favour of her late husband and another kabeen nama/tamleeq nama executed on the very same day by her late husband in her favour. The Family Court and the appellate Court concurrently held that the execution of the above-mentioned deeds had not been proved. The High Court took the view that the learned Courts below had dealt with the case as though it was a civil a suit, and that in family cases the provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 are not to be applied strictly. The High Court also referred to the testimony of the witnesses which it considered sufficient for proof of the execution of the said deeds. The High Court also referred to the statement made by Petitioner No. 1 that the properties which were the subject matter of the said deeds would be given to Respondent No. 1 if she handed over custody of the children to him.

4.       We are refraining from delving deep into the merits of the dispute between the contesting parties as it is not necessary for deciding the instant petition. However, the vital question that needs to be answered is whether the High Court while issuing a writ of certiorari under Article 199(1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution with respect to the concurrent judgments of the trial Court/Family Court and the appellate Court dismissing a suit for recovery of dower, decree the suit.

5.       In the case at hand, the High Court had identified the evidence that had not been read by the learned Courts below while dismissing Respondent No. 1’s suit. This may well have been reason enough for interference with the concurrent findings of the learned Courts below but having done this, the High Court could not have substituted its own findings for those of the learned Courts below by decreeing Respondent No. 1’s suit. The High Court in exercise of its Constitutional jurisdiction cannot arrogate to itself the powers of a family Court and issue decrees.

6.       There is a catena of case law in support of the proposition that the High Court in exercise of Constitutional jurisdiction cannot substitute its own views on the merits of the case with those of the Courts/Tribunals below. Interference by the High Court can be made when the findings of the Courts/Tribunals below are based on insufficient evidence, misreading of evidence, non-consideration of material evidence, erroneous assumption of facts and patent errors of law. Where however, interference with the findings of fact of the Courts/Tribunals below is considered imperative, the High Court ought not to substitute its own views with those of the Courts/Tribunals below. In such instances, the proper course for the High Court is to remand the matter to the Courts/Tribunals below for corrective measures to be taken.

7.       Where the High Court is of the view that the conditions for interference with concurrent findings of fact of the Courts/ Tribunals below are satisfied in any particular case, the proper course is to remand the case to the Courts/Tribunals below for recording fresh findings after considering the material or the law, which had earlier been omitted from consideration. We take this view on the strength of the law laid down in the following cases:-

(i)       In the case of Azmat Ali vs. The Chief Settlement and Rehabilitation Commissioner (PLD 1964 SC 260), it was held as follows:

          “In a proceeding of this extraordinary nature where a superior Court calls for the records of judicial or quasi-judicial authorities or Tribunals, which are not subject to its appellate jurisdiction, the superior Court no doubt has the full power to do justice but does not as a rule, even in a case where it does interfere, substitute its own decision for the decision of the inferior authority or Tribunal. Where it is felt that questions have been left undecided by such Tribunal or authority or a question has to be decided after the taking of fresh evidence, it is more appropriate to return the case to the authority or Tribunal concerned for a decision in accordance with law, after quashing the order complained against.”

(ii)      In the case of Nawaza vs. The Additional Settlement and Rehabilitation Commissioner (PLD 1970 SC 39), this Court held that the High Court, in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction, does not act as a Court of facts and ought not to enter into and decide disputed questions of fact, although it can interfere with a finding of fact given by a subordinate Court or a Tribunal or other authority if the finding is based on no evidence or is based on a complete misreading of the evidence. Furthermore, it was held that the High Court, in writ jurisdiction, cannot decide disputed questions of fact and that a finding of fact if based on no evidence or misreading of evidence can be interfered with but nevertheless proper course is to remand case back to lower Tribunal for decision.

(iii)     In the case of Shabbir Hussain vs. Muhammad Afzal (1972 SCMR 47), it was held as follows:

          “Court exercising [writ] jurisdiction does not sit as a Court of Appeal but merely as a Court for correcting a grave illegality. Where an inferior authority has acted contrary to law or to rules of natural justice, the practice is to set aside the order of the inferior authority and send the case back for proper decision by that authority, particularly, where that authority has, as in this case, exclusive jurisdiction in the matter. This was pointed out in the cases of Syed Azmat Ali v. Chief Settlement and Rehabilitation Commissioner (PLD 1964 SC 260), Begum B. H. Syed v. Mst. Afzal Jahan Begum (PLD 1970 SC 29) and Sh. Khursheed Muhammad v. Settlement and Rehabilitation Commissioner (PLD 1971 SC 498).

          We see no reason to depart from the principle laid down in the above-mentioned decisions and are in agreement with the learned counsel that the High Court had exceeded its jurisdiction under Article 98 of the Constitution in reversing a finding of fact arrived at by the Settlement Authorities as if it was a Court of Appeal.”

(iv)     In the case of Muhammad Younus Khan vs. Government of N.-W.F.P. (1993 SCMR 619), it was held as follows:

          “Where the case has been considered by various authorities, their decision on fact can be disturbed in exercise of writ jurisdiction if it is against the material on record or without any basis. Even in such cases the High Court refrains from substituting its own finding of fact and proper course is to remand the case to lower Tribunal for proper determination of the controversy.”

8.       In view of the above, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned judgment to the extent whereby the concurrent judgments and decrees passed by the Family Court and the appellate Court have been set-aside. However, as regards the decision of the High Court to decree Respondent No. 1’s suit, the same being beyond the jurisdiction of the High Court, is liable to be set-aside. Consequently, leave to appeal is granted only to the extent of the High Court’s decision to decree the suit; the petition is converted into an appeal to the said extent only and allowed; and the matter is remanded to the Family Court for a decision afresh on the basis of the material on the record and the observations made by the High Court in the impugned judgment.

Order

Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, J.--The instant petition was filed against the judgment dated 19.04.2021 passed by the Lahore High Court in Writ Petition No. 62232/2020 dismissing the petitioner’s challenge to judgment and decree dated 04.11.2020 passed by the appellate Court, whereby Respondents No. 3 and 4’s appeal against the order and decree dated 14.05.2019 passed by the family Court, was allowed by enhancing the maintenance for each of the said respondents from Rs. 30,000/-to Rs. 150,000/-per month along with educational expenses.

2.       On 14.11.2017, the petitioner’s daughters, Zeina Naseer Butt (Respondent No. 3) and Imaan Naseer Butt (Respondent No. 4) had instituted a suit against the petitioner for the recovery of maintenance. Earlier the said suit had been decreed ex-parte on 15.02.2018. On the petitioner’s application, the ex-parte decree was set aside vide order dated 08.06.2018 with the direction to the petitioner to pay as interim maintenance Rs. 30,000/-per month to each of his daughters. Failure on the petitioner’s part to pay interim maintenance caused the family Court to invoke its powers under Section 17-A of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 and consequently, the suit was decreed on 14.05.2019.

3.       The instant petition was filed on 06.06.2021. After remaining pending for more than three and a half years, this Court vide order dated 15.03.2025 referred the dispute between the parties to mediation by Ms. Sara Tarrar, who is an advocate of the High Court and an Accredited Mediator duly notified by the Law and Justice Division under the provisions of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2017. The contesting parties participated in the process of mediation and were able to arrive at a settlement. The Mediator, along with her report dated 05.05.2025 filed a copy of the settlement agreement, which has been taken on record. The learned counsel for the contesting parties request for a decree to be pronounced in terms of the said settlement agreement.

4.       The purpose of detailing hereinabove the litigation history between the parties is to underscore that the dispute between the father/petitioner and daughters/Respondents No. 3 and 4 has traversed various judicial tiers and has extensively consumed judicial time and resources. The swift conclusion of mediation achieved within approximately five weeks starkly contrasts with the prolonged adversarial litigation spanning over more than seven years (from the date of the institution of the suit to the date of reference to mediation).

5.       Mediation is not merely an alternative to litigation; it is a paradigm shift in dispute resolution, built on the principles of collaboration, confidentiality, and party autonomy. It offers a non-adversarial framework that empowers parties to shape the outcome of their own disputes, guided by a neutral facilitator rather than a judicial determination.

6.       The benefits of mediation are manifold. It reduces the costs associated with protracted legal battles, alleviates the burden on Courts, and ensures quicker resolution of disputes. The confidential nature of mediation protects the privacy of the parties, and its informal setting encourages honest communication and problem-solving. Moreover, the flexibility of the process allows parties to explore creative, interest-based solutions that a Court of law may not be empowered to grant. These benefits were remarkably evident in the present case. What years of litigation could not resolve, mediation achieved within weeks. This reinforces the principle that the earlier a dispute is channeled through mediation, the greater the potential for cost and time savings, reduced emotional strain, and restored relationships.

7.       Courts must embrace a pro-mediation ethos, particularly at the initial stages of litigation. Judges and lawyers must be sensitized to identify cases fit for mediation and facilitate their referral in a timely manner. Litigants, likewise, should be encouraged to consider mediation and other methods of alternative dispute resolution as a first resort, rather than a last recourse.

8.       The statutory recognition and legislative frameworks provided by the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2017, and subsequent provincial legislations underline mediation’s established legal validity. Recent judicial directions and rules, such as the ADR Mediation Accreditation (Eligibility) Rules, 2023 and Mediation Practice Direction (Civil) Rules, 2023, further consolidate mediation as a mainstream dispute resolution tool within Pakistan’s judicial ecosystem.

9.       The case at hand underscores the efficacy and benefits of mediation, particularly in familial contexts where adversarial litigation often exacerbates emotional distress, imposes significant financial burdens, and strains familial ties. Had mediation been pursued earlier, the extended litigation and accompanying costs, both monetary and emotional, could have been substantially mitigated or altogether avoided in the present case.

10.     This Court expresses its profound appreciation to Ms. Sara Tarrar for her expert mediation, patience and diligence in facilitating dialogue and fostering an atmosphere of mutual respect and cooperation, culminating in a satisfactory resolution acceptable to the contesting parties. Her contributions have vividly demonstrated mediation’s potential to provide a timely, efficient and humane avenue for resolving disputes.


10-A.  For the purposes of this order, it is not necessary to restate the terms of the settlement between the parties. A decree in terms of the settlement agreement dated 05.05.2025 shall be drawn up by the family Court at the earliest. Office shall transmit a copy of this order along with the settlement agreement for drawing up a decree. This petition stands disposed of in terms of the settlement agreement.

Order

Shakeel Ahmad, J.--This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and decree dated 17.10.2018 passed in Civil Revision No. 2220 of 2016 by the Lahore High Court, Lahore (“the High Court”), whereby and whereunder the concurrent judgments and decrees of the Courts below were set aside. While dismissing the suit of the appellant, he was held entitled to get back the amount of Rs. 700,000/-deposited by him in pursuance of the interim order of the trial Court dated 07.07.2011.

2.       The controversy in the present appeal arose from a suit for specific performance of an agreement dated 17.02.2009. As per the contents of the plaint, the respondents (hereinafter referred to as the “vendors”) had agreed to sell a shop (detail whereof was given in the headnote of the plaint) to the appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “vendee”) for a total sale consideration of Rs. 800,000/-. It was agreed that the vendee would pay the whole sale consideration till 31.10.2010, whereafter, the sale deed would be executed in his favour. Failing this, the vendee, who was already in possession of the suit shop as a tenant, would deliver back its possession to the vendors. The vendee claimed that he paid Rs. 200,000/-in two instalments, but the vendors delayed the matter, and eventually refused to execute the sale deed. The suit was decreed by the trial Court on 26.11.2013, subject to deposit of Rs. 800,000/ along with 8% annual interest from 31.10.2010. Dis-satisfied with the same, the respondents went in appeal, which was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 16.03.2016. Not contented with the judgments and decrees of the two Courts below, the respondents filed a Civil Revision Petition before the High Court, which was allowed vide impugned judgment dated 17.10.2018, thereby the judgments and decrees of the two Courts below were set aside and the suit of the appellant was dismissed. However, he was held entitled to get back the amount of Rs. 700,000/-deposited by him in pursuance of the interim order of the trial Court dated 07.07.2011. Hence, this appeal.

3.       Heard both sides and record gone through.

4.       On perusal of the record, we are of the view that the instant matter pivots on two fundamental questions: (i) whether the vendee misrepresented material facts in the plaint, and (ii) whether time was the essence of the contract. These questions can be properly appreciated in light of the agreement dated 17.02.2009, the pleadings of the vendee, particularly in Para No. 2 of the plaint, and the statement made by him as PW-1.

5.       It is an admitted fact that vide the agreement to sell executed on 17.02.2009, the vendors had agreed to sell the suit shop on the terms and conditions mentioned therein. In Para. No. 2 of the plaint, the vendee pleaded as under:

"یہ کہ دوکان مذکور پر پر من مدعی بطور کرایہ دار قابض ہے۔ جو کہ مدعی باقاعدگی سے کرایہ ادا کرتا چلا آرہا ہے۔ میعاد مقررہ سے 8 یوم قبل من مدعی همراه گواہان مدعا علیہم کے پاس گیا اور ان کو کہا کہ وہ فرد اراضی پٹواری حلقہ سے لا کر بقایا رقم مبلغ 8 لاکھ روپیہ وصول کر کے دوکان متدعویہ کی رجسٹری بحق مدعى تحرير و تکمیل کروادیوں کیونکہ وہ 1 لاکھ روپے پہلے وصول کر چکے تھے مگر مدعا علیہم کی نیت میں فرق آچکا ہے۔ کیونکہ جائیداد متدعویہ کی قیمت بڑھ چکی ہے۔ جنہوں نے بہانہ سازی شروع کردی کبھی کہتے کہ ان کی والدہ ملتان گئی ہوئی ہے اسکی آمد پر رجسٹری کردینگے پھر کہا کہ کچھ رقم دی جاوے تاکہ پٹواری حلقہ سے فرد اراضی لا سکیں چنانچہ مدعی نے مزید 1 لاکھ روپیہ ادا کردیا۔"

The plain reading of the above discloses that the vendee initially paid Rs. 100,000/-to the vendors and then, on their demand to get a copy of fard of the shop in dispute, he further paid Rs. 100,000/-to them. Thus, according to the plaint, Rs. 200,000/-were paid. Contrary to that, when he appeared in the witness box as PW-1, he stated as under:

"میں تاریخ مقررہ سے آٹھ روز قبل مدعا علیہم کے پاس ہمراہ حاجی عنایت مہر محمد یاسین حاجی محمد اکرام، نیاز احمد کپڑے والا ان کی دوکان پر گئے۔ میں نے مدعا علیہم سے کہا کہ پیسے لے لو اور دوکان واپس کردو۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ ہماری والدہ ملتان گئی ہوئی ہے جب وہ آئی گی پھر ہم آپ کو رجسٹری کردیں گے انہوں نے کہا کہ ایک لاکھ روپے دے دو کہ ہم نے فرد لانی ہے۔ پھر میں مدعا علیہم کے پاس بار بار جاتا رہا۔ مدعا علیہم ٹال مٹول کرتے رہے پھر میں بازار کے معززین کو ساتھ لے کر گیا پھر میں نے مدعا علیہم کو نوٹس دیا۔"

6.       A comparison of the pleadings and the testimony of the vendee reveals that the amount in question was not paid to the vendors as earnest money. Even the agreement to sell (Ex.P1) is completely silent about any such payment. During cross-examination, it was admitted by the vendee that no earnest money was paid to the vendors, which clearly demonstrates that he had misstated in the plaint about the factum of payment of earnest money. At this juncture, it is relevant to reiterate the settled equitable maxim that “he who comes into equity must come with clean hands”. In this regard, the Court, while applying the aforementioned principle laid down in Justice Khurshid’s case,[1] categorically held that relief cannot be extended to a party who approaches the Court with unclean hands or seeks to secure an unethical or un-merited advantage. The High Court, therefore, correctly observed that the vendee had not come to the Court with clean hands and thus is not entitled to discretionary relief.

7.       It is also a matter of record that the agreement to sell specifically fixed 31.10.2010 as the final date for the completion of the transaction. It further provided that in case of default by the vendee, the agreement would stand cancelled. Admittedly, the agreement was executed on 17.02.2009, giving the vendee over twenty months to complete the said transaction by making payment of the entire sale consideration by 31.10.2010. The vendee’s failure to perform his obligations within the stipulated time raises the question whether the vendors can validly raise the defence that, since time was the essence of the contract, the Court cannot decree specific performance in favour of the vendee who failed to fulfil his part of the contract within the agreed timeframe.

8.       It is observed that in cases relating to specific performance, equity, which governs the rights of the parties, does not rigidly adhere to the express terms of the contract. Instead, the Court examines the substance of the agreement to ascertain whether the parties intended that performance be completed within a specific time period and whether the parties in substance intended that the completion should take place within a reasonable time.

9.       In the present case, prior to the execution of the agreement, its terms were admittedly discussed and read over to both parties. The vendee willingly undertook the burden of obtaining clearance within the time stipulated in the agreement. A bare perusal of the terms of the agreement, which have been discussed earlier in this order, clearly reveals that time was the essence of the contract, and this was understood by both parties, particularly, in view of the fact that the consequences of non-performance of the contractual terms by the vendee were also explicitly set out in the said agreement. Thus, such default on the part of the vendee was fatal to his suit. In this context, reliance can be placed on Fazal-Ur-Rehman’s case,[2] wherein this Court held that:

“Learned counsel for the appellant while arguing to establish that the time was not the essence of the contract relied upon reported judgments in which general principles have laid down that unless it was shown in each case that the time was intended to be the essence of the contract, normally time would not be considered as essence in respect of sale of immovable property, keeping in view the nature of the property and the time. There is no cavil with the correctness of this general proposition of law but we have already observed that it was provided expressly in the agreement in question that payment of the total amount of consideration would be made before 9-6-1991 and in each month an amount of Rs. 2 lacs had to be paid before 9-6-1991. It was also settled in the agreement itself by both parties that time was intended to be the essence of the contract, and in case of default in the payment of any of the instalment, the earnest money already paid would stand forfeited. In view of these express terms neither it could be argued on behalf of the


appellant nor contended that the time was not intended to be the essence of the contract and Court should have decided the case on the general principle that in case of contract of sale of immovable property the time should not be assumed to be essence of the contract”

(Underlining is for emphasis)

10.     The present case obviously relates to a contract in commercial transaction and the Court can take judicial notice of the fact that the price of real estate is constantly escalating. The clear intention of the parties, as it appears from the stipulation of the agreement, was to treat time as essence of the contract. Exercise of jurisdiction, under these circumstances in favour of the vendee when character of the property or other circumstances would render such exercise likely to result in injustice, would be against the settled norms of justice.

11.     Having regard to the aforesaid principles, the Court cannot attribute a different intention to the parties and cannot specifically enforce the contract at the instance of the vendee, who has failed to perform his part of the obligation within the stipulated time.[3] Both the Courts below failed to consider the above legal and factual aspects of the case, thus arrived at a wrong conclusion, decreeing the suit of the appellant, but the High Court rightly took notice of the same while setting aside the judgments and decrees of the Courts below.

12.     For the reasons aforementioned, we find no merit in this appeal; the same is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.

Judgment

Ahmad Nadeem Arshad, J.--Through this application, the applicants seek review of judgment and decree dated 27.10.2014 pursuant whereto Regular Second Appeal (R.S.A. No. 59 of 1989) filed by the respondents was allowed by the learned Single Judge in Chambers.

2.       Facts in brevity are that predecessor of the applicants namely Mst. Bakhan instituted a suit for declaration on 09.12.1979 against the respondents and sought declaration to the effect that Mst. Rajan and Mst. Siani being widows of Kalu were limited owners of 100 Kanals land, originally belonged to Kalu, therefore, alienation by Mst. Rajan through registered sale deed dated 05.03.1951 followed by Mutation No. 271 dated 05.06.1951 in favour of Defendants No. 17 to 19 is against facts and law as being limited owner said lady had no power to alienate the suit property and also sought declaration that being daughter of Kalu she is entitled to inherit her Shari share measuring 33 Kanals 07 Marlas (1/3 share from his legacy) and also prayed for recovery of its possession. Said suit was dismissed by the learned Trial Court after full-fledged trial vide judgment and decree dated 30.11.1986. Feeling aggrieved, predecessor of the applicants preferred an appeal which was allowed by the learned lower Appellate Court vide judgment and decree dated 04.05.1989 and consequently her suit was decreed. Being dissatisfied, the respondents filed Regular Second Appeal (R.S.A. No. 59 of 1989) before this Court which was allowed by learned Single Judge in Chambers through the judgment and decree dated 27.10.2014 (under review) and suit was accordingly dismissed by observing that the plaintiff did not fulfill the condition imposed by the Court as her previous suit was dismissed as withdrawn with permission to institute fresh suit subject to payment of cost Rs. 5/-, therefore, the suit was bad from the very inception and the decree granted by the learned lower Appellate Court is result of illegality.

3.       We have heard learned counsel for the parties at full length and gone through the record minutely with their able assistance.

4.       After hearing learned counsel for the parties and going through the record, it has been observed that learned Single Judge in Chambers has decided the appeal on a legal point that the applicants instituted the suit on 09.12.1979 without fulfilling the condition attached with the permission to file fresh suit vide order dated 18.07.1978 as the amount of Rs. 5/- fixed by the learned Trial Court was never paid. For facility of reference, relevant paragraphs of the judgment under review are reproduced as under:

“2.      The learned trial Court on 30.11.1986 proceeded to dismiss the suit of the plaintiffs holding that the mutations relating to the years 1948 to 1951 were challenged by means of a suit filed in 1979. The appeal filed by the plaintiffs was allowed and suit was decreed by the learned Additional District Judge on 04.05.1989.

3.       Apart from the other points on factual side, it has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellants that since the suit subsequently filed on 09.12.1979 was filed without fulfilling the condition attached with the permission to file fresh suit to the plaintiffs vide order dated 18.07.1978 as the amount of Rs. 5/- as was fixed by the learned trial Court granting permission to file fresh suit after withdrawal of the earlier one was not complied with.

4.       The learned counsel for the respondents/plaintiffs once again after going through the record carefully has affirmed the position that at the time of filing of fresh suit, the condition attached with such filing was not fulfilled.

5.       Therefore, the filing of the subsequent suit was not a lawful act. The learned Courts below have conveniently ignored this aspect touching the roots of the matter and proceeded with the trial of the suit and hearing of the appeal in a suit which was not competently filed, thus, it was nothing but a futile exercise on the part of the learned Courts below.

6.       Since, the suit filed on 09.12.1979, was defective and not proceedable from the time of its inception, therefore, there would be no need to enter into the factual controversy raised in the suit.

          The judgment and decree, therefore, passed by the learned first appellate Court on 04.05.1989 is not sustainable.

7.       I am also conscious of the fact that I am hearing Regular Second Appeal and in view of the provisions of Section 100 of, C.P.C. in second appeal only question of law are to be adjudicated upon. On the touchstone of provisions of Order XXIII, C.P.C. the subsequently filed suit without fulfilling the condition attached with the earlier withdrawal order, when the plaintiffs were allowed to file a fresh suit, were not fulfilled and the suit as noted herein above was bad at its very inception, the decree granted by the learned first appellate Court is a result of illegality.

8.       Result is that this appeal is allowed and the judgment and decree dated 04.05.1989 passed by the learned first appellate Court is set aside and the dismissal of the suit as was announced by means of judgment and decree by the learned trial Court on 30.11.1986 is restored.”

5.       In order to reach a just conclusion and to dig out the truth, we have requisitioned the record of Courts below. Although, the record was burnt but the same was subsequently reconstructed which is available before us. Bare reading of the plaint transpires that predecessor of the applicants instituted the suit on 09.12.1979 wherein she referred about withdrawal of her earlier suit in the following manner:

"یہ کہ مدعیہ نے رقبہ متد عویہ کے متعلق ایک دعوی بعنوان مسماۃ بکھاں بنام را جن وغیرہ مورخہ 12.10.79 کو دائر کیا تھا جو بعد الت جناب چوہدری محمد اسلم صاحب زیر تجویز تھا۔ دعوی مذکورہ مدعیہ مورخہ 7.11.79 کو عدالت مذکورہ سے بروئے دائری جدید دعوئے بر بنائے سابقہ بنائے دعوئے واپس لے لیا تھا اور اب جدید دعوئے دائر کیا ہے۔"

6.       It is obvious that predecessor of the applicants unambiguously mentioned that earlier suit was withdrawn on 07.11.1979 without mentioning about imposition of any condition qua payment of cost to file subsequent suit.

7.       It is both surprising and significant to note that in the present suit, reference was clearly made to the withdrawal of an earlier suit on 07.11.1979. However, in the judgment under review, the learned Single Judge in Chambers mistakenly relied upon a different withdrawal order dated 18.07.1978 (available on record as Exh.D.2). The learned Judge dismissed the applicants’ suit on the ground that they had not fulfilled the condition imposed in order dated 18.07.1978 i.e. the payment of Rs. 5/- as cost before filing a fresh suit. This finding was made without examining the fact that the order dated 18.07.1978 did not relate to the same earlier suit referenced in the present proceedings. In fact, order dated 18.07.1978 (Exh.D.2) pertains to an entirely separate suit concerning Mutation No. 225 dated 03.06.1978, filed by the applicants’ predecessor against Mst. Rajan and Mst. Siani widows of Kalu. For reference, said order dated 18.07.1978 (Exh.D.2) is reproduced as under:

"دعویٰ استقرار حق بدیں مضمون کہ انتقال نمبر 225 مورخہ 3.6.78 سازش، خلاف قانون اور خلاف انصاف کا لعدم ہونے کی بناء پر حقوق مدعیہ پر غیر موثر ہے۔"

"18.7.78 دعویٰ ہذا انتقال ہو کر امروز وصول شد -درج رجسٹر ہوئے۔ کونسل مدعی حاضر بیان کرتے ہیں کہ وہ دعویٰ ہذا واپس لینا چاہتے ہیں اس لیے دعوی ہذا واپس ہوئے۔ بر استدعا کو نسل مدعی نیاد عویٰ دائر کرنے کی اجازت بشرط ادائیگی مبلغ/5 روپے دی جاتی ہے۔ مثل داخل دفتر ہو۔"

8.       However, the predecessor of the applicants instituted a suit for declaration titled “Mst. Bakhan v. Mst. Rajan, etc.” Suit No. 264, which was instituted on 14.10.1978 and subsequently dismissed as withdrawn on her application under order XXIII Rule 1, C.P.C. on 07.11.1979 (Exh.D.3) with permission to file fresh suit unconditionally in the following terms:

"کو نسل فریقین حاضر۔ بحث سماعت شد۔

حکم : دعویٰ استقرار یہ ہذا میں مدعیہ نے زیر آرڈر نمبر 23 رول 1 ض۔ د درخواست گزاری کہ عرضی دعویٰ میں مکمل تفصیل اراضی متد عو یہ درج نہ ہو سکی ہے اور بطور دادرسی مستلزمہ دخل یابی کی استدعا بھی نہ کی جاسکی ہے۔ اور یہ ایسے بنیادی فنی نقائص ہیں جنکا مابین فریقین قطعی انفصال مقدمہ کیلئے دور کیا جانا ضروری ہے۔ لہذا مدعیہ کو ان فنی و تکنیکی نقائص کی وجہ سے دعوی ہذا واپس لینے اور انہیں موجبات پر جدید دعویٰ دائر کرنے کی اجازت دی جاوے۔

ii۔    فاضل کو نسل مدعا علیہم نے درخواست ہذا کی مخالفت کرتے ہوئے استدعا کی ہے کہ مذکورہ بالا نقائص "formal defects“ کے زمرہ میں نہ آتے ہیں۔ لہذا مدعیہ کو انہیں وجوہات پر جدید دعویٰ دائر کرنے کی اجازت نہ دی جاوے۔

اسطرح تفصیل اراضی متدعویہ بھی دیا جانا ضروری ہے۔ اندریں حالات یہ دونوں نقائص ایسے ہیں جو formal defect کے زمرے میں آتے ہیں۔ لہذا مدعیہ کو با اجازت نالش جدید واپس لینے کی اجازت دی جاتی ہے۔ دعویٰ  خارج ہوئے۔ خرچہ بذمہ فریقین۔ مسل بعد تکمیل و ترتیب عدالت اپیل کو مرسل ہووے۔ سنایا گیا۔"

9.       Perusal of Exh.D.2 (order dated 18.07.1978) it reflects that predecessor of the applicants namely Mst. Bakhan instituted her suit against Mst. Rajan and Mst. Siani whereby she challenged the inheritance Mutation No. 225 dated 03.06.1978 (actual date is 03.06.1948), through which property of Kalu was devolved to his widows under custom as limited owners. Whereas, in her second suit, she impugned the sale deed dated 05.03.1951 and Mutation No. 271 dated 05.06.1951 sanctioned on the strength of said registered sale deed whereby Mst. Rajan sold her share to Wariam Khan s/o Pathana on the ground that Mst. Rajan widow of Kalu had no authority to sale the property devolved upon her as a limited owner. Subject matter of second suit and third suit are almost same, whereas, subject matter of first suit is quite different. This is the reason that predecessor of the applicants in her second and third suit impleaded legal heirs of Wariam as a party.

10.     The permission to bring a fresh suit after the withdrawal of the first suit may fall under different categories such as; i) unconditional withdrawal with liberty to bring fresh suit;
ii) conditional withdrawal with the liberty to file fresh suit subject to payment of cost before institution of fresh suit; iii) conditional withdrawal with liberty to file fresh suit subject to payment of cost on a date specified in the order; and iv) conditional withdrawal with liberty to file fresh suit subject to payment of cost without specifying the time of the payment.

11.     Order XXIII Rule 01, C.P.C. provides procedure for withdrawal of the suit which reads as under:

“Withdrawal of suit or abandonment of part of claim. (1) At any time after the institution of a suit the plaintiff may, as against all or any of the defendants, withdraw his suit or abandon part of his claim.

          (2)      Where the Court is satisfied--

(a)      that a suit must fail by reason of some formal defect, or

(b)      that there are other sufficient grounds for allowing the plaintiff to institute a fresh suit for the subject-matter of a suit or part of a claim. It may, on such terms as it thinks fit, grant the plaintiff permission to withdraw from such suit or abandon such part of a claim with liberty to institute a fresh suit in respect of the subject-matter of such suit or such part of a claim.

          (3)      Where the plaintiff withdraws from a suit, or abandons part of a claim, without the permission referred to in sub-rule (2), he shall be liable for such costs as a Court may award and shall be precluded from instituting any fresh suit in respect of such subjectmatter or such part of the claim.

          (4)      Nothing in this rule shall be deemed to authorise the Court to permit one of several plaintiffs to withdraw without the consent of the others.”

12.     Perusal of the Rule ibid, it appears that under Sub-Rule (1) the plaintiff may withdraw a suit at any stage of the proceedings and without an order of the Court. However, under Sub-Rule (2) he has to obtain the permission of the Court for withdrawal and the Court’s own power to permit withdrawal is limited to the instances specifically narrated in clauses (a) and (b). The result of a withdrawal without permission under Sub-Rule (1) is that the plaintiff by Sub-Rule (3) is precluded from instituting a fresh suit, no such consequence is stated in Sub-Rule (2) as following from the withdrawal of the suit and not complying with the conditions on which the permission to withdraw was given.

13.     It is incorrect to apply Sub-Rule (1) to cases where cost was imposed and to invoke the consequence stated in Sub-Rule (3) by holding that where a plaintiff to whom a permission to institute a fresh suit was given does not comply with the condition on which he obtained the permission, he must be deemed to have withdrawn his suit under Sub-Rule (1). Since the conditions on which the permission to institute a first suit was given has not been complied with the original suit must be deemed to be pending is also not correct view. The withdrawal is complete the moment and order to that effect is accorded and the right to bring a fresh suit follows from the withdrawal so permitted.

14.     Sub-Rule (2) expressly states that in granting the permission the Court may impose “such terms as it thinks fit”. If such terms have been imposed by the Court, then the right to bring a fresh suit is curtailed because the fresh suit can be brought only if the conditions imposed by the Court are fulfilled. Now the question arises what would be the consequence if any of the terms on which permission to withdraw with liberty to institute a fresh suit was given is not fulfilled. The answer can only be that unless the condition is complied with there is no proper suit before the Court. In such a case, the defendant is entitled and the Court has the power to demand that if the plaintiff wishes to proceed with the suit he must comply with the terms on which permission to withdraw was given. Unless the plaintiff satisfy the Court that the terms on which he had received the permission have been satisfied, there is no proper plaint before the Court, with the result that no proceedings on the plaint can be taken. However, the order of dismissal of the suit can, therefore, be passed only after it is found that the plaintiff, on an objection taken, is not willing to comply with the terms on which he was permitted to withdraw the suit with liberty to institute a fresh suit. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled “Haji Abdul Rasheed Sodagar v. S.M. Lalita Roy and others” (PLD 1959 SC (Pak.) 287), while considering the consequence of non-fulfillment of term in order permitting withdrawal with liberty to institute fresh suit observed as under:

“The question then is what would be the consequence if any of the leans on which permission to withdraw with liberty to institute a fresh suit was given is not fulfilled. The answer can only be that unless the condition is complied with there is no proper suit before the Court. In such a case the defendant is entitled and the Court has the power to demand that if the plaintiff wishes to proceed with the suit he must comply with the terms on which permission to withdraw was given. And leaving the question of limitation aside, the plaintiff may at any time comply with the terms and on proof that he has so complied may demand the Court to proceed with the suit: To put it in a different way, unless the plaintiff satisfies the Court that the terms on which he had received the permission have been satisfied there is no proper plaint before the Court, with the result that no proceedings on the plaint can be taken. The order of dismissal of the suit can, therefore, be passed only after it is found that the plaintiff, on an objection taken, is not willing to comply with the terms on which he was permitted to withdraw the suit with liberty to institute a fresh suit. Whether the condition has or has not been fulfilled is for the Court to determine in each case and in determining that question it has an inherent power to condone bona fide delays, omissions, etc.

Applying the above principle to the present case it must’ be held that the respondents complied with the condition when on an objection being taken by the appellant they expressed their willingness to deposit the additional costs and in compliance with the Court’s order actually deposited the costs.”

Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled “Malang Dad v. Mst. Mah Rari and others” (PLD 1993 SC 06)”, while discussing the consequence of non-payment of cost observed that in the absence of fulfillment of the said condition the suit is liable to be dismissed being incompetent and observed as under:

“8.      There cannot be any cavil with the proposition that if under Order XXIII, Rule 2, C.P.C. permission to withdraw a pending suit with the right to file a fresh suit, is granted to a plaintiff subject to payment of certain costs, it is a term on which such permission is granted and in the absence of fulfilment of the same, the suit is liable to be dismissed being incompetent as in the absence of payment of costs, there cannot be a proper suit before the Court. The learned Judge in Chambers, therefore, could reverse the concurrent judgments of the two Courts below on the above ground.”

However, while considering the ratio observed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Haji Abdul Rasheed Sodagar (supra) held as under:

“9.      However, we have noticed that while setting aside the concurrent judgments of the two Courts below, the learned Judge in Chambers, has not taken into consideration the question, whether it was a fit case for condonation of the above omission keeping in view the ratio of the judgment of this Court in the case of Haji Abdul Rasheed Sowdagar (supra), wherein this Court has held as follows:

          “To put it in a different way, unless the plaintiff satisfies the Court that the terms on which he had received the permission have been satisfied there is no proper plaint before the Court, with the result that no proceedings on the plaint can be taken. The order of dismissal of the suit can, therefore, be passed only after it is found that the plaintiff, on an objection taken, is not willing to comply with the terms on which he was permitted to withdraw the suit with liberty to institute a fresh suit. Whether the condition has or has not been fulfilled is for the Court to determine in each case and in determining that question it has an inherent power to condone, bona fide delays, omissions, etc.”

And Hon’ble Court allowed payment of cost by observing as under:

“10.    We have considered the question, whether we should allow the payment of the cost by the appellant at this stage. In this regard, it may be pertinent to refer Rule 6 of Order XXXIII of the Pakistan Supreme Court Rules, 1980, which provides that “nothing in these rules shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent powers of the Court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court”.

11.     In our view, it will not be just and proper to deny two concurrent judgments in favour of the appellant on the above technical ground, the High Court should have, in our view, directed the appellant to pay a reasonable amount as costs to the respondents besides the above amount of Rs. 100 for condoning the above lapse on his part.

12.     We are inclined to allow the appellant to pay above cost of Rs. 100 plus a further cost of Rs. 900 for the above omission on his part and to remand the case to the High Court for deciding the Revision Application of the respondents on merits.

13.     Mirza Abdur Rashid, learned counsel for the appellant, pursuant to this judgment, has paid the above sum of Rs. 1,000 to Mr. Khalilur Rehman.”

15.     However, where no time for payment of cost was specified in the order granting permission to withdraw the suit, delay can be condoned and order of dismissal of the suit could be passed only after it was found that the plaintiff on an objection taken was not willing to comply with the terms on which he was permitted to withdraw the suit with liberty to institute a fresh suit. Hon’ble Supreme Court of Paksitan, while referring the above referred two judgments in a case titled “Qamar Zaman and others v. Musammir Shah” (2000 SCMR 1730), held as under:

“7.      Having considered the rival contentions anxiously we have come to the conclusion that the impugned judgment is unexceptionable. It is true that there is no proof of payment of costs either before the institution or during pendency of the second suit but the conduct of the respondent cannot be termed as contumacious or obdurate on this score alone because his stance throughout the proceedings was that he had paid the costs. His standpoint is mentioned in the aforementioned judgment of the Peshawar High Court dated 7.4.1984 in these words that ‘the petitioner insisted that the amount had been paid to the defendants’. It is rather difficult to brush aside the stance of the respondent inasmuch as it does not stand to reason that he had put his suit at stake by not making payment of a meagre amount of Rs. 30. Be that as it may,’ no time for payment of costs was specified in the order granting permission to the respondent to withdraw from the suit, the delay was condoned by the trial Court in exercise of its inherent powers and rightly so because the element of mala fide was missing, the inherent power exercised by the trial Court has been upheld by the Appellate Court as well as the High Court and the costs were admittedly paid by the respondent during pendency of the suit culminating in this petition. It was held in Haji Abdul Rashid Sowdagar v. S.M. Lalita Roy and others (PLD 1959 SC 287) that the order of dismissal of the suit can be passed only after it is found that the plaintiff, on an objection taken, is not willing to comply with the terms on which he was permitted to withdraw the suit with liberty to institute a fresh suit and that whether the condition has or has not been fulfilled is for the Court to determine in each case and in determining that question it has an inherent power to condone bona fide delays, omissions etc.”

16.     Where defendant having neither taken objection with regard to dismissal of the suit for non-payment of cost before the learned Trial Court nor mentioning the same in memorandum of appeal, the plaintiff’s suit cannot be dismissed without giving him an opportunity to establish his stance. This Court in a case titled “Muhammad Boota v. Allah Lok and 2 others” (1984 CLC 3118) observed as under:

“The basic question which floats at the surface is that can the disposal of the appeal and the dismissal of the suit, in the manner as done by the learned Additional District Judge be upheld. My answer is in the negative. In case he deemed it fit to entertain the respondents’ plea that costs were not paid, the ground not having been taken up in the memorandum of appeal, or urged before the trial Court, it was essential for him to have given an opportunity to the petitioner, to establish his stand and dispose of the application, before proceeding with the decision of the appeal. The acceptance of the respondents’ appeal was thus illegal and the impugned judgment, therefore, cannot be upheld.”

17.     This Court in another case titled “Muhammad Riaz and an other v. Muhammad Siddique and another” (2002 CLC 1045) held as under:

“The rule to be followed in respect of the conditional orders is that if the order makes it clear that the condition is to be fulfilled within a certain time failing which certain consequences will ensue, then on the expiry of the time limit the condition will become operative and the consequences would follow. If no time limit is fixed in the conditional order then the needful may be done at any time during the course of the proceedings. In the case of Shidramappa Mutappa Biradar v. Mallappa Ramchandrappa Biradar AIR 1931 Bom. 257, it was held that if the Court had granted permission to withdraw a suit and bring a fresh one only on payment of costs before institution of the second suit, then the plaintiff is precluded from bringing the second suit unless costs are paid. If such a suit is brought without payment of costs, it is void and payment of costs after filing the suit does not save it. In an earlier case reported as Gollapudi Seshayya v. Nadendla Subbayya and another 1924 Mad. 877 it was held that where a suit was allowed to be withdrawn with permission to file a fresh one on payment of costs then the whole trial of the second suit before the costs were paid, would be bad under Section 10 of the, C.P.C. for want of jurisdiction and the whole suit would have to be tried again. However, this view was not followed by our Supreme Court. While deciding the controversy in the case of Haji Abdul Rashid Sowdagar v. S.M. Lalita Roy and others PLD 1959 SC (Pak.) 287, the Honourable Supreme Court was pleased to hold that if any of the terms on which permission to withdraw with liberty to file a fresh suit was given is not fulfilled, the consequence would be that unless the condition is complied with there is no proper suit before the Court. In such a case the defendant is entitled and the Court has the power to demand that if the plaintiff wishes to proceed with the suit he must comply with the terms on which permission to withdraw was given. It was further held that the plaintiff could comply with the terms at any time during the pendency of the suit and demand the Court to proceed with the suit.”

18.     It would not be in the interest of justice to non-suit the plaintiff on mere technicalities of procedure. The Court could direct the plaintiff to pay original cost plus further specified cost for the omission on his part. This Court, in a case titled “Muhammad Siddique and 06 others v. Zafar Iqbal and 9 others” (2005 CLC 33) discussed this principle in the following manner:

“32.    In this case while allowing the plaintiffs to withdraw the suit the Court had imposed cost of Rs. 80 on the plaintiffs which they were bound to deposit the same before or at the time of filing the subsequent/present suit. This legal point was discussed in case of Sajid Gul and others reported as AIR 1947 Pesh. 43 wherein the Court had observed as under:

          “Where the plaintiff has been allowed to withdraw his suit and is permitted to bring a fresh suit on condition of his paying the cost of suit to the defendant before the institution of the fresh suit, the second suit would not be competent if the condition precedent to the institution of such a suit has not been fulfilled.”

33.     As the condition was imposed on the plaintiffs-respondents to file subsequent suit subject to the payment of cost of Rs. 80, the burden to prove such fact was on the plaintiffs whether they have deposited the said cost in the Court at the time, presenting the instant suit and in absence of payment of cost fresh suit is liable to be dismissed being incompetent for in absence of payment of costs which was a condition for filing fresh suit, there could not be a proper suit before the Court and the High Court in such circumstances could reverse the findings of Courts below. Reference in this respect can be made to the case of Malang Dad v. Mst. Mah Pari PLD 1993 SC 6 but it would not be in the interest of justice to non-suit the plaintiffs on mere technicalities of procedure. The Court could direct the plaintiff to pay original cost plus further specified cost for the omission on his part. No such order has been passed by the Court. Had the Court directed the plaintiffs-respondents to deposit the costs imposed to them while allowing to withdraw their previous suit and the plaintiffs-respondents would have been contumacious in obeying the order, then on this sole ground the suit ‘ was liable to be dismissed and if they have tendered the cost subsequently then the plaint would be deemed to have been properly presented and it must be taken to have been filed on the date on which the cost was tendered. In this respect reference can be made to the case of K.P. Kesavalu Naidu v. A.R. Venkatarama Chettiar and others AIR 1942 Mad. 35.”

19.     Epitome of the above discussion and extract of decisions of the apex Courts (discussed supra), is that non-compliance of a condition could result in the following result:-

i.        Where the permission is subject to payment within a time fixed by the Court, a fresh suit cannot be instituted if the costs are not paid within the time fixed. However, this time can be extended in terms of Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

ii.       Where the permission is conditional on payment being made to the defendant prior to the filing of a fresh suit, the second suit will be deemed to have been instituted when such payment is made.

iii.      Where the order is conditional but no time for payment is specific, payment can be affected during pendency of the fresh suit.

iv.      Where conditions have been imposed the Court has inherent power to condone bona fide delay, omissions, etc.

v.       Where payment of costs is not a condition precedent, non-payment will not affect competency of the subsequent suit.

It is clear from the above discussion that suit of the applicants could not be dismissed for non-payment of the costs as the said defect was curable and the delay in payment of cost could be condoned by the Court or the cost could be enhanced as per the discretion of the Court.

20.     However, the proposition involved in this case is altogether different. There was no question of non-payment of the costs as it has been settled supra that the Court while referring to an irrelevant withdrawal order non-suited the applicants. Now the question before this Court is that whether said factual and legal omission permit us to review the order passed by learned Single Judge in Chambers.

21. The petitioners through this review petition applied for the review of the judgment and decree passed by learned Single Judge in Chambers. Section 114 of CPC, 1908 deals with jurisdiction of Courts of civil jurisdiction to review its judgments. Any person considering himself aggrieved from the decree or order from which an appeal allowed, but no appeal has been preferred or where no such appeal is allowed or by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes may apply for review of the judgment of the Court which passed the decree or order. The grounds on which a review be sought are enumerated under Order XLVII Rule 1, CPC, 1908 which are as follows:

“1.    Application for review of judgment.--Any person considering himself aggrieved--

(a)      by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred,

(b)      by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed, or

(c)      by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes, and who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of judgment to the Court which passed the decree or made the order.

(2)      A party who is not appealing from a decree or order may apply for a review of judgment notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal by some other party except where the ground of such appeal is common to the applicant and the appellant, or when, being respondent, he can present to the Appellate Court the case on which he applies for the review.”

22.     Review is creation of the statute. The right to claim review of any decision of the Court of law, is substantive right and not a mere matter of procedure. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its Full Bench Judgment titled “Hussain Bakhsh v. Settlement Commissioner, Rawalpindi and others” (PLD 1970 Supreme Court 1) held as under:

“The right to claim review of any decision of a Court of law, like the right of appeal is a substantive right and not mere matter of procedure. An appeal, as observed by Brandwell, L.J. in the case of Sandback Charity Trustees v. North Staffordshire Railway Co. (1)--“does not exist in the nature of things; a right to appeal from any decision of any Tribunal must be given by express enactment. This is equally true in case of review, because both appeal and review, though they differ in scope, are substantive rights. As such, neither of them is available unless it has been confirmed by law.”

In “Capital Development Authority through Chairman v. Raja Muhammad Zaman Khan and another” (PLD 2007 Supreme Court 121), the august Supreme Court of Pakistan again held that right of review application is a substantive right and is always a creation of the relevant statute on the subject.

23.     It is abundantly clear that power of review can be exercised to correct the errors and the main aim is to prevent injustice being done by a Court to correct error or mistake which is manifestly floating on face of record, which is patent that if it allowed to remain intact, would perpetuate illegality and gross injustice. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case of “Mehmood Hassan Lark and others v. Muslim Commercial Bank Limited and others” (2010 SCMR 1036) and it has been observed as under:

“We are of the view that before an error can be a ground of review, it is necessary, that it must be one which is apparent on the face of the record and that it must be so manifest, so clear, that no Court could permit such an error to remain on record.”

24.     Every Court of law is under obligation to apply the correct law and if it is established that same had not been applied by Court, then, a review application in this regard is maintainable. Similarly, where by some inadvertence an important statutory provision has escaped notice which, if had been noticed, might materially have affected the judgment of the Court. In this regard reference can be made to case law reported as “Lt. Col. Nawabzada Muhammad Amir Khan versus The Controller of Estate Duty, Government of Pakistan, Karachi and Pakistan through the Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Government of Pakistan Rawalpindi” (PLD 1962 Supreme Court 335) wherein it had been observed as under:

“The indulgence by way of review may no doubt be granted to prevent irremediable in injustice being done by a Court of last resort, as where by some inadvertence an important statutory provisions have escaped notice which, if had been noticed, might materially have affected the judgment of the Court, but in no case should be a rehearing be allowed upon merits.”

Reliance is also placed on case law titled “Faqir Muhammad Khan versus Mir Akbar Shah” (PLD 1973 Supreme Court 110).

25.     A full Bench of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment titled “Zulfikar Ali Bhutto v. The State” (PLD 1979 SC 741) while dealing with the words “an error apparent on the face of record” while repelling the contention that exposition of law is incorrect or erroneous, or that Court has wrong in application of law to facts of particular case, or that an erroneous inference have been drawn as a result of reappraisal or appreciation of evidence do not constitute valid ground for review, observed that an order based on an erroneous assumption of material fact or without adverting to a provision of law, or a departure from an undisputed construction of the law and the Constitution may amount to an error apparent on the face of the record, and held as under:

“43.    From what has been said in the preceding paragraphs, it follows that in order that an error may be a ground for review, it is necessary that it must be one which is apparent on the face of the record, that is, it must be so manifest, so clear that no Court could permit such an error to remain on the record. It may be an error of fact or of law, but it must be an error which is self-evident and floating on the surface, and does not require any elaborate discussion or process of ratiocination. The contention that the exposition of the law is incorrect or erroneous, or that the Court has gone wrong in the application of the law to the facts of the particular case ; or that erroneous inferences have been drawn as a result of appraisal or appreciation of evidence, does not constitute a valid ground for review. However, an order based on an erroneous assumption of material fact, or without adverting to a provision of law, or a departure from an undisputed construction of the law and the Constitution may amount to an error apparent on the face of the record. At the same time if the judgment under review, or a finding contained therein, although suffering from an erroneous assumption of facts, is sustainable on other grounds available on the record then although the error may be apparent on the face of the record, it would not justify a review of the judgment or the finding in question. In other words, the error must not only be apparent, but must also have a material bearing on the fate of the case. Errors of inconsequential import do not call for review.”

26.     The misconstruction of law, misreading of evidence and also non-consideration of pleas raised before a Court, would also amount to an error floating on the surface of the record. In this regard reliance can be placed on the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan reported in case titled “Land Acquisition Officer and Assistant Commissioner, Hyderabad versus Gul Muhammad through Legal Heirs” (PLD 2005 SC 311), wherein it was held as under:

“12.    From the above discussion it would appear that the learned Judge in Chambers of the High Court in appeal has misconstrued the provision of sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the said Act and also has misread the evidence on record, therefore enhancement of rate of compensation was made in violation of the principle of law and law laid down by this Court, consequently in review application the learned Judge in Chambers misconstrued the law and also misread the evidence and did not consider pleas raised before him which amounted to error floating on the surface of record, therefore impugned judgment dismissing the review applications cannot be sustained in law consequently the same is reversed so also the order passed in appeal and the appeals before us are also allowed with no order as to costs.”

27.     We are mindful of the fact that scope of review jurisdiction is very limited, however, at the same time it is also a well-entrenched principle of law, as has been time and again reiterated by the apex Court, that a judgment can be reviewed when the error is apparent on the face of the record and that it must be so manifest, so clear, that no Court could permit such an error to remain on record.

28.     In the proceedings before us, the error under scrutiny is not one that emerges upon prolonged deliberation or dependent upon subjective inference; rather, it stares at the face of the record with such certainty and plainness that it leaves no room for doubt or debate. It is of the kind which compels judicial intervention.

29.     In the instant suit, the respondents/defendants while submitting written statement neither mentioned that earlier suit was conditionally withdrawn nor highlighted any shortcoming qua non-payment of cost. Had there been any condition or stipulation qua payment of cost, the respondents/defendants must have highlighted the same.

30.     It is clear that predecessor of the applicants firstly instituted a suit on 10.04.1978 which was withdrawn on 18.07.1978. Then she instituted a suit on 14.10.1978 and withdrew the same on 07.11.1979. Lastly, she instituted the instant suit on 09.12.1979. In the first suit, permission to institute fresh suit was granted subject to payment of Rs. 5/- as cost. The predecessor of the applicants in her plaint specifically mentioned that she had withdrawn her earlier suit on 07.11.1979. Perusal of said order dated 07.11.1979 (Exh.D.3) transpires that said order was passed on the application of the predecessor of the applicants, whereby she sought permission to withdraw the suit with the liberty to file fresh one and her application was allowed unconditionally and she was given permission to file fresh suit without imposing a condition.

31.     The power to review could only be exercised for the specific purpose of “correcting any error or supplying any omission” which appears on the surface of the record and could be detected without further elaborate inquiry or investigation. This might apply to accidental or arithmetical mistake due to some forgetfulness not involving a mental process of reasoning or the appreciation of any law or the facts already proved or admitted. Any other view would eliminate the real distinction between the exercise of powers on appeal where the entire subject matter is open to re-assessment and re-decision by the higher authority and on review where the matter has already been finally decided and cannot be re-opened but for the very narrow object of correcting some errors which have occurred in respect of intention to the contrary.

32.     What else do we mean by “clarity”, if not this? The law does not demand hyper-technical precision when confronting injustice; it requires, instead, a readiness to recognize when the principles of natural justice and legal equity are contravened in a manner that is conspicuous. The error is as luminous as daylight. It is the one that any reasonable judicial mind, upon mere perusal of the record, would at once acknowledge as an aberration. It is an error which exposes itself by its very presence--a mistake so patent, so glaring, that its non-recognition would amount to judicial blindness.

33.     Above referred facts clearly suggest that learned Single Judge in Chamber fell in error while making observations qua conditional withdrawal of the suit and non-payment of cost in the judgment under review while referring to some other suit having no concern with the lis, which had a different subject matter and legal basis.

34.     For the foregoing reasons, we unanimously hold that the judgment under review suffers from an error apparent on the face of the record which being is so clear and manifest cannot be permitted to remain on the record. Hence, application in hand is allowed. Consequently, the judgment under review dated 27.10.2014 is set-aside and the appeal of respondents is remanded to the learned Single Judge in Chambers for its decision on merits. No order as to costs.

Mr. Muhammad Yaqoob Sidhu, Advocate for Petitioner.

Ch. Muhammad Akbar Warraich, Advocate for Respondent.

Date of hearing: 23.1.2025.

Judgment

Through this single judgment, the present as well as connected Civil Revision bearing No. 17857/2019 are being simultaneously decided. Although both the petitions emanate from separate proceedings conducted in two different suits, instituted by the petitioner, against two different individuals, however, common question of law is involved therein. The present petition emanates from the suit instituted by the petitioner, against Amanat Ali son of Ghulam Sarwar (deceased), for specific performance of agreement to sell, whereas in connected civil revision, a similar suit was instituted by the petitioner against deceased Ghulam Sarwar, who expired during the pendency of the proceedings.

2.       By way of factual background, it has been noted that the petitioner instituted suit for specific performance based on an agreement to sell dated 26.03.2009, with the averment that the respondent entered into said agreement with the petitioner in respect of plot measuring 03 marla, fully described in para 1 of the plaint of the suit against present respondent, for total consideration of
Rs. 100,000/-, out of which a sum of Rs. 50,000/-was paid as earnest money and the remaining amount was agreed to be paid on or before 08.05.2009; that on 12.05.2009, the respondent received the balance sale consideration of Rs. 50,000/-in presence of Ghulam Sabir, however, when the petitioner asked to execute registered sale deed in his favour, the respondent refused. The suit was contested. After framing of issues and recording of evidence pro and contra, the suit of the petitioner was decreed, vide judgment and decree dated 23.02.2015, with direction to the petitioner to deposit remaining sale consideration of Rs. 50,000/-, within thirty days.

3.       The connected civil revision arises out of the suit for specific performance, instituted by the petitioner with the averment that the deceased predecessor of the respondents therein, namely, Ghulam Sarwar agreed to sell a plot measuring 07 marla, fully described in para 1 of the plaint, to the petitioner through agreement to sell dated 26.03.2009 for total consideration of Rs. 350,000/-, out of which a sum of Rs. 50,000/-was paid as earnest money and remaining amount was agreed to be paid on or before 08.05.2009; that on 12.05.2009, deceased Ghulam Sarwar received the balance sale consideration of Rs. 300,000/-in presence of Ghulam Sabir, however, when the petitioner asked to execute registered sale deed in his favour, the deceased Ghulam Sarwar refused. This suit was also contested. After framing of issues and recording of evidence of the parties, the suit of the petitioner was decreed, vide judgment and decree dated 23.02.2015, with direction to deposit remaining sale consideration of Rs. 300,000/-, within thirty days.

4.       The respondents’ side did not lay challenge to the findings of the Trial Court rendered in the suits. The petitioner preferred appeals in which he also filed an application, on 30.01.2019, for extension in time for deposit of the balance sale consideration. However, both the appeals, preferred by the petitioner, were dismissed, vide separate judgments and decrees dated 13.02.2019, on the ground that he failed to pay the balance sale consideration. Hence, these civil revisions.

5.       Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter alia, contends that both the Courts below erred in deciding the point of payment of balance consideration as the petitioner proved that he paid the balance sale consideration. Adds that even otherwise, once appeals were preferred, the decree(s) were under challenge and the petitioner was not obligated to deposit the balance sale consideration. Additionally, it has been contended that the petitioner had established bona fides by offering to deposit the same and also moved applications for extension of time before the Appellate Court below, which have been erroneously dealt with and law on the subject has neither been properly appreciated nor applied, and in this regard, reference has been made to Section 35 (c) of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (“the Act”). Further contends that once the appeals were preferred by the petitioner, the conditional decree(s), being preliminary in nature, were in fact the contract(s) between the parties and the Appellate Court below had the power to extend the time for payment of balance consideration as the respondents did not apply for rescission of the same, which power has not been exercised erroneously.

6.       Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents has supported the impugned judgments and decrees of the Appellate Court below.

7.       Arguments heard. Record perused.

8.       The petitioner instituted the suits against the respondents, which were decreed subject to deposit of balance sale consideration as he failed to establish that the respondents received the entire amount of balance sale consideration. Against the said judgments of the Trial Court, the respondents did not prefer any appeal. No misreading or non-reading of evidence could be pointed out by learned counsel for the petitioner to substantiate that the petitioner paid the entire sale consideration to the present respondent or the deceased Ghulam Sarwar, before instituting the suits against them. Hence, in the light of arguments advanced before me, only following legal question requires opinion of this Court:

“Whether filing of appeal against a conditional decree, by the decree holder, in itself amounts to suspension of the condition attached thereto and the decree holder is absolved from depositing the balance sale consideration?”

Before addressing the legal question formulated hereinabove while reappraising the record, it will be appropriate to examine the nature of the decree(s) passed in favour of the petitioner in suits against the respondents and scope of Section 35(c) of the Act.

9.       Learned counsel for the petitioner has pleaded that unless the respondents apply for rescission of the agreements to sell on the basis of the which the petitioner instituted the suits and decrees were passed and/or cancellation of the decrees, the petitioner has right to seek enlargement of the time to deposit the sale consideration and the Appellate Court below was empowered to grant the same, keeping in view Section 35 of the Act, which reads under:

“35.  When rescission may be adjudged. Any person interested in a contract in writing may sue to have it rescinded and such rescission may be adjudged by the Court in any of the following cases, namely:

(a)      …. ;

(b)      …..;

(c)      where a decree for specific performance of a contract of sale, or of a contract to take a lease, has been made and the purchaser or lessee makes default in payment of the purchase-money or sums which the Court has ordered him to pay.”

It is the case of the petitioner that in terms of above quoted provision of law, where the agreement to sell on the basis of which the petitioner institutes the suit and the decree has been passed, the judgment debtor is obligated to apply for rescission of contract on the basis of which the decree is passed. Scope of Section 35(c) came under discussion in case of Tasneem Ismail and others v. M/s. Wafi Associates and others (2007 SCMR 1464), and while examining catena of judgments, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:

“11.    … If, however, the decree directs that in the event of default of deposit within the time fixed the suit shall stand dismissed, the Court would be incompetent to extend the time. In such a case it will be deemed that the Court has also, in substance, passed an order of rescission of contract as contemplated by the concluding portion of section 28(1)’. With regard to the nature of a decree in a suit for specific performance and the scope of Section 35 of the said Act, this Court took a similar view in Shabbir Ahmed and another Zahoor Bibi and others PLD 2004 SC 790. While accepting the appeals the Court extended time for deposit of sale consideration holding that the decree in a suit for specific performance is a preliminary decree partaking the nature of a contract that the Court is still seized of the lis and could extend time for deposit of sale consideration or rescind the contract in terms of Section 35(c) of the Specific Relief Act, this Court observed as follows:

          Perusal of Section 35(c) clearly indicates that even after passing of decree, the Court possesses the power to rescind the contract and consequently set aside the decree, which it had passed earlier. Irresistible conclusion, therefore, would be that a suit, which was once decreed, could be dismissed again if the case falls within the scope of Section 35(c). The main characteristic of Section 35 is that the Court has been empowered to rescind or not to rescind the contract, despite the fact that decree has already been passed. If still the Court permits the decree to remain operative, certainly the time could be extended. Normally in a civil suit after passing of decree, the proceedings come to an end. In a suit for specific performance, the situation is different and if the case falls under clause (c) of Section 35, still the order of rescission can be passed. This brings it within the scope of preliminary decree, as further proceedings, as a rule, are to be taken before a suit could be completely disposed of. Besides, such decree itself assumes the characteristics of a contract, whereby certain acts are yet to be performed, including depositing of the purchase price, cost of purchase price of necessary stamps for execution of conveyance deed, the seller has also to put his appearance for signing conveyance deed, to receive the purchase price, etc.”

(Emphasis supplied)

From the ratio laid down in case of Tasneem Ismail supra, it is well-evident that generally, a decree in a suit for specific performance of agreement to sell is to be treated as preliminary decree and scope of the same is in the nature and character of a contract where the vendor has to deposit the balance sale price, cost of purchase of necessary stamp papers for the execution of the conveyance deed while seller remains under the obligation to appear before the Court to sign the conveyance deed and receive purchase money, hence, in such an eventuality, the decree is not final. However, in cases where the decree is passed by the Court concerned, subject to imposition of a condition, inter alia, by stipulating time for deposit of balance sale consideration and also specifying the consequences of any default in respect thereof, in such an eventuality, the decree is final and if the decree holder fails to comply with the condition, the time stipulated for fulfillment of the condition expires, the penal consequences contemplated through the said decree become self-operative and the decree is to be treated as final. Case reported as “Shah Wali v. Ghulam Din alias Gaman and another” (PLD 1966 SC 983) is referred in this regard. The Supreme Court held as under:

“The real test, in my view, is whether the decree has been made in such terms as to indicate that operate automatically or whether the Court has still retained some control over the litigation. An examination, therefore, has, to be made of the precise terms used in the decree. In the present case, the decree of the trial Court used the words that in the event of default the suit “will be dismissed”. These are not words of automatic operation, for, they contemplate a further order dismissing the suit. But the District Judge in the appellate decree made good this defect by stating that in the event of default the suit “will be treated as dismissed”. These words were capable, in my view, of operating automatically without any further order by the Court.”

In view of the dicta laid down in case of Shah Wali, supra, it is well evident that if consequence of non-fulfillment of the condition contained in the decree passed in a suit for specific performance has been provided for an automatic dismissal or rescission of the contract, nothing is left to be performed by the Court, whether it is the Trial Court or the Appellate Court. Putting it otherwise, the judgment debtor is not obligated to seek rescission.

10.     Having above legal position in sight, the decree(s) passed in the present cases as also the proceedings before the Appellate Court below need to be examined. Following relief was granted to the petitioner and decree sheets, in both cases, were accordingly chalked out:

“12.    In view of my finding on above issues, instant suit is hereby decreed in favour of the plaintiff, plaintiff is directed to deposit remaining consideration amount
Rs. 50,000/-within thirty days before the Court otherwise agreement shall deem to be rescinded.”

(Emphasis supplied)

A period of 30 days was given by the Trial Court, in both the cases, with clear warning that in case the needful is not done, the agreement(s) shall be deemed to be rescinded. A lot of emphasis has been laid on the point that the appeal is continuation of suit and it was obligatory on part of the Appellate Court below to extend time for deposit of the balance sale consideration. There is no cavil to said legal position, however, the argument is misconceived keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. It is also admitted feature of the case that the petitioner preferred appeals in both the cases on 21.03.2015 and did not fulfill the condition by depositing the balance sale consideration in both the cases. Along with the appeals, separate applications seeking suspension of the impugned judgments and decrees to the extent of payment of balance amount were also filed. Through order dated 17.04.2015, the appeals were admitted for regular hearing, however, no injunctive order was passed with respect to suspension of the impugned judgments and decrees of even date, i.e., 23.02.2015. The petitioner never agitated implicit refusal of the Appellate Court below to pass any injunctive order before the Appellate Court below or approached any higher forum. This Court is of the opinion that mere filing of appeal against a conditional decree, by the decree holder, in itself does not amount to suspension of the condition attached thereto and the decree holder is not absolved from depositing the balance sale consideration when the consequences of his failure to comply with condition is specified in the decree itself making the said decree final.

11.     There is another angle from which the present and the connected civil revision can be examined. Record depicts that during the pendency of the appeals before the Appellate Court below, approximately, 31 opportunities were granted to the petitioner side to advance arguments between 17.04.2015 till 13.05.2017 but the needful was not done. On 13.05.2017, the petitioner filed applications before the Appellate Court below, in his appeals, while taking a somersault that he filed separate applications before the Trial Court for the purpose of payment of balance amount but the said applications have been misplaced, which may be traced. The said applications were dismissed, vide orders dated 02.06.2017 (in both cases), operative part whereof read as under:

“4.      No any photo copy or attested photo copy of the order of the learned trial Court is attached with the petition, so how it can be said that appellant filed any application or Learned Trial Court passed any order? Whole contention of the appellant is oral, which has no force in the eye of law. Petition being merits less is dismissed.”

Orders dated 02.06.2017 were not assailed by the petitioner before any higher forum. Thereafter, again, the petitioner was granted number of opportunities to advance arguments on the appeals and after availing about 64 adjournments, the matter was finally argued, which depicts that the petitioner side was never ready and willing to perform his part of the contract under agreement(s) to sell between the parties and kept on lingering the matter on one pretext or the other. Hence, he is not entitled to any equitable relief and the Appellate Court below has correctly passed the impugned judgment and decree.

12.     In view of the above, the present as well as connected Civil Revision No. 17857/2019 have no merits. Hence, the same are dismissed.

Judgment

This constitutional petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) calls in question the vires of order dated 01.07.2021 passed by Member (Judicial-I), Board of Revenue, Punjab whereby appeal filed by the Petitioners against order dated 06.01.2020 of Commissioner Rawalpindi Division was dismissed.

2.       Brief facts necessitating the filing of instant petition are that the Respondent No. 6 approved Naqsha Jeem vide order dated 26.07.2016 in response to application filed by the Petitioners. Feeling aggrieved from aforementioned order, the Respondent No. 7 appealed before the Respondent No. 2/Additional Commissioner (Revenue), Rawalpindi who disposed of the same vide order dated 05.09.2016 with direction to Tehsildar that during partition proceedings previous possession of the parties and mode of partition be kept in view however, Naqsha Jeem was subsequently approved by CRO on 17.09.2016. The said order, thereafter, was challenged by the Petitioner before the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Rawalpindi which was dismissed vide order dated 13.03.2018. This order was then assailed by the Petitioners through appeal before the Additional Commissioner (Revenue), Punjab however, during proceedings, on application of the Petitioners, the said appeal was transferred to the Commissioner Rawalpindi Division, Rawalpindi who vide order dated 06.01.2020 disposed of revision petition and directed the Tehsildar Taxila to proceed further in the Naqsha Jeem as per law. The Petitioners filed appeal against above-stated order before the Member (Judicial-I), Board of Revenue, Punjab which was dismissed vide order dated 01.07.2021 (the “impugned order”), hence this petition.

3.       Learned counsel for the Petitioners inter alia argued that the “impugned order” was passed by the Respondent No. 1 on technical grounds and without providing proper right of hearing to the Petitioners; that the “impugned order” is against the law and facts; that the impugned judgment is the result of mis-reading and non-reading of material available on record.

4.       Learned counsel for the Respondent No. 7, on the other hand, supported the “impugned order” and stated that same was passed by the Respondent No. 1, as per law and this petition is liable to be dismissed as there is no illegality or infirmity in the “impugned judgment”.

5.       Arguments heard.

6.       From perusal of the “impugned order” it reveals that appeal of the Petitioners was dismissed by the Respondent No. 1 on the point of limitation. Admittedly, the litigation between the parties was initiated under The Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1967 (the “Act”) which is a special law and provides its own period of limitation for appeals. Section 161 of the “Act” deals with filing of appeal whereas period for filing is provided under Section 162 of the “Act” which reads as under:

Limitation for appeals.--Save as otherwise provided by this Act, the period of limitation for an appeal under section 161 shall run from the date of the order appealed against and shall be--

(a)      thirty days, where the appeal lies to the Collector;

(b)      sixty days, where the appeal lies to the Commissioner;

(c)      ninety days, where the appeal lies to the Board of Revenue.

Above provision of law clearly manifests that ninety days are prescribed in filing of appeal against the order of the Commissioner to the Board of Revenue. Pertinently, provision of Section 167 of the “Act” having expressly providing that limitation shall be governed by the provisions of Limitation Act, 1908 in filing of appeal, review or revision filed under this Act. It evinces from the “impugned order” that the order dated 06.01.2020 passed by the Commissioner Rawalpindi Division was assailed after inordinate delay of one year and 21 days. The question of limitation is of significance importance. In terms of Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1908, every Court is bound to consider such question despite being not raised by the parties to the lis. It has paramount importance, as with the afflux of time certain rights do accrue in favour of the adversary, which cannot be taken away in a slipshod manner. The object for framing the law for the purpose of regulating the limitation was to push the parties to file their respective claims within stipulated period. The time period provided for filing the proceedings in terms of appeal, review or revision petition cannot be lightly ignored or brushed aside. The question of limitation is as important as jurisdiction of the Court. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Lahore Development Authority versus Mst. Sharifan Bibi and another” (PLD 2010 Supreme Court 705) held that “law of limitation could not be considered merely a formality and required to be observed being mandatory in nature. Purpose of law of limitation was to help vigilant and not the indolent. Helping hand might not be extended to a litigant having going into deep slumber, on having become forgetful of his rights. Concerned person had to be made aware of invasion of his interest and such awareness had to be ascertained as a matter of fact. Supreme Court declined to interfere with exercise of discretion regarding question of limitation by High Court and order passed by High Court was neither illegal nor unreasonable but well based and did not warrant interference”. In the “impugned order” the Respondent No. 1 has rightly observed that:

“This case has chequered history of litigation. The matter remained pending adjudication in different revenue Courts and ultimately, learned Commissioner, Rawalpindi Division vide his order dated 06.01.2020 disposed of the revision petition with the direction to Tehsildar Taxila to proceed further in Naqsha Jeem dated 16.08.2018 as per law. Partition of land of joint khata is righto of each and every land owners/co-sharer provided under the law and it cannot be denied. This appeal has been filed with the inordinate delay of one year and 21 days”.

7.       Furthermore, the Petitioners fully knew factum of litigation history and passing of order dated 06.01.2020 by the Commissioner, Rawalpindi Division and to assail it before the Board of Revenue in terms of Section 161(1)(c) of the “Act” within the statutory period of limitation but they remained slept for more than one year. Reliance is made on “Muhammad Azhar Khan and another versus Assistant Commissioner/Collector, Toba Tek Singh and others” (2006 SCMR 778) wherein the Supreme Court has held that “Honourable Judge in the Chambers of the High Court, who had decided the writ petition filed by the respondents on 7-7-1993 has held that appeal before the Deputy Commissioner was time-barred, therefore, the same was rightly dismissed. It is to be noted that once the appeal was not filed in time before the Appellate Authority how the writ or review petition was competent because before approaching the High Court for redressal of the grievance-by invoking its Constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution, it was incumbent upon the respondents to have availed alternative remedies according to law”. Moreover, the law helps the vigilant and not the indolent. Reliance in this regard is placed on “Aftab Iqbal Khan Khichi and another versus Messrs United Distributors Pakistan Ltd. Karachi” (1999 SCMR 1326). It is a settled principle of law that when a law describes or requires a thing to be done in a particular manner, it should be done in that manner or not at all. Reliance in said regard may well be placed upon observation in “Attaullah Khan versus Ali Azam Afridi and others” (2023 PLC (C.S) 182).

8.       Aptly, the petition in hand was filed on 17.12.2021 and the Petitioners have called in question the “impugned order” order but interestingly after lapse of five months and sixteen days without explaining any convincing reasons for the inordinate delay, as such principle of laches is applicable upon this case as three months’ time is considered reasonable for a party to assail an adverse order in writ jurisdiction of this Court. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Civil Aviation Authority through Director General and 3 others versus Mir Zulfiqar Ali and another” (2016 SCMR 183) has held as under:

“The Respondent No. 1, who appeared in person, despite opportunity failed to explain or justify the delay. Since the petition was filed after a lapse of almost 10 years and that too without any justification or explanation for such delay, the same ought to have been dismissed as such.”

In “State Bank of Pakistan through Governor and another
versus Imtiaz Ali Khan and others” (2012 SCMR 280) it has held as under:

“laches is a doctrine whereunder a party which may have a right, which was otherwise enforceable, loses such right to the extent of its enforcement if it is found by the Court of a law that its case is hit by the doctrine of laches/limitation. Right remains with the party but it cannot enforce it. The limitation is examined by the Limitation Act or by special laws which have inbuilt provisions for seeking relief against any grievance within the time specified under the law and if party aggrieved do not approach the appropriate forum within the stipulated period/time, the grievance though remains but it cannot be redressed because if on one hand there was a right with a party which he could have enforced against the other but because of principle of limitation/laches, same right then vests/accrues in favour of the opposite party”.

It was further held by Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Member (S&R)/Chief Settlement Commissioner, Board Of Revenue, Punjab, Lahore and another versus Syed Ashfaque Ali and others” (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 132) as under:

“On account of Laches in setting the machinery of law into motion they have indeed disentitled themselves to the exercise of discretionary and equitable jurisdiction, which in all cases must be exercised in order to foster the ends of justice and to right a wrong. Writ jurisdiction is undoubtedly discretionary and extraordinary in nature which may not be invoked by a party who demonstrates a style of slackness and laxity on his part. Furthermore, if a party does not choose legal remedy available under the Statute strictly speaking Constitutional


jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be exercised in his favour. Law is well-settled that a patty guilty of gross negligence and laches is not entitled to the equitable relief. One who seeks equity must show that equities lean in his favour. In the facts and circumstances of the appeal we are, therefore, in no manner of doubt that the High Court was not competent to exercise its writ jurisdiction conferred under Article 199 of the Constitution”.

9.       The exercise of constitutional jurisdiction in terms of Article 199 of the “Constitution” is discretionary which can only be invoked in extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. The Petitioners have badly failed to point out any illegality or material irregularity in the impugned order, warranting interference by this Court in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction. This Court while invoking its constitutional jurisdiction always exercises restraint in interfering with the judgment or order passed in exercise of revisional jurisdiction unless some perversity or patent illegality is floating on the surface of record. The constitutional jurisdiction can only be exercised in such an eventuality if the impugned judgment or order suffers with certain legal infirmities or patent illegalities, resulting into failure of justice.

10.     Learned counsel for the Petitioners is unable to point out any illegality or irregularity in the “impugned order” warranting interference by this Court in its constitutional jurisdiction. Resultantly, the instant petition stands dismissed.

All the matters are being decided through this single judgment.

2.       Briefly stated the facts of the prosecution case as described by Ashraf Ali (PW.11) in FIR (Exh.PM/1) are that he is the permanent resident of Chak No. 13/14-L and a cultivator being retired Army Official. On 30.05.2017 at about 4:30 p.m., he along with his brother Akbar Ali, son Salman Asrhaf, nephews Muhammad Usman, Muhammad Idrees and Naeem Abbas (son-in-law of Akbar Ali) was present in veranda of his cattle shed after giving fodder to the cattle. Meanwhile, Imran armed with pistol .30 bore, Shahid armed with .222 bore rifle, Arshad armed with .12 bore gun, Yaseen armed with .222 bore rifle came on the rooftop of Akbar Ali and came in the veranda through Ihata of Bashir Ahmad with the help of ladder. Accused Amir armed with .12 bore gun, Bashir accused (since dead) armed with .12 bore gun, Amin accused armed with .12 bore repeater, Yousaf accused armed with .12 bore gun, Iqbal alias Bali accused armed with .222 bore rifle, Arshad alias Sohni accused armed with .12 bore gun, entered into the house of Akbar through outer-gate and raised Lalkara to the women folk present in the house that they would teach a lesson to Shah Ali for purchasing Ihata. The accused maltreated the women folk present in the house and used abusive language, upon which Idrees, Akbar Ali, Usman, Naeem Abbas, Suleman and the complainant came at the spot. Arshad Masih alias Sohni accused made fire with .12 bore gun at Usman which hit him on his left shoulder. Bashir accused (since dead) made fire shot with gun .12 bore at Naeem Abbas which hit him on his right leg. Tariq accused made fire shots with repeater gun .12 bore at Suleman Ashraf which hit him on his right leg and left leg. Iqbal alias Bali accused fired with his rifle .222 bore which hit on the left side of complainant’s abdomen. Yasin accused fired from his .222 bore rifle which hit at the right side of the abdomen of the complainant. Yousaf accused fired with his repeater gun at Akbar PW which hit on his left arm. Adnan accused fired with repeater .12 bore gun at Akbar Ali which hit him on his left leg. Shahid accused also fired with .222 bore rifle at Akbar Ali which hit him on his left leg.

Amin accused fired with his repeater .12 bore gun which hit the bullock. Muhammad Ali accused made fire shot with his repeater .12 bore gun which hit their she-buffalo. The afore-mentioned accused along with 7/8 unknown persons equipped with firearms while making firing kept on creating terror and raising Lalkara that they would not let Akbar Ali and others alive. The occurrence was also witnessed by Muhammad Saddique and Haider Ali. The motive behind the occurrence statedly was that on 17.05.2017 Akbar Ali purchased a piece of land measuring 21 Marlas from Shah Ali for which the accused had nourished grudge.

3.       On 03.06.2017 Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19) along with other police officials was present at Railway Crossing Kassowal, when Ashraf Ali complainant (PW.11) presented application (Exh.PM) before him as well as medico legal reports of Muhammad Idrees, Akbar Ali, Suleman Ashraf, Naeem Abbas, Muhammad Usman and his own along with MLRs of two injured cattle. He recorded the police proceedings on application (Exh.PM) and sent the same to Police Station Kassowal through Muhammad Iqbal 353/C for the registration of formal FIR. Subsequent thereto, he visited the spot and secured blood stained cotton from the place where Muhammad Idrees (deceased) received injuries through memo. Exh.PW. From the place of occurrence, he also took into possession 8 crime empties of .12 bore (P.14/1-8) from the rooftop of the house of Akbar Ali vide memo. Exh.PW/1, 5 crime empties of .30 bore pistol (P.15/1-5), 23 crime empties of .222 bore (P.16/1-23) and 30 crime empties of .12 bore (P.17/1-30) from the Courtyard of the house of Akbar Ali which were taken into possession through memo.

Exh.PW/4. He secured 6 crime empties of pistol .30 bore (P.22/1-6) from the street near the house of occurrence which were secured vide memo. Exh.PW/5. He also prepared visual site plan of the place of occurrence (Exh.PZ).

Upon the expiry of Muhammad Idrees injured on 04.06.2017, the investigation of the case was entrusted to Abid Sagheer Inspector (PW.16), who visited THQ Hospital Chichawatni, prepared injury statement (Exh.PX), inquest report (Exh.PX/1) and deputed Amjad Ali 1186/C to get conducted the autopsy of Muhammad Idrees. On 21.08.2017 he arrested Muhammad Yasin, Muhammad Shahid, Bashir Ahmad, Tariq and Muhammad Yousaf accused. On 27.08.2017 accused Muhammad Yasin and Shahid accused during investigation made separate disclosures and led to the recovery of .222 bore rifles (P.3 and P.11) which were taken into possession through memos. Exh.PC and Exh.PH. He also arrested the accused Muhammad Amin, Muhammad Ali and Iqbal alias Bali, Imran alias Mani on 08.09.2017, 14.09.2017 and 22.09.2017.

He recorded the statements of PWs under Section 161, Cr.P.C. and submitted the file to SHO Police Station Kassowal for preparing report in terms of Section 173, Cr.P.C.

4.       During trial, prosecution in order to prove its case against the appellants and their co-accused produced 19-witnesses, out of whom Dr.Mushtaq Ahmad (PW.5) who on 30.05.2017 at 10:30 a.m. medically examined one buffalo and bullock and issued certificates (Exh.PJ & Exh.PK), Dr.Nazeer Ahmad (PW.9) who on 30.05.2017 after examining injured Salman Asrhaf, Muhammad Usman, Ashraf Ali, Naeem Abbas, Akbar Ali, Muhammad Idrees issued their MLCs (Exh.PN, Exh.PO, Exh.PP, Exh.PQ, Exh.PR & Exh.PS) and Dr.Ali Hussain Syed (PW.10) who on 04.06.2017 at 1:00 p.m. conducted the postmortem examination of Muhammad Idrees and issued PMR (Exh.PT) along with pictorial diagrams (Exh.PT/1 & Exh.PT/2), Ashraf Ali (PW.11), Salman Ashraf (PW.12), Muhammad Usman (PW.13), Akbar Ali (PW.14) and Haider Ali (PW.15) entered appearance in the witness box as witnesses of ocular account and Abid Sagheer Inspector (PW.16) and Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19) investigated the case. The remaining PWs were more or less formal and acted according to the law to aid and support the investigation.

5.       After the conclusion of prosecution evidence, the appellants were examined under Section 342, Cr.P.C. during which they were asked the questions arising out of the prosecution evidence but they denied almost all those questions while pleading their innocence and false implication with the case. Appellants neither opted to make statement under Section 340(2), Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in their defence. On the conclusion of trial, the appellants were convicted and sentenced as afore-stated, hence the instant criminal appeals, criminal revision and murder reference.

6.       It is contended on behalf of the appellants that there is a delay of more than four days in reporting the crime to police for which no plausible explanation has been offered by the prosecution. The appellants have been implicated in the instant case due to previous enmity with the complainant party. The PWs are not trustworthy as they have made dishonest improvements in their statements to bring the case in line with the medical evidence. All the PWs are interested and inimical witnesses, thus for relying upon their statements a very cautious approach ought to be adopted by the Courts. The medical evidence contradicts the ocular account. The prosecution also failed to seek corroboration from the motive as well as the recovery of weapons allegedly recovered from the appellants. It was thus argued that the convictions and sentences awarded to the appellants be set- aside and they be acquitted from all the charges.

7.       On the other hand, learned Deputy Prosecutor General well assisted by learned counsel for the complainant submitted that the delay in reporting the matter was properly explained by the prosecution. The accused committed a cold blooded murder of an innocent person and injured five persons by making fire shots. The eye-witness account consisting of four injured witnesses narrated the incident in a very natural way. The medical evidence is in line with the ocular account. The prosecution also sought full corroboration from the duly proved motive as well as the positive report of PFSA whereby the weapons recovered from the appellants matched with the crime empties secured from the spot. It was thus urged that the convictions and sentences awarded to the appellants be maintained.

8.       We have gone through the case file, heard pro and contra arguments of the learned counsel for the parties well assisted by the Deputy Prosecutor General and perused the record.

9.       The minute perusal of the record reveals that the case in hand is arising out of an occurrence which took place on 30.05.2017 at about 4:30 p.m. in an area known as “Chak No. 13/14-L” situated at a distance of 10-miles from Police Station Kassowal, District Sahiwal. The detail of crime was reported by Ashraf Ali (PW.11) through written application (Exh.PM) presented before Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19) when he was present at Railway Crossing Kassowal on 03.06.2017, which was transcribed into formal FIR (Exh.PM/1). According to the detail mentioned in the crime report, initially six persons, namely, Salman Asrhaf, Muhammad Usman, Ashraf Ali, Naeem Abbas, Akbar Ali and Muhammad Idrees received firearm injuries during the occurrence. Out of the above-mentioned six persons, Muhammad Idrees died on 04.06.2017 at District Headquarter Teaching Hospital, Sahiwal. The allegation of committing the crime was attributed to as many as twelve named and 7/8 unknown accused, out of them, appellants were handed down guilty verdict whereas four accused mentioned supra were acquitted.

10.     As stated above, the incident in this case occurred on 30.05.2017 at about 4:30 p.m. but the matter was reported to the police on 03.06.2017 at about 6:05 p.m. i.e. after the delay of 04- days & 1½ hour but no plausible explanation was offered by the prosecution for such long delay. We have also noticed that immediately after the occurrence Rapat No. 18 dated 30.05.2017 was entered at 5:50 p.m. wherein it was specifically mentioned that Akbar Ali, Asrhaf, Muhammad Idrees, Salman, Muhammad Usman, Naeem Abbas in injured condition came at Police Station Kassowal and stated that Imran along with 12 other named and 7/8 unknown accused who were armed with Dands, Sotas and firearm weapons injured them. It is worth mentioning here that when the occurrence had already been reported in the form of Rapat No. 18, there was no occasion for the complainant to re-report the matter through written application (Exh.PM) after the delay of more than four days.

It is evident from the record that Muhammad Usman ASI (PW.6) posted at police station Kassowal was the first police officer who visited the place of occurrence after the incorporation of Rapat No. 18 but no complaint was presented to him at the spot by complainant Ashraf Ali (PW.11) in order to get registered an FIR as per version introduced later on. This fact was categorically admitted by Muhammad Usman ASI (PW.6) who deposed that:

“I had visited the place of occurrence almost at the evening time. There were lot of people present at the spot at that time. Ashraf s/o Rehmat Ali complainant of this case was also present at the spot at that time. Ashraf complainant or any other person including injured did not produce before me any application for registration of FIR, nor they nominated their assailants before me.”

The above quoted portion of the evidence of Muhammad Usman ASI (PW. 6) is very much relevant because had the incident taken place in the manner and mode the complainant narrated through application (Exh.PM) it would have been reported immediately to him at the spot. The complainant party through a protracted trial remained fail in justifying as to what preluded them to report the crime to the police promptly. We have also minutely perused Rapat No. 18 dated 30.05.2017 the examination of which shows that the afore-mentioned injured along with Idrees (the then injured) arrived at Police Station, however, in the said Rapat the description of injuries and the role assigned to the accused are missing. It is also mentioned in Rapat No. 18 that the accused caused injuries to the injured persons by using blunt as well as firearm weapons. Therefore, it can be concluded that in fact Rapat No. 18 was the exact information which was conveyed to police immediately after the incident. However, later on the facts were concocted and the FIR was chalked out after deliberation and consultation. Reliance is placed upon the case reported as Muhammad Jahangir and another v. The State and others (2024 SCMR 1741), wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:

“…….. perusal of record reveals that FIR was lodged after an unexplainable delay of 3 hours despite the fact that the distance of the police station from the place of occurrence was 5 km. The time of occurrence is around 05:00/05:30 pm and the matter is reported at 08:30 p.m. The complainant had a bike that he used to go to the police station. This delay has not been encountered through plausible explanation by the prosecution.”

In order to cover delay in reporting the matter to police Ashraf Ali complainant (PW.11) during the course of evidence took the stance that on 30.05.2017 he presented an application for the registration of FIR before SHO who did not lodge any FIR. Learned trial Court at the relevant time asked DDPP to peruse the record for tracing out the said application but the same was not found available. Since this is an important aspect, hence relevant portion of the cross- examination of Ashraf Ali (PW.11) is reproduced hereunder:-

“I also submitted my application before SHO for registration of my FIR on 30.05.2017 on the day of occurrence but SHO did not lodge my FIR on the application. It is correct that I cannot present that application before the Court now. At the request of learned counsel for the accused file was perused by learned DDPP but no such application dated 30.05.2017 is available on record.”

Similarly, Ghulam Farid SI/Investigating Officer (PW.19) during cross-examination stated that no application for the registration of FIR was submitted by Ashraf Ali SI (PW.11). In this regard, an excerpt from the cross-examination of Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19) is mentioned below:-

“I have perused the police file as well as judicial file, no application is available on record that might have been submitted by the complainant on 30.05.2017 for the registration of this case.”

Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19) further stated the occurrence had come into his knowledge, however, no application with regard to the registration of FIR was moved prior to 03.06.2017. A relevant portion of cross-examination of Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19) reads as under:-

“The instant occurrence came into our knowledge on 30.05.2017. It is correct that if a cognizable offence is committed at any application the FIR must be registered instantly. Since complainant did not submit any application for registration of case of present occurrence prior to 03.06.2017 therefore police did not lodge any FIR at its own”.

Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19) absolutely ruined the case of prosecution by admitting during cross-examination that the complaint (Exh.PM) was got drafted by the complainant under some legal advice and on advice of the local MPA. An excerpt from the cross-examination of Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19) on account of its importance is also mentioned hereunder:

“It is correct that application Ex.PM was not submitted to me on the date and time stated therein. That in fact it was prepared at the police station with legal advice and for the advice of local MPA and nominated with specific role the opponents of said MPA.”

The above-mentioned extracts clearly demonstrate that the FIR was got registered by the complainant after consulting a legal brain, thus the same is to be looked with suspicious eyes. Reference in this context may be made to the case reported as Dur Muhammad and another v. The State and another (2020 YLR 470) wherein it was held that:

“The above quoted portion of cross-examination of the complainant (PW-2) clearly indicates that the FIR has been lodged while procuring legal advice, after consulting a legal brain, in the manners be suiting to the complainant, therefore, such FIR, which has been lodged after consultation and deliberation is always seen with suspicious eyes as its veracity is deemed to be at stake being result of consultation and deliberations.”

11.     We have also observed that complaint (Exh.PM) is a computerized drafted application. Asrhaf Ali (PW.11) who is signatory of Exh.PM during cross-examination admitted that he got it drafted from Tehsil Courts, Chichawatni from a computer operator. Since this is an important aspect, hence a relevant portion of cross-examination of Asrhaf Ali (PW.11) is mentioned hereunder:-

“I got composed my complaint Ex.PM from Tehsil Courts Chichawatni. I am literate. Computer Operator after composing my application read over to me and I conceded it as correct, therefore, he handed over to me the print of the same and I after putting my signatures on it submitted the same before the Thanedar.”

Admittedly, the composer of complaint (Exh.PM) was neither produced during investigative phase nor at trial stage. The facts and circumstances mentioned hereinabove lead us to the conclusion that the FIR (Exh.PM/1) was registered while implicating each accused with the role assigned to him as per choice of the complainant-party. Therefore in such like cases the Courts have to adopt a very cautious approach for evaluating the evidence for maintaining the conviction of the accused, especially on the charge of capital sentence.

12.     The facts mentioned above prompted this Court to sean the ocular account with extreme care and caution. Before the trial Court the story of homicide incident was narrated by Ashraf Ali (PW.11), Salman Ashraf (PW.12), Muhammad Usman (PW.13), Akbar Ali (PW.14) and Haider Ali (PW.15). Out of these witnesses, the former four PWs claimed to have endured firearm injuries on different parts of their bodies and the foregoing fact was described by the prosecution as affirmative proof of their truthful depositions. We acknowledge that the receipt of grievous hurt by an eye-witness in the murder incident though is a factor which reflects positively an assumption of his presence at the spot but it is not a conclusive proof about the truth of his deposition. For handing down guilty verdict to an accused in such incident, the testimony of an injured eye-witness is still required to be tested on the touchstone of the principles laid down for the appraisal of evidence. To say that an injured witness of murder incident seldom tells lie might be true in a case of single accused but is an overstatement when the number of assailants is more than one. It will wholly be unjust to raise the superstructure of conviction on the deposition of injured witness, without subjecting it to strict test of scrutiny for adjudging his credibility. If any reference in this regard is needed that can be made to the case reported as Amin Ali v. The State (2011 SCMR 323) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:-

“Certainly, the presence of injured witnesses cannot be doubted at the place of incident, but the question is as to whether they are truthful witnesses or otherwise, because merely the injuries on the person of P.Ws. would not stamp them truthful witnesses.”

In another case reported as Nazir Ahmad v. Muhammad Iqbal and another (2011 SCMR 527), the Supreme Court of Pakistan while examining the case of an injured witness held as under:

“It is settled law that injuries of PWs are only indication of his presence at the spot but are not affirmative proof of his credibility and truth. See Said Ahmed’s case (1981 SCMR 795) and Muhammad Pervez’s case (2007 SCMR 670).”

13.     Keeping in view the afore-mentioned principle of law, we have eloquently perused the record and found that the ocular account consisting of five PWs is suffering from multiple omissions and lacunas and the same cannot be made basis for maintaining the conviction and sentence of the appellants. In this regard, it is observed that as mentioned supra the incident occurred on 30.05.2017 whereas the FIR in this case was chalked out on 03.06.2017 i.e. after more than four days. All the four injured PWs after the occurrence as per story of the prosecution were taken to Police Station Kassowal from where after preparation of police papers they were dispatched to THQ Hospital Chichawatni for their medical examination and this aspect was highlighted by Ashraf Ali complainant (PW.11) with the following words:

“We the injured PWs including Muhammad Idrees (the then injured) deceased were taken to police station Kassowal where papers were prepared for getting us medically examined. Whereafter we were taken to the Tehsil Headquarter Hospital Chichawatni, where we were medically examined. I, Akbar Ali PW and Idrees deceased who was then alive were referred to District Headquarter Teaching Hospital Sahiwal for further treatment. On 03.06.2017, I obtained our medicolegal reports from Tehsil Headquarter Hospital Chichawatni and I got written computerized application Ex.PM at Tehsil Courts, Chichawatni which bears my signatures.”

The similar stance was supported by Salman Ashraf (PW.12), Muhammad Usman (PW.13) and Akbar Ali (PW.14) who deposed that:

Salman Ashraf (PW.12)

“I and other injured named above were shifted to police station Kassowal where our injury statements were prepared by the Police and we were taken to the Tehsil Headquarter Hospital Chichawanti where we were medically examined. I, Muhammad Idrees deceased who was then alive and Akbar Ali PW were referred to District Headquarter Teaching Hospital Sahiwal for better treatment but Muhammad Idrees then injured succumbed to the injuries in District Headquarter Teaching Hospital, Sahiwal on 04.06.2017.”

Muhammad Usman (PW.13)

“After the occurrence, we the injured PWs including Muhammad Idrees deceased who was then alive, were removed to police station Kassowal where our injury statements were prepared and we were taken to Tehsil Headquarter Hospital Chichawatni where we were medically examined. We all the injured were referred to District Headquarter Teaching Hospital Sahiwal. Muhammad Idrees injured succumbed to the injuries on 04.06.2017 in the District Headquarter Teaching Hospital Sahiwal.”

Akbar Ali (PW.14)

“After the occurrence we the injured including Idrees deceased who was then alive were removed to police station Kassowal wherefrom we the injured including the deceased who was then alive were taken by the police to Tehsil Headquarter Hospital Chichawatni where we were medically examined. Idrees deceased who was then alive and Ashraf Ali complainant were referred to District Headquarter Teaching Hospital Sahiwal for their better treatment. I and Suleman injured PW were also referred to District Headquarter Teaching Hospital Sahiwal for better treatment. On 04.06.2017, Muhammad Idrees injured succumbed to the injuries in District Headquarter Teaching Hospital Sahiwal.”

However, the version of the above-mentioned witnesses of the ocular account was not supported by Haider Ali (PW.15) produced by complainant party itself and he deposed in the terms referred below for the sake of reference:

“On the day of occurrence Muhammad Usman ASI reached the place of occurrence soon after the occurrence and all the injured were lying at the place of occurrence I also appeared before Muhammad Usman ASI at that time. I did not record any statement to Muhammad Usman ASI or any other police officer on the day of occurrence regarding the occurrence on 30.05.2017. Except Idress all the other injured PWs were in conscious. None of them made any statement before Usman ASI as to how they received injuries nor they nominated their assailants before the Usman ASI.”

This version of Haider Ali (PW.15) stood corroborated from the statement of Muhammad Usman ASI (PW.6) who was the first police officer who visited the place of occurrence immediately after getting knowledge and made it clear during the course of his examination-in-chief that on 30.05.2017 he prepared the injury statement of Naeem Abbas injured Ex.PL, injury statement of Akbar injured Ex.PL/1, injury statement of Salman injured Ex.PL/2 and the injury statement of Muhammad Usman Ex.PL/3 and sent them to Tehsil Headquarter Hospital Chichawanti with Ijaz Ahmed 312/C for their medical examination. The MLCs of the injured Ashraf Ali (PW.11), Salman Ashraf (PW.12), Muhammad Usman (PW.13) and Akbar Ali (PW.14) categorically contained the fact that all the injured were medically examined through above-said Ijaz Ahmed 312/C meaning thereby that the witnesses of ocular account stand belied before the Court regarding the manner and mode of incident and the examination of injured who were never taken to police station immediately after the occurrence, rather their injury statements were prepared by Muhammad Usman ASI (PW.6) at the spot and that too prior to the registration of the FIR. During trial complainant Ashraf Ali (PW.11) further stated that on 28.06.2017 he along with other PWs appeared before Abid Sagheer Inspector (PW.16) and got recorded his statement (Exh.DA) asserting therein that after the occurrence the injured were shifted to hospital by rescue 1122 and the police did not visit the place of occurrence on the day of incident, rather he met the police for the first time on the day of occurrence at 5:45 p.m. This being important is reproduced hereunder:

“It is correct that on 28.06.2017 we appeared before Abid Sagheer Inspector during investigation who recorded my statement. I recorded in my statement Ex.DA that injured persons were shifted to hospital by Rescue 1122. Police did not visit the place of occurrence on the day of occurrence at all. I for the first time met the police at police station on the day of occurrence at 05:45 PM.”

The admission on part of the complainant that the injured were shifted to the hospital via Rescue-1122 manifests that they were not taken to Police Station rather were shifted directly to the hospital.

14.     Besides that Muhammad Usman ASI (PW.6) also stated that he prepared injury statement of she-buffalo of complainant (Exh.PL/5) and sent it to Veterinary Hospital for its medical examination. The perusal of afore-said injury statements reveals that the reference of Rapat No. 18 dated 30.05.2017 is mentioned therein. It also speaks volume of the fact that by the time the police officer visited the spot, no FIR had been registered. Thus, without registration of FIR Muhammad Usman ASI (PW-6) was not empowered to prepare and investigate the case. Furthermore, it is evident from record that neither Muhammad Usman ASI (PW.6) was joined with investigation nor he handed over the injury statements of the injured to IO to be taken into possession vide recovery memo. in this case in order to endorse the fact that after Rapat No. 18 the proceedings were conducted in accordance with law and in this way the injury statements prepared by Muhammad Usman ASI lost its evidentiary value in the light of admission of Muhammad Usman ASI (PW.6) who in unequivocal terms admitted during cross- examination that:

“I did not join the investigation of this case and nor my statement was recorded by IO. It is correct that FIR was not registered at that time when I prepared the injury statements”.

15.     The perusal of the record further make it clear that despite the visit of Muhammad Usman ASI (PW.6) at the crime scene on 30.05.2017 the crime empties were not taken into possession by him, rather according to record the same were secured by Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19) during his visit at the crime scene on 03.06.2017. We have observed that nowhere in the prosecution evidence it has come on record that the crime scene was secured and the crime empties recovered later on were lying at the same places and in the same position as mentioned by Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19). Abid Sagheer Inspector (PW.16) during cross-examination also admitted that the case diary of 03.06.2017 is silent as to whether the crime scene was secured. The relevant portion of cross-examination of Abid Sagheer Inspector (PW.16) is reproduced hereunder:-

“There is no observation of Ghulam Farid SI mentioned in the inspection notes or anywhere in the case diary of dated 03.06.2017, that the place of occurrence had been secured,
so that nobody tempered with anything at the place of occurrence until he visited the place of occurrence. There is
no mention anywhere in the case diary that crime scene
unit had visited the place of occurrence. No one got recorded his statement during investigation conducted by me that the place of occurrence was secured by the local police from 30.05.2017 onward, so that nobody tampers with the scene of occurrence.”

16.     We are also mindful of the fact that during investigation, .222 bore rifles (P.3, P.11 & P.10) were recovered from Muhammad Yasin, Shahid and Iqbal (appellants) and pistol .30 bore and pump action gun (P.5 &P.7) were got recovered by Imran and Adnan (appellants). According to reports of PFSA (Exh.PAA & Exh.PAC) .222 bore rifle, pistol .30 bore and pump action recovered from Yasin, Imran and Adnan (appellants) were found wedded with the respective crime empties secured from the spot. However, the evidence of Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19) has caused a serious dent in the case of prosecution who while recording his statement before the Court deposed that on 03.06.2017 he took into possession 8 crime empties of .12 bore (P-14/1-8) from the roof top of the house of Akbar Ali which were converted into sealed parcel and were taken into possession vide recovery memo. Ex.PW/1, however, Ex.PW/1 contained the fact that the above said crime empties were taken into possession by Investigation Officer from thoroughfare and not from the rooftop of the house of Akbar Ali. Similarly, Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19) mentioned that he secured 12 crime empties of .12 bore (P-19/1-12), 3 crime empties of .12 bore (P.20/1-3), 4 crime empties of .222 bore (P.21/1-4) from the street near the house of occurrence which were converted into sealed parcel and were taken into possession vide recovery memo. Ex.PW/4 whereas. vide recovery memo. Ex.PW/4 8 crime empties were taken into possession by IO from the rooftop of Akbar Ali and not from the street near the house of occurrence. In this way the positive report of PFSA lost it evidentiary value whereas the reports of PFSA regarding the recovery of weapons of the remaining appellants are negative. Needless to mention the positive reports of PFSA further lose legal acceptance as corroboratory piece of evidence when seen in the context that the ocular account stands disbelieved. Reliance is placed upon the case reported as Muhammad Hassan v. State (2024 SCMR 1427) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:

“…… it is highly unsafe to rely on the evidence of recovery, which even otherwise is a corroborative piece of evidence and relevant only when the primary evidence i.e. ocular account inspires confidence as observed by this Court in Nasir Javaid and another v. The State (2016 SCMR 1144); Muhammad Nawaz and others v. The State and others (2016 SCMR 267) and Hayatullah v. The State (2018 SCMR 2092).”

17.     It is further noteworthy here that as per complaint (Exh.PM) when the accused entered the house of Ashraf Ali (complainant), they maltreated the women-folk present thereat and thereafter the whole incident took place. However, Ashraf Ali (PW.11) when appeared before the trial Court, he did not utter a single word regarding the maltreatment of his women-folk. Though Muhammad Usman (PW.13) in his examination-in-chief stated that the accused gave slaps to their ladies, however during cross-examination admitted that he did not produce any lady before any of the Investigating Officers for recording of her statement. Muhammad Usman (PW.13) during cross-examination admitted as under:

“It is correct that we did not produce any lady during the investigation to prove that any lady was present in the house of occurrence at the time of occurrence. It is correct that we did not get recorded any statement of any lady during investigation to prove this fact that at the time of occurrence our ladies were present in the house of occurrence.”

Despite scrutiny of record with great circumspection we also remained abortive in tracing out the slightest piece of material to prove that any of the women was either produced before the Investigating Officer or at trial stage in support of the afore-stated stance, besides that no MLC of any of the afore-stated women is available on the file. All the narration of facts mentioned above speaks volume that either no woman was present at the crime scene or the story of maltreatment to the complainant’s women folk was introduced just to aggravate the incident by giving it a colour of Ghairat.

18.     It has further been noticed by us that Ghulam Farid SI (PW.1) during evidence stated that he had taken blood with the help of cotton from different places i.e. four places. Contrarily, the memo. (Exh.PW) through which the blood through cotton was taken into possession shows that the same was done from one place.

19.     We have no hesitation or doubt in observing that all the witnesses of ocular account also made dishonest improvements, thus it is not safe to rely upon them. The improvements so made by the eye-witnesses on account of relevancy are reproduced hereunder:-

Ashraf Ali (PW.11)

I recorded in my complaint Ex.PM that I got registered the present case on 03.06.2017 because I was worried and remained busy in the medical treatment of Muhammad Idrees the then injured and myself. During this period Muhammad Idrees injured succumbed to the injuries on 04.06.2017. (Confronted with Ex.PM where it is not so recoded word to word rather it is recorded that I remained busy in the medical treatment of the injured persons till today).

Salman Ashraf (PW.12)

I recorded in my statement under Section 161, Cr.P.C. on 03.06.2017 that accused Imran make fire shots. Confronted with Ex.DB where only one fire shot has been recorded.

Muhammad Usman (PW.13)

I recorded in my statement under Section 161, Cr.P.C. that Imran made more than one fire. Confronted with Ex.DA where only one fire has been recorded.

Akbar Ali (PW.14)

I recorded in my statement under Section 161, Cr.P.C. that Shah Ali abducted the daughter of accused Muhammad Ali regarding which a case FIR No. 187/2017 offence under Section 496-A was got registered by Muhammad Saleem the husband of Mst. Mazia Bibi at police station Ghazi Abad, Lahore. Confronted with Ex.DC where it is not so recorded. I also got recorded in my statement under Section 161, Cr.P.C. that Muhammad Saleem remained failed in his case, Imran accused was asked for restoration of Mst. Nazia Bibi who in this connection beat Sayyam Ali the son of Shah Ali regarding case FIR No. 147/2017 dated 18.04.2017 was registered against Imran etc. Confronted with Ex.DC where it is not so recorded. I recorded in my statement under Section 161, Cr.P.C. Ex.DC that being feared from Imran etc Shah Ali sold his Ihata in dispute to me and left the village. Confronted with Ex.DC where it is not so recorded. I recorded in my statement u/S. 161, Cr.P.C. that accused Imran made fire shots. Confronted with Ex.DC where only one fire shot has been mentioned.

Haider Ali (PW.15)

I recorded in my statement Ex.DE that Imran accused made fire shots at the deceased. Confronted with Ex.DE where only one fire shot is mentioned.

On the other hand, Ghulam Farid SI (PW.19) during cross- examination stated that he correctly recorded the statements of PWs. In this way, no question arises that any omission in recording the statements of eye-witnesses remained on part of the Investigating Officer. In this view of the matter, the omissions/improvements made by the afore-mentioned eye-witnesses rendered them unworthy of any credence as their credibility was compromised. In arriving at such conclusion, we are enlightened from the observation of Supreme Court of Pakistan expressed in case reported as Muhammad Arif v. The State (2019 SCMR 631) wherein it was held as under:-

“It is well established by now that when a witness improves his statement and moment it is observed that the said improvement was made dishonestly to strengthen the prosecution, such portion of his statement is to be discarded out of consideration. Having observed the improvements in the statements of both the witnesses of ocular account, we hold that it is not safe to rely on their testimony to maintain conviction and sentence of Muhammad Arif (appellant) on a capital charge.”

20.     The medical evidence in this case was furnished by Dr.Mushtaq Ahmad Veterinary Officer (PW.5), Dr.Nazeer Ahmad (PW.9) and Dr.Ali Hussain Syed (PW.10). Out of these three doctors, Dr.Nazeer Ahmad (PW.9) medically examined Muhammad Idrees (the then injured) along with five other injured persons. During the medical examination of Muhammad Idrees Dr.Nazeer Ahmad (PW.9) observed one firearm punctured wound measuring 1 cm x 1 cm on the left side of head just above the left ear. Contrarily, Dr.Ali Hussain Syed (PW.10) during autopsy of Muhammad Idrees (deceased) noted two firearm entry wounds each measuring 1 cm x 1 cm present on the left ear. On dissection, the doctor observed that there were two holes in the skull, corresponding to the both wounds. In this way, the medical evidence contradicts the ocular account whereby the single firearm injury from .30 bore pistol was attributed to Malik Muhammad Imran (appellant). In such scenario, the existence of second shot at the skull of the deceased which is not attributed to anybody casts a colossal doubt to the prosecution case. Reliance is placed on case reported as Abdul Jabbar and another v. The State (2019 SCMR 129) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan while dilating upon inconsistency between medical ocular evidence observed as under:-

“It is the settled principle of law that once a single loophole is observed in a case presented by the prosecution much less glaring conflict in the ocular account and medical evidence or for that matter where presence of eye-witnesses is not free from doubt, the benefit of such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution case automatically goes in favour of an accused.”

We have also noticed that as per record, Ashraf Ali complainant (PW.11) along with Akbar Ali PW and Idrees (the then injured) were referred to District Headquarter Teaching Hospital, Sahiwal for further treatment. From above, it is crystal clear that the above- mentioned three injured remained under treatment in the hospital of District Sahiwal but no record therefrom was produced nor any Medical Officer under whose supervision they remained admitted appeared in the dock to support the prosecution case. Moreover, the injuries of Ashraf Ali complainant and Akbar Ali were declared by Radiologist as 337-F(iii) and 337-F(v), PPC but no Radiologist was produced. It is settled that once Radiologist is not produced in proof of the x-ray report qua the declared injuries, the same cannot be used for maintaining the conviction of the accused. Reliance is placed upon case reported as Muhammad Bakhsh v. The State and others (1986 PCrLJ 2718) wherein it was held that:

“I further find that Radiologist has not been produced by the prosecution to prove the X-Ray report pertaining to the injuries of Ghulam Haider.”

21.     The case of the prosecution further falsified from the fact that as per prosecution case the shot fired by Malik Muhammad Imran (appellant) hit at the head of deceased. However, as stated above during postmortem examination of Muhammad Idrees (deceased) he was found in receipt of two firearm injuries and during postmortem examination two foreign bodies were recovered. Subsequent thereto, these two foreign bodies were dispatched to the office of PFSA and report (Exh.PAC) was received therefrom. The perusal of Exh.PAC shows that the afore-mentioned metallic pieces were not matched with the weapon recovered from Malik Muhammad Imran (appellant); relevant portion of Exh.PAC reads as under:

“Two metallic pieces were examined and found to be not suitable for caliber determination and comparison.”

22.     The motive set out in the FIR was that on 17.05.2017 Akbar Ali (PW.14) had purchased a piece of land measuring 21-Marlas from one Shah Ali due to which the accused-party had nourished grudge. In this regard, it is observed that though all the witnesses of ocular account stated in their statements regarding the motive part of the incident, however no documentary evidence was produced by the prosecution and besides that Shah Ali from whom Akbar Ali (PW.14) purchased the property in dispute was not associated during investigation nor he was produced during trial. This aspect was candidly admitted by Ghulam Farid SI/Investigating Officer (PW.19) during trial with the following words:

“Akbar Ali PW or the complainant did not produce before me any registered deed through which the house in dispute might have been purchased the house in question from Shah Ali for Rs. 35,00,000/-. Shah Ali did not join the investigation with me.”

From above, it can conveniently be held that prosecution could not prove its motive part of the case. It is well settled that once the motive is set up by the prosecution and the same is not proved, the prosecution shall suffer. Reliance in this context may be placed upon the case reported as Sarfraz and another v. The State (2023 SCMR 670) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:-

“It is now well established that if a specific motive has been alleged by the prosecution then it is duty of the prosecution to establish the said motive through cogent and confidence inspiring evidence. Otherwise, the same would go in favour of the accused.”

23.     For what has been discussed above, the prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against the appellants beyond scintilla of doubt. Needless to mention here that a single doubt creating circumstance is sufficient to form the basis of an acquittal. Reliance in this regard may be placed upon the cases reported as Tariq Parvez v. The State (1995 SCMR 1345), Muhammad Akram v. The State (2009 SCMR 230) and Muhammad Imran v. The State (2020 SCMR 857). In the latter cited judgment, the following observation was given by the Supreme Court of Pakistan:

“It is by now well settled that benefit of a single circumstance, deducible from the record, intriguing upon the integrity of prosecution case, is to be extended to the accused without reservation …..”

24.     Foregoing in view, Criminal Appeal No. 63397 of 2019, Criminal Appeal No. 1005 of 2019 and Criminal Appeal No. 1200 of 2019 are allowed. The convictions and sentences of appellants, namely Malik Muhammad Imran, Muhammad Shahid, Muhammad Yasin, Muhammad Adnan, Tariq, Yousaf, Iqbal alias Bali and Arshad alias Sohni are set-aside and they stand acquitted of the charges. Malik Muhammad Imran (appellant) is in jail; he shall be released forthwith if not required to be detained in any other case, whereas the remaining appellants are on bail and their sureties stand discharged from bail bonds. Resultantly, Murder Reference No. 134 of 2019 is answered in the NEGATIVE and death sentence awarded to Malik Muhammad Imran (convict) is NOT CONFIRMED.

25.     For the foregoing reasons, Criminal Revision No. 64108 of 2019 seeking enhancement of sentence of Malik Muhammad Imran, Muhammad Adnan and Muhammad Shahid (Respondents No. 1 to 3) has become infructuous which is hereby dismissed.

Judgment

Abher Gul Khan, J.--Muhammad Arshad (appellant) along with two co-accused, namely Muhammad Hayat & Ahmad Nawaz was tried by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Khushab in private complaint titled Muhammad Wazir v. Muhammad Hayat & 2 others (under Sections 302 & 34, PPC) which has arisen out of case FIR No. 7/2020 registered under Sections 302 & 34, PPC at Police Station Saddar Jauharabad. Trial Court vide judgment dated 24.02.2022 while acquitting the afore-mentioned two co-accused, convicted and sentenced the appellant as under:-

Under Section 302(b), PPC to suffer death sentence as ta’zir for committing qatl-i-amd of Muhammad Azam. He was also directed to pay compensation of Rs. 2,00,000/-in terms of 544-A, Cr.P.C. to the legal heirs of the deceased which was ordered to be recovered as arrears of land revenue and in default whereof to undergo simple imprisonment for 06-months.

Challenging his conviction and sentence Muhammad Arshad (appellant) filed Criminal Appeal No. 78244 of 2023, whereas Muhammad Wazir (complainant) preferred Criminal PSLA No. 19066 of 2022 against the acquittal of Muhammad Hayat & Ahmad Nawaz (Respondents No. 1 & 2). Likewise, trial Court forwarded a reference which was numbered as Murder Reference No. 53 of 2022 under Section 374, Cr.P.C. to seek confirmation or rejection of the death sentence imposed on the convict, Muhammad Arshad. All these matters are being decided through this single judgment.

2.       Succinctly stated the facts of the prosecution case as unfolded by Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) in FIR (Exh.CW.4/D) are that on 08.01.2020 at about 5:10 p.m., he along with Mehboob Azam and Javed Iqbal was going to Jamia Mosque Mastialanwala on foot from main Bazaar Hadali. Meanwhile Muhammad Azam crossed them on his motorcycle, who was also going to his house. When they reached behind Jamia Mosque Mastialanwala, Muhammad Hayat, Ahmad Nawaz and Muhammad Arshad all armed with .30 bore pistols arrived there. Muhammad Hayat raised Lalkara to take his revenge and made three successive fire shots from his .30 bore pistol which struck on the left side of chest, right side of chest and upon right elbow of Muhammad Azam. Subsequently, Muhammad Arshad made a fire shot which landed on the upper side of his abdominal area. Muhammad Azam fell on the ground in an injured condition. Then Ahmad Nawaz fired a shot from pistol .30 bore which hit Muhammad Azam upon his right buttock. The accused fled away while brandishing their weapons from the spot towards Southern street. The PWs attended Muhammad Azam but he succumbed to the injuries at the spot. The motive behind the occurrence was that on 16.02.2019 Umar Azam son of Muhammad Azam had caused a fire shot injury to Muhammad Hayat, pursuant to which a criminal case was registered against them.

3.       After the receipt of information about the incident, Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) along with his colleague police officials arrived at the place of occurrence, recorded the statement/Fard Bian (Exh.PA) of Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) and sent the same to the police station through Ameer Moavia 661/C for the registration of formal FIR. Subsequent thereto, he prepared injury statement (Exh.CW.6/H), inquest report (Exh.CW.6/I) and deputed Rehman Qadir 886/C for accompanying the dead body for autopsy. He also made photographs of the dead body as well as secured blood through cotton vide memo. Exh.PC. He collected six crime empties (P.1/1-6) through memo. Exh.PD. He also took into possession motorcycle (P.2) vide recovery memo. Exh.PE. He prepared un-scaled site plan (Exh.CW.6/J) of the place of occurrence. He arrested accused Muhammad Hayat and Muhammad Arshad on 09.02.2020. On 16.02.2020 Muhammad Arshad (appellant) made disclosure and in pursuance thereof led to the recovery of pistol .30 bore (C.9) along with two live bullets, which were taken into possession through memo. Exh.CW.5/G. In his investigation, two accused Muhammad Hayat and Ahmad Nawaz were not found involved in the case.

4.       Being dissatisfied with the mode of investigation, Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) filed private complaint upon which the trial was held. Prosecution in order to prove its case against the accused produced three witnesses, out of whom Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) and Javed Iqbal eye-witness (PW.2) narrated the ocular account. Trial Court also examined seven persons as Court witnesses, out of whom Ghulam Qasim SI (CW.6) investigated the case, whereas Dr. Imran Ahmad (CW.7) furnished the medical evidence. The remaining PW/CWs, more or less were formal in nature.

5.       Dr. Imran Ahmad (CW.7) on 08.01.2020 at about 9:30 p.m., conducted the autopsy over the dead body of Muhammad Azam and observed the following injuries:--

(1)      A lacerated penetrating wound 1 x 1 cm on left interior chest, 6 cm above left nipple. Margins of wound were inverted with collar of abrasion. There was corresponding hole in the Qameez. This was the wound of entry of firearm.

(2)      A lacerated penetrating wound 2 x 1 cm on left scapular region of posterior chest, 2 cm lateral to posterior midline. Margins of wound were everted. There was corresponding hole in the qameez, on probing it proved to be the exit of injury No. 1.

(3)      A lacerated penetrating wound 1 x .12 cm on right interior chest, 4 cm below right lateral part of clavicle. Margins of wound were inverted. There was corresponding hole in the qameez. This was the wound of entry of firearm.

(4)      A lacerated penetrating wound 1 x 1.4 cm on right upper arm, 6 cm below right shoulder. Margins of wound were everted. There was corresponding hole in qameez, on probing it proved to be the exit of the injury No. 3.

(5)      A lacerated penetrating wound 1 x 0.8 cm on right posterior lower arm. Margins of wound were inverted with collar of abrasion. There was corresponding hole in the qameez. This was the wound of entry of firearm.

(6)      A lacerated penetrating wound 1 x 1.2 cm on right lateral elbow. Margins of wound were everted. There was corresponding hole in the qameez, on probing it proved to be the exit of injury No. 5.

(7)      A lacerated penetrating wound 1 x 1 cm on interior abdominal wall, 5 cm above and left to umbilicus. Margins of wound were inverted with collar of abrasion. There was corresponding hole in the qameez. This was the wound of entry of firearm.

(8)      A lacerated penetrating wound 2 x 2 cm on 10 cm below to the inferior angle of left scapula. Margins of wound were everted. There was corresponding hole in the qameez, on probing it proved to be the exit of the injury No. 7.

(9)      A lacerated penetrating wound 1 x 1.3 cm on posterior lower abdominal wall, 4 cm right lateral to posterior midline. Margins of wound were inverted. There was corresponding hole in the qameez, on probing the probe reached the metallic foreign body present subcutaneously on anterolateral right lower chest, 7 cm below the right nipple. The metallic foreign body removed and duly sealed and handed over to the police.

(10)    A lacerated penetrating wound 1 x 0.8 cm on right upper lateral gluteal region. Margins of wound were inverted. There was corresponding hole in the shalwar, on probing the probe reached the metallic foreign body present in lateral side of hip-bone visible on x-ray of pelvis.

(11)    A lacerated penetrating wound 1 x 1 cm on right mid buttock. Margins of wound were inverted with collar of abrasion. There was corresponding hole in the shalwar, on probing the probe reached the metallic foreign body present in head of right femur visible on x-ray of pelvis.

According to the doctor injuries No. 1,2,7,8 and 9 were sufficient to cause death and besides that injuries No. 3,4,5,6, 10 & 11 were also held contributory to the death of the deceased. The doctor described the probable time between death and injury as immediate and between death and postmortem 5 to 7 hours.

6.       After the conclusion of prosecution evidence, Muhammad Arsahd (appellant) was examined under Section 342, Cr.P.C. during which he was asked the questions arising out of the prosecution evidence but he denied almost all those questions while pleading his innocence and false implication with the case. Appellant neither opted to make statement under Section 340(2), Cr.P.C., nor produced any evidence. However, the defence produced Asad Abbas as DW.1. On the conclusion of trial, the appellant was convicted and sentenced as afore-stated, hence the instant criminal appeal, Criminal PSLA and murder reference.

7.       Learned counsel for the appellant argued that as per record the FIR in this case seems to have been registered with promptitude but the same was managed in connivance with the local police. Both the eye-witnesses who appeared before the trial Court have failed to give any plausible reason for their presence at the eventful time. The appellant had no motive to take the life of the deceased. The medical evidence is in sharp contrast with the ocular account. Both the eye-witnesses in their Court statements made material contradictions which make them unworthy of any credence. The recovery of pistol at the instance of the appellant is foisted one as the same was affected in violation of Section 103, Cr.P.C. The motive set out in the FIR remained unproved, rather the same adversely affects the case of the prosecution. The two co-accused who were named in the FIR with the specific role of causing injuries to the deceased were acquitted by the trial Court so the same set of evidence cannot be used against the appellant. It was thus urged by the learned counsel that since many doubts are arising out of the prosecution case, hence the appellant is entitled to clean acquittal.

8.       Conversely, learned law officer well assisted by learned counsel for the complainant came forward with the submissions that it was a promptly lodged FIR wherein the appellant is specifically named with the role of causing firearm injury to the deceased. The eye-witnesses while appearing before the trial Court gave a trustworthy and confidence inspiring ocular account. The medical evidence supports the ocular account. The motive set out in the FIR further implicates the appellant in the commission of crime. The positive report of PFSA by virtue of which the weapon recovered from the appellant matched with the crime empties secured from the spot on the day of crime, is another factor to implicate the appellant in this case. In these circumstances, learned complainant’s counsel prayed that since the prosecution case qua the appellant is foul proof, hence he does not deserve any leniency and besides that the acquitted accused be also convicted and sentenced appropriately keeping in view the existence of confidence inspiring evidence.

9.       Arguments heard. Record perused.

10.     It evinces from the perusal of the record that the case in hand is emanating from an incident having taken place on 08.01.2020 at about 5:10 p.m. near Jamia Mosque Mastialanwala situated at a distance of 9-kilometers from Police Station Saddar Jauharabad. The information of crime was reported to the police by Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) through Fard Bian/statement (Exh.PA) made before Ghulam Qasim SI (CW.6) upon his arrival at the spot at about 6:30 p.m. on the eventful day and FIR (Exh.CW.4/D) was chalked out at 7:05 p.m. In this way, FIR (Exh.CW.4/D) in this case seems to have been registered within two hours which is portrayed by the prosecution in a way to establish the fact that such prompt reporting of crime excludes all hypotheses of concocting of facts and fabricating of false story. No doubt, in our criminal judicial system, FIR is a crucial document and its prompt registration is generally considered more reliable which is less likely to be influenced by embellishments or afterthoughts. However, in the instant case we have minutely perused the available record and found that the FIR (Exh.CW.4/D) was not registered at the time and manner canvassed by the prosecution. According to the inquest report (Exh.CW.6/I) Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) received information regarding the happening of crime at 5:10 p.m. on 08.01.2020 who during cross-examination also stated that he arrived at the place of occurrence in pursuance of call on ‘15’ at 5:30 p.m. i.e. within twenty minutes of the occurrence, However, astonishingly the statement/Fard Bian (Exh.PA) of Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) was recorded by Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) at 6:30 p.m. From the narration of facts mentioned hereinabove, it can easily be gathered that Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) reduced into writing the statement of the complainant after one hour of his reaching at the spot and in this regard the prosecution failed to give any satisfactory explanation. Thus, we feel no reluctance in holding that one hour time was spent to arrange witnesses who got registered FIR (Exh.CW.4/D) after deliberation while specifying the role of each accused as per their choice. Even otherwise, the question as to what task Ghulam Qasim SI (CW.6) kept on performing after his arrival at the crime scene is shrouded in mystery and makes the case of the prosecution highly doubtful putting this Court at guard to appraise the case of an accused on the charge of capital sentence with cautious approach. Reliance is placed upon the case reported as Ghulam Abbas and another v. The State and another (2021 SCMR 23) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan while dealing with a criminal case reported with delay held as under:

“No explanation whatsoever was furnished by the complainant for this delay in reporting the crime to the police. Hameed Ullah Khan SI (PW.15) who investigated the case during his cross-examination that he reached at the place of occurrence at about 5.00 a.m. and he had completed the police proceedings by 06.30 p.m. In the circumstances, chances of deliberations and consultations before reporting the matter to the Police cannot be ruled out.”

11.     It is also a matter of record that during the course of investigation, out of total three accused, two namely Muhammad Hayat (since acquitted) and Ahmad Nawaz (since acquitted) were found not involved in the case and in consequence thereof Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) had to file a private complaint (Exh.PB) upon which the trial was held. During trial, the tale of occurrence was brought on record through Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) and Javed Iqbal eye-witness (PW.2). As regards Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1), he was the father of Muhammad Azam (deceased). So far as, Javed Iqbal eye-witness (PW.2) is concerned, though he was not closely related with the deceased but claims to have close tie with him. Since the details of occurrence are mentioned in para-2 above, hence there is no compelling reason to recapitulate the same here. To be precise as per FIR (Exh.CW.4/D) at the relevant time Muhammad Hayat (since acquitted) raised Lalkara to take his revenge and fired three successive shots from his pistol .30 bore which hit on the left side of chest, right side of chest and upon right elbow of Muhammad Azam (deceased). Muhammad Arshad (appellant) was ascribed the role of firing .30 bore pistol shot which landed on the upper side of abdominal area of Muhammad Azam (deceased), whereas the blame of causing firearm injury with pistol .30 bore at the right buttock of Muhammad Azam (deceased) is attributed to Ahmad Nawaz (since acquitted). The scrutiny of the eye-witness account also raises doubts about the sequence of the shooting involving Muhammad Hayat (since acquitted) and Muhammad Arshad (appellant), as well as who shot whom, was not established from the testimonies of Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6), Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) and Javed Iqbal eye-witness (PW.2). Learned counsel for the complainant cross-examined Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) and during cross-examination, he admitted that:

“In investigation, it was found that two sisters of Muhammad Hayat were married to two brothers of Muhammad Azam deceased.”

Contrary to the above, Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1), father of Muhammad Azam (deceased) and a close relative of Muhammad Hayat (since acquitted), was unable to state that Muhammad Hayat suffered a head injury and had undergone treatment, remained admitted at the hospital, and was discharged on 10.01.2020. This is evident when considering Ex.CW.5/E, which shows that Muhammad Hayat (since acquitted) was admitted at the DHQ Teaching Hospital Sargodha on 07.01.2020 and discharged on 10.01.2020. Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) deposed during cross-examination that:

“It was the version of accused Hayat that he was admitted in the hospital at the time of occurrence. I verified the factum of Hayat’s admission in the hospital DHQ, Sargodha at the time of occurrence and collected discharge slip and other relevant papers. According to my investigation, accused Hayat was admitted in DHQ Hospital, Sargodha at the time of occurrence.”

The sequence of the shots allegedly fired by the accused, as reported by Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1), was not found established by the prosecution evidence.”

12.     We have further noticed that according to statement of Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) he along with police officials came at the spot pursuant to ‘15’ call and despite careful scrutiny we have not come across the name of the person who informed the police. Similarly, no record from 15-Call Centre was placed either during investigation or at trial stage. Had the record pertaining to 15-Call Centre been placed on record, the actual facts of the prosecution case would have easily been brought on the file. Furthermore, Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) stated during cross-examination that when the occurrence took place the time was not of any prayer and besides that he failed to give any plausible explanation for his being present at the spot. This stance was admitted by Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) with the following words:-

“I did not mention any specific reason for going to mosque Mastialanwala. At the time of occurrence it was not a prayer time.”

Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) during cross-examination also admitted that the residence of Javed Iqbal eye-witness (PW.2) is situated at a considerable distance from the place of occurrence. Similarly, Javed Iqbal eye-witness (PW.2) while appearing before the trial Court deposed that his residence is situated at a distance of half kilometer from the place of occurrence. Javed Iqbal eye-witness (PW.2) further admitted that “I did not mention any reason in my statement under Section 161, Cr.P.C. for my presence on the spot at the relevant time.” The absence of both the eye-witnesses at the spot can further be verified from the fact that according to inquest report (Exh.CW.6/I), Muhammad Azam (deceased) was identified by Rab Nawaz (given up PW) and Muhammad Bashir (PW.3). In this way, the case of the prosecution that both the eye-witnesses saw the incident falls on the ground. The non-identifying the dead body by the eye-witnesses, leads this Court to the conclusion that had they been present at the place of occurrence or accompanied the deceased to the hospital, they would have definitely identified him and such aspect makes the case of the prosecution highly doubtful. Reliance is placed upon the case reported as Iftikhar Hussain alias Kharoo v. The State (2024 SCMR 1449) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:

“This fact also finds corroboration from the fact that perusal of postmortem report and inquest report reveal that dead body was brought to hospital at 11:00 PM by the Police and was identified by the Yasir Abbas and Ali Raza (PW.14). Thus, eye-witnesses were also not the ones who had identified the dead body of the deceased at the time of the postmortem report. In absence of physical proof qua presence of the witnesses at the crime scene, the same cannot be relied upon.”

All the facts and circumstances mentioned above accumulatively are sufficient to show that it was an unseen occurrence and an effort has been made by the prosecution to implicate the appellant through planted eye-witnesses.

13.     A wade through the medical evidence furnished by Dr. Imran Ahmad (CW.7) unfolds that Muhammad Azam (deceased) was in receipt of eleven injuries, out of which seven were firearm entry wounds. Needless to mention here that the numerical strength of the injuries noticed by the doctor on one hand negates the case of the prosecution and on other hand does not coincide with the number of assailants. As stated above, three injuries were attributed to Muhammad Hayat (since acquitted) and one was ascribed to Ahmad Nawaz (since acquitted), whereas Muhammad Arshad (appellant) was saddled with the role of causing one firearm injury on the person of the deceased. Since the prosecution case was disbelieved to the extent of two co-accused to whom the effective role in the incident had been assigned and the reasons given by this Court in the preceding paras also create a reasonable doubt qua the guilt of the appellant therefore depending on the medical evidence alone to maintain appellant’s conviction would be unsafe. It is also an established principle of law that medical evidence serves as a form of corroborative evidence, which can validate the prosecution’s account concerning the location and type of injury, the weapon involved in the incident, and the time elapsed between death and postmortem, but does not reveal the identity of the murderer. Reference is made to the cases reported as Muhammad Tasaweer v. Hafiz Zulkarnain and 2 others (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 53) and Altaf Hussain v. Fakhar Hussain and another (2008 SCMR 1103). The relevant extract from the former cited case is being reproduced hereunder:

“It is also settled law that medical evidence may confirm the ocular evidence with regard to the seat of injury, nature of the injury, kind of weapon used in the occurrence but it would not connect the accused with the commission of the crime.”

14.     In order to seek any further corroboration, we examined the motive aspect of the prosecution’s case and found that at the time of registration of FIR (Exh.CW.4/D), in the private complaint (Exh.PB), and throughout the trial, a specific motive was presented. According to this, on 16.02.2019, Umer Azam, son of Muhammad Azam, fired a pistol shot at Muhammad Hayat, for which both Umer Azam and Muhammad Azam were challaned. In this context, we noted that the motive was ascribed to Muhammad Hayat (since acquitted) and not to the appellant. Muhammad Wazir complainant (PW.1) during cross-examination admitted that “Arshad accused had no previous litigation with us.” Similarly, Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) during the course of his evidence further made it clear that “Arshad accused had no personal enmity with the deceased Muhammad Azam”. It goes without saying that the motive sometimes supports the prosecution’s case and frequently serves as a major reason for the false implication of an accused, making it consistently regarded as a double-edged sword. Guidance may be sought from the case reported as Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu v. The State (2019 SCMR 652), wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:

“The motive is always a double-edged weapon. The complainant Sultan Ahmad (PW9) has admitted murder enmity between the parties and has also given details of the same in his statement recorded before the trial Court. No doubt, previous enmity can be a reason for the appellant to commit the alleged crime, but it can equally be a reason for the complainant side to falsely implicate the appellant in this case for previous grouse.”

15.     It further evinces from the perusal of the record that on 16.02.2020 after his arrest Muhammad Arshad (appellant) led the police party to his house and got recovered pistol .30 bore (C.9) and two live bullets (C.10/1-2) which were taken into possession vide memo. Exh.CW.5/G. Likewise, on the day of occurrence, Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) visited the spot and took into possession six crime empties (P.1/1-6) vide memo. Exh.PD. Both the parcels i.e. Exh.CW.5/G and Exh.PD were received in the office of PFSA on 14.01.2020 and 19.02.2020 respectively. According to the PFSA report (Exh.PG), the five crime empties secured from the spot matched with the weapon recovered from the appellant. However, positive report of PFSA (Exh.PG) loses its importance when seen in the context that columns No. 22 & 23 of inquest report according to which no crime empty was recovered from the place of occurrence. From this aspect, it can conveniently be concluded that no crime empty was secured from the spot and apparently the same were planted by the police so as to knit the evidence for corroborating the statements of eye-witnesses. Reliance may be placed upon the case reported as Mansab Ali and another v. The State (2024 PCrLJ 617) wherein the following observation was given:

“Furthermore, in column No. 23 of the Inquest Report (Ex.CW9/D) no crime empty has been shown present there, albeit in the recovery memo. (Ex.PF) and in the site plan (Ex.CW11/A), these empties have been shown recovered lying very close to the dead body of the deceased. This deliberate omission, creates reasonable doubt about the recovery.”

Furthermore .30 bore pistol and two live bullets recovered at the pointing out of Muhammad Arshad (appellant) were sealed in a parcel, and if this parcel was submitted to the PFSA office, it should have been noted in the report that the parcel contained two live bullets also, which are not indicated in the report. It has also been noted that Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) received parcels containing six crime empties and a pistol on 13.01.2020 and 18.02.2020, but he submitted them to the PFSA office on 14.01.2020 and 19.02.2020, respectively. A one-day delay in depositing the afore-mentioned parcels, indicates that their secure handling has been jeopardized, rendering the recovery inconsequential. Reliance is placed upon the cases reported as Muhammad Saleem v. Shabbir Ahmed and others (2016 SCMR 1605) and Kamal Din alias Kamala v. The State (2018 SCMR 577). For advantage sake a relevant portion from the former cited judgment is reproduced hereunder:

“…… It had never been proved before the trial Court that the weapon of offence had been kept in the Mal Khana safely after its recovery and its dispatch to the Forensic Science Laboratory was also not proved by any witness.”

16.     This Court has also taken notice of the fact that in his examination under Section 342, Cr.P.C. Muhammad Arshad (appellant) took a specific stance that he was falsely implicated in the instant case and the felony mentioned in the FIR was committed by one Asad Abbas upon the asking of Tiwana family who had hired him for the very purpose. This very plea was taken by the appellant in response to question “why this case is against you and why the PWs have deposed against you”, which for reference sake is mentioned below:

“Complainant falsely involved me in this case. In fact occurrence was committed by Asad Abbas who was hired by Tiwana family which was inimical to the deceased. PWs deposed falsely against me.”

In addition to above, the accused-side also produced Asad Abbas as DW.1, who stated that Munir Tiwana was his friend who sustained fire shot injuries at the hands of Umar Azam son of Muhammad Azam and that he committed the murder of Muhammad Azam at the behest of Munir Tiwana. It has also been noted by us that at the time of arrest of Muhammad Arshad (appellant) on 09.02.2020 his first version was recorded by Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) wherein Muhammad Arshad (appellant) stated that he was present at the spot empty handed while murder of Muhammad Azam was committed by one Asad Abbas. This fact even was admitted by Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) during his cross-examination with the following words:

“I recorded first version of accused Arshad that I was present on the spot empty handed while murder of deceased Muhammad Azam was committed by Asad Abbas P.O. in another case.”

Since the prosecution failed to prove its case against Muhammad Arshad (appellant) beyond scintilla of doubt, there is no need to dilate upon the plea taken by him. Needless to mention here that the plea so taken by the appellant at the time of his arrest being admissible in evidence in terms of Article 27 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, also creates a reasonable doubt in the credibility of the prosecution case. Reliance is placed upon the cases reported as Najaf Ali Shah v. The State (2021 SCMR 736) and Qaisarullah and others v. The State (2009 SCMR 579). The relevant portion of the former reported judgment for advantage sake is reproduced hereunder:

“The first plea of the petitioner, which was not taken into consideration by the Courts below, being admissible evidence under Article 27 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 carries weight wherein he has categorically denied the allegations leveled against him.”

17.     In the aftermath of afore-mentioned discussion, we conclude that prosecution failed to fulfill its obligation in substantiating the case against the appellant beyond scintilla of doubt. It goes without saying that if any uncertainty/lacuna arises from the prosecution’s case, there is no justification for denying its benefit solely on the basis of the gravity of the case. Based on established principles for evaluating evidence, the premium of every reasonable doubt is to be extended to the accused which can best be extended via verdict of acquittal. Reliance is placed upon the case reported as Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 1048) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:

“… The rule of benefit of doubt, which is described as the golden rule, is essentially a rule of prudence which cannot be ignored while dispensing justice in accordance with law. It is based on the maxim, “it is better that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted”.

18.     Consequently, we allow Criminal Appeal No. 78244 of 2023 while giving benefit of doubt in favour of Muhammad Arshad (appellant); his conviction and sentence are set-aside and he stands acquitted of the charge. Muhammad Arshad (appellant) is in custody; he be released forthwith if not required to be detained in any other criminal case. Resultantly, Murder Reference No. 53 of 2022 is answered in the NEGATIVE and death sentence awarded to Muhammad Arshad (convict) is NOT CONFIRMED.

19.     Insofar as Criminal PSLA No. 19066 of 2022 is concerned, we have noticed that Muhammad Hayat (Respondent No. 1) though was named in the FIR (Exh.CW.4/D) with the specific role of raising Lalkara and causing three pistol shot injuries to Muhammad Azam (deceased) hitting him on the left side of chest, right side of chest and upon right elbow, however during the course of investigation he took the plea of alibi by stating that at the time of incident he was admitted at DHQ Teaching Hospital, Sargodha. The plea so taken by Muhammad Hayat (Respondent No. 1) was verified by the Investigating Officer, namely Ghulam Qasim SI (CW.6). He collected discharge slip and other relevant documents (Exh.CW.5/E) in arriving at the conclusion that Muhammad Hayat (Respondent No. 1) was admitted in DHQ, Teaching Hospital Sargodha at the eventful time. As regards Ahmad Nawaz (Respondent No. 2), we have observed that during investigation he was not found involved in the occurrence and to his extent Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) pronounced declaration of innocence. We are not oblivious of the fact that that the opinion of the police cannot solely be made basis for deciding the fate of a case. However, if such opinion is based on some convincing material then there is every good reason to consider it along with other factors for deciding a criminal case. Investigating Officer is the person, who visits the crime scene immediately after the


occurrence, records the statements of the witnesses, interacts with numerous other persons who for various reasons opt to stay away from the case and then forms an opinion. For the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that since the opinion expressed by Ghulam Qasim SI/Investigating Officer (CW.6) was not favourable to the prosecution, hence its benefit was legitimately extended to the respondents. In this regard reference may be made to the case reported as Nazir v. The State (NLR 2002 Criminal 265) wherein the following observation was given:

“No doubt, the opinion expressed by the police has no proof of innocence or guilt of accused yet the factum of impact of such an opinion cannot be thrown away to wind altogether.”

Further reliance on the subject can also be placed upon the law laid down in the cases reported as Altaf Hussain and four others v. The State (NLR 2000 Criminal 232), Zulqarnain v. The State (PLD 1994 FSC 34) and Ashiq Ali v. The State (NLR 1996 Criminal 544).

20.     In the said circumstances, the learned trial Court rightly acquitted Muhammad Hayat and Ahmad Nawaz (Respondent No. 1 & 2). Even otherwise, it is well settled proposition of law that when a Court of competent jurisdiction passes the judgment of acquittal on the basis of cogent grounds, the same is not to be disturbed in a mechanical manner. In order to set-aside the judgment of acquittal, it is to be proved that the judgment of acquittal is arbitrary, fanciful, perverse and contrary to record. An accused on the judgment of acquittal acquires a verdict of innocence hence it is to be disturbed in exceptional and extraordinary circumstances. Reliance is placed upon the cases reported as Mst. Anwar Begum v. Akhtar Hussain alias Kaka and 2 others (2017 SCMR 1710) and Raja Khurram Ali Khan and 2 others v. Tayyaba Bibi and another (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 146). Resultantly, the instant Criminal PLSA has no merits and is hereby dismissed.

Judgment

Ishtiaq Ibrahim, J.--Through this Jail Petition, the petitioner/convict, Zakir Ali, has called in question the legality and propriety of the judgment dated 26.06.2023 passed by the learned High Court of Balochistan, Quetta, whereby appeal filed by the petitioner against his conviction and sentence recorded by the learned Special Judge CNS/Sessions Judge, Sariab, Quetta in case FIR No. 180/2021 dated 5.1.2021 registered under Section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 (CNSA), was dismissed, thereby maintaining his conviction and sentence.

2.       The petitioner was tried for possessing 1800 grams of Methamphetamine (commonly known as “Ice”) allegedly recovered from his possession on 05.12.2021. After a full-dress trial, the learned Trial Court vide judgment dated 31.05.2023, convicted the petitioner under Section 9(c) of the CNSA and sentenced him to nine years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 100,000/-, and in default thereof, to undergo one month simple imprisonment. The benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C., was, however, extended to him. The said conviction and sentence were upheld by the learned High Court dismissing the petitioner’s appeal, hence the instant petition.

3.       The prosecution’s case as per FIR is that upon receipt of spy information qua presence of the petitioner at Zamindar Street Shahji Chowk dealing in the detestable business of narcotics, on 05.12.2021 Attiq-ur-Rehman SHO (PW-2), who, while patrolling with other police officials reached the spot and at 12.10. a.m apprehended the petitioner. He allegedly recovered 1800 grams of Methamphetamine contained in two plastic boxes from possession of the petitioner. From each box, he separated 10 grams as samples for chemical analysis by the FSL and sealed the same in parcels (Nos. 1 & 2), while the remaining quantity was sealed by him in parcels 1-A &
2-A. He drafted Murasila and sent the same to Police Station on the basis of which FIR (ibid) was registered against the petitioner.

4.       We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State and perused the record as well as evidence on record.

5.       A careful analysis of the testimonies of the prosecution’s witnesses, especially, Attiq-ur-Rehman SHO (PW-2)/the Seizing Officer, Muhammad Ali Moharrir (PW.3) and Nadar Khan ASI (PW.5)/the Investigating Officer reveal material gaps and contradictions regarding the safe custody and transmission of the recovered substance from the spot to the Police Station and then samples to the FSL. It is noteworthy that police official Hassan Ali, who allegedly conveyed the murasila and case property to the Police Station on the basis of which FIR was registered, was neither cited nor examined as a witness. The non-production of Hassan Ali, is a serious blow the prosecution ‘s case as in absence of his statement, there is no other evidence to prove safe transmission of the cases property and samples from the spot to the Police Station. The Seizing Officer/ complainant did not mention in his statement or in his cross-examination the specific act of sending the narcotics to the Police Station or to the FSL. Muhammad Ali Moharrir (PW.3), admitted that the parcels were handed to him by the Investigating Officer without the issuance of any receipt and did not produce Register No. 19 on record. Nadar Khan ASI/I.O., failed to mention the name of the person through whom the samples were sent to the FSL, although the FSL report mentions his own name. He also admitted not recording the statements of key persons under Section 161, Cr.P.C., and failed to exhibit any documentary trail evidencing a secure chain of custody of the samples from the spot to the FSL. The law by now is well-settled that in narcotics cases, due to the severity of punishment involved, the prosecution must establish an unbroken, secure, and reliable chain of custody of the recovered contraband from the point of seizure to its receipt at the forensic laboratory. Any lacuna or discrepancy in this regard renders the entire process suspect and the report of the chemical examiner inadmissible or at the very least unreliable. The importance of maintaining a meticulously documented chain of custody has been emphasized in several authoritative pronouncements of this Court, particularly in cases of “Javed Iqbal v. The State” (2023 SCMR 139) “Qaiser Khan v. The State” (2021 SCMR 363) “Mst. Sakina Ramzan v. The State” (2021 SCMR 451) “Zubair Khan v. The State” (2021 SCMR 492) “Asif Ali and another v. The State” (2024 SCMR 1408). In Javed Iqbal’s case (supra), this Court held that “It is the duty of the prosecution to establish each and every step from the stage of recovery, making of sample parcels, safe custody of sample parcels and safe transmission of the sample parcels to the concerned laboratory. This chain has to be established by the prosecution and if any link is missing in such like offences, the benefit must be extended to the accused”. The sanctity of the chain of custody serves as the linchpin of evidentiary reliability in narcotics prosecutions. Where the prosecution fails to conclusively establish the movement and security of narcotic samples at every stage, from the point of recovery to chemical analysis, the benefit of such material lapses must be extended


to the accused, in line with the fundamental principle that in case of doubt, the benefit must go to the accused. In case titled, “Abdul Ghani and others vs the State and others” (PLJ 2019 SC (Cr.C) 462) this Court, without discussing the merits of the case, on the sole ground of missing chain of safe transmission of the samples from the spot till receipt in the FSL and non-production of the relevant witnesses in whose custody the samples remained, acquitted the convict/appellant by setting aside the concurrent findings of the two Courts below. Relevant paragraph of the judgment (supra) is reproduced below for the sake of convenience and ready reference.

6.       In the case at hand, the prosecution has manifestly failed to discharge this burden. The unexplained and undocumented transmission of samples, non­ examination of key witnesses, failure to produce chain-of-custody registers, and contradictory statements of the prosecution witnesses cumulatively cast a serious doubt on the integrity of the evidence. Consequently, the chemical examiner’s report becomes unsafe to rely upon and cannot be made the sole basis for conviction.

17.     In view of the foregoing discussion the learned Courts below have erred in law while recording conviction of the petitioner thereby totally oversighting the law settled by this Court. Consequently, the instant petition is converted in to an appeal and the same is allowed. The impugned judgments passed by the learned Trial Court and the learned High, are set aside. The appellant is acquitted of the charge leveled against him. He shall be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in any other case.

2025 SCMR 1380
TYPES OF CONFESSION.
-----------------------
As per the law of confession in Pakistan, it recognizes two types of confessions; one being the extra-judicial confession and the second being the judicial confession. It is pertinent to mention that both confessions have a distinct evidentiary value, the former constitutes a weak piece of evidence unless corroborated with strong piece of evidence as held in Imran Case, that the extra-judicial confession was not sufficient for recording conviction on a capital charge unless it was strongly corroborated by tangible evidence coming from unimpeachable source, for the very reason that it may be deposed in front of any person, of any locality, any profession, and even any character, but it is upon the Judge, whether he believes in the existence of the occurrence and veracity of the version as deposed in the extra-judicial confession. Conceptual (naeem)analysis of Article 2(4), Qanun-eShahadat, 1984 shows that in order to prove a fact asserted by a party, it does not require a perfect proof of facts, as it is very rare to have an absolute certainty on facts. This provision sets the standard of a prudent man for determining the probative effect of evidence under the circumstances of the particular case. The judicial consensus that has evolved over time is that the standard of 'preponderance of probability' is applicable in civil cases, the standard of 'proof beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases, and the in-between standard of clear and convincing proof in civil cases involving allegations of a criminal nature. All these three standards are, in fact, three different degrees of probability, which cannot be expressed in mathematical terms, and are to be evaluated under the circumstances of particular case, as provided in clause (4) of Article 2 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, and observed in Salamat Case.

The latter, which is in the instant case is the judicial confession, that is attributed with a high degree of confidence Ipso Facto, as it is recorded by a Judicial officer in a court in consonance with Section 164 and 364 of the Cr.P.C. and it is commonly relied upon for maintaining conviction by the superior courts of Pakistan. Reference in this regard can be plethora of judgments in Pakistan.

It is to be noted that a different view also exists in criminal law, that as far as confessional statement of one accused is concerned, it may be taken into consideration against the other accused persons if the confession substantially implicates the maker himself, to the same extent as the other accused persons against whom it is sought to be taken into consideration. However, this cannot (naeem)be considered as a prevailing view in our opinion and it would be sufficient when the accused attributes to himself even a minor role, which is different from other coaccused, it will still be acceptable if by confessing to that minor role, it leads to the maker’s incrimination in the case. The position, however, would be different and confession would not be acceptable, where while making the alleged confession, an attempt is made by the maker of it to (naeem)throw the blame on the other accused persons, making himself a mere unwilling spectator, in this regard reliance is placed on numerous judgments of India.

Judgment

Salahuddin Panhwar, J.--These appeals have been filed by the appellants, against the judgment dated December 20, 2016, passed by the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad, in Criminal Appeals No. 13 & 19 of 2011 and M.R. No. 10/2011. The appeals in the High Court challenged the judgment dated February 1st, 2011, rendered by the Additional Sessions Judge, Islamabad, in Sessions Case No. 28 of 2007, wherein the appellants were convicted under multiple Sections of the Pakistan Penal Code, specifically Sections 302 and 396, resulting in the death penalty and a fine of Rs. 100,000 each; failure to pay this fine would lead to two months of simple imprisonment. They were also convicted under Section 460, which resulted in life imprisonment and an additional fine of Rs. 100,000 each, with the same default penalty of two months’ simple imprisonment. The charge under Section 400 was not proven, leading to their acquittal. Each appellant was ordered to pay Rs. 200,000 to the legal heirs of the deceased, with a default penalty of six months’ simple imprisonment. Leave to appeal was granted to the appellants, and the Jail Petitions as well as the criminal petition was converted into Criminal Appeal vide Order dated 11.01.2021.

2.       The prosecution’s case asserts that on May 14, 2007, the complainant, Syed Amjad Ali Mashahdi, lodged FIR No. 167/2007 at Police Station Shalimar, Islamabad. In his statement, he reported that at approximately 4:15 a.m., four individuals entered his home, tied his and his wife’s hands, and one of them shot his son, Syed Hamad Raza, Additional Registrar, Supreme Court of Pakistan, who later succumbed to his injury. It is pertinent to mention that the record reflects dacoity involving jewelry as well as mobile phone and watch. The complainant identified the appellants during the identification parade conducted before the Magistrate. Subsequently, the trial Court convicted the appellants of the aforementioned offences and imposed the sentences outlined in the introductory paragraph. The appellants challenged their conviction and sentences before the Islamabad High Court, which dismissed their appeals vide judgment dated December 20, 2016.

3.       The learned counsel for the appellants argued that the prosecution failed to prove the specific role of each appellant in the murder of Syed Hamad Raza; that the appellants were not identified by the complainant during the investigation, and their identification during the identification parade before the Magistrate was not reliable; that the medical evidence and recovery of weapons were not sufficient to connect the appellants with the commission of the offence; that no motive was proved by the prosecution through any cogent evidence.

4.       The learned Deputy Prosecutor General countered that the prosecution had established the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt; that the identification of the appellants by the complainant during the identification parade before the Magistrate, corroborated by the ocular evidence, recoveries, and statement under Section 164, Cr.P.C. of the appellant Mir Muhammad Afzal; that the medical evidence and recoveries had sufficiently supported and corroborated the ocular account against the appellants.

5.       After meticulous evaluation of the arguments advanced by the learned counsel and a thorough appraisal of the record, this Court is satisfied that the prosecution has established the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. The ocular testimony, corroborated by the identification of the appellants during the trial and the identification parade, recovery of incriminating weapons, the confessional statement recorded under Section 164, Cr.P.C., made by the appellant Mir Muhammad Afzal, collectively form a cogent and reliable body of evidence linking the appellants to the commission of the offence. Furthermore, the medical evidence, coupled with the forensic examination and positive report of the recovered weapon by the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), supports and reinforces the ocular account, thereby eliminating any reasonable doubt as to the involvement of the appellants. It is pertinent to mention that, the medical evidence establishes that the deceased, Syed Hammad Raza, sustained a single fatal injury on his skull, this important fact will be addressed in the latter part of this judgment.

6.       In the present case, the judicial confession of the appellant Mir Muhammad Afzal, is available on record in the form of Section 164, Cr.P.C., in which the said appellant narrates the occurrence and gives an inculpatory confessional statement which involved the role of all co-accused persons, who are the present appellants in the instant case. At this juncture, we cannot resist to shed light on confessions in criminal law. The Black’s Law Dictionary defines confession, as a criminal suspect’s oral or written acknowledgment of guilt, often including details about the crime.[1] Apart from the dictionary meaning, writers like John H. Wigmore defined confession as “an acknowledgment in express words, by the accused in a criminal case, of the truth of the main fact charged or of some essential part of it.”[2] To make it more simple it is the admission of the accused regarding the commission of the offence.

7.       Coming to the evidentiary value of the confession, as per the law of confession in Pakistan, it recognizes two types of confessions; one being the extra-judicial confession and the second being the judicial confession. It is pertinent to mention that both confessions have a distinct evidentiary value, the former constitutes a weak piece of evidence unless corroborated with strong piece of evidence as held in Imran Case,[3] that the extra-judicial confession was not sufficient for recording conviction on a capital charge unless it was strongly corroborated by tangible evidence coming from unimpeachable source, for the very reason that it may be deposed in front of any person, of any locality, any profession, and even any character, but it is upon the Judge, whether he believes in the existence of the occurrence and veracity of the version as deposed in the extra-judicial confession. Conceptual analysis of Article 2(4), Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 shows that in order to prove a fact asserted by a party, it does not require a perfect proof of facts, as it is very rare to have an absolute certainty on facts. This provision sets the standard of a prudent man for determining the probative effect of evidence under the circumstances of the particular case. The judicial consensus that has evolved over time is that the standard of ‘preponderance of probability’ is applicable in civil cases, the standard of ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases, and the in-between standard of clear and convincing proof in civil cases involving allegations of a criminal nature. All these three standards are, in fact, three different degrees of probability, which cannot be expressed in mathematical terms, and are to be evaluated under the circumstances of particular case, as provided in clause (4) of Article 2 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, and observed in Salamat Case.[4]

The latter, which is in the instant case is the judicial confession, that is attributed with a high degree of confidence Ipso Facto, as it is recorded by a Judicial officer in a Court in consonance with Section 164 and 364 of the, Cr.P.C. and it is commonly relied upon for maintaining conviction by the superior Courts of Pakistan. Reference in this regard can be plethora of judgments in Pakistan.[5]

8.       The Judicial confessional statement of the appellant Mir Muhammad Afzal, is recognized by law as against the other co-accused as circumstantial evidence, under Article 43 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984, which is reproduced below:

“43.  Consideration of proved confession affecting person making it and others jointly under trial for same offence:

When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence and a confession made by one of such persons is proved,--

(a)    such confession shall be proof against the person, making it and;

(b)    the Court may take into consideration such confession as circumstantial evidence against such other person.”

Hence, the law of the land itself allows the consideration of such statement as circumstantial evidence against the other co-accused, in addition to that the sub-continental precedent of India has reasoned the jurisprudence behind this provision, Article 43 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 is Pari Materia to the Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act 1872, regarding which the Court held in Emperor v. Daii Norsu and Govinda Nath[6] that the logic behind such a provision cannot be ignored as “when a person admits guilt to the fullest extent and exposes himself to the pain and penalties provided for the guilt, there is a guarantee for his truth”. The confessional statement of the co-accused, wherein he has implicated both himself and the other accused, may also be considered a relevant circumstance against the convict in terms of Article 43 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984. This provision lays down that when two or more persons are jointly tried for the same offence, and a confession made by one of them is duly proved, the Court may take such confession into consideration as circumstantial evidence against the others. Reliance is placed on the dictum laid down by this Court in Khurrum Malik Case.[7]

9.       Indian Courts have held that the rule laid down in Section 30 of Indian Evidence Act 1872, must be construed strictly. All that is necessary for a confession to be admissible against a co-accused is that the maker should inculpate himself in all the offences in which he implicates the other co-accused and it is not necessary that he should ascribe to himself as a major part in the confession of the crime as he ascribes to the other co-accused. Even if the maker implicates him only in an attempt to commit, or in the abetment of, the offence, or a minor part in the commission of the offence, the admissibility of the confession against the other accused is not affected, reference in this regard is placed on Mohammad Sabir Case.[8]

10.     It is to be noted that a different view also exists in criminal law, that as far as confessional statement of one accused is concerned, it may be taken into consideration against the other accused persons if the confession substantially implicates the maker himself, to the same extent as the other accused persons against whom it is sought to be taken into consideration. However, this cannot be considered as a prevailing view in our opinion and it would be sufficient when the accused attributes to himself even a minor role, which is different from other co-accused, it will still be acceptable if by confessing to that minor role, it leads to the maker’s incrimination in the case. The position, however, would be different and confession would not be acceptable, where while making the alleged confession, an attempt is made by the maker of it to throw the blame on the other accused persons, making himself a mere unwilling spectator, in this regard reliance is placed on numerous judgments of India.[9]

11.     In the present case, the inculpatory confession made by the appellant, Mir Muhammad Afzal, not only details his own involvement but also implicates the other appellants in the incident. Even though the confession was subsequently retracted, a conviction can still be sustained if there exists other corroborative and incriminating evidence against the appellants. It is pertinent to note that once a confessional statement is found to be true and voluntary, it can form the basis for conviction. In this regard, reference may be made to the case of Muhammad Amin.[10] The inculpatory judicial confession of appellant Mir Muhammad Afzal constitutes a significant cornerstone of the prosecution’s case. This confession was duly corroborated by the ocular testimony of the prosecution witnesses, the identification parade, medical evidence, the recovery of the weapon, and the forensic report issued by the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), collectively forming a consistent and credible chain of evidence supporting the prosecution’s narrative.

12.     As far as the motive is concerned, it is important to highlight that the prosecution’s case reveals two conflicting narratives regarding the motive: one asserts that the murder occurred during a robbery/dacoity, while the other proposes the possibility of a targeted killing. Consequently, the true motive remains shrouded in mystery. Both versions have surfaced in the evidence, yet neither diminishes the culpability of the appellants, nor any of the version was supported by cogent evidence. It was held in Muhammad Yaqoob Case[11] and Ali Asghar alias Aksar case[12] that, where the motive for the offence is shrouded in mystery then the extreme penalty of death is not warranted. In addition to that, it has been held in numerous cases that when motive is neither proved, nor satisfactorily established, in that circumstance the extreme penalty of death is usually avoided.[13] Additionally, given that four individuals were implicated in the crime, the investigation and identification parade do not attribute a specific role to each appellant with respect to inflicting this injury. This factual


matrix, while not exonerating the appellants, constitutes a relevant mitigating circumstance in the assessment of their respective culpabilities and the quantum of sentence.

13.     The above discussion leads us to the inevitable inference that the appellants are conclusively linked to the offences, the aforementioned mitigating factors warrant a modified sentencing approach. There are precedents of this Court recognizing that the act of firing a single shot from a firearm may constitute a mitigating factor warranting the imposition of an alternate sentence. In support of this principle, reliance is placed on the authoritative judgment of this Court in Shameem Khan Case.[14]

14.     In light of the preceding considerations, the appeal is partly allowed, the death sentence of the appellants (in Crl. A. 26/2021), (in Crl. A. 27/2021) & (in Crl. A. 28/2021) is hereby, modified to the sentence of life imprisonment and the above said appellants are directed to pay a fine of Rs. 500,000 each. The said amount shall be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased as compensation, in accordance with the provisions of Section 544-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. In the event of non-payment, they shall undergo six months of simple imprisonment.

The following queries arise for our consideration: 

Question No= 01
.............................
i)  In the context of capital punishments, is it permissible for convictions to be predicated on circumstantial evidence? 

Answer:
............
In order to adjudicate the question No. (i) supra, it is now widely accepted that punishment can be imposed based on circumstantial evidence; however, it is subject to rigorous standards and principles. Conviction exclusively on the basis of circumstantial evidence is not prohibited by law. Nevertheless, the quality and sufficiency of the evidence are more important than its quantity. The circumstantial evidence must be of a nature that is inconsistent with the accused’s innocence. The accused must be linked to the offense by a complete and unbroken chain of circumstantial evidence. The conclusion of guilt must be reached by the collective application of the various pieces of circumstantial evidence, with one end (naeem)of the chain contacting the deceased individual and the other touching the accused individual’s neck. If any link in this chain is absent, the entire chain is disrupted and no conviction can be recorded in such a situation. 

Question No= 02
...........................
ii) . In a court of law, what is the admissibility of CCTV footage and its evidentiary value?

Answer:
...............
Reverting to question No. (ii) it is worth mentioning that in the case of State v Ahmed Omar Sheikh (2021 SCMR 873), this Court has established a two-step test for the verification of digital evidence regarding CCTV footage. This examination necessitates that the evidence in question be both authentic and pertinent, and that it has been acquired from a trustworthy and dependable source. The list of conditions comprises:

 “i) providing an explanation of how the video was obtained or its source, and

 ii)presenting a forensic report to show that the video has not been altered.” 

 It is a well-known fact that technology has become so ingrained in our lives that everyone is utilizing one form of technology or another. Criminals are also employing this in our society, establishing a trail for digital forensics to follow in order to uncover their crimes. It is important to note that we were unable to capitalize on digital evidence for an extended period of time due to the following factors: Firstly, our courts were previously reliant on traditional methods of evidence collection and presentation. Secondly, digital evidence was admissible only under article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (“QSO of 1984), which allows the court to admit any evidence that is obtained through the use of modern devices if it is deemed appropriate. Thirdly, the evidence was considered hearsay. Nevertheless, in light of the growing (naeem)importance of tracing and identifying the perpetrators, some critical legislative changes were implemented to grant digital evidence the status of primary evidence. The Electronic Transactions Ordinance (ETO) was implemented in 2002 to capitalize on the advantages of information technology. This Ordinance has resulted in modifications to other laws, such as the QSO of 1984, that pertain to the admissibility of digital evidence. It has also designated such evidence as primary evidence.

The CCTV footage may also be admitted under the “Silent witness” theory, which stipulates that the video (naeem)itself functions as evidence without the necessity of a sponsoring witness, provided that the footage is authenticated. It provided unbiased and real-time evidence that is frequently more reliable than human testimony, serving as a potent “Silent Witness”. In Black’s Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, at page 1508, ‘Silent Witness Theory’ is mentioned as under: 

“A method of authenticating and admitting evidence (such as a (naeem)photograph), without the need for a witness to verify its authenticity, upon a sufficient showing of the reliability of the process of producing the evidence, including proof that the evidence has not been altered.

The “Silent Witness theory” is a rule of evidence that allows for the admission of photographic video, or other recorded evidence as substantive proof of what it depicts, without the need for an eyewitness to testify that they personally observed (naeem)the events depicted in the recording (United States v. Harris, 55 M.J.433 (C.A.A.F 2001). Over the last 25 years, the “Silent Witness” theory of authentication has developed in almost all jurisdictions to allow photographs to substantively “speak for themselves” after being authenticated by evidence that supports the reliability of the process or system that produced the photographs. The threshold case for automated camera evidence is United States v. Taylor (530 F.2d 639 (5th Cir 1976)). In that case, footage recording a robbery that was taken after bank employees were locked in the bank vault was admitted, despite the fact that no one could testify as to the events shown. 

The digital evidence has now assumed a crucial role in the courts of law while administrating justice. In the recent past such evidence was treated as hearsay and secondary (naeem)evidence in our country, however, as stated above, keeping in view its importance, particularly in tracing and identifying the culprits, required changes were made in the relevant laws in order to give the status of primary evidence to the digital evidence, thus, being primary evidence, it is admissible. The CCTV footages, if pass the two-fold test, as per dictum laid down by this Court in the case of Ahmad Omar Sheikh (supra), then it does not require any corroboration being primary evidence.

[10/21/25, 11:16:37 AM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: 📜 خطاب برائے حاکمِ وقت، اقتدار میں بیٹھنے والے حضرات و ادارے

بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِیمِ

محترم حاکمِ وقت، معزز حکومتی عہدیداران اور تمام متعلقہ ادارے،
السلام علیکم ورحمت اللہ وبرکاتہ

میری پہلی اور سچی اپیل یہی ہے کہ اپنے دلوں میں اللہ کا خوف اور انسانیت کا رحم جگہ دیں۔ ہمارے رب نے ہمیں انصاف، رحم اور غریبوں کا ساتھ دینے کا حکم دیا ہے — قرآن مجید میں ارشاد ہے: "وَيُطْعِمُونَ الطَّعَامَ عَلَىٰ حُبِّهِ مِسْكِينًا وَيَتِيمًا وَأَسِيرًا" (انسانیت و احسان کی ہدایت) — اور رسولِ کریم ﷺ نے فرمایا کہ جو شخص کسی مسلمان کا بوجھ ہلکا کرے گا، اللہ اس کی مشکلات کم فرمائے گا۔

آج ہماری قوم کا المیہ یہ ہے کہ بنیادی ضرورتیں — روٹی، سبزیاں، تیل اور شافاف قیمتیں — عام آدمی کی دسترس سے دور ہو چکی ہیں۔ آٹا 2800، ٹماٹر 500، چینی 200، ڈالڈا 600 — یہ صرف اعداد نہیں، یہ خونِ دل ہے، ماں کی آنکھوں میں آنسو ہیں، بچوں کی بھوک ہے، اور بزرگوں کی بے بسی ہے۔

میں آپ سے عاجزانہ، مگر پُرزور درخواست کرتا ہوں:

1. اللہ اور قرآن کے سامنے سر جھکائیں — اپنے فیصلوں میں رحم، تقویٰ اور عدل کو فوقیت دیں۔ معاملہ صرف سیاسی نہیں، یہ ایک روحانی و اخلاقی فریضہ ہے۔


2. اگر آپ عوام کے بنیادی حقوق برقرار نہ رکھ سکیں تو ذمّہ داری کا احساس کریں — کرسی کا راستہ ہمیشہ خدمت کا راستہ ہونا چاہیے، تسلسلِ اقتدار کی خاطر عوام کی عزت و جان کو قربان نہیں کیا جا سکتا۔


3. فوری طور پر ذخیرہ اندوزوں اور منڈی مافیا کے خلاف سخت کارروائی کریں — قوانین کے تحت شفاف تحقیقات، ضبطِ اثاثہ اور بروقت سزا دی جائے تاکہ مصنوعی قلت ختم ہو۔


4. قیمتوں اور سپلائی چین کا فوری آڈٹ کروائیں — درآمد، ٹرانسپورٹیشن اور ذخیرہ کے راستوں کا فوری جائزہ لیا جائے اور جو بھی ناجائز فائدہ اٹھا رہا ہے اس کا حساب لیا جائے۔


5. فوری ریلیف اقدامات — عارضی راشن، سبسڈی یا متبادل ریلیف پیکیج متعارف کروایا جائے تاکہ کوئی بھوکا نہ سوئے۔


6. عوامی شمولیت اور شفافیت — ایک عوامی نگرانی کمیٹی بنائی جائے جس میں دینی رہنما، سول سوسائٹی، صحافی اور عوامی نمائندے شامل ہوں تاکہ فیصلے قابلِ اعتبار اور شفاف رہیں۔



میں یہ بات سخت لہجے میں نہیں کہہ رہا؛ میں اس ملک سے محبت کرتا ہوں، اس کے اداروں کی قدر کرتا ہوں، اور یہی وجہ ہے کہ میں آپ سے اپیل کر رہا ہوں — اللہ کے تقاضے کو سامنے رکھ کر فیصلہ کریں۔ قیامت میں ہر ذمّہ دار سے جواب طلب ہوگا، اور اگر ہماری نیت صاف ہے تو اللہ مدد فرمائے گا۔

ہم کسی خونریزی، نفرت یا فرقہ وارانہ ٹوٹ پھوٹ کے خواہاں نہیں ہیں۔ ہماری بات صرف انصاف، رحمت اور قانون کی حکمرانی کی ہے۔ مگر اگر حالات ایسے ہی برقرار رہے کہ عام آدمی کے پاس کھانے کو نہ رہے اور انصاف کا دروازہ بند رہے تو سماجی بےچینی بڑھ سکتی ہے  جو کسی کے لیے مفید نہیں ہوگی۔ اس لیے ازراہِ حکمت اور ایمان، ابھی قدم اٹھائیں۔

آخر میں ایک عاجزانہ دعا: اے اللہ! اس ملک کے حقوق ضائع نہ ہونے دے، حکمرانوں کے دلوں میں رحم ڈال دے، اور غریبوں کو ان کا حق عطا فرما۔ آمین۔

والسلام،

دنیا میں سب سنتے ہیں،
مگر بہت کم لوگ ایسے ہوتے ہیں جو خاموش آوازوں کو سمجھتے ہیں۔
ظلم کے اندھیروں میں دبے ہوئے سسکتے دلوں کی پکار،
اور بے گناہی کی چیخیں...
ان کے لیے کان نہیں — دل چاہیے۔

یہی دل کی پکار ہے جس نے ہمیں “غریب کی آواز جیل میں” کے سفر پر لگایا۔
یہ مشن صرف ایک تنظیم نہیں، یہ ایک ضمیر کی بیداری ہے۔
ہم نے عہد کیا ہے کہ ہم اُس ہر قیدی کے ساتھ کھڑے ہوں گے
جو بے قصور ہے، مگر انصاف کے دروازے تک نہیں پہنچ پایا۔

ہم کیا مانتے ہیں؟

ہم جرم سے نفرت کرتے ہیں — انسان سے نہیں۔
ہم مذہب، قوم یا مسلک نہیں دیکھتے — بس سچائی اور بے گناہی دیکھتے ہیں۔
ہم عدالتوں میں وکالت کریں گے،
لیکن اللہ کے لیے، انسانیت کے لیے، اور ضمیر کی تسکین کے لیے۔

ہم پشاور، سوابی اور پورے پاکستان میں
ان مظلوم قیدیوں کے مقدمات لڑیں گے
جن کے پاس اپنی صفائی کے لیے کوئی وکیل، کوئی سہارا، کوئی امید نہیں۔

ہم کسی سے ایک روپیہ بھی نہیں لیں گے۔
ہم نہ شہرت کے لیے، نہ سوشل میڈیا کی لائکس کے لیے،
بلکہ صرف اللہ کو راضی کرنے کے لیے یہ فریضہ انجام دیتے ہیں۔

ہمارا وعدہ

جب تک اس سرزمین پر ایک بھی بے گناہ جیل میں ہے،
ہم خاموش نہیں رہیں گے۔
یہ مشن چلتا رہے گا،
کیونکہ ظلم کے خلاف بولنا ہی اصل عبادت ہے۔

2024 MLD 1970
Unless directed otherwise, on acquittal by High Court, disposal of case property shall be regulated by learned lower Court under section 517 of Cr.P.C.

Section 517 Cr.P.C. clearly mentions that when an inquiry or trial is concluded, Court concerned may pass order for the disposal by destruction, confiscation, or (naeem)delivery to any person claiming to be entitled to possession thereof or otherwise of any property or document. Conclusion of trial includes decision of case in appeal when no order with respect to case property has been made by the appellate Court.  

There is no cavil to the proposition that under section 520 of Cr.P.C. this Court is also authorized to pass an appropriate order in case learned trial Court fails to exercise power under section 517 Cr.P.C. Learned counsel for the petitioners could not controvert the fact that petitioners/accused have not claimed such amount as their own (naeem)during the trial rather in their statements under section 342 Cr.P.C alleged that said amount was foisted upon them. Order passed by the learned trial Court clearly speaks that the petitions were not decided on merits but on technical ground that learned trial Court lacks jurisdiction due to acquittal order passed by this Court. 

In this case trial Court has ordered confiscation of case property through a judgment of conviction and said decision has been reversed, therefore, principle of merger shall not apply, which attracts only if the appellate Court upholds the decision of trial Court or modify it in substance or relief but in the present case this Court has not upheld or modified the judgment of trial Court, rather quashed it, therefore, by all means, the situation has been reversed to the stage when during investigation amount was shown recovered from the petitioners, then accused, while opening an avenue for the petitioners to once again file the petitions on the analogy of section 516-A or 523 of Cr.P.C. but under section 517 of Cr.P.C. No doubt this Court under section 520 Cr.P.C. can pass an appropriate order, but only when petition under section 517 Cr.P.C. is decided by the trial Court on merits, which has not been done by the trial Court. Railway Department is contesting the claim on the basis of facts and contentions cited above, record of trial Court is also not before this Court and counter claims of the parties require a factual inquiry based on recording of evidence, if necessary, by the learned trial Court/Special Judge (Central) Lahore to determine entitlement of petitioners to alleged amount which function cannot be under taken by this Court while exercising revisional jurisdiction. Therefore, learned Special Judge (Central) Lahore/trial Court would better examine the entire record while assessing the entitlement of the portioners for the amount claimed.

Section 517 of Cr.P.C. is not an exhaustive section, Court after conclusion of trial can also refer the matter to Magistrate for disposal of property as mentioned in section 518 of Cr.P.C.

Though section 104 of Cr.P.C. authorizes the Court to impound any document or thing yet during the trial and after conclusion it can decide the fate of such property including destruction, confiscation and delivery to person entitled. When the accused, during the trial claims the property as his own, then on acquittal he is entitled to receive it back straightaway by the order of trial Court but when the situation is otherwise then Court must decide the question again by providing opportunity to prove the entitlement and also reason for disowning of such property during the trial and Court can presume any fact while deciding application for claim. Section 517 of Cr.P.C. in that case provides jurisdiction to Court to decide all questions arising out of acquittal order. This section is somewhat like section 47 of CPC which says that all questions arising between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed and relating to the execution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree shall be decided by the Court executing the decree and not by a separate suit. Similarly, as sections 379, 425 and 442 of Cr.P.C., say that all orders passed by Court of Reference, Appeal and Revision shall be certified to the lower Court which shall pass orders confirmable to the judgment and order of the High Court and if necessary, record shall be amended in accordance with law. Thus, in this way lower Court becomes an executing Court like one under section 47 of CPC, therefore, can decide all ancillary question relating to case property in accordance with law.

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*

Mrs. Justice Ayesha A. Malik 
Uploaded and Judgment date 
 23-10-2025 

1). فیملی عدالتیں از خود 
Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 (طلاق کے قانون) کے تحت دائر مقدمہ کو خلع کے مقدمے میں تبدیل نہیں کر سکتیں، جب تک کہ بیوی کی واضح اور باخبر رضامندی حاصل نہ ہو۔

2). فیملی عدالتوں کی کارروائیاں دیوانی نوعیت کی ہوتی ہیں اور انہیں امکانِ غالب (balance of probabilities) کی بنیاد پر فیصلہ کیا جانا چاہیے۔

3). فیملی عدالتوں کے فیصلے ثبوت اور معقول استدلال پر مبنی ہونے چاہئیں، نہ کہ روایتی یا مردانہ بالادستی پر مبنی مفروضوں اور تصورات پر۔

4). زبان انسانی سوچ کو تشکیل دیتی ہے، لہٰذا فیملی عدالتوں کو ایسے الفاظ استعمال کرنے سے گریز کرنا چاہیے جیسے "نافرمان بیوی" یا "خود گھر چھوڑنے والی عورت"، کیونکہ یہ منفی تصورات اور اخلاقی پیمانوں پر عورتوں کا فیصلہ کرنے کی روش کو مضبوط کرتے ہیں، بجائے اس کے کہ ان کی عزت اور خودمختاری کو تسلیم کیا جائے۔

 قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ
1. Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 (DMMA) اور خلع کا فرق
بنیادی اصول:

Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 کے تحت بیوی مخصوص قانونی وجوہات (مثلاً شوہر کی بدسلوکی، نان و نفقہ کی عدم ادائیگی، یا غیر حاضری وغیرہ) کی بنیاد پر عدالتی طلاق (judicial divorce) حاصل کر سکتی ہے۔

خلع (Khula) فقہی طور پر زوجہ کی یکطرفہ علیحدگی کی درخواست ہے جو بیوی اپنی ازدواجی ناپسندیدگی یا زندگی گزارنے کی ناممکن صورتحال کی بنیاد پر دیتی ہے، جس میں وہ شوہر کو مہر یا کوئی مالی معاوضہ واپس کرنے پر آمادہ ہوتی ہے۔

قانونی نتیجہ

اگر عورت DMMA کے تحت مقدمہ دائر کرے تو عدالت از خود اسے خلع میں تبدیل نہیں کر سکتی، جب تک عورت واضح طور پر رضامند نہ ہو۔

ایسا کرنا فیملی کورٹ کی حدودِ اختیار (jurisdictional overreach) میں شمار ہوگا، کیونکہ عدالت دعویٰ کی نوعیت از خود تبدیل نہیں کر سکتی۔

عدالتی نظائر

PLD 2023 Lahore 312

2022 CLC 845 (Lahore): “Family Court cannot suo motu convert a suit under DMMA into Khula proceedings without wife’s express consent.”

PLD 2006 SC 533 (Khurshid Bibi v. Baboo Muhammad Amin): عدالت نے خلع کو عورت کا شرعی و قانونی حق قرار دیا مگر اس کے طریقہ کار کی وضاحت بھی کی کہ اسے رضامندی اور ثبوت کے ساتھ ہی اختیار کیا جا سکتا ہے۔

2. Family Proceedings are Civil in Nature  Standard of Proof
اصول:

فیملی عدالتوں کی کارروائیاں دیوانی (civil) نوعیت کی ہیں، اس لیے ان میں criminal standard of proof (beyond reasonable doubt) لاگو نہیں ہوتا۔

فیصلے “balance of probabilities” یعنی جس پہلو کے زیادہ امکانات ہوں، اس بنیاد پر کیے جاتے ہیں۔

عدالتی رہنمائی

2017 SCMR 446 (Mst. Kaneez Fatima v. Wali Muhammad): عدالتِ عظمیٰ نے واضح کیا کہ فیملی مقدمات میں “balance of probabilities” کا معیار ہی لاگو ہوگا۔

PLD 2021 Lahore 1107: “Family matters concern personal relationships, not criminal liability, hence civil standard of proof applies.”

قانونی اثر

اگر بیوی کے شواہد سے یہ ظاہر ہو کہ ازدواجی تعلقات ناقابلِ برداشت ہو گئے ہیں تو عدالت خلع کی ڈگری جاری کر سکتی ہے، چاہے شوہر کے انکار کے باوجود۔

3. Evidence-Based Reasoning vs Patriarchal Presumptions
قانونی نکتہ

آئینِ پاکستان کا آرٹیکل 25 مرد و عورت کو مساوی حقوق دیتا ہے۔

آرٹیکل 14 انسانی وقار (dignity of man/woman) کی ضمانت دیتا ہے۔

لہٰذا عدالتوں کو فیصلہ کرتے وقت سماجی تعصب یا صنفی مفروضات (gender bias) سے گریز کرنا لازم ہے۔

عدالتی نظائر

2021 SCMR 1917 (Mst. Sobia v. Additional District Judge): عدالت نے کہا کہ “Women litigants must not be judged by patriarchal notions; evidence must prevail over stereotypes.”

PLD 2022 Lahore 861 (Ayesha v. State): عدالت نے مشاہدہ کیا کہ “Courts must reject moralistic judgments against women and rely solely on evidence.”

تجزیہ

اگر عدالت عورت کو "بدچلن" یا "نافرمان" کے لقب سے یاد کرے بغیر کسی ٹھوس ثبوت کے، تو یہ قانونی طور پر تعصب (bias) کے زمرے میں آتا ہے، جو فیصلے کو annulable (باطل) بنا سکتا ہے۔

4. Language and Judicial Neutrality
اصولی نکتہ

عدالت کی زبان (judicial language) عدالتی غیرجانبداری (neutrality) کی آئینہ دار ہوتی ہے۔

عدالت اگر “disobedient wife” یا “self-deserting lady” جیسے الفاظ استعمال کرے تو یہ عدالت کی subjective morality کو ظاہر کرتا ہے، نہ کہ objective legal reasoning کو۔
بین الاقوامی حوالہ

UN CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women) کے تحت پاکستان نے عہد کیا ہے کہ عدالتیں gender-neutral language اپنائیں گی۔

Indian SC, 2022 (X v. Principal Secretary): “Language in judicial decisions must not reinforce stereotypes; it must uphold the dignity and agency of women.”

قانونی اثر

عدالتی زبان کو غیرجانب دار، باوقار اور صنفی لحاظ سے غیرمتعصب ہونا چاہیے۔

فیملی عدالت کو خواتین کے حقوق کے تحفظ کے ساتھ ساتھ انسانی وقار کو بھی مقدم رکھنا لازم ہے۔

 نتیجاً مختصراً۔۔۔۔
خودکار تبدیلی (conversion) کے بغیر عورت کی رضامندی کے، DMMA کے تحت دائر مقدمے کو خلع میں بدلنا غیرقانونی ہے۔

فیملی عدالتوں کے فیصلے ثبوت اور امکانِ غالب پر مبنی ہونے چاہئیں، نہ کہ روایتی تصورات پر۔

عدالتوں کو خواتین کے بنیادی انسانی حقوق، وقار اور خودمختاری کا تحفظ کرتے ہوئے غیرجانب دار زبان استعمال کرنی چاہیے۔

یہ اصول پاکستان کے آئین (آرٹیکلز 14، 25، 35) اور بین الاقوامی معاہدات (CEDAW) دونوں کے مطابق ہیں۔

سمری مقدمہ آرڈر XXXVII رولز 1 اور 2 ضابطۂ دیوانی (C.P.C) — یکطرفہ کارروائی (Ex-parte proceedings) — منسوخی (Setting aside) — مدعا علیہ جیل میں قید  کیا سمن کی تعمیل جیل سپرنٹنڈنٹ کے ذریعے آرڈر V رول 24 C.P.C کے تحت ہونی چاہیے؟ — عدالت کی ذمہ داری کہ انصاف تک رسائی 
(Access to Justice)
یقینی بنائے قید مدعا علیہ کو طلب نہ کرنا منصفانہ ٹرائل سے محرومی 
(Denial of Fair Trial)
 کے مترادف ہے  ٹرائل کورٹ نے اس علم کے باوجود کہ مدعا علیہ جیل میں ہے، یکطرفہ کارروائی جاری رکھ کر غلطی کی 
نظرِ ثانی قبول، یکطرفہ کارروائی کالعدم قرار دی گئی۔
 مقدمے کا پس منظر
یہ مقدمہ ایک Summary Suit کے تحت دائر کیا گیا تھا جس پر عدالتِ زیریں نے Order XXXVII Rule 1 & 2 C.P.C. کے مطابق کارروائی کی۔
مدعا علیہ (Defendant) جیل میں قید تھا، لیکن عدالت نے اس کے جیل میں ہونے کے باوجود ex-parte (یکطرفہ) کارروائی کرتے ہوئے مقدمہ آگے بڑھایا اور فیصلہ جاری کیا۔
مدعا علیہ نے بعد ازاں revision petition کے ذریعے اس کارروائی کو چیلنج کیا۔

 قانونی سوالات 
(Legal Questions)
کیا جیل میں قید ملزم کو آرڈر V رول 24 C.P.C کے تحت جیل سپرنٹنڈنٹ کے ذریعے سمن کی تعمیل کروانا عدالت کی ذمہ داری ہے؟

کیا عدالت، جب مدعا علیہ کی قید سے باخبر ہو، اس کے بغیر کارروائی جاری رکھ سکتی ہے؟

کیا ایسا عمل آئینِ پاکستان کے آرٹیکل 10-A (Right to Fair Trial) کی خلاف ورزی شمار ہوگا؟

اگر عدالت نے مدعا علیہ کو طلب کیے بغیر فیصلہ دیا، تو کیا وہ فیصلہ قانونی طور پر کالعدم (Void ab initio) سمجھا جائے گا؟

متعلقہ قانونی دفعات
Order XXXVII Rule 1 & 2 C.P.C.
یہ دفعات "Summary Procedure" سے متعلق ہیں، جو تیز تر انصاف کے لیے دی گئی ہیں، خاص طور پر ایسے معاملات میں جہاں دستاویزی ثبوت (like promissory notes, cheques, etc.) موجود ہوں۔
تاہم، اس کا مقصد مدعا علیہ کے دفاع کے حق کو سلب کرنا نہیں بلکہ کارروائی کو جلدی انجام دینا ہے۔

Order V Rule 24 C.P.C. – Service on Prisoners
“Where the defendant is confined in a prison, the summons shall be delivered or sent by post or otherwise to the officer in charge of the prison for service on the defendant.”

اس قاعدے کے تحت، اگر مدعا علیہ جیل میں قید ہو تو عدالت پر لازم ہے کہ وہ سمن جیل سپرنٹنڈنٹ کے ذریعے تعمیل کروائے۔
یہ عدالت کی ذمہ داری ہے، نہ کہ فریق کی۔

آئینِ پاکستان کا آرٹیکل 10-A – حقِ منصفانہ سماعت (Right to Fair Trial):
"For the determination of his civil rights and obligations, a person shall be entitled to a fair trial and due process."

یعنی اگر کسی شخص کو مقدمے میں سنا نہ جائے، یا اسے اپنی صفائی کا موقع نہ دیا جائے، تو یہ آئینی خلاف ورزی ہوگی۔

 عدالتی مشاہدات
 (Observations by the LHC)
عدالت نے مشاہدہ کیا کہ Trial Court کو علم تھا کہ مدعا علیہ جیل میں ہے۔
باوجود اس کے، اس نے اسے طلب کرنے یا سمن بھیجنے کے لیے کوئی مؤثر اقدام نہیں کیا۔

اس عمل سے Access to Justice اور Fair Trial کے بنیادی اصولوں کی خلاف ورزی ہوئی۔

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ

"When the Court is aware that the defendant is incarcerated, failure to ensure his appearance through Jail Superintendent amounts to denial of justice."

عدالت نے مزید فرمایا کہ "Justice is not a mere procedural formality but a substantive right safeguarded by the Constitution."

 عدالتی نظائر 
(Precedents)
PLD 2014 SC 389 (Dr. Mobashir Hassan Case)
سپریم کورٹ نے قرار دیا کہ "Denial of hearing is denial of justice."
یعنی اگر کسی فریق کو سنے بغیر فیصلہ دیا جائے تو وہ باطل ہے۔

2021 SCMR 1486 (Mst. Nasreen Akhtar v. Muhammad Asif)
عدالت نے کہا کہ "Ex-parte proceedings are to be set aside when the defendant was prevented by sufficient cause from appearing before the court."

2019 YLR 2211 (Lahore)
جیل میں قید شخص کی غیرحاضری کے باعث دیے گئے فیصلے کو عدالت نے کالعدم قرار دیا کیونکہ سمن تعمیل کا درست طریقہ اختیار نہیں کیا گیا تھا۔

 قانونی اصول
 (Legal Principle Evolved)
“Failure to serve a detained defendant through the Jail Superintendent constitutes a jurisdictional error and renders the ex-parte proceedings void.”

یعنی عدالت کی طرف سے جیل میں موجود فریق کو طلب نہ کرنا محض ایک تکنیکی غلطی نہیں بلکہ ایک بنیادی عدالتی اختیارات کی خلاف ورزی 
(jurisdictional defect)
 ہے۔

نتیجاً مختصراً۔۔۔
عدالتِ عالیہ نے ٹرائل کورٹ کا فیصلہ کالعدم قرار دیا۔

Ex-parte کارروائی کو منسوخ کر کے مقدمہ دوبارہ سماعت کے لیے بھیج دیا گیا تاکہ مدعا علیہ کو پورا موقع دیا جائے۔

یہ فیصلہ Access to Justice اور Due Process کے آئینی اصولوں کو تقویت دیتا ہے۔

قانونِ شہادت آرڈر 1984 کے آرٹیکلز 59 اور 84 — دستخط اور انگوٹھے کے نشان کا موازنہ — جدید فرانزک ذرائع کا استعمال سچائی سامنے لانے اور رسمی تکنیکی نکات کے مقابلے میں حقیقی انصاف کو برقرار رکھنے کے لیے لازمی ہے — عدالت کو اپنا عدالتی اختیار اس طرح استعمال کرنا چاہیے کہ منصفانہ فیصلہ یقینی بنایا جا سکے، چاہے مبینہ دستخط کنندہ فوت ہی کیوں نہ ہو — جب کسی متنازعہ دستاویز کی اصالت (authenticity) مقدمے کا بنیادی نکتہ ہو، خصوصاً جب جعل سازی کا الزام عائد کیا گیا ہو، تو عدالت پر لازم ہے کہ وہ قانونِ شہادت آرڈر 1984 کے آرٹیکلز 59 اور 84 کے تحت ماہر کی رائے حاصل کرے — ایسے مقدمات میں فرانزک موازنہ سے انکار انصاف کی سنگین پامالی کے مترادف ہے۔
اگر کوئی شخص آپ کے چیک پر جعلی دستخط کرے یا آپ کے نام سے کوئی جعلی دستاویز تیار کرے،
تو آپ عدالت میں اس کو چیلنج کر سکتے ہیں۔

عدالت اس معاملے میں صرف ظاہری یا تکنیکی نکات پر فیصلہ نہیں کرے گی بلکہ حقیقت تک پہنچنے کے لیے فرانزک ماہرین (Forensic Experts) کی مدد لینا لازمی ہے۔

قانونِ شہادت آرڈر 1984 کے آرٹیکلز 59 اور 84 عدالت کو یہ اختیار دیتے ہیں کہ:

عدالت ماہرِ تحریر، دستخط یا انگوٹھے کے نشان کی رائے طلب کرے۔

جدید سائنسی آلات اور فرانزک تجزیہ استعمال کر کے دستاویز کی اصل یا جعلی ہونے کا پتہ لگائے۔

یہ فیصلہ یہ اصول قائم کرتا ہے کہ اگر عدالت کسی مقدمے میں، جہاں جعل سازی کا الزام ہو، ماہر کی رائے لینے سے انکار کرے،
تو یہ انصاف کی سنگین خلاف ورزی
 (Miscarriage of Justice)
 ہوگی۔

 خلاصہ کلام ۔۔۔۔
"جعل سازی کے مقدمات میں فرانزک موازنہ نہ کرنا انصاف کو قتل کرنے کے مترادف ہے۔ عدالت کو جدید سائنسی ذرائع کے ذریعے سچ تک پہنچنا لازم ہے۔"
 پس منظر
 (Background)
یہ مقدمہ اس صورتحال سے متعلق تھا جہاں کسی فریق نے ایک متنازعہ دستاویز (Disputed Document) پر جعلی دستخط یا انگوٹھے کے نشان لگانے کا الزام عائد کیا۔
مرکزی سوال یہ تھا کہ:

کیا عدالت ایسے مقدمے میں، جہاں forgery کا الزام ہو، بغیر فرانزک ماہر کی رائے لیے فیصلہ کر سکتی ہے؟

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ ایسا کرنا انصاف کے اصولوں کے خلاف ہے، اور ماہر کی رائے لینا عدالت کی قانونی ذمہ داری (Judicial Duty) ہے۔

متعلقہ قانونی دفعات
 (Relevant Provisions)
آرٹیکل 59 
 Expert Opinion (رائے ماہر):
جب کسی معاملے میں عدالت کو ایسی سائنسی، فنی یا تکنیکی مہارت درکار ہو جس کا فیصلہ عام فہم کے ذریعے ممکن نہ ہو،
تو عدالت کسی ماہر کی رائے کو قابلِ شہادت (relevant) تسلیم کرے گی۔

یعنی
تحریر، دستخط، انگوٹھے کے نشان، یا دستاویز کی اصلیت کے تعین کے لیے ماہرِ تحریر یا فرانزک ایکسپرٹ کی رائے ضروری شہادت سمجھی جائے گی۔

 آرٹیکل 84 
Comparison of Signature, Writing or Seal
عدالت خود بھی کسی دستخط، تحریر یا مہر کا موازنہ کر سکتی ہے،
لیکن بہتر یہ ہے کہ عدالت ایسا ماہر کی مدد سے کرے تاکہ انصاف کا معیار برقرار رہے۔

یعنی
عدالت کو ازخود موازنہ کرنے کا اختیار ضرور ہے، مگر بغیر ماہر کے سائنسی معاونت کے،
یہ عمل ناقص اور غیر محتاط فیصلہ قرار پاتا ہے۔

عدالتی اصول 
(Judicial Principle Laid Down)
ماہر کی رائے طلب کرنا عدالت کا فرض ہے
جب forgery یا جعل سازی کا الزام ہو، تو عدالت کو از خود فرانزک تجزیہ کا حکم دینا چاہیے۔
ایسا نہ کرنا انصاف کی پامالی
 (Miscarriage of Justice) 
ہے۔

Substantive Justice کو Procedural Technicalities پر فوقیت حاصل ہے
عدالت نے کہا کہ انصاف کا مقصد "سچ تک پہنچنا" ہے،
نہ کہ محض رسمی قانونی ضوابط (technicalities) میں الجھ کر اصل حقیقت کو دبانا۔

Modern Forensic Tools 
کا استعمال ناگزیر ہے
جدید ٹیکنالوجی (forensic lab, handwriting analysis, thumb impression scanning وغیرہ) کے ذریعے
عدالت کو حقیقت کا تعین کرنا چاہیے۔

Judicial Discretion 
کا صحیح استعمال
اگر مبینہ signatory فوت ہو جائے تو بھی عدالت کو دستاویز کا فرانزک موازنہ کرانا چاہیے،
تاکہ بعد میں کسی بے گناہ کو جعلی ثبوت کے ذریعے نقصان نہ پہنچے۔

Evidence Evaluation 
کا اصول
عدالت نے زور دیا کہ تحریر یا دستخط کے ظاہری موازنے پر نہیں بلکہ سائنسی تجزیے پر انحصار کیا جائے۔
یعنی artificial observation کی بجائے scientific verification۔

 عدالتی مشاہدہ 
(Judicial Observation)
“When the authenticity of a disputed document forms the core of a legal dispute, especially involving allegations of forgery, courts are duty-bound to seek expert opinion under Articles 59 and 84 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Denial of forensic comparison in such cases amounts to a miscarriage of justice.”

جب کسی مقدمے میں متنازعہ دستاویز کی صداقت ہی بنیادی نکتہ ہو،
خصوصاً جب جعل سازی کا الزام عائد ہو،
تو عدالت پر لازم ہے کہ وہ آرٹیکلز 59 اور 84 کے تحت ماہر کی رائے حاصل کرے —
بصورت دیگر، فرانزک تجزیے سے انکار انصاف کی سنگین پامالی ہے۔

 قانونی اثرات 
(Legal Implications)
Forgery یا جعلی چیک کے مقدمات
اگر کسی پر الزام ہو کہ اس نے جعلی دستخط کیے یا جعلی چیک بنایا،
تو عدالت کو فرانزک ماہر کی رپورٹ لازمی طلب کرنی ہوگی۔

عدالت خود سے فیصلہ نہیں کر سکتی:
بغیر ماہر کی رپورٹ کے فیصلہ کرنا

برطانیہ اور بھارت میں بھی یہی اصول رائج ہے کہ:

“Handwriting or signature comparison by naked eye is unsafe; expert opinion is mandatory in cases of disputed authorship.”
(Ref: Murari Lal v. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1980 SC 531)

پاکستانی عدلیہ نے اسی اصول کو 2025 LHC 6141 میں مزید مضبوط قانونی بنیاد فراہم کی۔

 نتیجاً مختصراً۔۔۔۔
عدالتوں کو سچائی تک پہنچنے کے لیے جدید فرانزک ذرائع استعمال کرنے کا پابند کیا گیا۔

آرٹیکلز 59 اور 84 کے تحت ماہر کی رائے اختیاری نہیں بلکہ لازمی قرار پائی۔

جعل سازی، متنازعہ چیک یا دستاویزات کے مقدمات میں فرانزک تجزیہ سے انکار انصاف کی نفی ہے۔

یہ فیصلہ عدالتوں کے لیے ایک نیا معیارِ عدل (Standard of Justice) طے کرتا ہے کہ
"Substantive justice must prevail over procedural formality."

      [Pp. 790 & 791] A, B & C

Mr. Khalid Mian, Advocate for Petitioners (in W.P. Nos. 10784, 10852 & 10855 of 2008).

Date of hearing: 12.12.2008.

Judgment

This single judgment will dispose of WP No. 10587/2008 filed by Ashiq Ali, DSP seeking quashment of FIR No. 854 dated 21.8.2008, registered under Sections 155-C, 156 of Police Order, 2002 at Police Station Hanjarwal, Lahore; WP No. 10852/2008 filed by Tariq Mahmood, Ex-Inspector for quashment of FIR No. 850 dated 21.8.2008, registered under Sections 155-C, 156 of Police Order, 2002 at Police Station Hanjarwal, Lahore; WP No. 10784/2008 filed by Ijaz Ahmad, Sub-Inspector to quash FIR No. 851 dated 21.8.2008, registered under Sections 155-C, 156 of Police Order, 2002 at Police Station Hanjarwal, Lahore, and WP No. 10855/2008 preferred by Ansar Hussain, Sub-Inspector (Retd) for quashing of FIR No. 853 dated 21.8.2008, registered under Sections 155-C, 156 of Police Order, 2002 at Police Station Hanjarwal, Lahore as all these FIRs were registered against the Police Officers with the allegation that they had conducted investigation of a murder case on different occasions illegally and impartially and common questions of law and facts are involved.

2.  The facts giving rise to these writ petitions are that a case FIR No. 884 was registered at Police Station Hanjarwal, Lahore on 14.12.2006 in respect of offences under Sections 302/324/109/148/ 149 PPC and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and originally the case was investigated by Qaisar Mushtaq, Inspector, Tariq Mahmood, Inspector petitioner, Ijaz Ahmad, S.I. petitioner and Ansar Hussain, S.I. petitioner while Ashiq Ali petitioner being DPO, Sabzazar Circle verified the investigation conducted by the said police officers.

3.  The learned counsel for the petitioners have argued--

(i)   that all the FIRs have been registered illegally and with mala fide intentions on the part of DSP (Legal) as well as DIG (investigation) who without any evidence had passed the order in this regard, which is not warranted by law,

(ii)  that the competent Court has already taken the jurisdiction of the said case and during that period no objection regarding defective investigation was raised by any of the authorities;

(iii) that in the light of the comments given by the CCPO, Lahore and SSP, Lahore, DSP (Legal) had no authority to override their opinion;

(iv)  that all the accused persons except one who is absconder are facing the trial before the learned trial Court;

(v)   that the impugned order on which FIRs have been registered is against Articles 171 and 172 of Police Order, 2002 under which protection has been given to the acts done by the Police Officers in good faith;

(vi)  that FIR No. 852 of 2008 registered against Qaisar Mushtaq has been cancelled after investigation who was opponent and the investigation and subsequent investigations were conducted in continuation of his investigation;

(vii) that no case can be registered under Article 156 of Police Order, 2002 in anticipation of the verdict of the Court or any subsequent investigation;

(viii)      that keeping in view the material with the prosecution there is no probability of the conviction of the petitioners;

and prayed for quashment of the FIRs, which were registered mala fidely without any basis while misusing the authority only to create departmental harassment and the same are liable to be quashed as further proceedings therewith will be abuse of process of law and sheer wastage of time. Relies upon--

1997 P.Cr.L.J. 974,

1997 P.Cr.L.J. 1503,

1994 P.Cr.L.J. 2391, and

2008 SCMR 76.

4.  On the other hand, learned Additional Advocate General submits that the two accused, persons who were declared innocent during the investigation by the petitioners have been summoned vide order dated 11.6.2007 passed by learned Judge Anti-Terrorist Court IV, Lahore and it shows that they were illegally declared so by the petitioners as I/Os, who have been rightly proceeded under the provisions of Police Order, 2002.

5.  I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with due and caution with their assistance. Briefly the allegation is that after the investigation in the aforesaid murder case, Muhammad Asim and Muhammad Sarwar accused had been declared POs., who after the grant of interim pre-arrest bail from the Court joined the investigation and they were declared innocent by Qaisar Mushtaq, Incharge Investigation within 15 days vide Zmini No. 45 dated 25.3.2007, which was verified by Ashiq Ali DSP petitioner. Muhammad Aslam accused was also declared PO, who on coming back from France and after the grant of interim pre-arrest bail was joined in the investigation by Ijaz Ahmad SI petitioner and was declared innocent, which opinion of the said I/O was also verified by Ashiq Ali DSP, petitioner. Moreover, on 25.3.2007 Malik Muhammad Ashraf Lumberdar had given a writing about the innocence of Asim and Muntzir Mehdi accused, which was found fictitious, but no notice thereof was taken by Ashiq Ali DSP. Then on 22.4.2007 Tabassum Ali accused was declared innocent by Ijaz Ahmad SI after the investigation, which was verified by the DSP, but the learned Judicial Magistrate while disagreeing with the discharge report ordered for committal of Tabassum accused to jail, who was sent there by Ijaz Ahmad SI petitioner without effecting any recovery from him. However, the pistol was shown to be produced through Malik Zafar so that it could not be connected with the accused.

6.  It is admitted position that the challan in the murder case was primarily submitted to the Anti-Terrorism Court and after submission of challan an application for transfer of investigation was moved by Tassawar Hussain son of Bao Bashir Ahmad and Abdul Rashid son of Hadayat Ali, which was duly considered by the Senior Superintendent of Police, Discipline & Inspection, Lahore (Mr. Sultan Mahmood) and Chief City Police Officer, Lahore (Malik Muhammad Iqbal), who after going through the record and hearing the parties filed their comments that the investigation was properly conducted and case was not likely to be re-investigated as challan has already been submitted before the Anti-Terrorist Court. Then vide judgment dated 22.10.2007 passed by this Court in W.P. No. 49486 of 2007 whereby the jurisdiction of Anti-Terrorism Court had been challenged, offence under Section 7 of ATA was deleted by this Court and the case was sent to the Court of ordinary jurisdiction where the case is pending and during this period evidence of 7 witnesses has been recorded. It has also been brought to my notice that when the matter was pending before the CCPO, Lahore two aggrieved persons also filed writ petition claiming therein that they were satisfied with the investigation conducted by the above-said police officers. Now the case is sub judice before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore and during the pendency thereof in the Court of competent jurisdiction the DSP (Legal) on some query on the administrative side gave opinion that the investigation in this case had not been conducted honestly by the above-said petitioners whereupon the aforesaid FIRs have been registered. When questioned by this Court, the DSP (Legal) present in Court has failed to produce any letter/document on which this opinion was sought and he is also not sure that who had sought that opinion. It is admitted that keeping in view the provisions of Article 155 (2) of the Police Order, 2002 the DSP was not authorized person to recommend for registration of the cases against the petitioners. Moreover, under Articles 171 and 172 of Police Order, 2002, the acts of the police officers done in good faith have been protected and for ready reference the said provisions of Police Order, 2002 are reproduced as under:--

171. No Police Officer to be liable to any penalty or payment of damages on account of acts done in good faith in pursuance of duty. No Police Officer shall be liable to any penalty or to payment of damages on account of an act done in good faith in pursuance or intended pursuance of any duty imposed or any authority conferred on him by any provision of this Order or any other law for the time being in force or any rule, order or direction made or given therein.

172. Suits or prosecutions in respect of acts done under colour of duty not to be entertained if not instituted within the prescribed period. In case of an alleged offence by a Police Officer, or a wrong alleged to have been done by him or by any act done under colour of duty or in exercise of any such duty or authority of this Order or when it shall appear to the Court that the offence or wrong if committed or done was of the character aforesaid, the prosecution or suit shall not be entertained, or shall be dismissed, of instituted after more than six months from the date of the action complained of.

Furthermore under, sub-section (2) of Section 156 Cr.P.C., which is the parent law, the investigation conducted by the police officer cannot be called in question in the subsequent proceedings on the ground that he was not competent to do the same. The said sub-section reads as follows:--

"(2) No proceedings of a police officer in any such case shall at any stage be called in question on the ground that the case was one which such officer was not empowered under this section to investigate."

7.  It is also not case of the prosecution that the petitioners being the police officers were not competent to investigate the case and it is settled law that the opinion of the police is not binding on the Courts. The aggrieved party had the right to move for reinvestigation. Admittedly the police has not collected any evidence regarding dishonest investigation  conducted by the petitioners and it seems that all the FIRs have been registered only on the opinion of the DSP (Legal), who had no authority in this regard when the matter was already sub-judice before the Court of competent jurisdiction, which is fully empowered to recommend to the higher authorities in police hierarchy for any action against the police officers/I.Os if any lapses are found on their part during the trial. It has also been brought to the notice of this Court that FIR No. 852/08 with the such allegation was also registered against Qaisar Mushtaq, but the same has been cancelled after the investigation and the cases registered against the petitioners have no distinct features.

8.  In view of the above discussion, I am satisfied that all the aforesaid FIRs were result of malice and those do not constitute any offence, rather these are cases of no evidence and further proceedings therewith will be sheer abuse of process of law, which cannot be allowed to continue. Hence, all the four writ petitions are accepted and the FIRs called in question therein are quashed.

(M.S.A.)    FIRs quashed.

Under Sections 227 and 228 of the Cr.P.C., only the trial Court may alter or add any charge before judgment. Therefore, a bail Court cannot direct incorporation or deletion of any penal provision, as this would amount to exercising powers reserved for the trial Court. The direction issued by the learned Magistrate dated 05-09-2025, requiring incorporation of Section 365-A PPC at the bail stage, was thus without lawful authority and contrary to settled law.

The learned AAG relied on 2024 P.Cr.L.J 658 (Lahore High Court) and Criminal Bail Application No. 829 of 2025 (Sindh High Court) to justify the incorporation of Section 365-A PPC at the bail stage.

With utmost respect, this Court disagrees with those views, as they conflict with the scheme of the Criminal Procedure Code and the binding precedent of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Muhammad Yasin v. State (2016 SCMR 1740) in which the August Supreme Court has held that:-

" While deciding a bail application, the Court is not empowered to add, delete, or substitute any penal provision in the FIR; such powers can only be exercised by the trial Court at the time of framing charge or alteration of charge".

Under Article 189 of the Constitution, decisions of the Supreme Court are binding on all subordinate courts and High Courts; hence, any contrary interpretation cannot be followed.

PLD 2025 SC 262

The terms of a contract of marriage between a man and a woman are contained in the Nikah Nama. The terms and conditions are meant to secure the rights and intentions of both the wife and the husband. The Nikah is a social contract between parties who are competent to enter into a valid marriage contract. It is settled law that a presumption of truth is attached to the Nikah Nama and it enjoys the status of a public document. A strong presumption of truth exists regarding entries recorded in the Nikah Nama. The titles of columns 13 to 16 relate to 'dower'. Column 17 of the prescribed form is titled as 'special conditions if any'. The prescribed form nor the headings of the entries are conclusive for the purpose of ascertaining the intentions of the two parties to the marriage contract. This Court has held in the Haseen Ullah’s case that the Nikah Nama is the deed of marriage contract entered into between the parties and its clauses/columns/contents are to be construed and interpreted in the light of the intention of the parties. The headings are not sufficient to determine the intention of the parties. It is also a settled principle of interpreting a contract that a court cannot imply something that is inconsistent with the express terms and a stipulation not expressed in the written contract can also not be applied merely because it appears to be reasonable to the court.

In the present case the description of the plot in column 17 the Nikah Nama is explicit and not disputed --- However , there no condition stipulated in the column except the description of the plot --- Petitioner ( husband ) had filed his written statement in response to the plaint and had expressly admitted the description of the property but he had taken the stance that the plot was meant for the construction of a house and the respondent ( wife ) was to live in it for as long as the marriage subsisted --- However , a plain reading of the description of the property , as mentioned in column 17 , does not indicate nor supports such a stance - If such an interpretation is accepted then the property would not form part of the dower separately mentioned in columns 13 to 16 of the Nikah Nama --- Copy of column 17 except describing the property -- It is not the case of the Nikah Nama showed that no condition has been stipulated in the petitioner ( husband ) that the columns were filled by the carried out with her before or at the time of execution of the respondent ( wife ) or pursuant to meaningful consultation Nikah Nama --- No such evidence was brought on record --- Onus described in column No. 17 was not meant nor intended by the was on the petitioner ( husband ) to establish that the property construed against the interests and rights of the respondent parties to be part of the dower --- Ambiguity , if any , cannot be ( wife ) in the facts and circumstances of the present case --- Moreover , accepting the stance of the petitioner ( husband ) would amount to reading in the Nikah Nama something not provided therein ---- Courts cannot construe the Nikah Nama and its entries as having the effect of applying a stipulation not expressly provided therein --- High Court had correctly  interpreted the columns of the Nikah Nama and declared the respondent ( wife ) entitled to the plot described in column 17 of the Nikah Nama ---

RASHEED AHMED--Petitioner
versus
ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE etc.--Respondents

W.P. No. 27152 of 2013, heard on 25.1.2022.

(((Judgment)))

This petition calls into question the legality of the consolidated judgment and decree dated 18.02.2013, whereby the learned Additional District Judge, Sialkot, while dismissing the appeal filed by the petitioner, partly accepted the appeal filed by Respondent No. 3 and modified the judgment and decree dated 21.06.2012 passed by the learned Judge Family Court Sialkot, in the terms that the decree for recovery of Rs. 100.000/- as alternate value of dowry articles and pocket money/maintenance at the rate of Rs. 5000/- per month w.e.f.. 01.01.2010 till copletion of her period of Iddat passed in favour of Respondent No. 3 was maintained and her suit tor recovery of gold ornaments weighing eleven tolas or the current market price thereof was also decreed.

2. Brief facts giving rise to this petition are to the effect that Respondent No. 3 filed two suits one for recovery of dowry articles. gold ornaments and maintenance allowance and the other for recovery of dower in shape of gold ornaments weighing 14 tolas and pocket money at the rate of Rs. 5000/- per month as mentioned in the Nikah Nama, alleging that she was married with the petitioner on 20.11.2009, however, there was no issue out of the wedlock; she was given gold ornaments and dowry articles by her parents as per list attached with the plaint but in July 2010 she was ousted by the petitioner from his house, as Such she prayed for a decree for recovery of dowry articles, gold ornaments, maintenance allowance, dower in the shape of gold ornaments weighing 14-lolas and Rs. 5000/- per month as pocket money as per condition of Nikah Nama. The petitioner contested the suit by filing written statement with certain preliminary objections.

3. The learned trial Court out of divergent pleadings of the parties, framed issues, recorded evidence of the parties, and after having gone through the same while dismissing the suit of Respondent No. 3 for recovery of dower in the shape of gold ornaments weighing 14-tolas and pocket money, partially decreed the suit for recovery of dowry articles to the extent of Rs. 100,000/- as alternate price thereof and maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs. 5000/- per month from January, 2010 till the period of her Iddat. Feeling aggrieved, both the parties preferred appeals, which were decided through a consolidated judgment and decree by the learned Additional District Judge in the terms recorded in para-1 above.

4. Arguments heard. Record perused.

5. Prior to the discussion on the legal aspects of the proposition regarding the interpretation of column 17 of the Nikah Nama, I would like to discuss the wisdom maintained in the scheme in object of the Family Court. The West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 has been enforced to make provisions for the establishment of Family Courts for the expeditious settlement and disposal of disputes relating to marriage and family affairs and for matters connected therewith. That is why the application of the provisions of CPC and Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, have not been strictly made applicable to the family cases, rather the powers have been vested to the Family Courts to perform their functions. Under Section 15 the Family Courts are provided with the power to summon witnesses whereas Section 16 enable them to proceed with contempt matters. Similarly, the Family Court has the power to adopt any procedure under law for summoning of the witnesses or exhibiting the documents. The procedures, however, provided in CPC and Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, are not applicable in stricto sensu. Meaning thereby the wisdom behind the scheme is to avoid the technicalities so that the matters could be resolved expeditiously and justice could be provided within the very short span of time. That is why Section 5 of the Act provides "Subject to the provisions of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, and the Conciliation Courts Ordinance, 1961, the Family Courts .shall have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain, hear and adjudicate upon matter specified in the Schedule". Prior to introduction of this Act, some of the matters relating to the family affairs were subject to the Civil Courts and the Civil Court being the ultimate Court of jurisdiction was having the power to entertain those matters, but keeping in view the fact that the procedure before the Civil Court is very lengthy and painful, all the matters relating to the family affairs were made subject to the Family Courts. The Judges of the Family Courts have been given vast power to regulate the proceedings of the family cases with the wisdom that the Family Courts can initiate to bring about compromise/settlement between the spouses for their reunion and for their living together, therefore, during the proceedings of the case twice the provision of reconciliation have been inducted in the Court proceedings. The purpose behind the whole exercise is to make efforts for the reunion of the spouses so to have a peaceful and good family future. This is not only beneficiary for the families but this will also help to build a healthy and beautiful society.

6. With the introduction of the Act, the Nikah Form has attained a very vital importance regarding the resolution of the disputes, if arise between the spouses. Nikah Form otherwise is very important document. It has been observed that unfortunately most of the Nikah Khawn/Nikah Registrars have no understanding  with the spirit of the columns of the Nikah Form especially in the rural areas where the literacy rate is otherwise very low and people do not understand the meaning of some special terms. Nikah Khawn/Nikah Registrars while filling Nikah Form do not keep in mind the purpose of the columns thereof that ultimately creates problems for the spouses in case any dispute arises between them. Furthermore, in some matters it is very difficult for the Court to see the exact intention of the spouses regarding those columns at the time of Nikah. If Nikah Form is perused, its columns have very systematic sequence. From columns 1 to 6. it relates to the place of Nikah with the details of the spouses regarding their names, parentage, age and their matrimonial status i.e. bachelor or married, whereas columns 7 to 11 are regarding the requirements of a valid Nikah, wherein names of the witnesses and the name of Wakeel on behalf of the spouses, if any appointed, are mentioned. Column 12 is regarding the date of Nikah. Columns 13 to 17 relate to the fixation of dower. Now this head has been detailed in four different columns and every column has its own significance. While filling up these columns normally the person filling up does not care for the wisdom behind the said columns, which are very clear in their meanings. Column 17 is regarding "خاص شرائط اگر کوئی ہوں". According to the scheme of the form it reflects that this is a part of the dower and the conditions if having been imposed regarding the dower. It cannot be interpreted anywhere that this column is regarding the conditions after the divorce or in case of divorce, because Nikah Form clearly shows that column 18 starts from the subject of divorce and all the conditions regarding the divorce have been separately mentioned in two different columns.

7. The proposition in hand revolves around the interpretation of column 17 of the Nikah Form. Admittedly, the Nikah was performed between the parties on 20.1 1.2009, the document (photocopy of Nikah Nama) Mark-A is admitted by both the sides and there is no objection from any side regarding its execution. The petitioner has admitted that this Nikah Form was written in his presence and he signed over the same but he has further stated that these conditions were not written. He, however, has not challenged these conditions independently before any forum. Neither the petitioner has filed an application before the concerned union council for correction of the entries if were wrongly filled in column 17 nor brought a suit before the competent Court to get the entries corrected, meaning thereby that Nikah Nama is an admitted document. The learned Judge Family Court while interpreting column 17 of the Nikah Mama observed as under:

"In support of her version plaintiff lady has also produced a copy of her Nikah Nama as mark-A, perusal of which clearly reveals that in Column No. 17 of the same, following words are mentioned:

"17: خاص شرائط اگر کوئی ہوں:- چودہ تولے زیور طلائی کی صورت میں۔ پانچ ہزار روپے جیب خرچ"

Above mentioned words are so ambiguous that no clear picture of these words can be drawn. Plaintiff has stated that golden ornments mentioned in this column were agreed to be paid as her dower but perusal of Column No. 13 and 14 of Nikah Nama of the parties clearly shows that dower in the shape of 11-tolas golden ornaments was paid to the plaintiff at the time of her marriage. In these circumstances when dower has already been paid to the plaintiff, golden ornaments mentioned in Column No. 17 cannot be termed as dower of the plaintiff. It is also note worthy here that Column No. 17 of the Nikah Nama on the basis of which plaintiff lady has claimed the above mentioned 14-tolas golden ornaments etc, is completely silent about the status of these ornaments etc, mode of their payment/delivery so, in these circumstances this Court is of the view that on the basis of such an ambiguous column plaintiff lady cannot be held entitled to get these gold ornaments alongwilh Rs. 5000/- as per month pocket money in the shape of her Haq Mehr."

Whereas the learned Additional District Judge while dealing with the issue interpreted the said column otherwise and mentioned that it could be treated as deferred dower which the lady could claim under law. The wisdom of the judgment of Additional District Judge is backed by the case of jehangir Khan through Attorney vs. Mst. Saeeda Begum and 2 others (2020 YLR 2350), wherein column 17 was interpreted as under:

"As far as petitioner's claim qua house is concerned, I have examined Column No. 17 of the Nikahnama dated 20.11.2009 Ex.PW-1/1, though it was not specifically mentioned that it was given to her either in lieu of dower or as gift, however, it was also not mentioned that it was given to her for residential purpose only. In the absence of such stipulation in the Nikahnama, the suit house given to the wife is conclusive in nature and may be construed as a part of dower or gift in consideration of marriage, therefore, it would be falling with the exclusive jurisdiction of the Family Court as envisaged in Section 5 read with Part-1 of the schedule of the Family Courts Act, 1964 and it has become personal property of the Respondent No. 1."

Similarly, in the case of Mst. Shehnaz Mai vs Ghulam Abbas and 2 others (2018 CLC Note 104) column 17 of the Nikah Nama was also interpreted in the same way and the property mentioned therein was decreed in favour of wife and the said property was declared as deferred dower. There is no other view that presumption of truth is attached to the Nikah Nama. but at the same time, if the entries thereof are denied the same can be challenged and the party challenging the entries is under obligation to prove that those entries were not settled between the parties at the time of Nikah, but in this proposition there is no evidence regarding this aspect. Admittedly, the Nikah was performed in the Majlis and all the persons whose names are appearing on the Nikah Nama (Mark-A) including the petitioner signed over the same. Keeping in view the sequence of the scheme of Nikah Form, its column 17 is condition of dower which in other way can be interpreted as the property belonging to the wife after marriage and under Section 5 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, personal property and belonging of the wife can be claimed by her at any time and the matter is triable by the Family Court. Since this property/amount has not been fixed with any condition by the husband, therefore, this will be taken as the personal property and belonging of the wife, which has been rightly decreed by the learned Additional District Judge. The citations referred by the learned counsel for the petitioner are not as such applicable to the present proposition.

7. For what has been discussed above, the learned counsel for the petitioner has been unable to point out any exercise of excess of jurisdiction by the learned appellate Court. The learned counsel for the petitioner has similarly been unable to point out any illegality or material irregularity having been committed by the learned appellate Court. Under the circumstances this petition, having no merit, is dismissed and the judgment and decree passed by the learned appellate Court is upheld. There shall be no order as to costs.

Return/recovery of dower---Execution petition---Maintainability---Scope---Suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula was decreed subject to return of dower---Four tolas of gold ornaments was fixed as dower duly entered in Column of Nikah Nama---Executing Court turned down the objection of respondent/ex-wife that execution petition for recovery of Zar-e-Khulla was not maintainable---Appellate Court accepted the version/objection of respondent by allowing her revision petition---Held, that the decision of dissolution of marriage in terms of S.10(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964, was compound, which on the one hand dissolved the marriage inter se parties and, on the other, said dissolution was made subject to return of dower---Manner and form of decree was prescribed in Rr. 16 and 17 of the Family Courts Rules, 1965, in light of which dissolution of marriage, on the basis of Khula subject to return of dower was a decree for all intent and purposes under S.13 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, and thus was executable---

JUDGMENT---This petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 stems out from judgment dated 22nd September, 2016, whereby the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, while allowing the revision petition filed by respondent No.3 (hereinafter referred to as "respondent") set aside the order dated 6th February, 2016 passed by the learned Judge Family Court/ Executing Court, Rawalpindi.

2.    Facts in brief necessary for adjudication of instant petition are that the petitioner was married to the "respondent". On account of differences, a suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula was instituted by the "respondent", which was decreed by way of judgment dated 8th December, 2010, subject to return of dower. The petitioner moved an execution petition seeking return of dower. The execution petition was though objected by the "respondent", however, by way of order dated 6th February, 2016, the objection was turned down and the "respondent" was directed to hand over 4-tola gold in shape of ornaments or its price at the prevailing market rate. Feeling dissatisfied, the "respondent" filed a revision petition before the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, which was accepted through impugned judgment on the ground that execution petition was not competent, in the circumstances.

3.    After having heard learned counsel for the parties at considerable length, I have perused the record.

4.    After having remained in marital tie for some time with the petitioner, the "respondent" in order to part her ways, instituted a suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula before the learned Judge Family Court, Rawalpindi. On failure of pre-trial reconciliation proceedings, suit was finally decreed by way of order dated 8th December, 2010 with the following observations: -

       "3. Considering pre-trial reconciliation proceedings to be failed under proviso of Section 10(4) of Family Courts Act 1964, suit of the plaintiff for dissolution of marriage is hereby decreed on the basis of Khullah, subject to return of dower…"

       (Underlining supplied for emphasis)

5.    This followed an execution petition on behalf of petitioner for the return of 4-tola of gold as part of dower. The "respondent" resisted the execution proceedings and by way of order dated 22nd November, 2011, she was directed to return the four tolas gold ornaments mentioned in Nikahnama or its price mentioned in the receipt at the time of Nikah. Feeling dissatisfied, the petitioner preferred revision petition before the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, which was allowed by way of judgment dated 2nd April, 2012. The "respondent" then filed W.P.No.3002 of 2012, which was accepted with the consent of the parties by way of order dated 15th May, 2015 in the following manner:-

       "With the consensus of the parties, this petition is accepted and set aside the orders dated 25.11.2011 and 02.04.2012 passed by the learned trial Court, with a direction to the learned Executing Court to decide the application of the respondent afresh keeping in view the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in titled "Mst. Ayesha Shaheen v. Khalid Mehmood and another" (2013 SCMR 1049).

6.    In post remand proceedings, the learned Judge Family Court/ Executing Court, by way of order dated 6th February, 2016, directed the "respondent" to hand over 4-tola gold in shape of ornaments or its price at the prevailing market value while discarding her objections. This prompted the "respondent" to file the revision petition before the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, which was allowed through impugned judgment.

7.    It appears from the impugned judgment that the revision petition was accepted on the sole ground that for the recovery of "Zar-e-Khula" in a suit for dissolution of marriage, execution petition was not maintainable. Reliance to this effect was placed on Mst. Nadia Bibi v. Additional District Judge and others (PLD 2013 Lahore 41). From the perusal of the judgment in the case of (Mst. Nadia Bibi) supra; it clearly reveals that in the said matter suit for dissolution of marriage was decreed and marriage was dissolved on the basis of Khula without any condition. In this backdrop, it was held that as there was no decree in favour of respondent No.2 in the petition, so execution proceedings are not maintainable.

8.    The facts in the present case on the contrary are altogether different. In this case, the learned Judge Family Court, while dissolving the marriage on the basis of Khula, directed the "respondent" to return the dower. As per column No.17 of Nikahnama, dower was in the shape of 4-tola gold ornaments, which is even not in dispute. Learned counsel for the "respondent" though submitted that a suit for recovery was instituted by the petitioner to this effect, which was dismissed but from the perusal of record it reveals that suit for recovery was related to some other gold ornaments, having no nexus with the gold ornaments subject matter of the present controversy.

9.    The term "decree" is nowhere defined in the Family Courts Act, 1964. So for this purpose, recourse can be made to section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908), which defines the decree as under:-

       "decree" means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint the determination of any question within section 144 and an order under rules 60, 98, 99, 101 or 103 of Order XXI but shall not include ---

       (a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order; or

       (b) any order of dismissal for default.

After having a glimpse of the definition of decree, no doubt left that a decree means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint the determination of any question within section 144 and an order under Rules 60, 98, 99, 101 or 103 of Order XXI but shall not include any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order or any order of dismissal for default. Suit for dissolution of marriage was decreed in terms of section 10 (4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964. The decision was compound, which on the one hand dissolved the marriage interse parties and on the other dissolution was made subject to return of dower.

10.  Section 13 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 provides the manner of enforcement of decrees, which reads as under: -

       13. Enforcement of decrees.- (1) The Family Court shall pass a decree in such form and in such manner as may be prescribed, and shall enter its particulars in the prescribed register.

       (2) If any money is paid or any property is delivered in the presence of the Family Court, in satisfaction of the decree, it shall enter the fact of payment [or] the delivery of property, as the case may be, in the aforesaid register.

       (3) Where a decree relates to the payment of money and the decretal amount is not paid within time specified by the Court [not exceeding thirty days], the same shall, if the Court so directs be recovered as arrears of land revenue, and on recovery shall be paid to the decree-holder.

       (4) The decree shall be executed by the Court, passing it or by such other Civil Court as the District Judge may, by special or general order, direct.

       (5) A Family Court may, if it so deems fit, direct that any money to be paid under a decree passed by it be paid in such installments as it deems fit.

11.  The manner and form of decree is provided in the West Pakistan Family Court Rules, 1965. Rules 16 and 17, for the said purpose, are more relevant, which are reproduced below:-

       16. In every suit, on passing the judgment, a decree shall be drawn up in Form I and shall be signed by the presiding Judge. The decree shall bear the seal of the Court.

       17. The Court shall maintain a register of decrees and orders in the form prescribed for decrees and orders under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

12.  The above discussion thus leads to irresistible conclusion that the order dated 8th December, 2010 resulting into dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula subject to return of dower, for all intent and purposes, was a decree under section 13 of the "Act, 1964" and was executable.

13.  The crux of above discussion is that the learned Additional District Judge has erred in law while allowing the revision petition. Resultantly, this petition is allowed. Impugned judgment dated 22nd September, 2016 is set aside being illegal and unlawful.

The Petitioner herein [Defendant], through 'lame excuses', such as; some time there is a winter season, sometime there is a 'summer season' and sometime, there is a 'holy month of Ramzan', 'Moharram' etc. etc. repeatedly delayed the 'Rukhsati', of the Plaintiff [Respondent No.3 herein], in a very clever manner.
5. Later on, when the parents of Respondent No.3 herein [Plaintiff] again asked the Petitioner herein [Defendant], to arrange 'Rukhstati' of their daughter namely Ms. Shahnaz then, also the Petitioner herein [Defendant], very cleverly, postponed the 'Rukhsati' of Respondent No.3 herein. Thereafter, about six months back, the father of the Petitioner herein [Defendant], came to Karachi, but for the purpose of attending a 'funeral ceremony' of a relative/brother-in-law. During such period, as per Petitioner's version, the Petitioner's father stayed at the house of a 'common relative'. During such stay at Karachi, he also met with the father Respondent No.3 herein [Plaintiff's] and, as asserted, he had assured for the arranging of 'Rukhsati' i.e. after 40 days but this time, as well, the Rukhsati of Plaintiff [Respondent No.3 herein], as promised, could not take place. The Respondent No.3 herein [Plaintiff] and her parents, on account of such continued 'breach of promises' and 'routine excuses', not only suffered 'mental agony', 'defamation' but also faced insult in brathery/closed and known relatives, who were not only making jokes but also they were then raising fingers for and on account of non-taking place of 'Rukhsati' of Mst. Shahnaz daughter of Khalil-ur-Rehman since, 24.12.1999. According to Respondent No.3's stand, mother of Respondent No.3 herein [Plaintiff] thereafter, also died/expired, as alleged, due to 'shocks'/'worries' caused to her and her family members by the Petitioner herein [Defendant] and his parents, that is to say, since, 24.12.1999, when 'NIKAH' of the Petitioner herein [Defendant], was performed with Respondent No.3 herein [Plaintiff].
6. Under the foregoing scenario, the Petitioner herein [Defendant] was thus called upon through a Legal Notice [Exh.'P/1-C'] by Plaintiff's counsel to immediately pronounce 'Divorce', to the Respondent No.3 herein [Plaintiff] i.e. within seven [7] days, from receipt of such Legal Notice dated 24.09.2012, failing which, Respondent No.3 herein, [Plaintiff] would have no 'alternate' except to seek appropriate remedy by way of approaching a court of law, as well as, to other competent authorities including Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission of Pakistan, Islamabad etc. regarding the Defendant's-Petitioner's illegal, un-justifiable and immoral acts. The Petitioner herein, despite receipt of such legal notice, however, failed to give any positive response.
7. On account of 'passive attitude'/ 'dis-inclined behavior' of Petitioner [Defendant], in the heart of Respondent No.3 [Plaintiff], hatred was gradually developed thus she finally compelled to approach the court of learned Xth Family Judge, Karachi-West, by way of filing a Suit on 27.11.2012, for 'Dissolution' of her Marriage by way of 'Khula', and recovery of 'past maintenance' with the prayers as follows:-
1) It is therefore, prayed that this Hon'ble Court may pleased to pass a Judgment and decree in favour of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant, thereby dissolving the marriage of the Plaintiff with the Defendant, thereby declaring the marriage of the Plaintiff with the Petitioner herein [Defendant] or in the alternative , the Plaintiff may be awarded KHULA for which she is ready forego her Dower amount.
2) To direct the Defendant to pay the past maintenance of the Plaintiff at the rate of Rs.30,000/- per month since 24-12-1999 which is approx. calculated to Rs.46,80,000/- for last 156 months and also till she get Khulla, further the Defendant be directed to pay maintenance in addition to the abovementioned maintenance at the rate of Rs.2000/- per month already settled in between the parties in Nikkah Nama against 156 months i.e. total amounting to Rs.3,12,000,00/- and onwards till disposal of suit.
3) Costs of this suit, any other/further relief which this Honorable Court may deem fit and proper.
8. Upon service, the Petitioner herein [Defendant], filed his 'written statement' wherein, the 'allegations levelled' and 'adverse assertions' made in plaint were denied/controverted. In the 'written statement' however, the factum of 'NIKAH' on 24.12.1999, according to Muslim Personal Law, against the Dower amount of Rs.30,000/- [Rupees Thirty Thousand only], was not denied. Besides, 'Registration' of NIKAH and receiving the Registered Copy of 'NIKAHNAMA' [Exh. 'P/1-C'] was also not denied.
9. Per Petitioner's stand, he is still residing in a 'Government Hostel', and has never obtained any accommodation from the 'Employer Department' [Dr. A.Q. Khan Research Lab Kahutta], because of the Plaintiff's 'non-co-operation' though, the Plaintiff is a 'wedded wife' of the Defendant [Petitioner herein].
10. As averred in the 'written statement', the Petitioner [Defendant], has neither kept the Respondent No.3 herein [Plaintiff] nor her parents, as alleged, on false hopes in respect of Plaintiff's Rukhsati. Per Petitioner's stand, he and his family always wished/ wanted to take the 'Rukhsati' of the Plaintiff namely Ms. Shahnaz after 'performance of her Nikah' on 24.12.1999, with Petitioner herein [Defendant]. Per assertions, Defendant's father and other family members regarding 'Plaintiff's Rukhsati', though had made requests to the Plaintiff's family members but they despite such requests did not agree for the Rukhsati of Respondent No.3 [Plaintiff] since, 24.12.1999, when her Nikah was performed with the Petitioner [Defendant]. Per Petitioner's stand, Plaintiff's father in fact, before Rukhsati of Respondent No.3 [Plaintiff] wanted first to arrange the marriages of his elder daughters, construct a house in Orangi Town, Karachi and set-up a transport business.
11. During the entire period i.e. since, the performance of Plaintiff's 'Nikahnama' with the Petitioner herein [Defendant] on 24.12.1999, it was the Plaintiff's father, who wasted long time for fulfilling of his wishes. The 'Rukhsati' of the Respondent No.3 herein [Plaintiff], namely Mst. Shahnaz daughter of Khalil-ur-Rehman thus became a hurdle for the Petitioner herein [Defendant], as well as, his family. Per Defendant's version/stand, no delay, 'irreparable losses', 'mental agony' and/or 'great inconvenience', as alleged, in the plaint, was ever caused to Plaintiff, as Petitioner [Defendant], is not only a law abiding citizen of Islamic Republic of Pakistan but also a responsible Government employee. Per version of the Petitioner herein [Defendant] sometime in the Month of April, 2012, when father of Petitioner herein [Defendant], came to Karachi along with the Defendant's uncles namely [i]. Muhammad Ashraf and [ii]. Muhammad Riaz for attending a 'funeral ceremony' of his brother-in-law namely Khursheed [late] then, also after the attending the 'funeral ceremony', they had also gone to the house of Plaintiff's father, situated in Orangi Town, Karachi, with a request for the Plaintiff's Rukhsati but then, instead of allowing the Rukhsati, a promise for allowing Rukhsati was made but only after the Chehlum of Khursheed [late], is over.
12. With regard to the death of Plaintiff's mother, per Defendant's stand, she did not expire much-less, to say due to 'shock'/ 'worries' caused to her on account of Plaintiff's 'Non-Rukhsati', rather to say, she had died, on account of acute 'blood pressure' and 'heart attack' in a Hospital. The 'funeral ceremony' of the Plaintiff's mother, was also attended by the Defendant [Petitioner herein], as well as, his mother who is a real sister of the Plaintiff's deceased's mother. According to Defendant's version, this time, as well, after ten [10] days, from the death of Plaintiff's mother, the Defendant's mother had asked for 'Rukhsati' of the Plaintiff [Respondent No.3 herein], but then, also, as asserted, father of the Plaintiff had said that the matter of 'Rukhsati' would be dis-cussed later-on i.e. after Chehlum of Plaintiff's mother. On saying so, the Petitioner [Defendant] left for Peshawar, without taking 'Rukhsati' of Mst. Shehnaz daughter of Khalil-ur-Rehman.
13. Thereafter, some weeks' later, family members of the Defendant again requested to Plaintiff's father to give the 'Rukhsati' of Plaintiff but then, also the 'Rukhsati' of the Plaintiff was denied by demanding/imposing some new conditions i.e. [i]. 'Dower amount' must be of Rs.10 Lacs [ii]. 'Monthly Maintenance' amount must be of Rs.10,000/- per month and [3]. The 'gold ornaments' must be of 15 Tolas. Otherwise, the 'Rukhsati' of his daughter [Plaintiff], would not be allowed. Later-on, per Petitioner's stand, a letter dated 07.2.2012, was sent through registered A/D to Plaintiff's father, in which a request for effecting 'Rukhsati' of Plaintiff [Respondent No.3 herein], was made/reiterated. Moreover, in the said letter of 07.02.2012, imposition of new conditions was stated to be against the 'Sharia'. The father of Plaintiff, somehow, was no more interested in the 'Rukhsati' of the Plaintiff, though in this regard, repeatedly requests were made on the part of Defendant's kith and kin but to no avail.
14. In the legal notice dated 27.9.2012 [Exh.'A/1-B'], received to Defendant [Petitioner herein], from Plaintiff's side, a clear demand for 'Divorce' of the Plaintiff [Respondent No.3 herein] was made. The Defendant's father, thereafter, came to Karachi, along with his relatives namely [i] Muhammad Bashir and [ii]. his son named Shakeel Ahmed who also went to the house of the Plaintiff's father with an 'aim to resolve' the issue/dispute of 'Rukhsati' of the Plaintiff [Respondent No.3 herein] but then father of the Plaintiff stated/said that he has taken a Swear [QASAM] not to give 'Rukhsati' of Plaintiff to the Defendant. In this regard, as asserted in the 'written statement', the Petitioner's father had also approached some other 'relatives' / 'family members' of Plaintiff's father i.e. [i]. Shah Zaman who is the brother of Plaintiff's father and [ii]. Shafiq-ur-Rehman. Per Defendant's versions, they had also requested to the Plaintiff's father for allowing 'Rukhsati' of the Plaintiff [Respondent No.3 herein], but father of Respondent No.3 [Plaintiff] did not bother to even consider such requests.
15. In the 'written statement', it has further been asserted that after the Defendant's 'Nikah' his father and other family members always used to send 'gift items', as well as, 'cash amount' for/to the Plaintiff [Respondent No.3 herein] i.e. on each 'occasion of Eid' etc. as the Defendant's sister is also married at Karachi, as such, when the Defendant's family sent anything to his sister then, gift items, were also sent for the Plaintiff [Respondent No.3 herein], that is to say, sometime by hand and sometime through money order, despite the fact that the Plaintiff's 'Rukhsati' had not taken place. Per 'averments' made in the 'written statement', the Plaintiff is not entitled for any 'maintenance' as claimed, in Family Suit No.1653 of 2012 [Mst. Shahnaz v. Muhammad Arif], because it was the Plaintiff and her family, who not only refused the 'Rukhsati' but the Plaintiff herself had also refused/ avoided the performance of 'marital obligation' with the Defendant. The Plaintiff [Respondent No.3 herein], as such, is not entitled for recovery of any 'past maintenance' as claimed.

The Plaintiff [Respondent No.3 herein], as such, is not entitled for recovery of any 'past maintenance' as claimed.
16. Later on, when Family Suit No.1653 of 2012 [Mst. Shahnaz v. Muhammad Arif], came-up before the Court of learned Xth Family Judge, Karachi-West, for 'pre-trial' proceedings on 10.4.2013 then, the following order was passed :-
Case called. Today the matter is fixed for pre trial proceedings. The plaintiff is present with her counsel so also the defendant counsel is present. The plaintiff stated that she does not want to live with the defendant at any cost and request for dissolution of marriage by way of khulla and is ready of to forego her dower amount Rs.30,000/- which is still unpaid to her and rukhsati did not take place. On the other hand, the defendant in his written statement admitted that he had not paid the dower and his counsel contended that any appropriate order may be passed. [Emphasis Supplied].
The facts of the plaintiff case are the plaintiff filed a suit for dissolution of marriage by way of khulla and recovery of past maintenance against the defendant.
It is pertinent to mention here that in view of the amendment in section 10 of the W.P. Family Courts Act, 1964, Family Court in a suit for dissolution of marriage, if reconciliation fails, shall pass decree for dissolution of marriage for with and shall also restore the husband Haq Mehar received by the wife in consideration of marriage at the time of marriage.
Since, the dower is not disputed, thus no question of returning the same arises. Hence I hereby declare the pre-trial proceedings failed and dissolve the marriage between the plaintiff and defendant and from the pleading of parties following issues were framed:--
1. Whether no cause of action accrued to the plaintiff? [OPD]
2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled for maintenance, if so, at what rate and from which period?
3.What should the decree be?
Let the 'preliminary decree' be prepared and sent to the concerned authorities for information and compliance.
Announced in open court
Given under my hand and the seal of the court
This 10th--------day of--------April ------2013

[Mrs. Shehnaz Bohyo]
Xth Family Judge
Karachi West.
17. In compliance with the Order dated 10.4.2013, a 'PRELIMINARY DECREE', was accordingly prepared/ passed on 10.4.2013. The marriage of the Plaintiff [Respondent No.3 herein], namely Mst. Shahnaz daughter of Khalil-ur-Rehman with the Defendant namely Muhammad Arif son of Ali Asghar was thus dissolved. The Plaintiff in Family Suit No.1653 of 2012 [Mst. Shahnaz v. Muhammad Arif], thereafter, it appears, had filed her own 'Affidavit-in-Evidence' on 27.11.2012, wherein, the 'averments' and 'assertions' vis-a-vis 'dissolution of her marriage' with Defendant [Petitioner herein] and he claim pleaded/put forward for 'MAINTENANCE' in plaint were 're-affirmed'/'reiterated'. Later on, the Plaintiff's 'Examination-in-Chief' and 'Cross-Examination' was recorded on 17.9.2013. In the Plaintiff's 'Examination-in-Chief', the deponent namely Mst. Shehnaz [PW-1] besides, producing here 'Affidavit-in-Evidence' as Exh 'P/1-A' also produced here 'Nikahnama' dated 24.12.1999, 'TCS Receipt' and 'Legal Notice' dated 24.09.2012 as Exh. 'P/1-B' and Exh. 'P/1-C'. Thereafter, the evidence of Plaintiff's 2nd witness namely Muhammad Saleem ['PW-2'], was recorded on 12.11.2013 and thereafter, Plaintiffs side of evidence was closed.
18. The Family Suit No.1653 of 2012 [Mst. Shahnaz v. Muhammad Arif] thereafter, was posted for Defendant's side of evidence on 02.12.2013. On 02.12.2013 and thereafter, on so many dates right upto 27.08.2014, the Family suit was adjourned for one reason or the other. On 27.08.2014, an Application for re-opening of the Plaintiff's side of evidence was filed, as then, the Plaintiff wanted to examine a 3rd witness namely Muhammad Shafiq. On 05.10.2019 the Defendant filed, objections in response to the Plaintiff's such Application. On 29.01.2014 the said application was heard and allowed. For ready reference, Order dated 29.01.2016 is reproduced herein-below:-
"By this order, I intend to dispose of an application for re-opening the side of the Plaintiff to examine her witness namely Muhammad Shafiq, which is filed by Plaintiff through her counsel notice of said application was duly served upon defendant learned counsel for Plaintiff contended that this Hon'ble court may be pleased to reopen her side of Plaintiff of witness her side of evidence and permit her to examine her witness namely Muhammad Shafiq in this suit as earlier due to bonafide mistake of advocate for Plaintiff he closed her side of evidence but later on when the Plaintiff informed her advocate that she wants to examine her important witness Muhammad Shafiq who is brother of the Plaintiff and he can depose properly in respect of documents which were filed by the defendant in this case with his written statement hence he is important witness therefore he may be examined in the interest of Justice earlier her father was cited as such witness but he then. Hence, now her brother is important witness in this case.
Learned counsel for the Plaintiff relied upon the case reported as Umar Hayat v. Additional District Judge and others (2004 SCMR 1637 Supreme Court of Pakistan), Mrs Shahnaz Begum and 4 others (1995 CLC 327 LHR), Mrs. Hidayat Khatoon v. Munir Ahmed and others (1999 MLD 2153 KHI), Abdul Khaleeq v. Rashid Ahmed (1999 MLD 2156 LHR) respectively.
On the other hand, the defendant filed counter affidavit through his counsel wherein he submitted that application for reopening the side of the Plaintiff to examine her witness is not maintainable as the same had been filed without mentioning the proper section of law. He next stated that the name of deposed witness had not been mentioned in the list of the witnesses of the Plaintiff. He next submitted that reason had not been explained in the application that the said witness is necessary and affective. He next submitted that the application is only filed to pressurized the defendant. He next submitted that the said application had been filed without any valid reasons. He further stated that the said application had been filed without any valid reasons. He further stated that the said application is groundless and the same is liable to be dismissed.
Considering the above facts and circumstances, it would be better to give ample opportunity to the Plaintiff to contest the matter rather than to decide the case on technical ground as law would favour adjudication on merits. With regard to contention of production of the witness the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 could not be confined to Plaints only both Plaintiff and defendant could be allowed to produce evidence beyond the list appended with the pleadings. Thus, keeping this view in the interest of justice and to decide the case on merit the Plaintiff application is hereby allowed subject to payment of a sum of Rs.500/- as cost by the Plaintiff to the defendant and order dated 12-11-2013 is hereby recalled, the Plaintiff is also allowed to produce the witness namely Muhammad Shafiq to establish her claim. The Plaintiff is directed to produce the witness till the next date of hearing without fail. [Emphasis Supplied]."
19. On granting the aforesaid Application on 29.01.2016 the 'affidavit-in-evidence' of Plaintiff's 3rd witness namely Muhammad Shafiq son of Khalilur Rehman ['PW-3'], was filed on 16.02.2016. Lateron, on 17.04.2016, his evidence was also recorded. Thereafter, Plaintiff's side of evidence, i.e. after recording of Plaintiff's evidence ['PW-1'] and other two [2] witnesses i.e. ['PW-2' and 'PW-3'], was closed in presence of Defendant's counsel and then, the case was put-up to 23.04.2016, for Defendant's side of evidence. On 23.04.2016, for want of Defendant's side evidence, the case was put-up to 29.04.2016. On 29.04.2016, again none was present from the Defendant's side. Nonetheless, then, also as 'last' and 'final' chance, the case was adjourned to 16.05.2016. Once again for the same purpose, the case was adjourned to 30.05.2016. Again on 30.05.2016 as a 'last' and 'final' chance, the case was adjourned to 21.07.2016. On 21.07.2016, again the case was put-up to 11.08.2016 for Defendant's evidence. Even, thereafter again and again, the case was posted/fixed for Defendant's evidence that is to say from 11.8.2016 till 26.11.2016.
20. From the record, it reveals that later on, the Family Suit No.1653 of 2012 [Mst. Shahnaz v. Muhammad Arif], was transferred from the Court of learned VIIIth Family Judge, Karachi-West, to the Court of learned IXth Civil/Family Judge and JM, Karachi-West, vide order dated 23.11.2016, passed by learned District and Sessions Judge, Karachi-West. On transfer of the suit, when the Family Suit No.1653 of 2012 [Mst. Shahnaz v. Muhammad Arif], came-up before the Court of learned IXth Civil/Family Judge and JM, Karachi-West, on 02.12.2016, for Defendant's side of evidence then, again, as a 'last' and 'final' chance, the Family Suit, was adjourned to 16.12.2016, for recording of Defendant's evidence. Even thereafter, on 10.12.2016, the Defendant, failed and/or avoided to come forward and record his evidence. The Defendant's side of evidence, under the foregoing circumstances, was 'closed' and resultantly, the suit was fixed on 14.12.2016 for 'POST TRIAL PROCEEDINGS'. Lastly, on 17.01.2017, when the Family Suit No.1653 of 2012 came-up before the Court of learned IXth Civil/Family Judge, Karachi-West, then, the 'Post Trial Proceedings' were declared as failed. For ready reference, order dated 17.01.2017, is reproduced herein-below:-
"Case called. Counsel for plaintiff is present. None is present from defendant side. Perusal of record shows that matter was fixed for post-trial proceedings but neither Plaintiff nor Defendant appeared before this Court. Therefore, post-trial proceedings failed. Now the matter is fixed for final arguments on next date of hearing."
21. As a routine, even on 17.01.2017, none was present from the Defendant's side. Nonetheless, then, the case was posted for 'arguments' on 17.01.2017. Per record, thereafter, for the same purpose, on nine [9] occasions i.e. from 17.01.2017 to 17.04.2017, the case was adjourned. As per earlier 'LATE DIARY' dated 10.12.2016, the Defendant [Petitioner herein], had opted to file an Application for re-opening of Defendant's side of evidence/ recalling of order dated 10.12.2016, whereby, not only the Defendant's side of evidence was closed, but the Application for re-opening the Defendant's side of evidence was also dismissed. The relevant part of Order dated 17.01.2017, reads as follows:--
...
"The learned counsel for the defendant filed an application for adjournment where it has been on record that since long defendant is absent and since last four dates of hearing matter is fixed for evidence of the defendant but on each and every date an adjournment application is filed on the date of hearing. The defendant if did not appear his side shall be closed. Last chance was then given but today again, is the same position. The application filed by the learned counsel for the defendant stands dismissed and the side of defendant is hereby closed.
22. The Family Suit No.1653 of 2012 [Mst. Shahnaz v. Muhammad Arif] thereafter, was coming-up for 'final arguments'. Lastly, on 17.04.2017, when the said suit was fixed for 'final arguments', then the Defendant's counsel, opted to file another Application for re-calling/setting aside of order dated 10.12.2016, as being evident from the Late Diary of 17.4.2016. The said Application, later on, was 'allowed' on 27.4.2016, however, subject to a condition that the Petitioner herein [Defendant], be produced within fifteen [151 days for recording his evidence and in case of his 'failure' heavy cost shall be awarded. Then, as appears, the case for such purpose, was adjourned to 13.05.2017.
23. On 13.05.2017, counsel for the Defendant's, filed an 'Affidavit-in-Evidence' and copy thereof, was supplied to the Plaintiff's counsel. The matter, thereafter, was adjourned to 29.05.2017, for recording of Defendant's evidence but again, as a 'last' and 'final chance'. Being relevant, Order dated 29.05.2017, is also reproduced herein-below:--
Learned counsel for defendant filed application for adjournment. Learned counsel for the plaintiff also present. The photocopy of the certificate also annexed with the application. It shows that the matter is pending since 2012 and defendant filed his affidavit in evidence on 13.5.2017. In the above circumstances the application is allowed with the condition that on next date of hearing if the defendant does not appear his side shall be closed and cost of Rs.5000/- shall also be imposed [Emphasis Supplied].
24. Even thereafter, the Family Suit was adjourned on 'several occasions' i.e. 04.07.2017, 26.07.2017 and 09.08.2017, for want of Defendant's evidence. Some of the 'more relevant' trial court's diaries i.e. 10.12.2016, 17.01.2017, 25.04.2017, 27.04.2017, 29.05.2017 and 17.08.2017, are reproduced herein-below respectively:-

25. On 16.09.2017, the Family Suit No.1653 of 2012 [Mst. Shahnaz v. Muhammad Arif], was consequently decreed in the following manner:
[i] The Defendant is directed to pay maintenance of the Plaintiff at the rate of Rs.25,000/- per month for 3 years [total Rs.900,000/-] within one month [excluding deposited amount, if any];
[ii]. Cost shall follow the events.
26. Not only the 'assertions' made in the plaint but the evidence led from the Plaintiff's side, in support of her stand/claim, as well, was gone un-rebutted, as Defendant [Petitioner herein] failed to establish his stand. The Plaintiff's Suit No.1653 of 2012 [Mst. Shahnaz v. Muhammad Arif], for recovery of 'past maintenance', against the Defendant, was consequently decreed on 16.09.2017, in the above manner by the learned IXth Civil and Family Judge Karachi-West, after giving the brief facts in the background as follows:-
"The Plaintiff performed Nlkah with the defendant on 21.12.1999 at Karachi per sharia against the dower amount of Rs.30000/- but Rukhsati never took over Nikahnama was registered by the defendant and said that if the Nikahnama will be registered he will seek accommodation for the residence as the defendant is working in Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Islamabad and as per their rules for the accommodation, he has to submit the registered Nikahnama. Therefore, father of the plaintiff continuously requested the parents of the defendant for Rukhsati but they always gave lame excuses and sought time. Lastly, before the filing of the present suit before 8 months, father of plaintiff strictly asked the defendant's family for Rukhsati but defendant refused to perform the Rukhsati after 13 years of the Nikah, Hence the present suit was filed by the plaintiff with the following prayers:
[a] To direct the defendant for performing of the marriage or alternative the plaintiff be awarded Khula in lieu of dower amount.
[b] To direct the defendant to pay the past maintenance of the plaintiff at the rate of Rs.30,000/- per month since 24.12.1999 which approx. calculated Rs.40,80,000/- for the last 156 months till the Order of the khula.
[c] To direct the defendant to pay maintenance in addition as per condition of Nikahnama at the rate of Rs.2,000/- per month of last 156 months.
[d] Any other or further relief[s] which this Honourable Court may be pleased to grant under the circumstances of the case.
The defendant was served and filed his written statement. The Defendant besides denying the adverse allegations admitted the factum of marriage. The defendant stated that the father of plaintiff was not ready for performing the Rukhsati of the plaintiff. Plaintiff has not performed any legal duty of defendant. It is all fault of the plaintiff that the Rukhsati could not take place. Lastly, he prayed for dismissal of the suit of the plaintiff.
27. Upon passing of Decree on 16.09.2017, the Defendant [Petitioner herein], instead of paying the 'decretal amount' somehow, feeling himself 'aggrieved' by and 'dis-satisfied' with judgment and decree, opted to file Family Appeal No.101 of 2017 [Muhammad Arif v. Mst. Shahnaz], before the court of learned Addl. District Judge No.VIII Karachi-West 'inter alia' with a prayer for setting aside the Judgment and decree dated 16.09.2017, whereby, the Plaintiff's suit was decreed. The prayers sought in the Memo of Appeal No.101 of 2017 [Muhammad Arif v. Mst. Shahnaz], reads as follows:--
In view of the above, it is therefore, very respectfully prayed that this appeal may very kindly be accepted and impugned judgment dated 16.09.2017 and decree may very graciously be set-aside in the interest of justice after calling record and proceedings from the trial Court.
It is further prayed that the matter may very graciously be remanded to the trial Court for decision afresh after hearing the appellant and opportunity may be given to the appellant.
Any other relief/relives this Hon'ble Court may be deem fit and proper in the circumstances, of the case in the interest of justice.
.
28. The aforesaid Family Appeal No.101 of 2017 [Muhammad Arif v. Mst. Shahnaz], when came-up before the learned VIIIth Addl. District Judge and Sessions Judge Karachi-West, on 30.08.2018, then, upon hearing learned counsel for the parties, the same was dismissed, however, with no order as to costs. The 'material portion' of the Appellate's court judgment dated 30.08.2018 passed in Family Appeal No.101 of 2017, reads as follows:
Primarily, under section 277 of Muhammadan Law, a husband is bound to maintain his wife unless she is too young for matrimonial intercourse, so long she is faithful to him and obeys his reasonable orders. In the present case, the nikahnama reveals that the girl/respondent was 18 years old and since no rukhsati had taken place, thus, the question of faithfulness and obeying the orders does not strictly applicable to the case. Even, if we consider the contention of the learned appellant's counsel that in absence of rukhsati no maintenance can be given, because no favour had extended from wife to husband, respectfully is misconceived. In his book namely Digest of Muhammadan Law Baillie has mentioned that;
"when an adult women, who has not yet removed to her husband's house, ask for maintenance, she is entitled to it unless he has called upon her to remove;"
This shows that mere fact of no rukhsati would not debar a wife from claiming her maintenance unless she refuses to remove herself from her father's house on the orders of husband. In this case, respondent took plea that it was on the part of appellant that he did not called for rukhsati and she waited for 13 years. From the available evidence, especially the letter of appellant's father, it is not difficult to deduce that there was some delay on the party of appellant's side, which the father of the appellant tried to clarify. The appellant on the other hand, though cross-examined, the respondent/plaintiff, but chose nor to lead his evidence or produce any witness, which goes against his plea. It cannot be ignored that in our society the age of a girl is very crucial for the purpose of marriage and it is not difficult to foresee what actually went through the lady who waited for 13 years after nikkah for her rukhsati and indeed from the record she got married in 2017 at the age of 36 years of age. Thus, without any doubt, I am of the view that appellant being husband of the respondent was bound to maintain his wife and in the given circumstances when he had failed to prove that rukhsati was on account of failure of respondent side.
The learned trial court had fixed the amount of maintenance at Rs.25,000/- per month, which in my view is not exorbitant keeping in view that appellant is serving in BPS-20 in a prestigious department and his salary would not be less than Rs.200,000/- at present. Though the amount so decreed by the court cannot be a compensation for a time respondent had suffered, but at least in accordance with law, some compensation would relieve her pain [Emphasis Supplied].
Moreover, the instant family appeal is also not maintainable on account of non-payment of Court fee. It is admitted position that appeal is not filed on any stamp paper. I have gone through the case law of Hameeda Begum v. 1st ADJ and another [1988 CLC 1645] whereby Honourable Divisional Bench hold that Family Court is in fact a civil Court and any appeal under section 14 of Family Court Act filed before District Court falls under Article 1 of Schedule 1 of Court Fees Act and in case of non-payment, the appeal is liable to be dismissed. Thus, on the basis of above observations, the point No.1 is answered as Negative.
(Point No.1 was/is to the effect and extent as to Whether the Judgment and decree dated 16.09.2017, passed by the learned 9th Family Judge Karachi-West, in Family Suit No.1653 of 2012 suffers from any illegality and require interference?'
.
29. The Petitioner herein, [Defendant], once again feeling 'aggrieved' by and 'dis-satisfied' with the 'concurrent findings' of the courts below, has now approached this Hon'ble court by way of filing the instant Constitutional Petition No.S-2342 of 2018, [Muhammad Arif son of Ali Asghar v. Additional Sessions Judge No. VIII Karachi West and others], 'inter alia' with a prayer that 'Judgment' and 'decree' passed by the learned IXth Civil and Family Judge Karachi-West [Annexure 'E/3' to the MoP] and maintained by the learned Additional District Judge, Karachi-West, through the 'impugned judgment' of 30.08.2018, herein [Annexure 'A' to the MoP], be set aside, as the same, besides being erroneous have been passed 'contrary to law' and without properly appreciating the 'materials'/'evidence' available on record. Further, both the impugned 'Judgments' and 'Decrees' (Annexure 'A' and 'E/3' to the MoP] even otherwise, are bad in law, as per the Petitioner's version, the 'MONEY DECREE', in fact has been passed without affording a chance to the Petitioner herein [Defendant], to 'examine' himself on oath.
30. On 29.10.2018, when the instant Constitutional Petition No.S-2342/ 2018 [Muhammad Arif son of Ali Asghar v. Additional Sessions Judge No. VIII Karachi West and others], came-up before this Court, on the Petitioner's urgent Application, then while, granting the urgent Application, the following order was passed:
29.10.2018
Mr. Altamash Faisal, Advocate for the Petitioner.
-----
1. Granted.
2. Deferred till the next date of hearing.
3. Granted subject to just all legal objections.
4&5. Per learned counsel for petitioner, petitioner and Respondent No.3 married on 24.12.1999, but no Rukhsati took place till this date. However, per learned counsel for the petitioner Respondent No.3 filed Family Suit No.1653/2012 in the Court of X Family Judge, Karachi West for dissolution of marriage by way of Khulla and recovery of past maintenance. Per learned counsel for the petitioner, petitioner contested the aforesaid suit but as petitioner was posted at Haripur, therefore, he could not contest the suit properly and his evidence was not recorded, though he filed affidavit-in-evidence but was not cross-examined before the trial Court. The trial Court on 16.09.2017 decided the matter and partly decreed the suit of the Respondent No.3 by judgment dated 16.09.2017. Per learned counsel for the petitioner, petitioner filed Family Appeal No.101/2017 against the aforesaid judgment in the Court of District Judge, Karachi West and by judgment dated 30.08.2018, learned Additional Sessions Judge No.8, Karachi West, dismissed the appeal. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the judgments of both the trial Court and Appellate Court are patently illegal as no Rukhsati took place therefore, awarding the maintenance is illegal and unlawful. Point raised requires consideration. Issue notice to the Respondent No.3. Subject to furnishing of surety to the extent of Rs.900,000/- [Rupees Nine Lacs], to the satisfaction of the Nazir of this Court, operation of the impugned judgments/decree shall remain suspended till the next date of hearing. [Emphasis Supplied].
Adjourned to 19.11.2018.

31. It appears that pursuant to and in compliance with order dated 29.10.2018, the 'requisite security' was not furnished. The 'non-furnishing' of the security/ surety is evident from the 'endorsement' of Deputy Nazir dated 23.11.2018 and 18.12.2018. Nonetheless, when later on, the matter came-up before the court on 21.05.2019, then, it was observed that order dated 29.10.2018, does not rule-out a 'Bank Guarantee' and resultantly Nazir of this Court was directed to accept the same. Accordingly, Bank Guarantee bearing No.ABL-176PB181025 dated 18.07.2019, M/s. Askari Bank Limited Sumbalhag Branch, 'Kahutta', in the sum of Rs.9,00,000/ - [Rupees Nine Lac only], was accepted. The Deputy Nazir report dated 13.09.2019, in this regard reads as follows:
NAZIR'S ENDORSEMENT IN COMPLIANCE OF COURT'S ORDER DATED 30.08.2019
In compliance of Court's order dated 30.08.2019, Bank Guarantee bearing No.3ABL-176PB181025 dated 18.07.2019 furnished by the authorized officers namely Messrs Hafiz Muhammad Fareed Haseeb son of Muhammad Haseeb and Syed Asif Haider son of Syed Razi Haider of Askari Bank Limited, Sumbalhag Branch Kahuta in the sum of Rs.9,00,000/- [Rupees Nine Lac only] on behalf of Petitioner vide Bond No.80149 dated 12.09.2019. This Guarantee has been accepted after obtaining NOC regarding amount from the learned counsel for Respondents
32. Lastly, on 23.10.2019 and 29.11.2019, when the above Constitutional Petition came-up before me then, I heard Mr. Altamash along with Mr. Muhammad Rehan, learned counsel for the Petitioner herein [Defendant] and Mian Muhammad Akram, learned counsel for Respondent No.3 herein [Plaintiff] and also gone through the available record before me minutely, with the valuable assistance of learned counsel for the parties.
33. Mr. Altmash Arab, learned counsel for the Petitioner [Defendant] while, arguing the case of the Petitioner forcefully, contended that both the courts below have badly failed while, passing the 'impugned' judgments and decrees [Annexure 'A' and 'A/3' to the MoP] to either properly apply their judicial mind and/or otherwise, to appreciate the 'evidence' / 'materials' available on record in its' 'true perspective'. Per learned counsel, both the courts in fact have erred in law while, deciding the matter without considering the 'contents' of the Defendant's 'written statement' and 'affidavit-in-evidence' merely for the reason that the Petitioner herein [Defendant], has failed to appear, lead evidence and put himself to 'cross-examination' before the trial court in Family Suit No.1653 of 2012 [Mst. Shehnaz daughter of Khalil ur Rehman v. Muhammad Arif].
34. According to Altamash Arab, learned counsel for the Petitioner herein [Defendant], both the 'impugned Judgments' and 'Decrees' are not only suffering from 'mis-reading', 'non-reading' of evidence but the same are also bad on account of material 'irregularities' and 'illegalities' committed by both the courts below. Per learned counsel, the Petitioner [Defendant] though accepts in his 'written statement'/ 'Affidavit-in-Evidence' the factum of his 'Nikah' with Respondent No.3 [Plaintiff] on 24.12.1999 but as far as 'Rukhsati' of Mst. Shahnaz daughter of Khalil-ur-Rehman, is concerned, the same could not take place as Respondent No.3's parents despite all possible efforts on the part of Petitioner [Defendant], did not agree to allow.
35. Per Mr. Altamash Arab, learned counsel for the Petitioner, Respondent No.3, namely Mst. Shahnaz daughter of Khalil-ur-Rehman nevertheless, has failed to establish that her Non-'Rukhsati' in any manner was on account of the Petitioner's failure. Per learned counsel, the 'burden of proof' in this regard was lying on the shoulder of Respondent No.3 [Plaintiff] which burden, as evident from the record, has not been discharged satisfactorily. According to Mr. Altamash Arab, the learned Additional District and Sessions Judge No.VIII Karachi-West, somehow, in an erroneous way, shifted the burden of proving of 'Non-Rukhsati', on the shoulders of Petitioner herein [Defendant] though it was solely and squarely lying on the shoulder of Respondent No.3 [Plaintiff], as it was she who approached the court of law by instituting legal proceedings i.e. Family Suit No.1653 of 2012 [Mst. Shehnaz daughter of Khalil ur Rehman v. Muhammad Arif], before the Family Court. Filing of legal proceedings also amounts to refusal.
36. Mr. Altamash Arab, learned counsel for the Petitioner herein [Defendant], while, continuing his arguments next contended that the learned Appellate Court i.e. learned Additional District and Sessions Judge No.VIII Karachi-West, has erred in interpreting the contents of letter dated 07.02.2012, written by the Petitioner's father to Respondent No.3's father. Per learned counsel, bare reading of the letter would show that the admission of delay from the Petitioner's side was only with a view to maintain the existing 'cordial' and 'good relationship'.
37. Mr. Altamash Arab, learned counsel for the Petitioner herein [Defendant], next contended that even, awarding of 'maintenance' in the sum of Rs.25,000/- [Twenty Five Thousand only], per month towards' 'Past Maintenance' of Respondent No.3 [Plaintiff], is without any 'justification', as in the case in hand, the marriage has not consummated as Rukhsati has never taken place. For this reason, as well, awarding of 'maintenance amount to Mst. Shahnaz daughter of Khalil-ur-Rehman, is contrary to law. In the case in hand, the 'Rukhsati' of Respondent No.3 [Plaintiff] since performance of her Nikah on 24.12.1999 with the Petitioner did not take place upto 27.11.2012, when a Family Suit No.1653/2012 [Mst. Shehnaz daughter of Khalil ur Rehman v. Muhammad Arif], for 'dissolution of marriage by way of Khulla' and recovery of 'past maintenance', was filed before the court of Xth Family/Civil Judge at Karachi-West. The grant of 'maintenance amount', without 'consummation' of marriage, per Mr. Altamash Arab, learned counsel for the Petitioner [Defendant], besides, being illegal is un-justified.
38. Mr. Altamash Arab, learned counsel for the Petitioner [Defendant] in support of his contentions placed reliance on the cases of [i] Mst. Rubina Bibi v. Muhammad Bashir Ahmed [2006 ylr 633] [ii]. Syed Rashid Ali Shah v. Mst. Haleema Bibi and 2 others [PLD 2014 Peshawar 226]. The relevant portions therefrom, on which reliance has been placed by Mr. Altamash Arab, learned counsel for the Petitioner [Defendant], are as follows:
[i] 2006 ylr 633:-
6. Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 is silent so far as past maintenance is concerned, therefore, the Court while interpreting the statute must keep in mind the intention of the Legislature. A wife who does not bother to live with her husband and perform her marital obligation is not entitled for the grant of maintenance allowance. Here in this case the petitioner lived separately and even has not performed the marital obligations in spite of decree for restitution of conjugal rights in favour of the respondent No.1. For what has been discussed above, I find that respondent No.2 has rightly passed the detailed order which needs no interference by this Court in Constitutional petition. Instant writ petition fails and the same is hereby dismissed. [Emphasis supplied]
[ii]. PLD 2014 PESHAWAR 226:-
8. Beside that the perusal of the judgments of the trial court reflects that on failure of pre-trial reconciliation proceedings, marriage of the parties was dissolved vide order dated 24.2.2007 and thereafter issues were framed and parties were put to trial for recording pro and contra evidence. The only provision which empowers the Family Court to dissolve the marriage of the parties in such manner is Proviso to section 10(4) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, which for ready reference and to properly appreciate the legal aspect of the case is reproduced herein below:-
"10. Pre-trial Proceeding.--
(1) ..
(2) ..
(3) ..
(4) ..
Provided that notwithstanding any decision or judgment of any court or tribunal, the Family Court in a suit for dissolution of marriage, if reconciliation fails, shall pass decree for dissolution of marriage forthwith and also restore the husband the Haq Mehr received by the wife in consideration of marriage at the time of marriage". [Emphasis supplied]
9. Bare reading of the proviso envisages that in case of failure of reconciliation at pre-trial stage, the court shall not only pass a decree for dissolution of marriage forthwith but also restore the husband the Haq Mahr, received by the wife in consideration of marriage. In view of this legal position when it was crystal clear before the trial court that Rukhsati had not taken place and the plaintiff wife is not willing to live with the husband in compliance of her marital obligation and the trial court due to the same reason, reached to a conclusion that re-union of the parties is impossible, had dissolved the marriage at pre-trial reconciliation stage, it was obligatory to restore Mahr/dower to husband received by the wife and there was no reason to go ahead with the trial to determine cruelty of the husband, which as observed earlier, was nothing else except second marriage of the petitioner/defendant. Whereas the sam

Though the provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 are not stricto sensu applicable to family matters, but exhibited salary slip was bereft of any strength and evidentiary value---If salary slip had been an official/attested/verified document, then situation would have been different, but genuine origination and sanctity of exhibited salary slip was not of required standards for being relied upon---In the circumstances, the Courts below had no option but to believe the evidence produced by the respondent (plaintiff / mother) regarding immediate necessities of claimants of maintenance allowance and fixing up same keeping in light the petitioner's obligations as well---No ground whatsoever was available to substitute the concurrent findings of courts below.

[10/26/25, 4:06:00 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The question which requires determination by this Court is that where a Nikah between the spouses has been performed, however, the marriage is not consummated as the Rukhsati has not taken place, in such an eventuality, whether a wife is entitled to maintenance allowance? 

Under section 5 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 (Ordinance), every marriage solemnized under the Act has to be registered and once a man and a woman enters into a marital bond they become HUSBAND and WIFE. Section 9 of the Ordinance spells out that where a HUSBAND fails to maintain his WIFE, she in addition to seeking other legal remedies (as contemplated in West Pakistan Family Courts Act 1964) can also seek maintenance allowance. It shall not be out of place to mention here that no condition of Rukhasti or consummation of marriage has been mentioned therein. 

The delinquency as to not seeking Rukhsati or not performing the marital obligations/conjugal rights is on part of the husband as wife was ready and willing to perform her marital obligations/conjugal rights being the lawfully wedded wife , thus, she has rightly been held entitled to maintenance allowance from the period when the Nikah was solemnized.

Adult son is also entitled to get maintenance.

Obligation of the father to maintain his adult son who has not yet accomplished basic education, enabling him to earn his livelihood, may be considered by the court in an appropriate case, a factor falling with the exception to the general rule (supra). 

Education is the necessary qualification which is required to a person to enable him to earn bread and butter. It does not include higher studies and studies abroad. From the analysis of above referred case laws, this Court has observed that the learned (naeem)Trial Court has to ascertain in the light of evidence of the parties as to which extent the father is bound to pay the educational expenses of an adult son. While doing so, following points must be taken into account by the learned Trial Court:- 

i) First and the foremost consideration is the capacity and financial status of father.  

ii) Age and conduct of the adult son.  

iii) Whether the adult son has his own resources to sustain his studies.  

iv) The nature and stage of studies.  

v) Academic performance of adult and his passion & zeal towards the education 

vi) The extent of education which is essential to enable him to earn his livelihood. Obviously, this shall not include the higher studies, especially studies abroad without there being a promise by the father to support him. 

vii) Whether the son gives due respect and show regard to his father and in any case is not disobedient or estranged man.  

It shall also be determined by the learned Trial Court after recording evidence of the parties and analyzing (naeem)status of the father as to whether the adult sons are entitled to receive maintenance allowance or not. 

No doubt the court may at any stage of the proceedings, either upon or without the application of either party, and on such terms as may appear to the court be just, order that the name of any party improperly joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, be struck out. The party who has no connection with the relief sought may be struck off from the record as a party.(naeem) The court can also strike out a party over whom it has no jurisdiction. Whether a party is to be struck out or not is to be determined on the basis of plaint as framed. The word „Party‟ has been defined in West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964

Mutation not challenged in life time of donee, could not be challged after his death by his legal heirs.
This is not a case of inheritance. The appellants have challenged the mutation, gift deed and Tamleek Nama on the ground of fraud with the contention that those were got sanctioned to deprive the appellants. This is also interesting that the owner who transferred the properties through mutations, gift deed and Tamleek Nama all pertains to the years 1949 and 1976. Said owner remained alive till the year 1991 and this factor has not been denied in any way by the appellants. The registered instruments were challenged by the appellants after decays through institution of suit on 10.10.2000. In such like cases, it is sine qua non for the seeker to stand on its own legs, who cannot be benefitted for weaknesses, if any, of the adversary. 
 The registered document attaches sanctity and there is no ground to disbelieve those documents. The other important question in this proposition was the locus standi to the appellants to agitate/challenge those mutations after a period of more than 30/40 years. The owner remained alive for remarkable period and appellants did not challenge anything in his life time. Inheritance opens after death of the owner of the property and not during the life. These mutations were sanctioned during life time of the owner. Being descendants definitely appellants have no locus standi to challenge the aforesaid mutations.

The scope of Section 100 is limited as demonstrated above i.e. a decision should be contrary to law or to some usage having the force of law; that the decision failed to determine some material issue in that regard; a substantial error or defect in the procedure provided by the Code or any other law for the time being in force, which may possibly have produced error or defect in the decision of the case upon the merits.

Undoubtedly, the specific performance is a relief which is dependent on the discretion of the Court. The Court has to assess the equity based on material facts deposed/brought on record in the case. As could be seen a suit for performance was filed in respect of four plots on the basis of an agreement; a part of the amount claimed to have been paid but a substantial amount remained unpaid up until decision of the suit. Only judgment of trial Court directed respondent to deposit the consideration after about seven years of litigation. The primary duty of the trial Court was to see whether the buyer seeking performance of the agreement was “at the relevant time” willing to perform his part of the contract. Prima facie the balance payment was never deposited by the respondent till decision is made by the trial Court, which is a sign of unwillingness on his part. He kept the money with him for his own use and to the contrary the value of the plots also enhanced with the passage of time many fold as adjudged by trial Court. The respondent/plaintiff seeking performance cannot have two bites of cherry i.e. he would enjoy the enhanced value of the plots and would also retain the balance consideration for his own use. The trial Court attempted an equity by directing the respondent to pay the balance of the sale consideration in respect of three plots by enhancing the balance sale consideration up to 12% per annum. The trial Court failed to appreciate that it was a deal of four plots together; initial amount was paid to all four individuals hence learned Judge cannot on his own wisdom consider it to be a part consideration for three plots ignoring the plot of a lady who was arrayed as defendant No.4 who later expired after execution of the agreement and retained part of consideration. The adjustment of initial amount towards three plots is only imaginary.

Mr. Muhammad Muzammil Qureshi, Advocate for the Respondent No. 2.

Date of hearing: 24.1.2023.

Judgment

Succinctly, a decree for recovery of maintenance allowance was passed against Aulad Hussain, deceased on 06.12.2008, which was upheld upto High Court as writ petition was dismissed on 29.06.2010. After dismissal of the writ petition, the judgment debtor transferred his property through Mutations No. 1859 dated 27.09.2010 and 1871 dated 09.10.2010 on the basis of alleged gift; therefore, the petitioners moved an application before the learned Executing Court for cancellation of said mutations and recovery of decretal amount of maintenance allowance. The said application was resisted by the rival party; however, the learned Executing Court allowed the said application on 09.02.2016. The respondents being aggrieved preferred an appeal and the same was accepted vide impugned judgment dated 04.05.2016 and application ibid was dismissed; hence, the instant revision petition.

2. Heard.

3. The said question has been answered by the Apex Court of the country in a judgment reported as Amjad Iqbal v. Mst. Nida Sohail and others (2015 SCMR 128), by holding that:

‘The Executing Court through its order dated 14.05.2011 declared such Hiba to be unlawful and such order of the Executing Court appears to have been maintained by the revisional Court. Once the Hiba itself was declared to be unlawful, any further transaction on the basis of the said Hiba could only be a nullity in the eye of law for that the donee of the Hiba did not have legal title to the house to sell the same to the petitioner. Both Hiba as well as the purported sale in favour of the petitioner were nothing but sham transactions and its purpose was to ensure that the decree is not satisfied. The decree was nothing but for the maintenance of Resondent No. 2’s own minor daughter. Unfortunately, the Respondent No. 2 in sheer disregard of his parental obligation has indulged in making all these unlawful transactions. What intent the Respondent No. 2 had in his mind but to starve his own minor daughter of her basic needs for survival. The Court while exercising parental jurisdiction cannot just sit and be a spectator in this unholy and unlawful conduct of the Respondent No. 2.’

In the present case, the deceased judgment debtor Aulad Hussain transferred the property, owned by him through disputed mutations No. 1859 dated 27.09.2010 and 1871 dated 09.10.2010 on the basis of alleged gift, after dismissal of his writ petition by this Court, which seems to be nothing but an attempt to frustrate the decree passed against him. Therefore, the learned Executing Court was vested with jurisdiction to undo the said illegal act committed by the deceased

Aulad Hussain and rightly cancelled the said mutations by allowing application, filed by the petitioners in this regard. As such, the learned appellate Court has failed to exercise its vested jurisdiction as per mandate of law and has committed illegality while passing the impugned judgment dated 04.05.2016, which cannot be allowed to hold field further. Resultantly, the revision petition in hand is accepted, impugned judgment dated 04.05.2016 passed by the learned appellate Court is set aside and order dated 09.02.2016 passed by the learned Executing Court is restored. No order as to the costs.

S.162 of Land Revenue  Act clearly manifests that ninety days are prescribed in filing of appeal against the order of the Commissioner to the Board of Revenue. Pertinently, provision of Section 167 of the “Act” having expressly providing that limitation shall be governed by the provisions of Limitation Act, 1908 in filing of appeal, review or revision filed under this Act. 
The exercise of constitutional jurisdiction in terms of Article 199 of the “Constitution” is discretionary which can only be invoked in extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. The Petitioners have badly failed to point out any illegality or material irregularity in the impugned order, warranting interference by this Court in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction. This Court while invoking its constitutional jurisdiction always exercises restraint in interfering with the judgment or order passed in exercise of revisional jurisdiction unless some perversity or patent illegality is floating on the surface of record. The constitutional jurisdiction can only be exercised in such an eventuality if the impugned judgment or order suffers with certain legal infirmities or patent illegalities, resulting into failure of justice.

The following queries arise for our consideration: 

Question No= 01
.............................
i)  In the context of capital punishments, is it permissible for convictions to be predicated on circumstantial evidence? 

Answer:
............
In order to adjudicate the question No. (i) supra, it is now widely accepted that punishment can be imposed based on circumstantial evidence; however, it is subject to rigorous standards and principles. Conviction exclusively on the basis of circumstantial evidence is not prohibited by law. Nevertheless, the quality and sufficiency of the evidence are more important than its quantity. The circumstantial evidence must be of a nature that is inconsistent with the accused’s innocence. The accused must be linked to the offense by a complete and unbroken chain of circumstantial evidence. The conclusion of guilt must be reached by the collective application of the various pieces of circumstantial evidence, with one end (naeem)of the chain contacting the deceased individual and the other touching the accused individual’s neck. If any link in this chain is absent, the entire chain is disrupted and no conviction can be recorded in such a situation. 

Question No= 02
...........................
ii) . In a court of law, what is the admissibility of CCTV footage and its evidentiary value?

Answer:
...............
Reverting to question No. (ii) it is worth mentioning that in the case of State v Ahmed Omar Sheikh (2021 SCMR 873), this Court has established a two-step test for the verification of digital evidence regarding CCTV footage. This examination necessitates that the evidence in question be both authentic and pertinent, and that it has been acquired from a trustworthy and dependable source. The list of conditions comprises:

 “i) providing an explanation of how the video was obtained or its source, and

 ii)presenting a forensic report to show that the video has not been altered.” 

 It is a well-known fact that technology has become so ingrained in our lives that everyone is utilizing one form of technology or another. Criminals are also employing this in our society, establishing a trail for digital forensics to follow in order to uncover their crimes. It is important to note that we were unable to capitalize on digital evidence for an extended period of time due to the following factors: Firstly, our courts were previously reliant on traditional methods of evidence collection and presentation. Secondly, digital evidence was admissible only under article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (“QSO of 1984), which allows the court to admit any evidence that is obtained through the use of modern devices if it is deemed appropriate. Thirdly, the evidence was considered hearsay. Nevertheless, in light of the growing (naeem)importance of tracing and identifying the perpetrators, some critical legislative changes were implemented to grant digital evidence the status of primary evidence. The Electronic Transactions Ordinance (ETO) was implemented in 2002 to capitalize on the advantages of information technology. This Ordinance has resulted in modifications to other laws, such as the QSO of 1984, that pertain to the admissibility of digital evidence. It has also designated such evidence as primary evidence.

The CCTV footage may also be admitted under the “Silent witness” theory, which stipulates that the video (naeem)itself functions as evidence without the necessity of a sponsoring witness, provided that the footage is authenticated. It provided unbiased and real-time evidence that is frequently more reliable than human testimony, serving as a potent “Silent Witness”. In Black’s Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, at page 1508, ‘Silent Witness Theory’ is mentioned as under: 

“A method of authenticating and admitting evidence (such as a (naeem)photograph), without the need for a witness to verify its authenticity, upon a sufficient showing of the reliability of the process of producing the evidence, including proof that the evidence has not been altered.

The “Silent Witness theory” is a rule of evidence that allows for the admission of photographic video, or other recorded evidence as substantive proof of what it depicts, without the need for an eyewitness to testify that they personally observed (naeem)the events depicted in the recording (United States v. Harris, 55 M.J.433 (C.A.A.F 2001). Over the last 25 years, the “Silent Witness” theory of authentication has developed in almost all jurisdictions to allow photographs to substantively “speak for themselves” after being authenticated by evidence that supports the reliability of the process or system that produced the photographs. The threshold case for automated camera evidence is United States v. Taylor (530 F.2d 639 (5th Cir 1976)). In that case, footage recording a robbery that was taken after bank employees were locked in the bank vault was admitted, despite the fact that no one could testify as to the events shown. 

The digital evidence has now assumed a crucial role in the courts of law while administrating justice. In the recent past such evidence was treated as hearsay and secondary (naeem)evidence in our country, however, as stated above, keeping in view its importance, particularly in tracing and identifying the culprits, required changes were made in the relevant laws in order to give the status of primary evidence to the digital evidence, thus, being primary evidence, it is admissible. The CCTV footages, if pass the two-fold test, as per dictum laid down by this Court in the case of Ahmad Omar Sheikh (supra), then it does not require any corroboration being primary evidence.

درخواست گزار کو اپنی شہادت پیش کرنے کے لیے متعدد مواقع فراہم کیے گئے، تاہم، انتباہ کے باوجود اس نے ان مواقع سے فائدہ اٹھانے کی زحمت نہ کی۔ اس قسم کے سست اور لاپرواہ شخص کو عدالت کے طریقہ کار سے کھیلنے اور معاملے کو بلاجواز التواء میں رکھنے کی اجازت نہیں دی جا سکتی،

More than sufficient opportunities have been granted to the petitioner for producing his evidence and despite putting him under warning he did not bother to avail the same. Such like indolent person(s) cannot be allowed to play with the process of the Court and linger on the matter on one pretext or the other, that too, without any plausible and valid reason. It is evident from record that through speaking order(s) the petitioner was granted with absolute last and final opportunities for production of his evidence with clear cut warnings, the petitioner did not pay any heed to the orders and direction of the trial Court, which shows his adamant attitude towards the orders of the trial Court.  The above picture of affairs makes it crystal clear that how the petitioner pursued his case and showed his disobedience and indifferent demeanour towards the orders of the Court; thus, such like indolent person cannot seek favour of law, because law favours the vigilant and not the indolent.

Order

Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, J.--The instant petition was filed against the judgment dated 19.04.2021 passed by the Lahore High Court in Writ Petition No. 62232/2020 dismissing the petitioner’s challenge to judgment and decree dated 04.11.2020 passed by the appellate Court, whereby Respondents No. 3 and 4’s appeal against the order and decree dated 14.05.2019 passed by the family Court, was allowed by enhancing the maintenance for each of the said respondents from Rs. 30,000/-to Rs. 150,000/-per month along with educational expenses.

2.       On 14.11.2017, the petitioner’s daughters, Zeina Naseer Butt (Respondent No. 3) and Imaan Naseer Butt (Respondent No. 4) had instituted a suit against the petitioner for the recovery of maintenance. Earlier the said suit had been decreed ex-parte on 15.02.2018. On the petitioner’s application, the ex-parte decree was set aside vide order dated 08.06.2018 with the direction to the petitioner to pay as interim maintenance Rs. 30,000/-per month to each of his daughters. Failure on the petitioner’s part to pay interim maintenance caused the family Court to invoke its powers under Section 17-A of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 and consequently, the suit was decreed on 14.05.2019.

3.       The instant petition was filed on 06.06.2021. After remaining pending for more than three and a half years, this Court vide order dated 15.03.2025 referred the dispute between the parties to mediation by Ms. Sara Tarrar, who is an advocate of the High Court and an Accredited Mediator duly notified by the Law and Justice Division under the provisions of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2017. The contesting parties participated in the process of mediation and were able to arrive at a settlement. The Mediator, along with her report dated 05.05.2025 filed a copy of the settlement agreement, which has been taken on record. The learned counsel for the contesting parties request for a decree to be pronounced in terms of the said settlement agreement.

4.       The purpose of detailing hereinabove the litigation history between the parties is to underscore that the dispute between the father/petitioner and daughters/Respondents No. 3 and 4 has traversed various judicial tiers and has extensively consumed judicial time and resources. The swift conclusion of mediation achieved within approximately five weeks starkly contrasts with the prolonged adversarial litigation spanning over more than seven years (from the date of the institution of the suit to the date of reference to mediation).

5.       Mediation is not merely an alternative to litigation; it is a paradigm shift in dispute resolution, built on the principles of collaboration, confidentiality, and party autonomy. It offers a non-adversarial framework that empowers parties to shape the outcome of their own disputes, guided by a neutral facilitator rather than a judicial determination.

6.       The benefits of mediation are manifold. It reduces the costs associated with protracted legal battles, alleviates the burden on Courts, and ensures quicker resolution of disputes. The confidential nature of mediation protects the privacy of the parties, and its informal setting encourages honest communication and problem-solving. Moreover, the flexibility of the process allows parties to explore creative, interest-based solutions that a Court of law may not be empowered to grant. These benefits were remarkably evident in the present case. What years of litigation could not resolve, mediation achieved within weeks. This reinforces the principle that the earlier a dispute is channeled through mediation, the greater the potential for cost and time savings, reduced emotional strain, and restored relationships.

7.       Courts must embrace a pro-mediation ethos, particularly at the initial stages of litigation. Judges and lawyers must be sensitized to identify cases fit for mediation and facilitate their referral in a timely manner. Litigants, likewise, should be encouraged to consider mediation and other methods of alternative dispute resolution as a first resort, rather than a last recourse.

8.       The statutory recognition and legislative frameworks provided by the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2017, and subsequent provincial legislations underline mediation’s established legal validity. Recent judicial directions and rules, such as the ADR Mediation Accreditation (Eligibility) Rules, 2023 and Mediation Practice Direction (Civil) Rules, 2023, further consolidate mediation as a mainstream dispute resolution tool within Pakistan’s judicial ecosystem.

9.       The case at hand underscores the efficacy and benefits of mediation, particularly in familial contexts where adversarial litigation often exacerbates emotional distress, imposes significant financial burdens, and strains familial ties. Had mediation been pursued earlier, the extended litigation and accompanying costs, both monetary and emotional, could have been substantially mitigated or altogether avoided in the present case.

10.     This Court expresses its profound appreciation to Ms. Sara Tarrar for her expert mediation, patience and diligence in facilitating dialogue and fostering an atmosphere of mutual respect and cooperation, culminating in a satisfactory resolution acceptable to the contesting parties. Her contributions have vividly demonstrated mediation’s potential to provide a timely, efficient and humane avenue for resolving disputes.


10-A.  For the purposes of this order, it is not necessary to restate the terms of the settlement between the parties. A decree in terms of the settlement agreement dated 05.05.2025 shall be drawn up by the family Court at the earliest. Office shall transmit a copy of this order along with the settlement agreement for drawing up a decree. This petition stands disposed of in terms of the settlement agreement.

Feeling aggrieved from aforementioned order, the Respondent No. 7 appealed before the Respondent No. 2/Additional Commissioner (Revenue), Rawalpindi who disposed of the same vide order dated 05.09.2016 with direction to Tehsildar that during partition proceedings previous possession of the parties and mode of partition be kept in view however, Naqsha Jeem was subsequently approved by CRO on 17.09.2016. The said order, thereafter, was challenged by the Petitioner before the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Rawalpindi which was dismissed vide order dated 13.03.2018. This order was then assailed by the Petitioners through appeal before the Additional Commissioner (Revenue), Punjab however, during proceedings, on application of the Petitioners, the said appeal was transferred to the Commissioner Rawalpindi Division, Rawalpindi who vide order dated 06.01.2020 disposed of revision petition and directed the Tehsildar Taxila to proceed further in the Naqsha Jeem as per law. The Petitioners filed appeal against above-stated order before the Member (Judicial-I), Board of Revenue, Punjab which was dismissed vide order dated 01.07.2021 (the “impugned order”), hence this petition.

3.       Learned counsel for the Petitioners inter alia argued that the “impugned order” was passed by the Respondent No. 1 on technical grounds and without providing proper right of hearing to the Petitioners; that the “impugned order” is against the law and facts; that the impugned judgment is the result of mis-reading and non-reading of material available on record.

4.       Learned counsel for the Respondent No. 7, on the other hand, supported the “impugned order” and stated that same was passed by the Respondent No. 1, as per law and this petition is liable to be dismissed as there is no illegality or infirmity in the “impugned judgment”.

5.       Arguments heard.

6.       From perusal of the “impugned order” it reveals that appeal of the Petitioners was dismissed by the Respondent No. 1 on the point of limitation. Admittedly, the litigation between the parties was initiated under The Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1967 (the “Act”) which is a special law and provides its own period of limitation for appeals. Section 161 of the “Act” deals with filing of appeal whereas period for filing is provided under Section 162 of the “Act” which reads as under:

Limitation for appeals.--Save as otherwise provided by this Act, the period of limitation for an appeal under section 161 shall run from the date of the order appealed against and shall be--

(a)      thirty days, where the appeal lies to the Collector;

(b)      sixty days, where the appeal lies to the Commissioner;

(c)      ninety days, where the appeal lies to the Board of Revenue.

Above provision of law clearly manifests that ninety days are prescribed in filing of appeal against the order of the Commissioner to the Board of Revenue. Pertinently, provision of Section 167 of the “Act” having expressly providing that limitation shall be governed by the provisions of Limitation Act, 1908 in filing of appeal, review or revision filed under this Act. It evinces from the “impugned order” that the order dated 06.01.2020 passed by the Commissioner Rawalpindi Division was assailed after inordinate delay of one year and 21 days. The question of limitation is of significance importance. In terms of Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1908, every Court is bound to consider such question despite being not raised by the parties to the lis. It has paramount importance, as with the afflux of time certain rights do accrue in favour of the adversary, which cannot be taken away in a slipshod manner. The object for framing the law for the purpose of regulating the limitation was to push the parties to file their respective claims within stipulated period. The time period provided for filing the proceedings in terms of appeal, review or revision petition cannot be lightly ignored or brushed aside. The question of limitation is as important as jurisdiction of the Court. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Lahore Development Authority versus Mst. Sharifan Bibi and another” (PLD 2010 Supreme Court 705) held that “law of limitation could not be considered merely a formality and required to be observed being mandatory in nature. Purpose of law of limitation was to help vigilant and not the indolent. Helping hand might not be extended to a litigant having going into deep slumber, on having become forgetful of his rights. Concerned person had to be made aware of invasion of his interest and such awareness had to be ascertained as a matter of fact. Supreme Court declined to interfere with exercise of discretion regarding question of limitation by High Court and order passed by High Court was neither illegal nor unreasonable but well based and did not warrant interference”. In the “impugned order” the Respondent No. 1 has rightly observed that:

“This case has chequered history of litigation. The matter remained pending adjudication in different revenue Courts and ultimately, learned Commissioner, Rawalpindi Division vide his order dated 06.01.2020 disposed of the revision petition with the direction to Tehsildar Taxila to proceed further in Naqsha Jeem dated 16.08.2018 as per law. Partition of land of joint khata is righto of each and every land owners/co-sharer provided under the law and it cannot be denied. This appeal has been filed with the inordinate delay of one year and 21 days”.

7.       Furthermore, the Petitioners fully knew factum of litigation history and passing of order dated 06.01.2020 by the Commissioner, Rawalpindi Division and to assail it before the Board of Revenue in terms of Section 161(1)(c) of the “Act” within the statutory period of limitation but they remained slept for more than one year. Reliance is made on “Muhammad Azhar Khan and another versus Assistant Commissioner/Collector, Toba Tek Singh and others” (2006 SCMR 778) wherein the Supreme Court has held that “Honourable Judge in the Chambers of the High Court, who had decided the writ petition filed by the respondents on 7-7-1993 has held that appeal before the Deputy Commissioner was time-barred, therefore, the same was rightly dismissed. It is to be noted that once the appeal was not filed in time before the Appellate Authority how the writ or review petition was competent because before approaching the High Court for redressal of the grievance-by invoking its Constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution, it was incumbent upon the respondents to have availed alternative remedies according to law”. Moreover, the law helps the vigilant and not the indolent. Reliance in this regard is placed on “Aftab Iqbal Khan Khichi and another versus Messrs United Distributors Pakistan Ltd. Karachi” (1999 SCMR 1326). It is a settled principle of law that when a law describes or requires a thing to be done in a particular manner, it should be done in that manner or not at all. Reliance in said regard may well be placed upon observation in “Attaullah Khan versus Ali Azam Afridi and others” (2023 PLC (C.S) 182).

8.       Aptly, the petition in hand was filed on 17.12.2021 and the Petitioners have called in question the “impugned order” order but interestingly after lapse of five months and sixteen days without explaining any convincing reasons for the inordinate delay, as such principle of laches is applicable upon this case as three months’ time is considered reasonable for a party to assail an adverse order in writ jurisdiction of this Court. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Civil Aviation Authority through Director General and 3 others versus Mir Zulfiqar Ali and another” (2016 SCMR 183) has held as under:

“The Respondent No. 1, who appeared in person, despite opportunity failed to explain or justify the delay. Since the petition was filed after a lapse of almost 10 years and that too without any justification or explanation for such delay, the same ought to have been dismissed as such.”

In “State Bank of Pakistan through Governor and another
versus Imtiaz Ali Khan and others” (2012 SCMR 280) it has held as under:

“laches is a doctrine whereunder a party which may have a right, which was otherwise enforceable, loses such right to the extent of its enforcement if it is found by the Court of a law that its case is hit by the doctrine of laches/limitation. Right remains with the party but it cannot enforce it. The limitation is examined by the Limitation Act or by special laws which have inbuilt provisions for seeking relief against any grievance within the time specified under the law and if party aggrieved do not approach the appropriate forum within the stipulated period/time, the grievance though remains but it cannot be redressed because if on one hand there was a right with a party which he could have enforced against the other but because of principle of limitation/laches, same right then vests/accrues in favour of the opposite party”.

It was further held by Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Member (S&R)/Chief Settlement Commissioner, Board Of Revenue, Punjab, Lahore and another versus Syed Ashfaque Ali and others” (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 132) as under:

“On account of Laches in setting the machinery of law into motion they have indeed disentitled themselves to the exercise of discretionary and equitable jurisdiction, which in all cases must be exercised in order to foster the ends of justice and to right a wrong. Writ jurisdiction is undoubtedly discretionary and extraordinary in nature which may not be invoked by a party who demonstrates a style of slackness and laxity on his part. Furthermore, if a party does not choose legal remedy available under the Statute strictly speaking Constitutional


jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be exercised in his favour. Law is well-settled that a patty guilty of gross negligence and laches is not entitled to the equitable relief. One who seeks equity must show that equities lean in his favour. In the facts and circumstances of the appeal we are, therefore, in no manner of doubt that the High Court was not competent to exercise its writ jurisdiction conferred under Article 199 of the Constitution”.

9.       The exercise of constitutional jurisdiction in terms of Article 199 of the “Constitution” is discretionary which can only be invoked in extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. The Petitioners have badly failed to point out any illegality or material irregularity in the impugned order, warranting interference by this Court in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction. This Court while invoking its constitutional jurisdiction always exercises restraint in interfering with the judgment or order passed in exercise of revisional jurisdiction unless some perversity or patent illegality is floating on the surface of record. The constitutional jurisdiction can only be exercised in such an eventuality if the impugned judgment or order suffers with certain legal infirmities or patent illegalities, resulting into failure of justice.

10.     Learned counsel for the Petitioners is unable to point out any illegality or irregularity in the “impugned order” warranting interference by this Court in its constitutional jurisdiction. Resultantly, the instant petition stands dismissed.

Marking a weapon as "P" is not mere a formality rather a duty cast upon the Court to inspect it in detail.

Practice of marking an article like rifle as ‘P’ on the recovery memo is not mere a formality rather being real evidence it must be shown to the witnesses to identify or comment upon it so as to facilitate the inspection of Court that this was the weapon used by the accused for commission of offence. 
Proviso two to Article 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 obviously creates an exception to direct evidence and requires that if oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of any material thing other than document which of course includes weapons, stolen articles, implements, instruments, substance, vehicles and depending upon the nature of offence committed some of the spot recoveries like cigarette butts, packets, pen, mobile, bottles, crockery, utensils, stoves, gas cylinders etc., must be produced for the inspection of court. The words “for its inspection” referred in above proviso has wide connotation which requires a detailed examination of such article/material thing by the court and while relying upon such recovery court should also give its findings about such article. Rule 14-F of Chapter 24-B, Volume III of the Lahore High Court Rules and Orders
Court should have given finding with respect to description of weapon, its calibre and other necessary details so as to productively use this kind of evidence as corroboration to principal facts۔

Unless directed otherwise, on acquittal by High Court, disposal of case property shall be regulated by learned lower Court under section 517 of Cr.P.C.

Section 517 Cr.P.C. clearly mentions that when an inquiry or trial is concluded, Court concerned may pass order for the disposal by destruction, confiscation, or (naeem)delivery to any person claiming to be entitled to possession thereof or otherwise of any property or document. Conclusion of trial includes decision of case in appeal when no order with respect to case property has been made by the appellate Court.  

There is no cavil to the proposition that under section 520 of Cr.P.C. this Court is also authorized to pass an appropriate order in case learned trial Court fails to exercise power under section 517 Cr.P.C. Learned counsel for the petitioners could not controvert the fact that petitioners/accused have not claimed such amount as their own (naeem)during the trial rather in their statements under section 342 Cr.P.C alleged that said amount was foisted upon them. Order passed by the learned trial Court clearly speaks that the petitions were not decided on merits but on technical ground that learned trial Court lacks jurisdiction due to acquittal order passed by this Court. 

In this case trial Court has ordered confiscation of case property through a judgment of conviction and said decision has been reversed, therefore, principle of merger shall not apply, which attracts only if the appellate Court upholds the decision of trial Court or modify it in substance or relief but in the present case this Court has not upheld or modified the judgment of trial Court, rather quashed it, therefore, by all means, the situation has been reversed to the stage when during investigation amount was shown recovered from the petitioners, then accused, while opening an avenue for the petitioners to once again file the petitions on the analogy of section 516-A or 523 of Cr.P.C. but under section 517 of Cr.P.C. No doubt this Court under section 520 Cr.P.C. can pass an appropriate order, but only when petition under section 517 Cr.P.C. is decided by the trial Court on merits, which has not been done by the trial Court. Railway Department is contesting the claim on the basis of facts and contentions cited above, record of trial Court is also not before this Court and counter claims of the parties require a factual inquiry based on recording of evidence, if necessary, by the learned trial Court/Special Judge (Central) Lahore to determine entitlement of petitioners to alleged amount which function cannot be under taken by this Court while exercising revisional jurisdiction. Therefore, learned Special Judge (Central) Lahore/trial Court would better examine the entire record while assessing the entitlement of the portioners for the amount claimed.

Section 517 of Cr.P.C. is not an exhaustive section, Court after conclusion of trial can also refer the matter to Magistrate for disposal of property as mentioned in section 518 of Cr.P.C.

Though section 104 of Cr.P.C. authorizes the Court to impound any document or thing yet during the trial and after conclusion it can decide the fate of such property including destruction, confiscation and delivery to person entitled. When the accused, during the trial claims the property as his own, then on acquittal he is entitled to receive it back straightaway by the order of trial Court but when the situation is otherwise then Court must decide the question again by providing opportunity to prove the entitlement and also reason for disowning of such property during the trial and Court can presume any fact while deciding application for claim. Section 517 of Cr.P.C. in that case provides jurisdiction to Court to decide all questions arising out of acquittal order. This section is somewhat like section 47 of CPC which says that all questions arising between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed and relating to the execution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree shall be decided by the Court executing the decree and not by a separate suit. Similarly, as sections 379, 425 and 442 of Cr.P.C., say that all orders passed by Court of Reference, Appeal and Revision shall be certified to the lower Court which shall pass orders confirmable to the judgment and order of the High Court and if necessary, record shall be amended in accordance with law. Thus, in this way lower Court becomes an executing Court like one under section 47 of CPC, therefore, can decide all ancillary question relating to case property in accordance with law.

Discrepancy between opinion of doctor who first examined the injured and the subsequently constituted Medical Board comprising of senior and better qualified doctors---Preference to be given to opinion of Medical Board---
A 'Three Tier Structure' for conducting medico legal work had been established in the Province by the Provincial Health Department---Hierarchy of the medical examination as notified by the Health Department clearly reflected that against the opinion of the initial medical officer, the Medical Board would be constituted---Prior to the constitution of the said Medical Board, a judicial order had to be passed by the Magisterial Court---In the present case, according to the Medical Board, the injured witness was re-examined by four doctors including a Medical Superintendent, fully equipped with knowledge and expertise and also better in experience than the earlier expert who examined the injured witness soon after the occurrence---Argument of the complainant side that preference had to be given to the earlier examination by the medical officer could not be agreed with because the expert's opinion depended upon many factors including, physical examination, qualification, experience and finally collective wisdom of the members of the Board---In the report of the Medical Board, which comprised of four senior doctors having superior qualification and experience, it had been observed that the Board was of unanimous opinion that regarding the subject injury, the possibility of fabrication could not be ruled out---When there was conflict in opinions of the medical experts, the expert having better qualification, insight, experience, and more particularly the joint consensus of richly equipped members had more weightage, hence it had to be given precedence over the first examination conducted by a junior doctor, especially, when members of Board were four in number, whereas the first doctor who examined the injury at the first instance was only a single member assigned the duty to examine the injured person.

Partition  suits  are  different  in  nature,  than  the  other  civil  suits.  In partition  suits  only  those  parties  are  joined,  who  already  had established  their  right  of  ownership  in  the  property.  They  have  certain different  shares  in  the  property.    The  main  purpose  of  partition  suit  is to  settle  down  the  certain  part/share  of  each  sharer,  according  to  their entitlement.  So,  the  responsibility  of  court  is  to  see,  that nobody/share-holder  be  deprived  in  any  way  from  his/her  legal  right. According  to  the  Partition  Act  1893,  the  court  was  empowered  to appoint  local  commission  to  ascertain  certain  facts.  This  local commission  was  to  be appointed  U/O  26  Rule 1 CPC   

The  court  ascertains  the  power,  jurisdiction  and  specific  task  of  the local  commission  and    it    was  purely  discretion  of  the  Court.  The local  commission,  if  submits  that  the  property  is  partitionable,  then  it proposes    the  mode  of  the  partition,  the  parties  have  right  to  file  their objections,  if  not  suits  them,  then  the  court  has  to  decide  these objections.  If  the  commission  submits,  that  the  property  is  not partitionable,    then  the  same  was  put  to  auction  under  the  rules.  The amended  Punjab  Partition    of  Immovable  Property  Act,  2012,  also proposes,    internal  auction  and  external  auction  as  required  under section  10  & 11of    said  Act.

In  case  of  partitionable  property,  the    court  is  bound  to  see  that  the proposed  shares  are  equal  in    all  respect.(i)  that  the  valuation  of  the property  is  equal  of  each  sharer,  accordingly  to  his/her  share.(ii)  Right of  easement  are  equally  available  to  all  sharers.(iii)  All  sharers  have the equal  opportunity  to    utilize  theirs  shares.  (iv) The future aspect  of each  sharer  is  equal  in  all  respect.   

 If  the  sharers,  want  to  make  improvement  on  their  respective share  it  will  neither  affect    the  other  sharers,  nor    there  should  be  any hurdle  or  difficulty  for  any  of  the  sharer.  If  objections  are  filed  by  the sharers,  the    court  must  settle  these  objections  keeping  in  view  the wisdom  maintained  in  the  Partition  Act.  The  main  purpose  is  to permanently  settle  the  share  of  each  sharer  according  to  their entitlement.  These  proceedings  should  be  processed  speedily.  The discretion  of  the  court  has  been  minimized    in    the  amended  Partition Act  2012,  with  the  inclusion  of  the  amendment  regarding  the appointment  of  referee.  This    suit  for  partition  was  filed  under  the Partition  Act  1893  and  commission  was  also  appointed  under  the  provision  of  said  Act.    Second  local  commission  was  also  appointed before  the  enactment  of  the  provision  of  referee  in  Partition  Act  2012. So,  the  order  of  the  court  for  the  appointment  of      commission  on  2nd time was  valid   and  legal.

Section 6 of the "Ordinance, 1961" places a restriction on the second marriage of husband unless he obtains prior permission in writing of the Arbitration Council. Sub-section 5 of section 6 of the "Ordinance, 1961" provides consequences of contracting second marriage by a man without permission of Arbitration Council, one of which is that he has to face prosecution in complaint and if it is proved that he contracted second marriage without permission of the Arbitration Council, he shall be liable to be convicted and punishable with the simple imprisonment which may extend to one year and with fine of five hundred thousand rupees. The petitioner being wife of "respondent" lodged a complaint under section 6 of the "Ordinance, 1961" before the Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), Tehsil Sarai Alambir, District Gujrat through her special attorney Naveed Hanif s/o Muhammad Hanif, which was dismissed being not proceedable through attorney. "Ordinance, 1961" does not prescribe any procedure for the trial of the complaint, however, the Rules under the "Ordinance, 1961" (hereinafter referred to as "Rules, 1961") framed under section 11 pave way for the trial of offences under the "Ordinance, 1961". Needless to mention here that Rule 21 of the "Rules, 1961" ordains that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence under the Ordinance or these rules save on a complaint in writing by the Union Council, stating the fact constituting the offence. It would not be out of context to mention here that Rule 21 was later on reconstituted by the orders of the Governor of Punjab in exercise of powers conferred upon him by section 11 of the "Ordinance, 1961" through S.O X-1-15/75-Vol.II published in Gazette of Punjab, Extraordinary, 14th October, 1976 and words "aggrieved party" were inserted in place of "Union Council

[10/28/25, 4:44:47 AM] ~ Muhammad Jamil Khan AHC ☺️: کریمنل کیس میں ٹرائل کورٹ کو آرٹیکل 158 اور 161 قانون شہادت 1984 کے ساتھ ضابطہ  فوجداری کے دفعہ 94 کے تحت  وسیع اختیارات دیے گئے ہیں کہ وہ کسی بھی دستاویز یا چیز کو طلب کرے اگر اس دستاویز کی تیاری مقدمے کے مقصد کے لیے مطلوبہ اور ضروری ہو۔ 

Right to fair trial as ensured under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, has been further elevated by Article 10-A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.
Bare perusal of the impugned order reflects that the learned trial court dismissed the application of the petitioner solely on the ground that registers requested to be summoned are privileged documents under section 172 Cr.P.C., therefore cannot be summoned. We would like to take up the legal question raised before this Court that whether registers No. 2, 19 and 21, as maintained under the Police Rules, 1934, are privileged documents and governed by section 172 Cr.P.C. 
The aforementioned Section is a self-explanatory provision of law, which makes it the bounden duty of every investigating officer to enter day-to-day proceedings of the investigation in a case diary, setting forth the time at which the information reaches him, the time at which he begins and closes his investigation, the place or the places visited by him and statement of the circumstances ascertained through his investigation. Such case diary may be used by the court at the trial or inquiry, not as evidence in the case, but to aid itself in such inquiry or trial.
Having briefly discussed the purpose and scope of section 172 Cr.P.C., we have no hesitation to hold that a police diary maintained in a criminal case is absolutely a privileged document, which cannot be provided to an accused unless it is used by the Police officer who made it to refresh his memory or is used for the purpose of contradicting him. This section only deals with the case diary maintained by the investigating officer of every criminal case and has no relevance to the police registers, requested to be summoned by the petitioner, which are maintained under the Police Rules, 1934 (hereinafter „Rules‟). 

 The famous quote of Lord Acton „power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely‟ 3seems a rationale behind the effective mechanism of checks and balances provided in the Code and Rules. Policing is a job that carries a lot of authority and powers with it, including the power to deprive someone of his life and liberty, therefore, it was necessary to keep a record of every step taken by the police officials in order to keep them strictly within the sphere of their legal duties. Under Rule 45 Chapter 22 of the Rules, at every police station, there shall be maintained 25 types of police registers to keep a record of different duties and functions performed by the police officials. The aforementioned rule clearly depicts that keeping a record of every activity of police officers is with the purpose to keep the police proceedings transparent and within the domain of law. Every step taken in connection with the performance of their duties in a police station is incorporated into these registers to rule out every possibility that police officials perform their duties in an arbitrary manner according to their whims and wishes. All the pretrial proceedings are also protected by Article 10-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakatan, 1973 to ensure a fair trial, therefore, proper maintenance of these registers is also a constitutional requirement under this Article.  6.  The petitioner has requested the summoning of registers No. II, XIX and XXI as mentioned in Rule 49 of Chapter 22 of the Rules. Register No. II is called Station Diary. It is a complete record of all events which take place at the police station. It should, therefore, record not only the movements and activities of all police officers but also visits of outsiders, whether officials or non-officials, coming or brought to the police station for any purpose whatsoever. Register No XIX contains the details of every article placed in the storeroom and removed therefrom. Register No. XXI is a bound book of road certificates, which are issued for a variety of purposes. For instance when some case property etc. is sent from the police station for forensic analysis etc. A road certificate is a document necessary to be accompanied with a person carrying any parcel or property etc of the police station pertaining to any criminal case. When the police officer returns to the police station, the copy of the road certificate or receipt in lieu thereof shall be pasted onto the place from which the copy issued was taken. The registers requested to be summoned are public documents and with no stretch of the imagination are covered by the prohibition contained under Section 172 Cr.P.C. as misunderstood by the learned trial court.  
Every accused has a right to have fair trial and the concept of fair trial recognized under the Code has been conferred an elevated status under Article 10-A of the Constitution and now it is a much broader and wider concept. There can be no analytical, all comprehensive or exhaustive definition of the concept of a fair trial, and it may have to be determined in seemingly infinite variety of actual situations with the ultimate object in mind viz. whether something that was done or said either before or at the trial deprived the quality of fairness to a degree where a miscarriage of justice has resulted.

Petitioner is standing trial for keeping explosive material in his possession. He was allegedly arrested along with his co-accused with explosive material in their possession. All the abovementioned police registers are not only relevant but also necessary for the just decision of the case. There is no legal provision available on the statute books to consider these police registers as privileged. The purpose of a fair trial is to find out the truth and prevent miscarriage of justice.  

For that purpose, the trial Court is fully equipped with all the necessary powers under the Code and Qanoon-e-Shahdat, 1984. The role of a trial court should not be of a silent spectator, rather a participatory role should be played to ensure that truth must be arrived at. The Judge is not a mere umpire at a wit-combat between the lawyers for the parties whose only duty is to enforce the rules of the game and declare at the end of the combat who has won and who has lost. He is expected, and indeed it is his duty, to explore all avenues open to him in order to discover the truth.  
The very purpose of a fair trial shall be defeated if the petitioner is not provided a fair opportunity to prove his innocence. Under Section 94 of the Code read with Articles 158 and 161 Qanoone-Shahadat, 1984, a wide powers have been conferred upon the court to summon any document or thing if the production of that document is desirable and necessary for the purpose of the trial. The aforementioned provisions are enabling provisions of law which aim at arming the court to ensure the production of any document or thing to arrive at a just decision. It is sound rule of construction that procedural enactments should be construed liberally and in such a manner as to render the substantive rights effective.
Section 94, Cr.P.C, an enabling provision of law, provides this opportunity to the accused. The only precondition to invoke this Section is that he must satisfy the court that the production of such document or thing is „necessary or desirable‟ for the just decision of the case. The Language of section 94 of the Code indicates the width of the power to be unlimited but there is also an inbuilt limitation provided in this section. The scope of section 94, Cr.P.C is very wide, and the word “whenever” suggests that the court can exercise its power conferred by this Section at any stage of inquiry or trial. Further, the words “any document or other thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code” have been used which implies that it is not necessary that such document or thing should be the subject matter of such inquiry or trial but only consideration to produce such document or thing is that it will serve the ends of justice in any such inquiry or trial.
The power conferred upon the court to order the production of a thing or document should be exercised liberally after the court is satisfied that it is „necessary and desirable‟ that such document or thing should be produced as being relevant or having some connection with the inquiry or trial in progress. We, therefore, find that the petitioner has every right to shatter the credibility of the witnesses by advancing his defense and to require the production of documents, necessary to ascertain the truthfulness of the criminal charge leveled against him. In addition to the aforementioned provisions of law Rule 27.16 of the Rules states that a police officer is bound to produce any document in his possession or power if summoned to do so. This Rule further contains a list of documents which are privileged but registers requested to be summoned by the petitioner are not included in that list.

We, therefore, find that the petitioner has every right to shatter the credibility of the witnesses by advancing his defense and to require the production of documents, necessary to ascertain the truthfulness of the criminal charges leveled against him. It is evidently clear from what has been discussed above that right to a fair trial has been denied to the petitioner by the learned trial court. The learned trial court utterly misconceived and misconstrued the provisions of section 172, Cr.P.C. The impugned findings of the learned trial court in this regard are patently illegal, erroneous and fanciful, therefore, not sustainable in the eye of the law, therefore, the same are set aside.

Principles and law regarding the test identification parade as a piece of evidence.  

The identification parade is one of the methods of proof contemplated under section 22 of the Qanun-e- Shahadat Order, 1984. It must be carefully conducted in order to achieve its main object i.e to enable a witness to properly (naeem)identify a person involved in a crime and to exclude the possibility of a witness simply confirming a faint recollection and impression. The process has to be carried out having regard to the exigencies of each case in a manner that is fair and does not indicate any collusiveness. It is merely a corroborative piece of evidence and holding of test identification parade is not mandatory. If the testimony of the witness qua the identity of the accused inspires confidence and the witnesses are consistent in all material particulars and there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the latter had deposed falsely then in such an eventuality not conducting a test identification parade is not fatal to the prosecution's case. (copied from the page syed naeem ali advocate)The omission of salient features in a crime report is not necessarily a ground to discard a test identification parade. The test identification parade is, therefore, not required when the victim had identified the accused and his statement has been found reliable.

FIR cannot be straightaway quashed based on the civil dispute between the parties. It is settled law that criminal proceedings are not barred in presence of civil proceedings and that civil and criminal proceedings can proceed simultaneously.

It is pertinent to recognize that the registration of an FIR is a fundamental step in the criminal justice process. The duty to register an FIR arises under Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Cr.P.C), (naeem)which mandates law enforcement agencies to record any information that discloses a cognizable offence. This statutory obligation is not discretionary therefore courts should not intervene prematurely to stay the registration of an FIR. An FIR serves as the starting point for any investigation, enabling the police to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and collect necessary evidence. The act of staying the registration of an FIR effectively halts this significant process, thereby preventing law enforcement from fulfilling its mandated duty under the law to investigate. 

Criminal cases are decided on the basis of material so collected by the prosecution during the course of investigation, and the evidence recorded in the trial Court, and that too, after appraisal of evidence by (naeem)it in accordance with the law applicable thereto. High Court cannot assume the role of an investigation agency or of a trial Court without recording evidece to deliberate upon the factual controversies involved in the cases in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction.  
(copied from the page syed naeem ali advocate)
It is an established legal principle that when a prima facie offence has been committed, the usual course of trial proceedings in accordance with the law in a competent court of law  should not be bypassed by invoking the constitutional jurisdiction of High Court.

[10/28/25, 5:16:01 AM] ~ Muhammad Jamil Khan AHC ☺️: مفتی محمد اعظم پاکستان مولانا مفتی محمد شفیع صاحب کا ووٹ کے بارے میں تاریخی فتوئی
انتخابات میں دوٹ کی شرعی حیثیت کم از کم ایک شہادت کی ہے جس کا چھپانا بھی حرام ہے اور اس میں جھوٹ بولنا بھی حرام ہے۔ اس کو شش ایک سیاسی بار جیت اور دنیا کا کھیل سمجھنا بڑی بھاری غلطی ہے۔ آپ جس امید دار کو دوت دیتے ہیں شرعاً آپ اس کی گواہی دیتے ہیں کہ یہ شخص اپنے نظریئے اپنے علم و عمل اور دیانتداری کی رو سے اس کام کا اہل اور دوسرے امید واروں سے بہتر ہے جس کام کیلئے انتخابات ہو رہے ہیں۔ اس حقیقت کو سامنے رکھیں تو اس سے مندرجہ ذیل نتائج برآمد ہوتے ہیں۔
1 کے آپ کے ووٹ اور شہادت کے ذریعے جو نمائندہ کسی اسمبلی میں پہنچے گا وہ اس سلسلے میں جتنے اچھے یا برے اقدامات کرے گا ان کی ذمہ داری آپ پر بھی عائد ہوگی ۔ آپ بھی اس کے ثواب یا عذاب میں شریک ہوں گے۔ 2 کے اس معاملے میں یہ بات خاص طور پر یاد رکھنے کی ہے کہ شخصی ، عاملات میں کوئی غلطی بھی ہو جائے تو اس کا اثر بھی شخصی اور محدود ہوتا ہے، ثواب و عذاب بھی محدود قومی اور ملکی معاملات سے پوری قوم متاثر ہوتی ہے۔ اس کا ادنیٰ نقصان بھی بعض اوقات پوری قوم کی تباہی کا سبب بن جاتا ہے۔ اس لئے اس کا ثواب و عذاب بھی بڑا ہے۔
3) کی شہادت کا چھپانا از روئے قرآن حرام ہے۔ اس لئے اگر آپ کے حلقہ انتخاب میں اگر کوئی صحیح نظریئے کا حامل اور دیانت دار نمائندہ کھڑا ہے تو اس کو ووٹ نہ دینا گناہ کبیرہ ہے۔
4 جو امید وار نظام اسلامی کے خلاف کوئی نظریہ رکھتا ہے اس کو ووٹ دینا ایک جھوٹی شہادت ہے جو گناہ کبیرہ ہے۔ 5 کے ووٹ کو چیوں کے معاوضے میں بیچ دینا بدترین قسم کی رشوت ہے اور چند ٹکوں کی خاطر اسلام اور ملک سے بغاوت ہے۔ دوسروں کی دنیا سنوار نے کیلئے اپنا دین قربان کر دینا چاہے کتنے ہی مال و دولت کے بدلے میں ہو کوئی دانش مندی نہیں ہو سکتی ۔ رسول ﷺ نے فرمایا ہے کہ وہ شخص سب سے زیادہ خسارے میں ہے جو دوسروں کی دنیا کے لئے اپنا دین کھو بیٹھے ۔ جواہر الفقہ ، ج 2 صفحہ 300-301 ، مکتبہ دار العلوم کراچی )

(1) منشیات ایکٹ (CNS Act) کی دفعات 9، 14 اور 15
(2) نفسیاتی اثر رکھنے والے مادے (psychotropic substance) کے بارے میں ملزم کے شعوری علم (conscious knowledge) کا کوئی ثبوت ظاہر نہیں ہوا۔
(3) درخواست گزار کے کردار کی مزید تحقیقات درکار ہیں۔
(4) برابری کے اصول (rule of parity) کے تحت درخواست گزار کو بھی وہی فائدہ دیا جانا چاہیے، کیونکہ قانونی اصول یہ ہے کہ ایک جیسے مقدمات کو ایک جیسا برتاؤ ملنا چاہیے ("like cases should be treated alike")۔

 خلاصہ حکم
 (Summary of Judgment):
درخواست گزار
 Medisure Laboratories Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. کا ایک ملازم تھا، جسے اے۔این۔ایف۔ نے SAPT پورٹ، کراچی سے برآمد ہونے والے کنٹینر میں 19 کلوگرام Clonazepam 2mg اور 4.6 کلوگرام Clonazepam 0.5mg برآمد ہونے پر گرفتار کیا۔
اس کنٹینر کو برما (Myanmar) برآمد کیا جا رہا تھا۔

درخواست گزار کے مطابق:

وہ نہ برآمدکنندہ تھا، نہ شپّر، نہ کلئیرنگ ایجنٹ۔

اسے اس شپمنٹ کی کوئی دانستہ آگاہی نہیں تھی۔

برآمدکنندہ، کمپنی کے ڈائریکٹرز اور دیگر شریکِ ملزمان پہلے ہی ضمانت پر رہا ہو چکے تھے۔

عدالتِ عالیہ نے ضمانت مسترد کی تھی، جس کے خلاف سپریم کورٹ میں 
Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal
 دائر کی گئی۔

سپریم کورٹ نے قرار دیا کہ

مقدمہ مزید تحقیق (further inquiry) کا متقاضی ہے؛

استغاثہ کے شواہد ابتدائی طور پر ملزم کے کردار کو واضح طور پر ثابت نہیں کرتے؛

اور چونکہ شریکِ ملزمان کو ضمانت مل چکی، اس لیے قاعدہ برابری (rule of consistency) کے تحت درخواست گزار کو بھی ضمانت کا حق حاصل ہے۔

لہٰذا

درخواست اپیل میں تبدیل کی گئی اور منظور کر لی گئی۔

درخواست گزار کو دو لاکھ روپے کے مچلکوں کے عوض ضمانت پر رہائی دی گئی۔

 قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ
 (Legal Analytical Review):

1. متعلقہ قوانین و دفعات (Relevant Statutory Provisions)

(A) Control of Narcotic Substances (Amendment) Act, 2022
اہم دفعات:

Section 9 – Punishment for possession, import, export or trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.

Section 14 – Prohibition of import or export of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances without authorization.

Section 15 – Offences by companies.

(B) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Cr.P.C.)
اہم دفعات:

Section 497 Cr.P.C. – When bail may be taken in cases of non-bailable offences.

Section 498 Cr.P.C. – Pre-arrest (anticipatory) bail.

2. Bare Act Wording
 (اصل قانونی متن)

 Section 9 – CNS Act (Bare Wording):
"Whoever contravenes any provision of this Act or any rule or order made thereunder with respect to cultivation, production, manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transportation, import, export, or transshipment of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances shall be punishable..."
Punishment varies depending on the quantity and nature of substance (small, medium, or large quantity).

جو کوئی اس ایکٹ کی کسی بھی دفعہ، قاعدے یا حکم کی خلاف ورزی کرے جو منشیات یا نفسیاتی اثر رکھنے والے مادوں (psychotropic substances) کی کاشت، تیاری، پیداوار، قبضہ، فروخت، خرید، نقل و حمل، درآمد، برآمد یا منتقلی سے متعلق ہو، وہ قابلِ سزا ہوگا۔"
سزا: جرم کی نوعیت اور منشیات کی مقدار (چھوٹی، درمیانی یا بڑی مقدار) کے لحاظ سے مختلف ہوگی۔

Section 14 – CNS Act:
"No person shall import into, export from, or transship within Pakistan any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance except in accordance with the conditions of a licence, permit or authorization issued under this Act."

اثر رکھنے والے مادے کو درآمد، برآمد یا اندرونِ ملک منتقلی (transshipment) کے عمل میں نہیں لا سکتا جب تک کہ اس کے پاس اس ایکٹ کے تحت جاری کردہ لائسنس، اجازت نامہ یا اتھارائزیشن نہ ہو۔"

 Section 15 – CNS Act:
"Where any offence under this Act has been committed by a company, every person who at the time the offence was committed was in charge of and responsible for the conduct of its business shall be deemed guilty of the offence."

جب کوئی کمپنی اس ایکٹ کے تحت جرم کرتی ہے تو اس وقت کمپنی کے کاروبار کے انتظام و انصرام کا ذمہ دار ہر شخص اس جرم کا مرتکب تصور کیا جائے گا۔"
یعنی کمپنی کے سربراہ یا ذمہ دار افراد بھی جرم کے شریک سمجھے جائیں گے۔

 Section 497(1) Cr.P.C. 
 Bare Text:
“When any person accused of any non-bailable offence is arrested or detained... he may be released on bail unless there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for ten years.”

"جب کوئی شخص ناقابلِ ضمانت جرم (non-bailable offence) میں گرفتار یا حراست میں لیا جائے تو، اگر اس کے خلاف یہ معقول وجوہات موجود نہ ہوں کہ وہ ایسا جرم کر چکا ہے جو سزاے موت، عمر قید یا دس سال قید تک قابلِ سزا ہو، تو اسے ضمانت پر رہا کیا جا سکتا ہے۔"

Proviso: “If there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed such an offence but there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into his guilt, the accused shall be released on bail.”

"اگر ایسے معقول شواہد موجود نہ ہوں کہ ملزم نے یہ سنگین جرم کیا ہے، لیکن اس کے گناہ کے بارے میں مزید تحقیق (further inquiry) کی گنجائش ہو، تو ملزم کو ضمانت پر رہا کیا جائے گا۔"

3. تجزیہ و تشریح
 (Analytical Discussion)

(i) مزید تحقیق (Further Inquiry) 
 Section 497(2) Cr.P.C.
عدالت نے درست طور پر قرار دیا کہ

استغاثہ کے شواہد محض ابتدائی نوعیت کے ہیں؛

ایف آئی آر میں پیکٹس کی تعداد، مقدار یا واضح ضبطی کی تفصیل موجود نہیں؛

برآمدی دستاویزات اور شپمنٹ کا درخواست گزار سے براہِ راست کوئی تعلق ظاہر نہیں کیا گیا؛

دیگر شریکِ ملزمان کو ضمانت مل چکی ہے؛

لہٰذا مقدمہ “further inquiry” کے زمرے میں آتا ہے، جس کے تحت ملزم کو ضمانت دی جا سکتی ہے۔

یہ اصول Section 497(2) Cr.P.C.
 کے مطابق ہے 

“If there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry, the accused shall be released on bail.”

(ii) Rule of Consistency (قاعدہ برابری)
ضمانت کے معاملات میں عدالت نے اصولِ مساوات اپنایا:

جب شریکِ ملزم کو ضمانت دی جا چکی ہو، اور کردار ایک جیسا ہو، تو
 “Like cases should be treated alike.”

یہ اصول Article 25 of the Constitution
 (Equality before law)
 سے بھی ہم آہنگ ہے۔

(iii) Presumption of Innocence
 (بے گناہی کا مفروضہ)
سپریم کورٹ نے یاد دہانی کروائی کہ

“Every accused is innocent until proven guilty.”
یہ اصول نہ صرف Criminal Jurisprudence کا بنیادی ستون ہے بلکہ Article 10-A (Fair Trial) سے بھی مطابقت رکھتا ہے۔

(iv) Bail as a Right, Not a Punishment
عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ:

ضمانت سے انکار سزا کے مترادف نہیں ہونا چاہیے۔
ضمانت کا مقصد صرف اس بات کی ضمانت ہے کہ ملزم عدالت میں پیش ہو — اسے قبل از مقدمہ قید کرنا انصاف کے اصولوں کے خلاف ہے۔

عدالتی فلسفہ
 (Judicial Philosophy Highlighted)
اصول وضاحت
Presumption of Innocence ہر شخص جرم ثابت ہونے تک بے گناہ ہے۔
Further Inquiry اگر شواہد مکمل یا واضح نہ ہوں تو ضمانت دی جا سکتی ہے۔
Rule of Consistency شریکِ ملزمان کے ساتھ مساوی سلوک۔
Bail ≠ Punishment ضمانت سے انکار سزا نہیں۔
Tentative Assessment ضمانت کے وقت عدالت میرٹ پر نہیں جاتی بلکہ ابتدائی جائزہ لیتی ہے۔

 نتیجاً مختصراً۔۔

مقدمہ بادی النظر میں مزید تحقیق طلب
 (further inquiry)
 پایا گیا؛

ملزم کا کردار ثبوت سے واضح طور پر ثابت نہیں تھا؛

شریکِ ملزمان کو ضمانت مل چکی تھی؛

کوئی ٹھوس شواہد نہیں تھے جو دانستہ ملوثیت ثابت کریں؛

لہٰذا، عدالت نے دفعہ 497(2) 

Cr.P.C. 
کے تحت ضمانت منظور کی

 اور یہ اصولی فیصلہ ضمانت کے قانون میں ایک مثالی نظیر (precedent) 
ہے

 کہ CNS
 مقدمات میں بھی اگر شواہد مبہم ہوں
، تو 
"further inquiry" 
کی بنیاد پر ضمانت دی جا سکتی ہے۔

If injury has been caused below knee, then applicability of Section 324 PPC requires further probe/inquiry within the purview of sub-section 2 of Section 497 Cr.P.C., however, if injury has been caused above knee on the (naeem)leg at thigh, then situation is otherwise because femoral artery, which is major blood vessel, is located in thigh starting from groin coming to the back of knee and it supplies oxygen-rich blood to the lower parts of the body. So, femoral artery if damaged can cause lower limb ischemia leading to amputation of limb, compartment syndrome as well as death (naeem)due to severe blood loss from a major artery in the leg, hence if firearm injury has been caused at thigh, then prima facie section 324 PPC is attracted.

Evidentiary Value of Dying Declaration as enshrined in Article 46 QSO.

Here it must be explained that a 'dying declaration' is the statement which is made by the victim of homicide offences as to the cause of their death. The rule relating to dying declaration and its admissibility is provided in Article 46 of the Qanun-e Shahadat Order, 1984, which explains that the statement of a dying person is relevant and admissible in evidence, however, for recording such declaration no particular mode has been provided. The principles laid down by this Court are that a dying declaration is a weaker type of evidence, which needs corroboration and that a conviction can be based on the basis of such a declaration when fully corroborated by the other reliable evidence. Thus, the facts and circumstances of each case, have to be kept in view and also the credibility, reliability and acceptability of such a declaration, by the Court.

It would thus be beneficial to delineate the jurisprudential framework governing the evidentiary value of a dying declaration, as enshrined under Article 46 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. While such a statement may constitute an exception to the general rule of direct evidence, thereby permitting its admissibility in a criminal trial even in the absence of cross-examination of the declarant, the superior courts have consistently maintained that a dying declaration is, at best, a weaker type of evidence which requires cautious appraisal and must ordinarily be corroborated by other reliable and confidence-inspiring material. A conviction cannot rest solely on a dying declaration if the same is shrouded in mystery or is fraught with infirmities. The credibility, voluntariness, and the mental fitness of the declarant, along with the absence of extraneous influence, are sine qua non for its evidentiary acceptance. It is further emphasized that a dying declaration must not only be truthful and free from external coercion but also supported by surrounding circumstances, including the medical evidence, which confirms the declarant's capacity to make such a statement.
Jail Petition No.243/2023
Rajesh vs State
[10/29/25, 1:58:37 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2025 SCMR 1955
The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offence under section 489-F of PPC. The said offence is, admittedly, of the category which falls within the non-prohibitory clause of section 497 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure, 1898 ('Cr.P.C.). This Court has consistently held that while considering the grant of bail, where offences fall within the non-prohibitory clause, the granting of bail has to be considered favourably as a rule, but may be declined in exceptional cases. The extra ordinary and exceptional cases, inter alia, includes likelihood of abscondence of the accused; apprehension of the accused tempering with the prosecution evidence; and the danger of the offence being repeated. It is further noted that the quantum of amount involved in a case registered under section 489-F cannot be treated as an exception to the general rule that in cases falling under the category of non-prohibitory clause, bail shall be considered favourably. The offence under section 489-F of PPC is not a provision which is intended by the legislature to be used for recovery of the alleged amount. The criminal proceedings are meant to determine the guilt and then to sentence an accused. The legislature has set out the framework for recovery of an alleged amount in case of a dishonoured cheque under Order XXXVII of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. The petitioner in this case is, therefore, entitled to be granted bail since the State counsel has not been able to persuade us that exceptional circumstances exist in order to justify denying to the petitioner the concession of post arrest bail. Moreover, whether or not the alleged offence is attracted in the facts and circumstances of this case also require further probe.

[10/29/25, 1:58:38 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2025 SCMR 1961
Under the law a transaction or an agreement executed under custody or detention could potentially be considered as having been made under coercion, duress or undue influence, if the free consent is not given or the expressed will was the outcome of such circumstances. 

A person in custody or detention may be particularly vulnerable to coercion or duress as his freedom or liability to resist is severely limited. A person under the custody of the law enforcement agencies having control over the situation if enters into an agreement against best interest has an option to avoid It hence can be challenged in the court as voidable. A legally binding contract requires several elements i.e. an offer, acceptance of that offer, consideration, the parties having legal capacity contract but not for an unlawful to purpose, surely with a free consent (meeting of the minds consent is precured by influence is or consensus ad idem). If the coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake, the consent is not free. An undue a demonstration of controlling the will of the party because of the prevailing situation of the other duress are main party. While coercion is an act of enforcing a will but the undue influence or the consequence of coercion. A contract procured under duress by one party over the other is void and any benefit received therefrom must be restored and the loss be made good to such party.

[10/29/25, 1:58:40 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: It is a settled proposition of law that in cases falling within the prohibitory clause, the grant of post-arrest bail is restricted to the exceptions enumerated therein, namely: 

(i) under the first proviso to Section 497(1), Cr.P.C., where the accused is a woman, minor, or a sick or infirm person; 

(ii) under the third proviso to Section 497(1), Cr.P.C., where there is an unreasonable delay in the conclusion of the trial, not attributable to the accused; and 

(iii) under Section 497(2), Cr.P.C., where the case requires further inquiry into the guilt of the accused. However, upon (naeem)tentative assessment of the available material, the petitioner’s case does not appear to qualify as one of further inquiry so as to bring it within the purview of Section 497(2),Cr.P.C. 

It is a settled proposition of law that where there appear reasonable grounds to believe that the accused has committed an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, the case falls within the prohibitory clause of Section 497, Cr.P.C. 
At the bail stage, deeper scrutiny of material available on record is unwarranted, as that would affect the merits of the case at the trial. However, a (naeem)tentative assessment of material available on record prima facie connects the petitioner with the commission of the offence which falls within the ambit of the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C.

When an application under Section 12(2) of the CPC lies and when an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC lies, with illustrative instances to clarify their respective scopes.
.......................
Sub-section (2) of Section 12 CPC.
...........................

 The provision of Sub-section (2) of Section 12 CPC provides a remedy to challenge a judgment, decree, or order obtained by: 
i). fraud, 
ii). misrepresentation, or 
iii). want of jurisdiction.

 However, mere used of these terms is not sufficient, rather specific particulars must be provided as required by Rule 4 of Order VI, CPC5. It allows any person6 affected by such a decree or order to apply to the court that passed it, seeking to set it aside. This provision is not limited to parties to the suit but extends to any person aggrieved by the decree or order. It means an application under Section 12(2) CPC is maintainable when the decree or order was obtained by deliberate deception or suppression of material facts from the Court. However, the judgment supports a broader reading that includes fraud between the parties affecting the decree. For instance, if a plaintiff fabricates documents or misleads the court to secure a favorable judgment, the affected party can invoke Section 12(2) CPC;when the decree results from unintentional but material misstatement of facts by a party, leading the court to pass an erroneous order. For example, if a party misrepresents the ownership of property in a suit, the aggrieved party may apply under this section; and when the court lacked inherent jurisdiction to pass the decree or order. For instance, if a court passes a decree in a matter outside its territorial or pecuniary jurisdiction, an application under Section 12(2) can be filed. Additionally, a person not a party to the suit but affected by the decree e.g., a third party whose property is wrongly included in a decree, may apply under this section. The application must be filed in the same court that passed the decree or order. The applicant must prove fraud, misrepresentation, or lack of jurisdiction with cogent evidence. The scope of application under Section 12(2) CPC is broader than Order IX Rule 13, CPC, as it is not limited to ex-parte decrees and can be invoked by non-parties.

Rule 13 of Order IX, CPC.
........................

This provision of Rule 13 of Order IX, CPC provides a remedy to set aside an ex-parte decree passed against a defendant who was unable to appear when the suit was called for hearing. It applies only to defendants and is limited to ex-parte decrees. An application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC is maintainable when: the defendant(s) was not duly served with the summons, or the service was defective, preventing their appearance; the defendant(s) was prevented from appearing due to sufficient cause, such as illness, accident, or other unavoidable circumstances; the decree was passed exparte, i.e., in the absence of the defendant, without hearing their defense. The application must be filed by the defendant in the court that passed the ex-parte decree. The defendant must demonstrate that they were not served or had sufficient cause for non-appearance. The court may set aside the decree in terms (e.g., costs) and allow the defendant to contest the suit. Unlike Section 12(2) CPC, this provision-Order IX, Rule 13, CPC is limited to ex-parte decrees and does not cover fraud or jurisdiction issues unless they relate to service or non-appearance. Key Distinctions between the applications under section 12(2) and IX(13), CPC are that Section 12(2), CPC addresses fraud, misrepresentation or lack of jurisdiction and applies to any decree or order, while Order IX Rule 13, CPC is restricted to ex-parte decrees; Section 12(2), CPC can be invoked by any aggrieved person, including non-parties, while Order IX Rule 13, CPC is available only to defendants; Section 12(2) CPC focuses on substantive defects (fraud, misrepresentation, jurisdiction), while Order IX Rule 13 CPC addresses procedural issues (non-service, sufficient cause); Section 12(2) CPC seeks to set aside the decree or order entirely, while Order IX Rule 13 CPC seeks to restore the suit for hearing on merits.In light of the above, an application under Section 12(2) CPC lies when a decree or order is tainted by fraud, misrepresentation, or lack of jurisdiction, as seen in cases like fabrication of documents or jurisdictional overreach. Conversely, an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC lies when an ex-parte decree is passed due to non-service of summons or sufficient cause for the defendant’s non-appearance, such as illness or defective service. The court must assess the facts and evidence to determine the appropriate remedy under each provision.

 Ancillary Provisions for Section 12(2) CPC can be summarized as such that Section 47 CPC10 deals with questions arising between parties to a suit (or their representatives) regarding the execution, discharge, or satisfaction of a decree. Meaning thereby, if a decree is challenged under Section 12(2) CPC on the basis of fraud or lack of jurisdiction, issues related to its execution (e.g., whether the decree is enforceable) may be addressed under Section 47 CPC during execution proceedings. 
For instance, if a decree obtained by fraud is sought to be executed, the aggrieved party may raise objections under Section 47 CPC, alongside or instead of a separate application under Section 12(2) CPC, depending on the stage of proceedings; Section 151 CPC11empowers courts to pass orders necessary to meet the ends of justice or prevent abuse of the process of the court. It is notable fact that if an application under Section 12(2) CPC does not fully address procedural gaps (e.g. interim relief to stay execution of a fraudulent decree), the court may invoke its inherent powers under Section 151 CPC. For example, if a decree is challenged for fraud under Section 12(2) CPC, the Court may use Section 151 CPC to stay execution proceedings pending the adjudication of the application. 

Further, provisions under Order XXI (e.g. Rules 2612, 2913, 9014, 99–101) govern the execution of decrees. If a decree is challenged under Section 12(2) CPC for fraud or lack of jurisdiction, ancillary issues like staying execution (Order XXI Rule 26, CPC) or setting aside a sale in execution due to fraud (Order XXI Rule 90, CPC) may arise;if a property is sold in execution of a decree obtained by misrepresentation, the affected party may seek to set aside the sale under Order XXI Rule 90 CPC, in conjunction with an application under Section 12(2) CPC; Section 9 CPC establishes that civil courts have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature unless barred. When an application under Section 12(2) CPC is filed alleging want of jurisdiction, Section 9 CPC provides the foundational principle for determining whether the court had the authority to pass the decree. For instance, if a decree is challenged under Section 12(2) CPC for being passed by a court lacking territorial jurisdiction, Section 9 CPC guides the inquiry into the court’s competence. 

 However, ancillary Provisions for Order IX Rule 13 CPC can be summarized as such: Order V (Rules 1–30) CPC governs the issuance and service of summons. Since an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC often hinges on non-service or defective service of summons, Order V CPC provisions are critical to determining whether the service was proper. For example, if a defendant claims non-service under Order IX Rule 13, CPC because the summons were not served as per Order V Rule 15 CPC (service on an adult member of the family), the court will examine compliance with Order V, CPC; Order IX Rule 6 CPC outlines the procedure when the defendant does not appear, leading to an exparte decree. This provision sets the stage for an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC, as it defines the circumstances under which an ex-parte decree is passed; if a court proceeds ex-parte under Order IX Rule 6 CPC due to the defendant’s absence, the defendant may apply under Order IX Rule 13 CPC to set aside the decree, citing non-service or sufficient cause; if the suit is at the hearing stage and has not yet resulted in a decree, Order IX Rule 7 CPC allows the defendant to apply to set aside the ex-parte proceedings and join the hearing. This is a precursor to Order IX Rule 13 CPC, applicable when the case is still ongoing. For instance, if defendant(s) learns of the ex-parte proceedings before the decree is passed, he may apply under Order IX Rule 7 instead of waiting to file under Order IX Rule 13, CPC; Order IX Rule 14 CPC mandates that no ex-parte decree shall be set aside under Order IX Rule 13 CPC without giving notice to the opposite party (plaintiff). It ensures procedural fairness in applications under Order IX Rule 13, CPC. When a defendant files an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC, the court must issue notice to the plaintiff under Order IX Rule 14 CPC before deciding the application. In addition to the above, if an ex-parte decree is set aside under Order IX Rule 13 CPC, Section 144 CPC allows the court to order restitution to restore the parties to their original position (e.g. refund of money paid under the decree or restoration of property). 

Moreover, if a defendant’s property was sold in execution of an ex-parte decree that is later on set aside, Section 144 CPC may be invoked to restore the property to the defendant. Similar to its role in Section 12(2) CPC, Section 151 CPC can be used to address procedural gaps in Order IX Rule 13 CPC applications, such as granting interim relief to stay execution of an ex-parte decree pending the application’s adjudication. Furthermore, provisions like Order XXI Rule 26(stay of execution) and Rule 29 CPC (stay of suit when execution is pending), are ancillary to Order IX Rule 13 CPC, as they allow the court to manage execution proceedings while the application to set aside the ex-parte decree is pending. If a defendant files an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC and the decree is being executed, they may seek a stay under Order XXI Rule 26, CPC.

The ancillary provisions ensure procedural fairness, provide mechanisms for execution or stay, and allow appeals or restitution, complementing the primary remedies under Section 12(2) and Order IX Rule 13, CPC. Provisions like Section 151 and Order XXI, CPC grant courts flexibility to address case-specific issues, ensuring justice is not defeated by procedural technicalities. Both Section 12(2) and Order IX Rule 13, CPC applications require compliance with procedural rules [e.g., notice under Order IX Rule 14 CPC or evidence of fraud under Section 12(2) CPC], and ancillary provisions like Order V or Section 47, CPC guide these requirements.

Crl.P.L.A.1425/2024
Ghazi Arab v. The State
2025 SCMR 1967
فیصلہ ۔۔۔۔
یہ قانون کا طے شدہ اصول ہے کہ جب کوئی مقدمہ دائرۂ ممانعت (Prohibitory Clause) میں آتا ہے تو بعد از گرفتاری ضمانت (Post-Arrest Bail) صرف اُن استثنائی صورتوں (Exceptions) میں دی جا سکتی ہے جو قانون میں بیان کی گئی ہیں، یعنی:

(i) ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 497(1) کی پہلی proviso کے تحت، جب ملزم عورت، کم عمر (minor)، بیمار یا کمزور (infirm person) ہو؛

(ii) دفعہ 497(1) کی تیسری proviso کے تحت، جب مقدمے کے فیصلے میں غیرمعقول تاخیر ہو جو ملزم کی طرف سے نہ ہو؛

(iii) اور دفعہ 497(2) Cr.P.C. کے تحت، جب ملزم کے جرم میں ملوث ہونے پر مزید تحقیق (further inquiry) کی ضرورت ہو۔

تاہم، دستیاب مواد کے ابتدائی یا عبوری جائزے (tentative assessment) سے ظاہر ہوتا ہے کہ درخواست گزار (petitioner) کا کیس ایسا نہیں جو مزید تحقیق کے زمرے میں آتا ہو، لہٰذا وہ دفعہ 497(2) Cr.P.C. کے تحت ضمانت کا مستحق نہیں بنتا۔

یہ بھی قانون کا مسلمہ اصول ہے کہ اگر قرائن سے معقول بنیادیں (reasonable grounds) موجود ہوں کہ ملزم نے ایسا جرم کیا ہے جو سزائے موت یا عمر قید کے قابل ہے، تو ایسا مقدمہ دفعہ 497 Cr.P.C. کی prohibitory clause میں آتا ہے۔

مزید یہ کہ ضمانت کے مرحلے (bail stage) پر گہرائی میں جا کر شواہد کی جانچ پڑتال کرنا مناسب نہیں ہوتا، کیونکہ ایسا کرنے سے مقدمے کے میرٹ (merits) پر اثر پڑ سکتا ہے۔

تاہم، دستیاب مواد کے ابتدائی جائزے سے یہ بات ظاہر ہوتی ہے کہ درخواست گزار بادی النظر (prima facie) میں جرم میں ملوث ہے، جو دفعہ 497 Cr.P.C. کی prohibitory clause کے دائرے میں آتا ہے۔

 Bare Act 
Section 497, Criminal Procedure Code, 1898
Section 497 – When bail may be taken in case of non-bailable offence
(1) When any person accused of any non-bailable offence is arrested or detained without warrant by an officer in charge of a police station, or appears or is brought before a Court, he may be released on bail, but—
such person shall not be so released if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for ten years:

Provided that the Court may direct that any person under the age of sixteen years, or any woman, or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be released on bail:

Provided further that a person shall not be released on bail if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence under section 16 of the Offences Relating to Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979:

Provided also that the Court may release the accused on bail if it is satisfied that the delay in the trial of the case is not attributable to the accused and such delay is of unreasonable length.

(2) If it appears to such Court that there are not reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed a non-bailable offence, but there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into his guilt, the accused shall be released on bail pending such inquiry.

(3) An officer or a Court releasing any person on bail under this section shall record in writing his or its reasons for so doing.

(4) If, at any time after the conclusion of the trial of a person accused of an offence, the Court of Appeal or Revision is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed a non-bailable offence, it may cause him to be arrested and commit him to custody.

 
دفعہ 497 – غیر ضمانتی جرم کی صورت میں ضمانت کب دی جا سکتی ہے

(1) جب کوئی شخص کسی غیر ضمانتی جرم (Non-bailable offence) میں گرفتار کیا جائے یا بغیر وارنٹ کے حراست میں لیا جائے یا عدالت کے روبرو پیش کیا جائے، تو عدالت اسے ضمانت پر رہا کر سکتی ہے،
تاہم اگر ایسے معقول شواہد یا وجوہات (reasonable grounds) موجود ہوں کہ وہ سزائے موت، عمر قید یا دس سال قید کے قابل جرم کا مرتکب ہوا ہے تو اسے ضمانت پر رہا نہیں کیا جائے گا۔

پہلی مشروط شق (First Proviso):
عدالت کسی سولہ سال سے کم عمر، عورت، بیمار یا کمزور شخص کو ضمانت پر رہا کر سکتی ہے، چاہے جرم prohibitory clause میں آتا ہو۔

تیسری مشروط شق
 (Third Proviso)
اگر مقدمے کے فیصلے میں غیر معقول تاخیر (unreasonable delay) ہو جو ملزم کی وجہ سے نہ ہو، تو عدالت ملزم کو ضمانت دے سکتی ہے۔

(2) اگر عدالت کو معلوم ہو کہ ایسے معقول شواہد موجود نہیں کہ ملزم نے غیر ضمانتی جرم کیا ہے، لیکن مزید تحقیق (further inquiry) کی ضرورت ہے، تو ایسے شخص کو ضمانت پر رہا کیا جائے گا۔

(3) ضمانت دینے والی عدالت اپنے فیصلے کی تحریری وجوہات لازمی ریکارڈ کرے گی۔

(4) اگر مقدمے کے بعد اپیل یا نظرثانی کے دوران عدالت یہ سمجھے کہ ملزم نے غیر ضمانتی جرم کیا ہے، تو وہ اسے دوبارہ گرفتار کر کے حراست میں دے سکتی ہے۔
 قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ
 Analytical Legal Review

1. Prohibitory Clause 
کی بنیاد
قانون کے مطابق، اگر جرم کی سزا سزائے موت، عمر قید، یا دس سال سے زائد ہو تو یہ مقدمہ Prohibitory Clause کے زمرے میں آتا ہے۔
ایسے مقدمات میں ضمانت بطورِ اصول (Rule) نہیں دی جاتی بلکہ بطورِ استثنا (Exception) دی جا سکتی ہے۔
(Ref: Tariq Bashir v. The State PLD 1995 SC 34)

2. استثنائی صورتیں (Exceptions)
عدالتیں تین بنیادوں پر ضمانت دے سکتی ہیں:

(i) پہلی Proviso (Section 497(1))
اگر ملزم عورت، نابالغ، بیمار یا کمزور ہو → عدالت انسانی ہمدردی یا صحت کی بنیاد پر ضمانت دے سکتی ہے۔
(Ref: Zafar Iqbal v. The State, 2020 SCMR 139)

(ii) تیسری Proviso
اگر مقدمے کے فیصلے میں غیر معقول تاخیر ہو، اور تاخیر ملزم کی طرف سے نہ ہو → عدالت ضمانت دے سکتی ہے۔
(Ref: Muhammad Tanveer v. The State, PLD 2017 SC 733)

(iii) دفعہ 497(2) Further Inquiry
اگر دستیاب مواد ایسا ہو کہ ملزم کے ملوث ہونے میں شک یا مزید تفتیش کی گنجائش ہو، تو ضمانت بطورِ حق ملزم کو دی جاتی ہے۔
(Ref: Rana Abdul Khaliq v. The State, 2019 SCMR 1129)

3. Tentative Assessment کا اصول
ضمانت کے مرحلے پر عدالت گہرائی سے شواہد کا تجزیہ نہیں کرتی۔
بلکہ ظاہری مواد (prima facie evidence) کی بنیاد پر دیکھتی ہے کہ ملزم ملوث ہے یا نہیں۔
اگر بادی النظر میں جرم کے ارتکاب کے معقول شواہد موجود ہوں → ضمانت مسترد کی جاتی ہے۔
(Ref: Ghazi Arab v. The State, 2025 SCMR 1967)

4. Further Inquiry کی تعریف
"Further inquiry" کا مطلب ہے کہ شواہد غیر واضح یا متنازع ہوں، یا اس میں شک کی گنجائش ہو۔
اگر ایسا ہو، تو عدالت دفعہ 497(2) کے تحت ملزم کو ضمانت دیتی ہے —
کیونکہ "benefit of doubt" ابتدائی مرحلے پر بھی لاگو ہوتا ہے۔
(Ref: Muhammad Bashir v. The State, PLD 2007 SC 539)

5. Ghazi Arab Case (2025 SCMR 1967) – Judicial Principle
سپریم کورٹ نے اس مقدمے میں واضح کیا کہ

جہاں معقول شواہد موجود ہوں کہ ملزم نے ایسا جرم کیا جو Prohibitory Clause میں آتا ہے،
وہاں ضمانت بطورِ حق نہیں دی جا سکتی۔

عدالت صرف تین قانونی استثناؤں میں ضمانت دے سکتی ہے۔

گہرائی سے جانچ (deeper scrutiny) اس مرحلے پر نہیں کی جاتی۔

اگر عبوری جائزے (tentative assessment) سے جرم میں ملوث ہونے کا امکان ظاہر ہو، تو ضمانت رد کی جائے گی۔

6. نتیجاً مختصراً۔۔،
دفعہ 497 Cr.P.C. 
ایک توازن قائم کرتی ہے
ایک طرف ملزم کے بنیادی حقوق 
(liberty)
 ہیں، 
دوسری طرف جرم کی سنگینی 
(gravity of offence)۔
اس لیے عدالت ضمانت دیتے وقت صرف قانونی استثناؤں کو مدنظر رکھتی ہے،
ورنہ Prohibitory Clause کے مقدمات میں ضمانت نہ دینا اصول اور دینا استثنا ہے۔

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
[10/29/25, 1:58:44 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Grant of interim relief within meaning of Section 7(1) of the Illegal Dispissession Act 2005 was subject to condition “during the trial”. The said stage is the condition precedent. The use of word by legislature “during the trial” in Section 7(1) of the Act is of significance importance. The expression “during the trial” is not as common sense assumes.
Thus, use of word by the legislature "during the trial" in section 7(1) of the IDA, 2005 is of significant importance. There is no cavil to the proposition that taking of cognizance is not commencement of the trial. Trial of a case commences with the framing of the charge.  

The procedural stage, as envisaged under the special law, was altogether disregarded prior to the issuance of the impugned order. It is a well-settled principle in the administration of justice that when the law prescribes a specific manner for performing a particular act, it must be carried out in that prescribed manner alone and not otherwise. 13.  Execution or implementation constitutes the process through which a judicial order is enforced, thereby enabling the successful party to derive the intended benefit from such order. While it is not in dispute that the complainant is the uncle of the accused, the familial relationship stands overshadowed by the severity of the disputes, which were of such a grave nature that they could not be resolved within the family or the local community, ultimately necessitating judicial intervention. Significantly, the complainant/respondent had explicitly alleged in the complaint that the accused/petitioner had extended threats of murder. 

Statutes are undoubtedly an important source of law, but their effectualness as law has a great deal to do with the way they are regarded by the judges of any country. The brute fact remains that the statutes do not interpret themselves. Their meaning, their import and their application to the concrete situation of life, must await the sanction of the court and, to borrow the felicitous phrase of Gray “it is with the meaning declared by the courts, and no other meaning, that they are imposed upon the community as Law.”

Civil cases are decided based on preponderance of evidence, while in a criminal case, the entire burden lies on the prosecution, and proof beyond reasonable doubt has to be given. There is neither any statutory provision nor any legal principle that the findings recorded in one proceeding may be treated as final or binding in the other, as both cases have to be decided based on the evidence adduced therein.

[10/29/25, 1:58:48 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The purpose behind the infliction of sentence is twofold. Firstly, it would create such atmosphere which could become a deterrence for the people who have inclination towards crime and; secondly, to work as a medium in reforming the offence. Deterrent punishment is not only to maintain balance with gravity of wrong done by a person but also to make an example for others as a preventive measure for reformation of the society. However, in such like cases, where the appellants have committed the murders of three innocent persons during the occurrence, they deserve no leniency. If in any proved case lenient view is taken, then peace, tranquillity and harmony of society would be jeopardized and vandalism would prevail in the society. Now-a-days the crime in the society has reached an alarming situation and in the mental propensity towards the commission of crime with impunity is increasing. Sense of fear in the mind of a criminal before embarking upon its commission could only be inculcated when he is certain of its punishment provided by law and it is only then that the purpose and object of punishment could be assiduously achieved. If a Court of law at any stage relaxes its grip, the hardened criminal would take the society on the same page, allowing the habitual recidivist to run away scot-free.

(1). Four-Staged Proportionality Framework.
------------------------

The principle of proportionality provides a structured framework for judicial review of administrative actions. Developed across various constitutional jurisdictions, it involves a four-step test: 
(i) the measure must pursue a legitimate aim; 
(ii) be suitable to achieve that aim; 
(iii) be necessary, in that no less restrictive alternative exists; and
(iv) strike a fair balance between the measure’s impact on individual rights and the public interest. 
Supreme Court has recently introduced and adopted this four-stage test to assess the legality and fairness of administrative and disciplinary decisions. Such framework ensures that any interference with rights is justified, necessary, and lawful.  

(2). Proportionality to be applied with discipline, care, and sensitivity to where fundamental rights and human dignity are at stake.
----------------------------
Proportionality promotes a stable and systematic method of constitutional adjudication. Courts employing this approach are expected to articulate clearly the reasoning behind their decisions at each stage of the analysis thereby enhancing transparency, accountability, and legitimacy in judicial reasoning. Proportionality must, therefore, be applied with discipline, care, and sensitivity to context, particularly where fundamental rights and human dignity are at stake.

When an application under Section 12(2) of the CPC lies and when an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC lies, with illustrative instances to clarify their respective scopes.
.......................
Sub-section (2) of Section 12 CPC.
...........................

 The provision of Sub-section (2) of Section 12 CPC provides a remedy to challenge a judgment, decree, or order obtained by: 
i). fraud, 
ii). misrepresentation, or 
iii). want of jurisdiction.

 However, mere used of these terms is not sufficient, rather specific particulars must be provided as required by Rule 4 of Order VI, CPC5. It allows any person6 affected by such a decree or order to apply to the court that passed it, seeking to set it aside. This provision is not limited to parties to the suit but extends to any person aggrieved by the decree or order. It means an application under Section 12(2) CPC is maintainable when the decree or order was obtained by deliberate deception or suppression of material facts from the Court. However, the judgment supports a broader reading that includes fraud between the parties affecting the decree. For instance, if a plaintiff fabricates documents or misleads the court to secure a favorable judgment, the affected party can invoke Section 12(2) CPC;when the decree results from unintentional but material misstatement of facts by a party, leading the court to pass an erroneous order. For example, if a party misrepresents the ownership of property in a suit, the aggrieved party may apply under this section; and when the court lacked inherent jurisdiction to pass the decree or order. For instance, if a court passes a decree in a matter outside its territorial or pecuniary jurisdiction, an application under Section 12(2) can be filed. Additionally, a person not a party to the suit but affected by the decree e.g., a third party whose property is wrongly included in a decree, may apply under this section. The application must be filed in the same court that passed the decree or order. The applicant must prove fraud, misrepresentation, or lack of jurisdiction with cogent evidence. The scope of application under Section 12(2) CPC is broader than Order IX Rule 13, CPC, as it is not limited to ex-parte decrees and can be invoked by non-parties.

Rule 13 of Order IX, CPC.
........................

This provision of Rule 13 of Order IX, CPC provides a remedy to set aside an ex-parte decree passed against a defendant who was unable to appear when the suit was called for hearing. It applies only to defendants and is limited to ex-parte decrees. An application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC is maintainable when: the defendant(s) was not duly served with the summons, or the service was defective, preventing their appearance; the defendant(s) was prevented from appearing due to sufficient cause, such as illness, accident, or other unavoidable circumstances; the decree was passed exparte, i.e., in the absence of the defendant, without hearing their defense. The application must be filed by the defendant in the court that passed the ex-parte decree. The defendant must demonstrate that they were not served or had sufficient cause for non-appearance. The court may set aside the decree in terms (e.g., costs) and allow the defendant to contest the suit. Unlike Section 12(2) CPC, this provision-Order IX, Rule 13, CPC is limited to ex-parte decrees and does not cover fraud or jurisdiction issues unless they relate to service or non-appearance. Key Distinctions between the applications under section 12(2) and IX(13), CPC are that Section 12(2), CPC addresses fraud, misrepresentation or lack of jurisdiction and applies to any decree or order, while Order IX Rule 13, CPC is restricted to ex-parte decrees; Section 12(2), CPC can be invoked by any aggrieved person, including non-parties, while Order IX Rule 13, CPC is available only to defendants; Section 12(2) CPC focuses on substantive defects (fraud, misrepresentation, jurisdiction), while Order IX Rule 13 CPC addresses procedural issues (non-service, sufficient cause); Section 12(2) CPC seeks to set aside the decree or order entirely, while Order IX Rule 13 CPC seeks to restore the suit for hearing on merits.In light of the above, an application under Section 12(2) CPC lies when a decree or order is tainted by fraud, misrepresentation, or lack of jurisdiction, as seen in cases like fabrication of documents or jurisdictional overreach. Conversely, an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC lies when an ex-parte decree is passed due to non-service of summons or sufficient cause for the defendant’s non-appearance, such as illness or defective service. The court must assess the facts and evidence to determine the appropriate remedy under each provision.

 Ancillary Provisions for Section 12(2) CPC can be summarized as such that Section 47 CPC10 deals with questions arising between parties to a suit (or their representatives) regarding the execution, discharge, or satisfaction of a decree. Meaning thereby, if a decree is challenged under Section 12(2) CPC on the basis of fraud or lack of jurisdiction, issues related to its execution (e.g., whether the decree is enforceable) may be addressed under Section 47 CPC during execution proceedings. 
For instance, if a decree obtained by fraud is sought to be executed, the aggrieved party may raise objections under Section 47 CPC, alongside or instead of a separate application under Section 12(2) CPC, depending on the stage of proceedings; Section 151 CPC11empowers courts to pass orders necessary to meet the ends of justice or prevent abuse of the process of the court. It is notable fact that if an application under Section 12(2) CPC does not fully address procedural gaps (e.g. interim relief to stay execution of a fraudulent decree), the court may invoke its inherent powers under Section 151 CPC. For example, if a decree is challenged for fraud under Section 12(2) CPC, the Court may use Section 151 CPC to stay execution proceedings pending the adjudication of the application. 

Further, provisions under Order XXI (e.g. Rules 2612, 2913, 9014, 99–101) govern the execution of decrees. If a decree is challenged under Section 12(2) CPC for fraud or lack of jurisdiction, ancillary issues like staying execution (Order XXI Rule 26, CPC) or setting aside a sale in execution due to fraud (Order XXI Rule 90, CPC) may arise;if a property is sold in execution of a decree obtained by misrepresentation, the affected party may seek to set aside the sale under Order XXI Rule 90 CPC, in conjunction with an application under Section 12(2) CPC; Section 9 CPC establishes that civil courts have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature unless barred. When an application under Section 12(2) CPC is filed alleging want of jurisdiction, Section 9 CPC provides the foundational principle for determining whether the court had the authority to pass the decree. For instance, if a decree is challenged under Section 12(2) CPC for being passed by a court lacking territorial jurisdiction, Section 9 CPC guides the inquiry into the court’s competence. 

 However, ancillary Provisions for Order IX Rule 13 CPC can be summarized as such: Order V (Rules 1–30) CPC governs the issuance and service of summons. Since an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC often hinges on non-service or defective service of summons, Order V CPC provisions are critical to determining whether the service was proper. For example, if a defendant claims non-service under Order IX Rule 13, CPC because the summons were not served as per Order V Rule 15 CPC (service on an adult member of the family), the court will examine compliance with Order V, CPC; Order IX Rule 6 CPC outlines the procedure when the defendant does not appear, leading to an exparte decree. This provision sets the stage for an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC, as it defines the circumstances under which an ex-parte decree is passed; if a court proceeds ex-parte under Order IX Rule 6 CPC due to the defendant’s absence, the defendant may apply under Order IX Rule 13 CPC to set aside the decree, citing non-service or sufficient cause; if the suit is at the hearing stage and has not yet resulted in a decree, Order IX Rule 7 CPC allows the defendant to apply to set aside the ex-parte proceedings and join the hearing. This is a precursor to Order IX Rule 13 CPC, applicable when the case is still ongoing. For instance, if defendant(s) learns of the ex-parte proceedings before the decree is passed, he may apply under Order IX Rule 7 instead of waiting to file under Order IX Rule 13, CPC; Order IX Rule 14 CPC mandates that no ex-parte decree shall be set aside under Order IX Rule 13 CPC without giving notice to the opposite party (plaintiff). It ensures procedural fairness in applications under Order IX Rule 13, CPC. When a defendant files an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC, the court must issue notice to the plaintiff under Order IX Rule 14 CPC before deciding the application. In addition to the above, if an ex-parte decree is set aside under Order IX Rule 13 CPC, Section 144 CPC allows the court to order restitution to restore the parties to their original position (e.g. refund of money paid under the decree or restoration of property). 

Moreover, if a defendant’s property was sold in execution of an ex-parte decree that is later on set aside, Section 144 CPC may be invoked to restore the property to the defendant. Similar to its role in Section 12(2) CPC, Section 151 CPC can be used to address procedural gaps in Order IX Rule 13 CPC applications, such as granting interim relief to stay execution of an ex-parte decree pending the application’s adjudication. Furthermore, provisions like Order XXI Rule 26(stay of execution) and Rule 29 CPC (stay of suit when execution is pending), are ancillary to Order IX Rule 13 CPC, as they allow the court to manage execution proceedings while the application to set aside the ex-parte decree is pending. If a defendant files an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC and the decree is being executed, they may seek a stay under Order XXI Rule 26, CPC.

The ancillary provisions ensure procedural fairness, provide mechanisms for execution or stay, and allow appeals or restitution, complementing the primary remedies under Section 12(2) and Order IX Rule 13, CPC. Provisions like Section 151 and Order XXI, CPC grant courts flexibility to address case-specific issues, ensuring justice is not defeated by procedural technicalities. Both Section 12(2) and Order IX Rule 13, CPC applications require compliance with procedural rules [e.g., notice under Order IX Rule 14 CPC or evidence of fraud under Section 12(2) CPC], and ancillary provisions like Order V or Section 47, CPC guide these requirements.

تحریر: ارباب سلطان حسین
چیئرمین  غریب کی آواز  جیل


انسانی رشتوں میں سب سے مضبوط رشتہ ماں اور باپ کا ہوتا ہے،
اور ان کے درمیان ایک بچے کی مسکراہٹ سب سے بڑی نعمت۔
مگر جب حالات تلخ ہو جائیں اور والدین کے درمیان اختلاف پیدا ہو جائے،
تو وہی معصوم بچہ انصاف اور رحم کے بیچ میں آ جاتا ہے۔

ایسے وقت میں عدالت کا فرض بنتا ہے کہ وہ جذبات نہیں بلکہ فلاحِ طفل (welfare of the child) کو دیکھے،
کیونکہ بچہ نہ کسی کا مقدمہ ہے، نہ دلیل 
بلکہ اللہ کی امانت ہے۔

 معاملہ کیا ہے؟

ایک ماں نے عدالت میں گارجین اینڈ وارڈ ایکٹ 1890 کے تحت
دفعات 7، 10، 12 اور 25 کے مطابق درخواست دائر کی،
جس میں بچے کی تحویل (custody) اور سرپرستی (guardianship) مانگی گئی۔

عدالت نے نوٹس جاری کیا،
تو باپ (مدعا علیہ) نے نہ صرف جوابی بیان (written statement) جمع کروایا
بلکہ اسی عدالت میں ایک علیحدہ گارجین شپ درخواست بھی دائر کر دی
دفعہ 25 اور 12 کے تحت 
اسی بچے، اسی موضوع اور اسی معاملے پر۔

 قانون کیا کہتا ہے؟

قانون بالکل واضح ہے:
جب کسی عدالت میں ایک بچے کے متعلق گارجین شپ کی درخواست پہلے سے زیرِ سماعت ہو،
تو دوسرے فریق کو الگ درخواست دائر کرنے کی اجازت نہیں۔

اسے چاہیے کہ وہ اپنی بات اسی مقدمے میں رکھے،
بطورِ جوابی دعویٰ (Counter Claim) یا عبوری تحویل (Section 12 Application) کے ذریعے۔

عدالتیں بارہا یہ اصول دہرا چکی ہیں کہ
ایک ہی عدالت میں ایک ہی بچے کے متعلق دو علیحدہ درخواستیں
غیر قانونی اور ناقابلِ سماعت ہیں۔
(PLD 2003 Lahore 225، 2004 SCMR 1885)

 قانونی اور اخلاقی راستہ

اگر باپ بچے کی تحویل چاہتا ہے،
تو بہتر اور قانونی راستہ یہ ہے کہ وہ اپنی استدعا اسی زیرِ سماعت کیس میں پیش کرے۔
اس طرح عدالت دونوں والدین کو سن کر بچے کی بہتری اور مستقبل کے مطابق فیصلہ دے سکتی ہے۔

❤️ غریب کی آواز  جیل کا پیغام

“غریب کی آواز  جیل” ہمیشہ یہ پیغام دیتی ہے
کہ انصاف صرف دلیلوں سے نہیں، نیتوں سے بھی ظاہر ہوتا ہے۔

ہم سمجھتے ہیں کہ عدالتوں میں بیٹھے جج حضرات تب ہی بہتر فیصلہ کر سکتے ہیں
جب فریقین اللہ کے سامنے سچائی اور نرمی کے ساتھ اپنی بات رکھیں۔
قانون کا مقصد کسی کو نیچا دکھانا نہیں 
بلکہ انسانیت کو اونچا اٹھانا ہے.

لیکن اللہ کی رضا کو مقدم رکھتے ہیں۔

بچوں کے مقدمے فتح یا شکست کا نہیں،
بلکہ رحم اور ذمہ داری کا امتحان ہوتے ہیں۔

اللہ ہمیں عدل، رحم اور خلوص کے ساتھ فیصلے کرنے کی توفیق دے۔

The death of judgment debtor cannot in law release the surety from his obligation when there is no stipulation to that effect in the bond. 

Section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure-1908 contemplates that when a person becomes  surety for performance of any decree or its part, or restitution of any property taken in execution of decree or payment of any money under an order of the Court in any suit proceedings, the decree can be executed against him to the extent for which the surety has rendered himself personally liable in the manners, therein.

A surety’s liability is co-extensive with that of the judgment debtor and he was as much bound by his undertaking as was the judgment debtor, and both were collectively and severely liable to make payment to the decree holder. While construing the tenure and extent of surety bond, the words and recitals of the surety bond must be taken into consideration to gather the intention of the executant of said bond and the bond must be strictly construed. A surety is liable only upto the extent to which he is clearly bound.  

Through the order dated 28.11.2015 the learned executing Court directed respondent No.5 to submit surety bond of Rs.400,000/- with one local surety in the like amount and in compliance of said order, the petitioner submitted surety bond of Rs.400,000/- on 03.12.2015 and vide order dated 29.01.2016 the learned executing Court on submission of surety bond of Rs.400,000/- released respondent No.5 which facts clearly established that the petitioner was stood surety only of Rs.400,000/-. Contract of surety had provided that maximum he was liable to the tune of Rs.400,000/-. Orders of learned executing Court did not find mentioned that the respondent No.5 would arrange a surety for the payment of the entire decretal amount. Petitioner stood surety amounting to Rs.400,000/- only, which he has paid before the learned Executing Court on different occasions as detailed in his application to discharge him from the liability as surety. Said fact was not denied by respondents No.2 to 4. In these circumstances, the petitioner has satisfied the amount for which he stood surety.

On the basis of a sale agreement, no legal character or right can be established to prove the title of the property unless the title is transferred pursuant to such agreement to sell, but in case of denial or refusal by the vendor to specifically perform the agreement despite the readiness and willingness of the vendee, a suit for specific performance may be instituted in the court, but suit for declaration on the basis of a mere sale agreement is not the solution for appropriate relief.

عدالت نے کہا کہ معاہدہ برائے فروخت بذاتِ خود عنوانِ ملکیت قائم نہیں کرتا، کیونکہ وہ ٹائٹل ڈीड نہیں ہے۔ 

اس کی بنیاد پر، مدعی نے صرف معاہدہ برائے فروخت کی بنیاد پر دعویٔ اعلامیہ داخل کیا تھا، لیکن عدالت نے کہا کہ اسے درست راستہ یہ تھا کہ مخصوص نفاذ (specific performance) کی درخواست کی جائے۔ 

عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ شق 42 از Specific Relief Act, 1877 کے تحت اعلامیہ تب دی جا سکتی ہے جب مدعی کے پاس پہلے سے قانونی حق یا کردار موجود ہو جسے کوئی رد کر رہا ہو۔ 

2. Rao Abdul Rehman (v) Muhammad Afzal (2023 SCMR 815)

عدالت نے کہا: “معاہدہ برائے فروخت کی بنیاد پر کوئی قانونی کردار یا حق قائم نہیں کیا جا سکتا، جب تک اس معاہدے کے تحت ملکیت کی منتقلی نہیں ہوئی ہو”۔ 

اس فیصلے میں، عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ اگر فروختدار (vendor) مخصوص نفاذ نہیں کرتا تو مدعی کو مخصوص نفاذ کا دعویٰ کرنا چاہیے، لیکن صرف اعلامیہ کا دعویٰ مناسب نہیں۔ 
3. دیگر حوالہ جات

ایک مضمون کی بنیاد پر، “اعلامیہ کی مدعیت وہی کر سکتا ہے جس کے پاس قانونی کردار یا حق پہلے سے ہو۔ معاہدہ برائے فروخت وہ حق یا کردار نہیں دیتا جو اعلامیہ کی بنیاد بن سکے۔” 

مثال کے طور پر، ایک کیس میں عدالت نے کہا کہ “اعلامیہ کی بنیاد صرف معاہدہ برائے فروخت ہو تو وہ مدعیتاً ناقابلِ قبول ہے”۔

ملزم کی غیرحاضری کی بنا پر کیس داخلِ دفتر کیا گیا ہے، تاہم مؤدّی (درخواست گزار) کو اس فیصلے پر اعتراض ہے کیونکہ یہ ایک فائنل آرڈر نہیں بلکہ عدالتی کارروائی کی عارضی بندش ہے۔ لہٰذا، مؤدّی کو یہ حق حاصل ہے کہ وہ اسی عدالت میں درخواستِ بحالی (Restoration Application) جمع کرے تاکہ مقدمہ دوبارہ بحال کیا جا سکے۔
عدالتِ عالیہ کے متعدد فیصلوں میں یہ قرار دیا گیا ہے کہ اگر کسی فریق کی غیرحاضری معقول وجوہات کی بنا پر ہو (مثلاً اطلاع نہ ملنا، بیماری، سفر، یا وکیل کی غیرموجودگی وغیرہ)، تو عدالت کو انصاف کے تقاضے پورے کرنے کے لیے کیس بحال کرنے کا اختیار حاصل ہے۔
اس لیے مؤدّی کی استدعا ہے کہ عدالت انصاف کے اصولوں کے تحت فائنل آرڈر پر نظرِثانی کرتے ہوئے مقدمہ بحال کرے تاکہ فریقین کو سماعت کا پورا موقع دیا جا سکے۔"
⚖️ قانونی حوالہ (Case Law Example):
1. PLD 2003 Lahore 250  عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ اگر کیس داخلِ دفتر ہو گیا ہو مگر فریق کی غیرحاضری معقول ہو، تو عدالت اس کیس کو دوبارہ بحال کر سکتی ہے۔
2. YLR 2008 Karachi 1122 کیس بحالی کی درخواست اسی عدالت میں قابلِ سماعت قرار دی گئی جہاں کیس بند ہوا تھا۔
3. PLJ 2015 Lahore 332  فائنل آرڈر کے خلاف نظرثانی یا بحالی کی درخواست قابلِ قبول قرار پائی۔

[10/31/25, 2:02:27 PM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: 🎙️ موضوع: مچھلی اور انسان  بدبو کی حقیقت

اللہ کے نام سے آغاز کرتا ہوں، جو دلوں کے حال جانتا ہے۔
میرے محترم بھائیو اور بہنو!
آج میں آپ کے سامنے ایک چھوٹا سا مگر بہت گہرا جملہ رکھنا چاہتا ہوں 
کہا جاتا ہے:

> “مچھلی سے بدبو اس لیے آتی ہے کہ وہ اپنی اولاد کھا جاتی ہے، اپنی نسل کھا جاتی ہے،
اور انسان سے بدبو اس لیے آتی ہے کہ وہ منافق ہوتا ہے۔”

میرے عزیزو!
مچھلی اپنی نسل کھا جاتی ہے تو بدبو آتی ہے،
اور انسان جب اپنی سچائی، ایمان، وعدہ، اور غیرت کھا جاتا ہے تو
اس کے وجود سے بھی بدبو آنے لگتی ہے۔
یہ بدبو جسم کی نہیں، ضمیر کی ہوتی ہے۔
مچھلی چند لمحوں میں مر جاتی ہے،
مگر انسان جب اپنے ایمان کو مار دیتا ہے تو
پورا معاشرہ مرجھا جاتا ہے۔
ہم نے دیکھا ہے کہ جب قوموں میں منافقت، جھوٹ، ظلم،
اور خودغرضی آ جاتی ہے تو وہاں سے خیر ختم ہو جاتی ہے۔
نہ انصاف رہتا ہے، نہ رحم، نہ احساس۔
اور جب دل سے احساس مر جائے تو انسان صرف شکل سے انسان رہتا ہے،
روح سے نہیں۔

میرے بھائیو!
آج ہمیں اپنے معاشرے کو اس “بدبو” سے پاک کرنے کی ضرورت ہے۔
اور یہی مشن لے کر “غریب کی آواز  جیل” میدان میں نکلا ہے۔
ہم ان بےگناہ قیدیوں کے لیے آواز اٹھاتے ہیں
جنہیں کسی جرم کے بغیر جیلوں میں ڈال دیا گیا۔
ہم ان یتیموں، مزدوروں، اور بےسہاروں کے لیے کھڑے ہیں
جن کے پاس بولنے والا کوئی نہیں۔

ہمارا مقصد شہرت نہیں،
بلکہ صرف اور صرف اللہ کی رضا اور انسانیت کی خدمت ہے۔
کیونکہ سچی خوشبو تب آتی ہے جب نیت خالص ہو،
جب کام صرف اللہ کے لیے ہو،
جب کسی غریب کے چہرے پر مسکراہٹ واپس لائی جائے۔

آؤ،
مچھلی کی طرح اپنی نسل نہ کھاؤ 
بلکہ انسان بن کر اپنی قوم، اپنے بھائی، اپنی انسانیت کو زندہ رکھو۔
سچ بولو، عدل کرو، اور مظلوم کا ساتھ دو۔
یہی ایمان کی خوشبو ہے، یہی “غریب کی آواز جیل” کا پیغام ہے۔

اللہ ہمیں ایسا معاشرہ بنانے کی توفیق دے
جہاں جھوٹ نہیں، سچ کی خوشبو ہو۔
جہاں ظلم نہیں، انصاف ہو۔
جہاں ریا نہیں، صرف اللہ کی رضا ہو۔
آمین یا رب العالمین۔

*"ریٹائرڈ سرکاری ملازمین کے خلاف PEEDA کارروائی کا قانونی عدم اطلاق اور آئینی ضمانتِ انصاف (Article 10-A)"*
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*

Mr. Justice Salahuddin Panhwar
Uploaded 
29/10/2025

اگرچہ 
PEEDA (Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act) کے تحت بدعنوانی (misconduct) ثابت بھی ہو جائے، تب بھی مجاز اتھارٹی کو ایسی سزا دینے کا اختیار نہیں ہے جو قانون میں مقرر نہ ہو۔
خصوصاً PEEDA کی دفعہ 4 میں واضح طور پر جن سزاؤں کا ذکر ہے، صرف وہی دی جا سکتی ہیں۔

یہ نہایت تشویش ناک بات ہے کہ کس بنیاد پر ترقی (promotion) اور selection grade کے احکامات واپس لے لیے گئے، جبکہ ایسی سزا دفعہ 4 میں موجود ہی نہیں۔

مزید برآں، درجہ کم کرنے (lower scale) کی سزا صرف ملازمت پر موجود سرکاری ملازمین کے لیے ہے، ریٹائرڈ ملازمین پر اس کا اطلاق نہیں ہوتا۔

اسی طرح رقم کی وصولی (recovery) کا حکم بھی برقرار نہیں رہ سکتا، کیونکہ یہ تعزیری (penal) نوعیت رکھتا ہے، اور اس کے لیے ضروری ہے کہ انکوائری کے بعد یہ واضح کیا جائے کہ ملازم کے کسی فعل یا غفلت سے سرکاری خزانے کو قابلِ پیمائش نقصان پہنچا ہے — اور اسے منصفانہ موقع دیا گیا ہو۔
اس مقدمے میں ایسا کوئی واضح نتیجہ یا فیصلہ موجود نہیں۔

اسی نوعیت کے حالات میں عدالت نے ماضی میں بھی یہ قرار دیا ہے کہ کسی ملازم کو ماضی میں حاصل شدہ مراعات یا گریڈ سے محروم کرنے یا رقم واپس لینے کی ہدایت ریٹروسپیکٹیو طور پر (یعنی بعد از ریٹائرمنٹ یا عرصہ گزرنے کے بعد) نہیں دی جا سکتی۔

C.P.L.A. No. 3121-L/2022
Fazal Hussain vs. Commissioner Dera Ghazi Khan Division & others
فاضل جج: جناب جسٹس صلاح الدین پنہور
تاریخِ فیصلہ: 
 پس منظرِ مقدمہ
ملازم (پٹیشنر) کے خلاف PEEDA Act, 2006 کے تحت کارروائی کی گئی۔
انکوائری کے بعد مجاز اتھارٹی نے:

پٹیشنر کی ترقی (promotion) اور selection grade واپس لے لیے؛

اس کو کم درجے (lower scale) میں رکھا؛

اور رقم کی ریکوری (recovery) کا حکم دیا۔

یہ فیصلہ ریٹائرمنٹ کے بعد دیا گیا۔ عدالت نے ان احکامات کو غیرقانونی قرار دیا۔

 قانونی دفعات کے مطابق تجزیہ

 Section 4 – PEEDA Act, 2006 (Penalties)
Bare Act Wording:

“The competent authority may impose any of the following penalties on a government servant who is found guilty of inefficiency, misconduct, or corruption…”

Penalties include:

(a) Censure

(b) Withholding of promotion or increment

(c) Recovery from pay

(d) Reduction to a lower post or scale

(e) Compulsory retirement

(f) Removal from service

(g) Dismissal from service

 قانونی تجزیہ

یہ دفعہ صرف انہی سزاؤں کی اجازت دیتی ہے جو یہاں درج ہیں۔

“Withdrawal of promotion or selection grade already granted” بطور سزا اس فہرست میں شامل نہیں۔

لہٰذا مجاز اتھارٹی نے اختیار سے تجاوز (ultra vires) کیا۔

کسی قانون میں “retrospective punishment” (ماضی سے لاگو سزا) کی اجازت نہیں، جب تک وہ صراحتاً بیان نہ ہو۔

PLD 2018 SC 91 (Ali Azhar Khan Baloch v. Sindh Govt.)
 عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ promotion once validly granted cannot be withdrawn except under law.

2020 SCMR 1092 (Muhammad Idrees v. Govt. of Punjab)
ترقی یا selection grade کی واپسی PEEDA کی سزاؤں میں شامل نہیں۔

 Section 2(f) – Definition of “Government Servant”
“Government Servant means a person who is a member of civil service of the Province or holds a civil post in connection with the affairs of the Province.”

یہ تعریف صرف برسرِ ملازمت (in-service) ملازمین تک محدود ہے۔

ریٹائرڈ ملازم اس تعریف میں شامل نہیں۔

لہٰذا ریٹائرڈ شخص کے خلاف PEEDA کے تحت کوئی سزا یا ریکوری عائد نہیں کی جا سکتی۔

2021 PLC (C.S.) 1156 (Muhammad Akram v. Secretary Health)
 عدالت نے قرار دیا
“Proceedings under PEEDA automatically abate on retirement unless specifically saved by law.”

 Principle of Natural Justice (Audi Alteram Partem)
ریکوری یا مالی ذمہ داری عائد کرنے کے لیے ضروری ہے کہ ملازم کو:

الزامات کی واضح اطلاع (notice) دی جائے،

موقعِ صفائی (opportunity of hearing) فراہم ہو،

اور نقصان کی رقم (quantified loss) کا تعین ثبوت کے ساتھ کیا جائے۔

 موجودہ مقدمہ میں

انکوائری رپورٹ میں نہ تو کوئی quantified loss ظاہر کیا گیا،

نہ ہی عمدہ طریقے سے انکوائری یا موقعِ دفاع دیا گیا۔

PLD 2022 SC 456 (Government of Punjab v. Khalid Mahmood)
→ “Without quantified proof of loss, recovery cannot be imposed.”

2023 SCMR 725 (Secretary Irrigation v. Ghulam Abbas)
 عدالت نے recovery کو penal in nature قرار دے کر منسوخ کیا۔

 Retrospective Withdrawal of Benefits
ملازم کو اگر طویل عرصہ تک کسی پوسٹ یا گریڈ کی مراعات حاصل رہیں،
تو بعد میں ان کی واپسی غیر منصفانہ (unjust) اور ریٹروسپیکٹیو سزا شمار ہوگی۔

2021 SCMR 1483 (Nasir Mehmood v. Punjab Govt.)
→ عدالت نے کہا کہ “benefits enjoyed in good faith cannot be withdrawn retrospectively.”

2022 PLC (C.S.) 922 (Abdul Rauf v. Government of Punjab)
→ "Selection grade or promotion cannot be cancelled post-retirement."

 آئینی پہلو
 (Constitutional Dimensions)
Article 4 & 10-A – Constitution of Pakistan, 1973
Every person shall be dealt with in accordance with law.
Fair trial and due process are guaranteed rights.

PEEDA کے تحت سزائیں دیتے وقت due process اور fair inquiry لازمی ہیں۔

قانون میں موجود سزا سے باہر جا کر سزا دینا Article 4 کی خلاف ورزی ہے۔

موقعِ صفائی کے بغیر ریکوری یا سروس بینیفٹ واپس لینا Article 10-A کی خلاف ورزی ہے

عدالتیی نظریہ 
(Court’s Observation)
عدالت نے قرار دیا

“The competent authority exceeded its jurisdiction by imposing a penalty not prescribed under Section 4 of the PEEDA Act.
The impugned orders of withdrawal of promotion and selection grade and direction for recovery are without lawful authority and of no legal effect.”

 خلاصۂ قانونی نکات
قانونی پہلو عدالتی موقف
اختیارِ مجاز اتھارٹی صرف دفعہ 4 میں درج سزائیں دے سکتی ہے
واپسیِ ترقی یا سلیکشن گریڈ غیر قانونی — قانون میں درج نہیں
ریٹائرڈ ملازم پر اطلاق PEEDA لاگو نہیں ہوتا
ریکوری کا جواز تب ہی ممکن جب نقصان ثابت اور موقعِ دفاع دیا گیا ہو
ماضی میں دی گئی مراعات کی واپسی غیر منصفانہ، ریٹروسپیکٹیو سزا شمار ہوتی ہے
آئینی تقاضے Article 4 & 10-A کی خلاف ورزی

 نتیجاً مختصراً 
یہ فیصلہ واضح طور پر قانونی اختیار کی حد بندی (limitation of authority) اور natural justice کے اصولوں کو اجاگر کرتا ہے۔
اس کے مطابق

 PEEDA Act کے تحت صرف وہی سزائیں دی جا سکتی ہیں جو دفعہ 4 میں درج ہیں؛
ریٹائرڈ ملازمین کے خلاف کوئی کارروائی یا ریکوری غیر قانونی ہے؛
 ماضی میں دی گئی مراعات کی واپسی بغیر due process کے void ab initio (ابتداء سے باطل) ہے۔

خصو صِی ریلیف ایکٹ 1877 کے سیکشن 42 کی حدود و دائرہ کار۔

اگر فروخت کنندہ یا ہبہ کنندہ (Donor) اپنے حق کے حقیقی انکار کے خلاف، علم ہونے کے باوجود، مقررہ مدت کے اندر چیلنج نہیں کرتا، تو اس کا یہ حق قانونِ تعیّنِ مدت (Limitation) کے تحت ختم ہو جاتا ہے، اور بعد میں رجسٹری رپورٹ/رجسٹرڈ ریکارڈ (جمعبندی) میں غلط اندراج کی تکرار اسے نئے مقدمہ کا سبب (fresh cause of action) فراہم نہیں کرتی۔

اگر ہبہ کرنے والا/والی اپنی زندگی میں adverse انٹری کو علم کے باوجود چیلنج نہیں کرتا/کرتی تو یہ دعویٰ مدت گزشتہ (time-barred) قرار پاتا ہے۔

جب بظاہر قبضہ مدعی کے پاس موجود نہیں، تو ایسی صورت میں محض دعویٰ برائے اعلامیہ (Declaration Suit) نہیں کیا جا سکتا، بلکہ قبضہ کے حصول کی دعویٰ بھی لازمی طور پر مانگا جانا ضروری ہوتا ہے۔

 Key Legal Issues
Scope of Section 42 — Specific Relief Act, 1877

Limitation when donor/seller does not challenge adverse entry

Effect of non-challenge during lifetime of donor

Possession requirement — Declaratory Suit without possession

 Relevant Statutory Provisions
Section 42 – Specific Relief Act, 1877
Bare Act Wording

"Any person entitled to any legal character, or to any right as to any property, may institute a suit... against any person denying, or interested to deny, his title to such character or right, and the Court may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is so entitled; and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any further relief:
Provided that no Court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title, omits to do so."

ا
کوئی بھی شخص جو کسی قانونی حیثیت یا کسی جائیداد کے حق کے بارے میں دعوے دار ہو، اپنے حق کے انکار کرنے والے کے خلاف دعویٰ کرسکتا ہے، اور عدالت اسے یہ اعلامیہ دے سکتی ہے کہ وہ اس حق کا مالک ہے۔
لیکن اگر مدعی مزید عملی ریلیف لے سکتا ہو اور نہ لے تو صرف اعلامیہ نہیں دیا جا سکتا۔

 Principle in Case
صرف اعلامیہ مانگنے سے کام نہیں جب قبضہ آپ کے پاس نہ ہو۔ ایسی صورت میں دعویٰ برائے قبضہ بھی لازمی ہوگا۔

Limitation Act, 1908 — Article 120 (Residual)
Bare Act Wording:

“Six years — suits for which no period of limitation is provided elsewhere.”

جہاں قانونِ تعیّنِ مدت میں کوئی خاص مدت مقرر نہ ہو وہاں دعویٰ چھ سال کے اندر دائر کرنا ضروری ہے۔

Legal Principle Applied
اگر ملکیت کے انکار کا علم ہو اور چھ سال تک چیلنج نہ کیا جائے تو دعویٰ time-barred ہو جاتا ہے۔
جمعبندی میں غلط اندراج کی تکرار نیا cause of action نہیں بناتی۔

 Court's Legal Findings (Reasoning)

 1. Section 42 & Mandatory Relief
صرف deklaration لینا کافی نہیں

اگر قبضہ موجود نہ ہو تو Declaratory + Possession Relief لازمی ہے

یہ فیصلہ سپریم کورٹ کے اصول PLD 2002 SC 615 اور PLD 2014 SC 506 سے مطابقت رکھتا ہے

 2. Law of Limitation Controls Property Rights
Donor یا seller کو adverse entry کا علم ہوتے ہوئے اگر وہ اپنی زندگی میں چیلنج نہ کرے تو
Limitation Barretthe right forever

وارث/بعد کے شخص کو نیا cause of action نہیں ملتا

SC Principle:

"Repetition of wrong in revenue record does not give rise to fresh cause of action."

(Ref: PLD 2017 SC 28)

 3. Jamabandi Entry & Knowledge
Revenue entry adverse ہو اور علم ثابت ہو جائے

Challenge نہ کرنے پر حق ختم ہو جاتا ہے

 4. Plaintiff Not in Possession
مدعی بادی النظر میں قبضے میں نہیں تھا

اسی لئے صرف Section 42 کے تحت declaratory relief نہیں مل سکتا

 Legal Doctrine Applied
Principle Meaning
Declaratory suits are discretionary Court can refuse if proper relief not sought
Possession mandatory No possession → No bare declaration
Limitation extinguishes rights Sleeping on rights = rights lost
Wrong entry repetition No fresh cause of action

 Key Takeaways for Practice
Litigation Strategy Explanation
Always plead possession + declaration To avoid dismissal under Sec 42
Challenge revenue entries promptly Within limitation
If donor lifetime silence Successor’s claim weak
Jamabandi entries Simply recurring does not revive claim

 مختصراً نتیجاً ۔۔۔۔
یہ فیصلہ پاکستانی سول مقدمات میں ایک بنیادی اصول کی تصدیق کرتا ہے:

"Equity aids the vigilant, not those who sleep over their rights."

یعنی حق کے علم کے باوجود اگر وقت گزرنے دیا جائے تو عدالت حق فراہم نہیں کرتی۔
اور جس کے پاس قبضہ نہ ہو وہ صرف اعلامیہ کا دعویٰ نہیں کر سکتا۔

[10/31/25, 5:40:00 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: DNA and Serology Analysis Report---Doubts qua involvement of accused---Accused was charged for committing murder of the son of complainant---Prosecution placed reliance on the reports of DNA and Serology Analysis Report, whereby prosecution tried to prove the place of occurrence---Crime Scene Unit had secured blood stain found on eastern wall of north-western room of "DERA"---Accordingly, to that extent report of Forensic Science Agency was supporting the case of prosecution in terms that the accused had also pointed out the said place as 'place of murder' of the deceased---Swabs taken from 'Iron Bar' (the alleged weapon of offence) got recovered by the accused was also sent to Forensic Science Agency for DNA report---Conclusion of Forensic Science Agency was not certain about presence of DNA of accused found on the said 'Iron Bar'---So, to that extent, said segment of prosecution evidence was doubtful qua involvement of the accused---Appeal against conviction was allowed, in circumstances.

[10/31/25, 5:40:00 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Single accused---Substitution---Scope---Accused was charged for committing murder of the son of complainant---No doubt, substitution of single accused in a murder charge was a rare phenomenon but at the same time to put the rope around the neck of an accused charged singly, there must be circumstantial evidence/ocular account of unimpeachable character, trustworthy and confidence inspiring corroboration from the other pieces of evidence---Moreover, it was not the requirement of the law or the justice to consider the evidence of the prosecution as gospel truth if it was a case of sole accused rather it was the judicial duty of the Court to assess the intrinsic worth of the evidence---
2025 YLR 2372
[10/31/25, 5:40:01 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Presence of complainant at the spot not proved---Accused were charged for committing murder of the son of complainant by firing and causing firearm injuries to his friend---As per complaint, complainant narrated the tale of incident in a way to give impression that he along with witnesses had seen the occurrence but nowhere mentioned that he was not present at the spot and whatever he narrated in the complaint was on the asking of someone---Perusal of record showed that eye-witness in his examination-in-chief stated that the deceased and the injured were shifted to THQ Hospital where complainant reached and the entire occurrence was narrated to him---Occurrence took place at 2:15 p.m. and FIR was chalked out at 4:40 p.m. and what precluded witness and other eye-witnesses from reporting the matter directly to police regarding a broad daylight occurrence, made the prosecution case highly doubtful---Moreover, the name of a person from whom the complainant got drafted the complaint was not found---Neither the scriber of the complaint was produced before Investigating Officer nor at trial stage to prove that he drafted the complaint at the dictation of complainant---Admittedly, complainant died prior to recoding of his evidence before the Court, though, in such circumstances, FIR could be brought on record through secondary evidence, yet it could not be termed as a corroboratory piece of evidence keeping in view the non-appearance of the complainant, who did not appear in the witness box and was not subjected to cross-examination---

[10/31/25, 5:40:03 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Delay of about 16 to 26 hours in conducting postmortem upon the dead body of the deceased---Inconsequential---Accused was charged for committing murder of brother of the complainant by firing and also causing firearm injuries to the complainant---Medical evidence in this. case comprised of Medical Officer, who medically examined injured of the case/ complainant and Medical Officer, who conducted postmortem examination over dead body of deceased of the case on 28.08.2019 at about 01:55 a.m.---Though Medical Officer mentioned time between injury and death as "6 to 8" hours and between death and postmortem as "16 to 26" hours yet it had been mentioned that cause of death was injuries to major pelvic organs, cavity & major blood vessels---When injuries had been caused to major blood vessels, then it resulted in death without loss of much time---On the one hand, time between injury and death mentioned as "6 to 8" hours was not tallying with said state of affairs i.e. injuries to major blood vessels whereas on the other hand, time between death and postmortem examination mentioned as "16 to 26" hours was not supported by any valid reason hence said opinion was ipse dixit i.e. without any supporting material and thus could not be preferred over ocular account---In such peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, postmortem examination over dead body of deceased of the case could not be termed as unduly delayed---Even otherwise, in the case of firearm injuries, photographic view of the occurrence neither could be captured by the human eye nor could be expected from the witness because speed of bullet was more than speed of sound i.e. bullet hit first and its sound was heard subsequently by the witness, therefore, in the pandemonium situation at the time and place of occurrence, when bullets were being fired through firearm weapon at the deceased or injured/ victim, then any discrepancy regarding number and locale of injuries could not be emphasized in stricto-sensu---

[10/31/25, 5:40:04 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Eye-witnesses claimed that the occurrence took place exactly at the time when they had arrived at the place of occurrence---Said narrative of the witnesses that the accused kept waiting for the arrival of the witnesses at the place of occurrence and thereafter committed the same wasunnatural and could not be believed---Moreover, it opposed to human conduct that an assailant would keep waiting for the arrival of the witnesses prior to the commission of the offence---All the more illogical that being perceptive of the fact that by pending the matter the accused run the risk of the arrival of the witnesses and their deposing against the accused, even then the assailant kept waiting for their arrival---Such behavior, on the part of the accused, as deposed by the witnesses, ran counter to natural human conduct and behavior---Hence, being perceptive of that strain of human conduct, the Court was holding that the witnesses were not present at the time and place of occurrence and had not witnessed the occurrence---
2025 YLR 2270
[10/31/25, 5:40:05 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Non-availability of justification for the presence of witnesses at the time and place of occurrence-Chance witnesses---Scope---Accused were charged for committing murder of the son of complainant by firing and causing firearm injuries to his friend---In the present case, both the eye-witnesses were residents of a place situated at a distance of 15/16 kilometers from the place of occurrence---Said fact was admitted by eye-witness during his cross-examination---Moreover, both the eye-witnesses while appearing before the Trial Court had failed to give any plausible explanation for their presence at the spot, rather simply claimed to be in the company of deceased and uttered not a single word for their reason of being so---Presence of both the eye-witnesses at the spot, in the manner they claimed, made them chance witnesses and their deposition suspected evidence---Thus, the depositions of eye-witnesses were to be discarded from consideration---
2025 YLR 2242
[10/31/25, 5:40:05 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Unnatural conduct of eye-witnesses---Accused were charged for committing murder of the daughter of the complainant by pressing her throat---Record showed that the alleged eye-witnesses made no effort either to save the deceased or to apprehend the accused when they were three in number and could have easily restrained the accused---Claim of the witnesses that the accused, a woman, was not even armed with any weapon and still they did not make any effort either to apprehend the accused or save the deceased---Unnatural and unbelievable that the alleged eye-witnesses did not even move a limb to protect their near and dear one---No person having ordinary prudence would believe that such closely related witnesses would remain watching the proceedings as mere spectators for as long as the occurrence continued without doing anything to rescue the deceased or to apprehend the assailant---Such fact only proved that the deceased was at the mercy of the assailant and no one was there to save her---Such behaviour, on the part of the witnesses, ran counter to natural human conduct and behavior---

پشاور: CTD تھانے کے مال خانے میں دھماکہ  ایک اہلکار جاں بحق، دو زخمی

تاریخ: 2 نومبر 2025
مقام: CTD پولیس اسٹیشن، University Road، پشاور

خلاصہ:
آج 2 نومبر 2025 کو پشاور کے مرکزی علاقے University Road پر واقع Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) کے پولیس اسٹیشن کے مال خانے میں ذخیرہ شدہ پرانا بارودی مواد پھٹ گیا۔ پولیس کے ابتدائی بیانات کے مطابق یہ واقعہ دہشت گردی نہیں بلکہ ایک حادثاتی دھماکہ ہے۔ واقعے میں ایک پولیس اہلکار شہید اور دو دیگر افراد زخمی ہوئے ہیں۔ قیدیوں اور عملے کو فوری طور پر محفوظ مقام پر منتقل کر دیا گیا، جبکہ علاقے میں ایمرجنسی نافذ کر دی گئی اور امدادی ادارے موقع پر پہنچ گئے۔

تفصیلی رپورٹ:
آج صبح (2 نومبر 2025) پشاور کے CTD اسٹیشن کے مال خانے میں موجود پرانا بارودی مواد اچانک پھٹ گیا۔ دھماکے کی شدت کے باعث اسٹیشن کے بعض حصے اور قریبی گاڑیاں و شیشے متاثر ہوئے۔ فائر بریگیڈ اور ایمبولینس سروسز فوری طور پر موقع پر پہنچ گئیں اور زخمیوں کو قریبی ہسپتال منتقل کیا گیا۔ پولیس نے بتایاکہ ابتدائی معلومات کے مطابق واقعہ دہشت گردانہ حملہ نہیں بلکہ ذخیرہ شدہ ایمونیشن کے حادثاتی پھٹنے کا نتیجہ ہے۔

نقصان:

ایک پولیس اہلکار جاں بحق (پولیس نے تعزیتی بیانات جاری کیے)۔

دو افراد زخمی (زخمیوں کی حالت اور ناموں کی سرکاری تصدیق اس وقت منظر عام پر نہیں آئی)۔

یونیورسٹی روڈ پر ٹریفک معطل اور اطراف کے مکانات و دکانوں کے شیشے ٹوٹنے سمیت مادی نقصان رپورٹ ہوا۔


پولیس کا موقف:
مقامی پولیس اور CTD ذرائع نے واضح کیا ہے کہ ابتدائی تفتیش کے بنیاد پر یہ واقعہ دہشت گردی کا واقعہ نہیں سمجھا جا رہا، بلکہ سامانِ بارود کی ممکنہ خرابی یا غیر محفوظ ذخیرہ اندوزی کے باعث حادثہ رونما ہوا۔ پولیس عوام سے اپیل کر رہی ہے کہ وہ گھبراہٹ سے گریز کریں اور حکام کی ہدایات پر عمل کریں۔

پسِ منظر اور سوالات:
یہ واقعہ کئی اہم سوال اٹھاتا ہے: حساس اور خطرناک مواد کو اسٹیشنوں میں کس طرح محفوظ رکھا جاتا ہے؟ کیا میعاد ختم شدہ یا پرانا بارودی سامان باقاعدہ طور پر تلف کرنے کے انتظامات موجود تھے؟ یونیورسٹی روڈ جیسے مرکزی علاقے میں ایسے مال خانوں کی حفاظت اور ان کی جگہ کے حوالے سے سخت پروٹوکول کیوں نافذ نہیں کیے گئے؟ متعلقہ محکمے اور حکومت سے مطالبہ بنتا ہے کہ شفاف تحقیقات کرائی جائیں اور ذمہ داران کو فوری شناخت کیا جائے۔

احتیاطی ہدایات برائے عوام:

1. جائے وقوع کے قریب نہ جائیں اور فائر/ایمرجنسی گاڑیوں کو راستہ دیں۔


2. غیر مصدقہ خبریں اور افواہوں کو آگے نہ پھیلائیں — صرف مستند ذرائع کی معلومات پر بھروسہ کریں۔


3. اگر آپ کسی زخمی یا متاثرہ خاندان کے قریبی ہیں تو ہسپتالوں سے رجوع کریں اور امدادی اداروں سے رابطہ کریں۔


4. کسی بھی خطرناک شے کی اطلاع فوری طور پر 15 یا مقامی پولیس ہیلپ لائن پر دیں (سرکاری نمبر برائے تصدیق چیک کریں)۔
نتیجہ اور اپیل:
یہ افسوسناک واقعہ ہمیں بتاتا ہے کہ حساس مواد کی مناسب ذخیرہ اندوزی، باقاعدہ معائنہ اور حفاظتی پروٹوکول کتنے اہم ہیں۔ حکومت اور ادارہ بالا سے مطالبہ ہے کہ وہ فوری اور شفاف تفتیش کریں، ذمہ داری کا تعین کریں اور مستقبل میں ایسے حادثات سے بچاؤ کے ٹھوس اقدامات کریں۔ عوام سے گزارش ہے کہ وہ حکام کی ہدایات پر عمل کریں اور افواہوں سے پرہیز کریں۔

براہِ مہربانی: مضمون کو شئیر کرتے وقت یہ نوٹ شامل کریں — "معلومات مقامی ذرائع اور پولیس کے ابتدائی بیانات کی بنیاد پر دی گئی ہیں؛ مزید تفصیلات آنے پر اپ ڈیٹ شیئر کی جائیں گی"۔

[11/2/25, 6:07:45 PM] ‪+92 314 3179018‬: 💭 "ہر تین میں سے ایک پاکستانی ذہنی دباؤ کا شکار — کب کریں گے ہم سنجیدگی سے غور؟
پاکستان میں حالیہ رپورٹس کے مطابق، ہر تین میں سے ایک شخص کسی نہ کسی ذہنی بیماری یا دباؤ کا شکار ہے۔ نوجوان سب سے زیادہ متاثرہ طبقہ ہیں — کیونکہ اُن پر تعلیمی دباؤ، معاشی غیر یقینی صورتحال، مقابلے کا ماحول، اور سماجی دباؤ سب ایک ساتھ اثر انداز ہوتے ہیں۔

جب ذہنی دباؤ بڑھتا ہے تو صرف جذباتی نہیں بلکہ تحصیلی کارکردگی (academic performance) بھی متاثر ہوتی ہے۔ ریسرچ پر فوکس برقرار رکھنا، اسکالرشپ کے لیے محنت کرنا، یا اپنے پروجیکٹس مکمل کرنا — یہ سب اُس وقت مشکل ہو جاتا ہے جب ذہن مسلسل دباؤ میں رہے۔

💭 کیوں ضروری ہے کہ آپ ذہنی صحت پر توجہ دیں؟

ذہنی سکون آپ کی پیداواری صلاحیت (productivity) بڑھاتا ہے۔

امتحان یا ریسرچ ڈیڈلائن کے دوران فوکس برقرار رکھنے میں مدد دیتا ہے۔

بہتر ذہنی حالت سے آپ کی فیصلہ سازی (decision-making) بہتر ہوتی ہے۔

اسکالرشپ، انٹرویو یا پریزنٹیشن کے وقت اعتماد (confidence) میں اضافہ ہوتا ہے۔

🌸 کچھ آسان Self-Care Tips جو ہر اسکالر کو اپنانا چاہئیں:

📅 روزانہ کا معمول بنائیں: نیند، پڑھائی، اور آرام کے اوقات متعین کریں۔

☕ وقفہ لیں: 25–30 منٹ پڑھنے کے بعد 5–10 منٹ کا بریک لازمی لیں۔

🌳 قدرت سے جڑیں: واک کریں، کھلی فضا میں جائیں — قدرت دماغ کو ری سیٹ کرتی ہے۔

🤝 بات کریں: اگر ذہنی دباؤ محسوس ہو تو دوست، استاد یا فیملی سے بات کریں۔

🧘‍♂️ Mindfulness یا Meditation آزمائیں: روزانہ چند منٹ خاموش بیٹھ کر سانسوں پر فوکس کریں۔

📵 ڈیجیٹل بریک لیں: سوشل میڈیا سے کبھی کبھار وقفہ لینا بھی ذہنی سکون دیتا ہے۔

✍️ اپنے خیالات لکھیں: جرنل لکھنے سے ذہن کا بوجھ کم ہوتا ہے۔

💬 یاد رکھیں:

ذہنی صحت کمزوری نہیں، بلکہ ایک حقیقی مسئلہ ہے جسے سمجھنا اور حل کرنا ضروری ہے۔ کامیابی صرف ڈگری یا اسکالرشپ حاصل کرنے کا نام نہیں — بلکہ اپنے ذہن اور دل کو متوازن رکھنے کا بھی نام ہے۔

📢 آپ کی باری:
کمنٹس میں بتائیں — آپ ریسرچ یا پڑھائی کے دوران ذہنی دباؤ کو کیسے منیج کرتے ہیں؟
کیا یونیورسٹیوں میں طلبہ کے لیے ذہنی صحت کی سپورٹ ہونی چاہیے؟

Writ Petition-1938-23
RIZWAN ALI SAYAL VS FED.OF PAKSITAN ETC 

Whether the acquittal of accused from a criminal case, based on a compromise, can be considered an honorable acquittal?  

All acquittals including acquittal on compromise are honorable for the reason that the prosecution has not succeeded to prove their cases against the accused on the strength of evidence of unimpeachable character. There can be no acquittals, which may be said to be dishonorable and the law has not drawn any distinction between any types of acquittals. Moreover, once a person was acquitted by trial court, said person would stand shorn of stigma of any allegation and he would have to be deemed thereafter as innocent and having not committed any such crime. If acquittal of accused is not assailed before higher forum, such acquittal earned by accused from trial court, on whatsoever basis, would attain finality and pandora box of allegations could not be re-opened or used against him. In short, acquittal is an acquittal simpliciter and, must entail upon all consequences of pure acquittal. Additionally, order of acquittal of accused shall erase, efface, obliterate and wash away his alleged or already adjudged guilt in the matter apart from leading to setting aside of his sentence or punishment, if any.

 Every acquittal, whether on merits or on other grounds is honourable and should be accepted as such.

[11/3/25, 5:59:46 PM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: زخمی یا متاثرہ فریق کی اکیلی گواہی پر سزا کی بنیاد
(پاکستانی عدالتوں کے اہم نظائر کی روشنی میں)
تمہید

فوجداری قانون میں کسی جرم کے ثبوت کے لیے عام طور پر کئی گواہوں اور شواہد کی ضرورت ہوتی ہے۔ مگر بعض اوقات ایسا ہوتا ہے کہ وقوعہ کے وقت صرف متاثرہ یا زخمی شخص ہی موقع پر موجود ہوتا ہے۔ ایسے میں سوال یہ پیدا ہوتا ہے کہ کیا ایسی اکیلی گواہی پر کسی ملزم کو سزا دی جا سکتی ہے؟
پاکستان کی سپریم کورٹ اور ہائی کورٹس نے اپنے متعدد فیصلوں میں یہ اصول واضح کیا ہے کہ اگر گواہ سچا، پُراعتماد، اور بلا تضاد ہو تو صرف ایک گواہ کی گواہی پر بھی سزا دی جا سکتی ہے۔
قانونی اصول

قانونِ شہادت آرڈر 1984 (Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984) کے تحت عدالت کسی ایک گواہ کی گواہی پر فیصلہ دے سکتی ہے، بشرطیکہ وہ گواہی قابلِ اعتبار اور اعتماد کے قابل ہو۔
سپریم کورٹ آف پاکستان نے قرار دیا ہے کہ:

> “قانون میں گواہوں کی تعداد نہیں بلکہ ان کی شہادت کا معیار فیصلہ کن حیثیت رکھتا ہے۔”
پاکستانی عدالتوں کے اہم نظائر

1️⃣ Niaz-ud-Din v. The State (2011 SCMR 725)

سپریم کورٹ آف پاکستان نے اس فیصلے میں کہا کہ اگر کسی گواہ کی گواہی عدالت کو اعتماد انگیز لگے تو اکیلی گواہی پر بھی سزا دی جا سکتی ہے۔
عدالت نے کہا:

> “It is not the number of witnesses but the quality of evidence that matters.”
(یعنی گواہوں کی تعداد نہیں بلکہ گواہی کا معیار اہم ہے۔)
2️⃣ Criminal Appeal No. 251 of 2020 (Supreme Court of Pakistan)

یہ مقدمہ جنسی زیادتی (rape) سے متعلق تھا۔ عدالت نے کہا:

> “جنسی زیادتی کے مقدمات میں متاثرہ خاتون کی گواہی اگر اعتماد انگیز ہو تو اس پر براہِ راست ثبوت کی ضرورت نہیں۔”
مزید کہا گیا کہ:
“A rape victim stands on a higher pedestal than an injured witness.”
(یعنی متاثرہ خاتون کی گواہی زخمی گواہ سے بھی زیادہ اہمیت رکھتی ہے، کیونکہ وہ جسمانی اور نفسیاتی دونوں طرح کے صدمے سے گزرتی ہے۔)
3️⃣ 2025 CCJ 6 (Supreme Court Law Review)

اس فیصلے میں عدالت نے کہا:

> “محض زخمی ہونا گواہ کو سچا ثابت نہیں کرتا۔ اگر اس کے بیان میں تضاد، تاخیر یا غیر مطابقت ہو تو اس پر بلا تقویت اعتماد کرنا خطرناک ہے۔”
یعنی عدالت نے یہ واضح کیا کہ زخمی ہونا صداقت کی ضمانت نہیں، بلکہ بیان کی مطابقت اور دیگر شواہد کا جائزہ ضروری ہے۔
4️⃣ PLD 2015 SC 77 (Supreme Court of Pakistan)

اس فیصلے میں عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ:

> “اگر ایک گواہ سچا، غیر متزلزل اور اعتماد انگیز ہو تو عدالت اس کی گواہی پر بھروسہ کر سکتی ہے۔ مگر اگر معمولی شک بھی پیدا ہو جائے تو ملزم کو شک کا فائدہ دینا ضروری ہے۔”
5️⃣ Cr. A. No. 62-P of 2003 (Federal Shariat Court)

فیڈرل شریعت کورٹ نے قرار دیا کہ زخمی ہونا خود گواہ کے بیان کی صداقت کی ضمانت نہیں۔

> “Injuries on a witness are not a stamp of truth unless the statement itself inspires confidence.”
(یعنی اگر بیان میں تضاد یا شک پایا جائے تو محض زخمی ہونا اسے قابلِ یقین نہیں بناتا۔)
6️⃣ 2025 SCLR 6 (Supreme Court of Pakistan)

عدالتِ عظمیٰ نے کہا:

> “زخمی گواہ کی موجودگی وقوعہ کی تصدیق ضرور کرتی ہے، مگر اگر اس کی گواہی میڈیکل شواہد سے مطابقت نہ رکھے تو سزا دینا غیر محفوظ ہوگا۔”
یعنی عدالت گواہی اور طبی شہادت (medical evidence) کے باہمی تعلق کو بھی دیکھتی ہے۔

عدالتی معیار اور احتیاطی اصول

پاکستانی عدالتیں اکیلی گواہی پر فیصلہ دینے سے پہلے درج ذیل امور کا جائزہ لیتی ہیں:

1. بیان میں یکسانیت:
کیا گواہ نے ہر مرحلے پر ایک ہی مؤقف اختیار کیا؟


2. تضاد یا بہتری (Improvement):
کیا گواہ نے بعد میں بیان میں نئی باتیں شامل کیں؟


3. میڈیکل و سائنسی شہادت:
کیا میڈیکل رپورٹ یا دیگر شواہد گواہی کی تائید کرتے ہیں؟


4. شناخت و حالات:
کیا گواہ نے ملزم کو درست طور پر پہچانا؟


5. تاخیر یا بدنیتی:
کیا بیان میں غیر ضروری تاخیر یا بدنیتی کے آثار ہیں؟



اگر گواہی ان تمام معیارات پر پوری اترے تو پاکستان کی عدالتیں ایسی اکیلی گواہی پر سزا سنانے کا اختیار رکھتی ہیں۔
نتیجہ

سپریم کورٹ آف پاکستان، ہائی کورٹس، اور فیڈرل شریعت کورٹ کے متفقہ اصول کے مطابق:

> “اگر زخمی یا متاثرہ گواہ کی گواہی اعتماد انگیز، غیر متضاد اور حالات کے مطابق ہو تو صرف ایک گواہ کی شہادت پر بھی ملزم کو سزا دی جا سکتی ہے۔”



البتہ اگر گواہی میں معمولی سا بھی شک پیدا ہو جائے تو Benefit of Doubt لازمی طور پر ملزم کو دیا جاتا ہے۔

It seems you’re asking for the syllabus of PP (Public Policy) and CJ (Constitutional Jurisprudence or Criminal Justice?)  could you please confirm what “CJ” stands for in your context? Different programs use the same abbreviation for different subjects.

Once you confirm that, I can either:

Share or summarize the latest syllabus for both subjects, or

Help you find an official copy (e.g., from your university’s website or HEC Pakistan course outlines).


Please tell me:

1. Which program are you enrolled in (e.g., BS Political Science, CSS preparation, LLB, etc.)?
2. Which university or board?

[11/6/25, 10:52:23 PM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: ⚖️ قانونی نوٹ (Legal Note)
مقدمہ:

عنوان: مدعا علیہ کی طرف سے Counterclaim برائے واپسی زیورات و رقم
موضوع: کیا خاندان (Family) زیورات یا رقم کی واپسی کی اجازت یا منظوری دے سکتا ہے؟
دائرہ اختیار: فیملی کورٹ / سول کورٹ
1️⃣ تمہید:

مدعا علیہ نے اپنے تحریری جواب میں بطور Counterclaim یہ دعویٰ کیا ہے کہ مدعیہ نے بعض زیورات اور رقم اپنے پاس رکھی ہے،
لہٰذا ان کی واپسی (Recovery) کا حکم دیا جائے۔
اس ضمن میں یہ اعتراض پیدا ہوتا ہے کہ آیا خاندان یا اہلِ خانہ بذاتِ خود اس واپسی کی اجازت یا منظوری دے سکتے ہیں یا نہیں؟
2️⃣ قانونی اصول:

قانونِ دیوانی کارروائی (Code of Civil Procedure, 1908) کے Order VIII Rule 6A کے تحت
مدعا علیہ کو یہ حق حاصل ہے کہ وہ مدعی کے خلاف Counterclaim داخل کرے،
تاہم اس Counterclaim کی منظوری صرف عدالت دے سکتی ہے،
نہ کہ خاندان یا نجی سطح پر کوئی رشتہ دار۔

خاندان محض رضاکارانہ طور پر کوئی چیز واپس کر سکتا ہے،
لیکن اسے قانونی طور پر "Recovery Grant" نہیں کہا جا سکتا۔
3️⃣ عدالتی نظائر (Case Laws)

🏛️ (1) Pratibha Rani v. Suraj Kumar & Anr., (1985) 2 SCC 370

فیصلہ:
عورت کا Stridhan اس کی ذاتی ملکیت ہے، اور اگر شوہر یا اس کے اہلِ خانہ اسے واپس نہیں کرتے تو یہ غبن (Criminal Breach of Trust) شمار ہوگا۔

حوالہ:

> "شوہر یا اس کے گھر والے عورت کے زیورات یا Stridhan پر کوئی حق نہیں رکھتے،
اور ان کی واپسی صرف عدالت کے حکم سے ممکن ہے۔"
🏛️ (2) Krishna Bhattacharjee v. Sarathi Choudhury, (2016) 2 SCC 705

فیصلہ:
عورت علیحدگی کے باوجود اپنے Stridhan کی مالکہ رہتی ہے،
اور اس کی واپسی کے لیے عدالت میں درخواست دی جا سکتی ہے۔

حوالہ:

> "خاندانی ثالثی یا باہمی رضامندی قانونی Recovery نہیں سمجھی جاتی؛
قانونی حکم صرف عدالت جاری کر سکتی ہے۔"

🏛️ (3) K. Srinivas Rao v. D.A. Deepa, (2013) 5 SCC 226

فیصلہ:
خاندانی تنازعات میں مالی یا زرّی اشیاء (ornaments, cash) کی ملکیت اور واپسی کا فیصلہ
عدالت کے دائرہ اختیار میں آتا ہے، خاندان اس کا مجاز نہیں۔

حوالہ:

> "فیملی ثالث یا بزرگ فیصلہ تجویز کر سکتے ہیں مگر Recovery کا حکم عدالت ہی دے سکتی ہے۔"
🏛️ (4) Smt. Neelam v. Sanjay Kumar, 2018 (3) RCR (Civil) 856 (P&H High Court)

فیصلہ:
اگر مدعا علیہ زیورات یا رقم کی ملکیت ثابت نہیں کرتا تو Counterclaim قابلِ قبول نہیں ہوگا۔

حوالہ:

> "Counterclaim میں کامیابی کے لیے مدعا علیہ کو ملکیت اور ناجائز قبضہ دونوں ثابت کرنے ہوں گے۔". 4️⃣ تجزیہ:

مندرجہ بالا نظائر سے واضح ہے کہ:

1. خاندان یا اہلِ خانہ Recovery کا قانونی اختیار نہیں رکھتے۔


2. Counterclaim کے تحت واپسی کا فیصلہ صرف عدالت کر سکتی ہے۔
3. مدعا علیہ پر ثبوت کی ذمہ داری ہے کہ زیورات یا رقم اس کی ملکیت ہیں اور مدعیہ کے قبضے میں ہیں۔
5️⃣ نتیجہ (Conclusion):

> لہٰذا، ان تمام عدالتی فیصلوں کی روشنی میں یہ ثابت ہوتا ہے کہ
خاندان بذاتِ خود زیورات یا رقم کی واپسی کی اجازت یا منظوری نہیں دے سکتا۔
صرف عدالتِ عالیہ یا فیملی کورٹ شواہد کی بنیاد پر فیصلہ کر سکتی ہے کہ Recovery کا حکم دیا جائے یا نہیں۔
6️⃣ دعا (Prayer):
1. مدعا علیہ کا Counterclaim برائے واپسی زیورات و رقم،
چونکہ کسی قانونی ثبوت سے ثابت نہیں کیا گیا، اس لیے مسترد کیا جائے۔
2. عدالت مناسب سمجھے تو مدعیہ کے حق میں فیصلہ صادر کرے۔

In the case of firearm injuries, photographic view of the occurrence neither can be captured by the human eye nor can be expected from the witness because speed of bullet is more than speed of sound i.e. bullet hits first (naeem)and its sound is heard subsequently by the witness, therefore, in the pandemonium situation at the time and place of occurrence, when bullets are being fired through firearm weapon at the deceased or injured/ victim, then any discrepancy regarding number and locale of injuries cannot be emphasized in stricto-sensu.

Power of attorney.
Authority of counsel to get a decree of compromise on the basis of his statement.

Power of attorney must be construed strictly as giving only such authority as is conferred expressly or by necessary implication and it cannot empower beyond what it really conveys and its contents must be taken into consideration as a whole. Power of attorney only gives that power which is specifically mentioned therein.  
The power of attorney (Vakalatnama) does not confer impliedly the power of compromise on the counsel or to make any statement to withdraw the suit or to get decree the suit, until and unless such powers have been specifically given to the attorney.

There is hardly any doubt that if the power to do an act has not been specifically given to an attorney, such an act, whether compromise or otherwise, is of no legal consequence at the option of the concerned party.

Section 6 of the "Ordinance, 1961" places a restriction on the second marriage of husband unless he obtains prior permission in writing of the Arbitration Council. Sub-section 5 of section 6 of the "Ordinance, 1961" provides consequences of contracting second marriage by a man without permission of Arbitration Council, one of which is that he has to face prosecution in complaint and if it is proved that he contracted second marriage without permission of the Arbitration Council, he shall be liable to be convicted and punishable with the simple imprisonment which may extend to one year and with fine of five hundred thousand rupees. The petitioner being wife of "respondent" lodged a complaint under section 6 of the "Ordinance, 1961" before the Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), Tehsil Sarai Alambir, District Gujrat through her special attorney Naveed Hanif s/o Muhammad Hanif, which was dismissed being not proceedable through attorney. "Ordinance, 1961" does not prescribe any procedure for the trial of the complaint, however, the Rules under the "Ordinance, 1961" (hereinafter referred to as "Rules, 1961") framed under section 11 pave way for the trial of offences under the "Ordinance, 1961". Needless to mention here that Rule 21 of the "Rules, 1961" ordains that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence under the Ordinance or these rules save on a complaint in writing by the Union Council, stating the fact constituting the offence.

There is no denial of facts that disputed cheque No.641730 was issued on 12.07.2006, suit was instituted on 21.10.2009 on the basis of cheque amount and the respondent/plaintiff admittedly received an amount of Rs.100,000/- from the appellant/defendant in the year 2008 before filing suit. While appearing as PW-1, respondent/plaintiff conceded about the part-payment in cross-examination but by concealing this fact intentionally, failed to plead this fact in his plaint and simply filed a suit for recovery of cheque amount. Now the question which comes up for consideration is as to what the expression “sum of amount undertaken or ordered to be paid to payee” means in a case where the admitted liability of the drawer of the cheque gets reduced, on account of part-payment made by him, after issuing the cheque. No doubt, the expression “sum of amount undertaken or ordered to be paid to payee” would mean the amount of the cheque alone in case the amount payable by the drawer but, can it be said the expression “sum of amount undertaken or ordered to be paid to payee” would always mean the amount of the cheque, even if the actual liability of the drawer of the cheque has got reduced on account of some payment(s) made by him towards discharge of the debt or liability in consideration of which cheque in question was issued. If it is held that the expression “sum of amount undertaken or ordered to be paid to payee” would necessarily mean the amount of cheque in every case, the drawer of the cheque would be required to make arrangement for more than the cheque amount payable by him to the payee of the cheque in case of part-payment by the drawer of cheque to the payee. Obviously this could not have been the intention of the legislature to make a person liable to pay more amount than amount payable through cheque. If the drawer of the cheque is made to pay more than the amount actually payable by him, the inevitable result would be that he will have to chase the payee of the cheque to recover the excess amount paid by him. Therefore, it is difficult to take the view that even if the admitted liability of the drawer of the cheque has got reduced, on account of certain payment(s) made after issuance of cheque, the payee would be entitled to present the cheque for the whole of the amount to the banker for encashment or in such a case, if cheque is dishonoured for want of funds, a cause of action compulsorily will arise to file a suit for recovery of cheque amount under order XXXVII CPC. I am also conscious/aware of the situation where with a view to circumvent and get out of summary procedure under Order XXXVII CPC, the drawer of a cheque can make part-payment of the amount of the cheque but this can easily be avoided by payee of the cheque, either by taking new cheque of the reduced amount from the drawer or by making an endorsement through a note on the cheque by the drawer acknowledging the part-payment and then presenting the cheque for encashment of only the balance amount due and payable to him. In fact, Section 56 of Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 specifically provides for an endorsement on a Negotiable Instrument with regard to part-payment and the instrument can thereafter be negotiated for the balance amount. If the drawer and payee of cheque adopt the procedure given in section 56 of Negotiable Instrument Act, then  it would be open to the payee of the cheque to present the cheque for payment of only that much endorsed balance amount which is due to him. After the receipt of admitted partpayment from the amount of cheque before filing the suit, the payee can neither present the cheque for encashment without adopting procedure under Section 56 of Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 nor can file suit for recovery of cheque amount while invoking special jurisdiction under Order XXXVII CPC in new circumstances/ situation which is a subsequent agreement rather will file a suit for recovery of balance amount of cheque before an ordinary civil court of plenary jurisdiction. Generally, there is no cavil to the proposition that Order XXXVII CPC does not restrict  person(s) /plaintiff(s) from filing an ordinary suit for recovery of cheque amount before an ordinary civil court of plenary jurisdiction rather provides discretion to either institute a suit by invoking special jurisdiction under Order XXXVII CPC or to file the same under ordinary procedure before ordinary civil court of plenary jurisdiction and there exists no legal compulsion to restrict the choice of person(s)/plaintiff(s). 

In view of the foregoing discussion, I am of the affirmed view that the learned trial court erred in law in decreeing the suit vide impugned judgment dated 30.10.2014, hence, the same is hereby set-aside by allowing this regular first appeal on the question of jurisdiction with the direction to learned Additional District Judge to return the plaint under Order VII Rule 10, CPC to the respondent/plaintiff for filing the same before an ordinary civil court of plenary jurisdiction

مطلقہ بیٹی فیملی پنشن کی حقدار ہے
Family pension is a daughter’s right under the law. Tying it to marital status entrenches structural inequality and reflects patriarchal assumptions, not constitutional principles.

Under the Rules, whether the daughter is unmarried or divorced, she is entitled to the pension of the deceased civil servant in this case being the father’s family pension. However, the Circular gives a narrow interpretation of Rule 4.10(2)(B)(v)7 and (vi) as it restricts the grant of pension to surviving daughters of pensioners based on their marital status at the time of death of the pensioner. This is contrary to the right prescribed under the Act of 1973 and the Rules which imposes no such condition. In our opinion, the Circular adopts an overly rigid approach making a woman’s entitlement to family pension strictly contingent on whether her status as a widow or divorcee was established prior to or at the exact time of the pensioner’s death. 
Even a change in status occurring a single day after the death of the pensioner is treated as a complete bar to family pension. The Circular therefore does not clarify Rule 4.10(2) (A) or (B) but rather it imposes a condition of status at the time of death of the pensioner which is totally beyond the intent of the Act of 1973 and the Rules. 

  It is settled law that executive clarifications in the form of circulars and administrative directives cannot override, amend or curtail the scope of the statute itself or the rules framed thereunder.

Whether such a witness can be declared hostile, once his cross-examination has been conducted by the opposite party?. 

The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order is also silent on this score, however, as per practice, the stage to declare the witness hostile, is during his examination- in-chief where it can be alleged that the witness is deviating from his previous statement or is suppressing the truth or is otherwise un-cooperative. In this respect, the superior court has settled the issue that if a witness in examination-in-chief makes a statement adverse to the interest of the party calling him as witness, the court can exercise the discretion under Article 150 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, however, once the cross-examination is recorded, there is no concept of declaring a witness as hostile

[11/7/25, 2:49:37 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Evidentiary Value of Dying Declaration as enshrined in Article 46 QSO.
2025 SCMR 1876

Here it must be explained that a 'dying declaration' is the statement which is made by the victim of homicide offences as to the cause of their death. The rule relating to dying declaration and its admissibility is provided in Article 46 of the Qanun-e Shahadat Order, 1984, which explains that the statement of a dying person is relevant and admissible in evidence, however, for recording such declaration no particular mode has been provided. The principles laid down by this Court are that a dying declaration is a weaker type of evidence, which needs corroboration and that a conviction can be based on the basis of such a declaration when fully corroborated by the other reliable evidence. Thus, the facts and circumstances of each case, have to be kept in view and also the credibility, reliability and acceptability of such a declaration, by the Court.

It would thus be beneficial to delineate the jurisprudential framework governing the evidentiary value of a dying declaration, as enshrined under Article 46 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. While such a statement may constitute an exception to the general rule of direct evidence, thereby permitting its admissibility in a criminal trial even in the absence of cross-examination of the declarant, the superior courts have consistently maintained that a dying declaration is, at best, a weaker type of evidence which requires cautious appraisal and must ordinarily be corroborated by other reliable and confidence-inspiring material. A conviction cannot rest solely on a dying declaration if the same is shrouded in mystery or is fraught with infirmities. The credibility, voluntariness, and the mental fitness of the declarant, along with the absence of extraneous influence, are sine qua non for its evidentiary acceptance. It is further emphasized that a dying declaration must not only be truthful and free from external coercion but also supported by surrounding circumstances, including the medical evidence, which confirms the declarant's capacity to make such a statement.

If injury has been caused below knee, then applicability of Section 324 PPC requires further probe/inquiry within the purview of sub-section 2 of Section 497 Cr.P.C., however, if injury has been caused above knee on the (naeem)leg at thigh, then situation is otherwise because femoral artery, which is major blood vessel, is located in thigh starting from groin coming to the back of knee and it supplies oxygen-rich blood to the lower parts of the body. So, femoral artery if damaged can cause lower limb ischemia leading to amputation of limb, compartment syndrome as well as death (naeem)due to severe blood loss from a major artery in the leg, hence if firearm injury has been caused at thigh, then prima facie section 324 PPC is attracted.

[11/7/25, 2:49:39 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2025 SCMR 1955
The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offence under section 489-F of PPC. The said offence is, admittedly, of the category which falls within the non-prohibitory clause of section 497 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure, 1898 ('Cr.P.C.). This Court has consistently held that while considering the grant of bail, where offences fall within the non-prohibitory clause, the granting of bail has to be considered favourably as a rule, but may be declined in exceptional cases. The extra ordinary and exceptional cases, inter alia, includes likelihood of abscondence of the accused; apprehension of the accused tempering with the prosecution evidence; and the danger of the offence being repeated. It is further noted that the quantum of amount involved in a case registered under section 489-F cannot be treated as an exception to the general rule that in cases falling under the category of non-prohibitory clause, bail shall be considered favourably. The offence under section 489-F of PPC is not a provision which is intended by the legislature to be used for recovery of the alleged amount. The criminal proceedings are meant to determine the guilt and then to sentence an accused. The legislature has set out the framework for recovery of an alleged amount in case of a dishonoured cheque under Order XXXVII of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. The petitioner in this case is, therefore, entitled to be granted bail since the State counsel has not been able to persuade us that exceptional circumstances exist in order to justify denying to the petitioner the concession of post arrest bail. Moreover, whether or not the alleged offence is attracted in the facts and circumstances of this case also require further probe.

Under the law a transaction or an agreement executed under custody or detention could potentially be considered as having been made under coercion, duress or undue influence, if the free consent is not given or the expressed will was the outcome of such circumstances. 

A person in custody or detention may be particularly vulnerable to coercion or duress as his freedom or liability to resist is severely limited. A person under the custody of the law enforcement agencies having control over the situation if enters into an agreement against best interest has an option to avoid It hence can be challenged in the court as voidable. A legally binding contract requires several elements i.e. an offer, acceptance of that offer, consideration, the parties having legal capacity contract but not for an unlawful to purpose, surely with a free consent (meeting of the minds consent is precured by influence is or consensus ad idem). If the coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake, the consent is not free. An undue a demonstration of controlling the will of the party because of the prevailing situation of the other duress are main party. While coercion is an act of enforcing a will but the undue influence or the consequence of coercion. A contract procured under duress by one party over the other is void and any benefit received therefrom must be restored and the loss be made good to such party.

When an application under Section 12(2) of the CPC lies and when an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC lies, with illustrative instances to clarify their respective scopes.
.......................
Sub-section (2) of Section 12 CPC.
...........................

 The provision of Sub-section (2) of Section 12 CPC provides a remedy to challenge a judgment, decree, or order obtained by: 
i). fraud, 
ii). misrepresentation, or 
iii). want of jurisdiction.

 However, mere used of these terms is not sufficient, rather specific particulars must be provided as required by Rule 4 of Order VI, CPC5. It allows any person6 affected by such a decree or order to apply to the court that passed it, seeking to set it aside. This provision is not limited to parties to the suit but extends to any person aggrieved by the decree or order. It means an application under Section 12(2) CPC is maintainable when the decree or order was obtained by deliberate deception or suppression of material facts from the Court. However, the judgment supports a broader reading that includes fraud between the parties affecting the decree. For instance, if a plaintiff fabricates documents or misleads the court to secure a favorable judgment, the affected party can invoke Section 12(2) CPC;when the decree results from unintentional but material misstatement of facts by a party, leading the court to pass an erroneous order. For example, if a party misrepresents the ownership of property in a suit, the aggrieved party may apply under this section; and when the court lacked inherent jurisdiction to pass the decree or order. For instance, if a court passes a decree in a matter outside its territorial or pecuniary jurisdiction, an application under Section 12(2) can be filed. Additionally, a person not a party to the suit but affected by the decree e.g., a third party whose property is wrongly included in a decree, may apply under this section. The application must be filed in the same court that passed the decree or order. The applicant must prove fraud, misrepresentation, or lack of jurisdiction with cogent evidence. The scope of application under Section 12(2) CPC is broader than Order IX Rule 13, CPC, as it is not limited to ex-parte decrees and can be invoked by non-parties.

Rule 13 of Order IX, CPC.
........................

This provision of Rule 13 of Order IX, CPC provides a remedy to set aside an ex-parte decree passed against a defendant who was unable to appear when the suit was called for hearing. It applies only to defendants and is limited to ex-parte decrees. An application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC is maintainable when: the defendant(s) was not duly served with the summons, or the service was defective, preventing their appearance; the defendant(s) was prevented from appearing due to sufficient cause, such as illness, accident, or other unavoidable circumstances; the decree was passed exparte, i.e., in the absence of the defendant, without hearing their defense. The application must be filed by the defendant in the court that passed the ex-parte decree. The defendant must demonstrate that they were not served or had sufficient cause for non-appearance. The court may set aside the decree in terms (e.g., costs) and allow the defendant to contest the suit. Unlike Section 12(2) CPC, this provision-Order IX, Rule 13, CPC is limited to ex-parte decrees and does not cover fraud or jurisdiction issues unless they relate to service or non-appearance. Key Distinctions between the applications under section 12(2) and IX(13), CPC are that Section 12(2), CPC addresses fraud, misrepresentation or lack of jurisdiction and applies to any decree or order, while Order IX Rule 13, CPC is restricted to ex-parte decrees; Section 12(2), CPC can be invoked by any aggrieved person, including non-parties, while Order IX Rule 13, CPC is available only to defendants; Section 12(2) CPC focuses on substantive defects (fraud, misrepresentation, jurisdiction), while Order IX Rule 13 CPC addresses procedural issues (non-service, sufficient cause); Section 12(2) CPC seeks to set aside the decree or order entirely, while Order IX Rule 13 CPC seeks to restore the suit for hearing on merits.In light of the above, an application under Section 12(2) CPC lies when a decree or order is tainted by fraud, misrepresentation, or lack of jurisdiction, as seen in cases like fabrication of documents or jurisdictional overreach. Conversely, an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC lies when an ex-parte decree is passed due to non-service of summons or sufficient cause for the defendant’s non-appearance, such as illness or defective service. The court must assess the facts and evidence to determine the appropriate remedy under each provision.

 Ancillary Provisions for Section 12(2) CPC can be summarized as such that Section 47 CPC10 deals with questions arising between parties to a suit (or their representatives) regarding the execution, discharge, or satisfaction of a decree. Meaning thereby, if a decree is challenged under Section 12(2) CPC on the basis of fraud or lack of jurisdiction, issues related to its execution (e.g., whether the decree is enforceable) may be addressed under Section 47 CPC during execution proceedings. 
For instance, if a decree obtained by fraud is sought to be executed, the aggrieved party may raise objections under Section 47 CPC, alongside or instead of a separate application under Section 12(2) CPC, depending on the stage of proceedings; Section 151 CPC11empowers courts to pass orders necessary to meet the ends of justice or prevent abuse of the process of the court. It is notable fact that if an application under Section 12(2) CPC does not fully address procedural gaps (e.g. interim relief to stay execution of a fraudulent decree), the court may invoke its inherent powers under Section 151 CPC. For example, if a decree is challenged for fraud under Section 12(2) CPC, the Court may use Section 151 CPC to stay execution proceedings pending the adjudication of the application. 

Further, provisions under Order XXI (e.g. Rules 2612, 2913, 9014, 99–101) govern the execution of decrees. If a decree is challenged under Section 12(2) CPC for fraud or lack of jurisdiction, ancillary issues like staying execution (Order XXI Rule 26, CPC) or setting aside a sale in execution due to fraud (Order XXI Rule 90, CPC) may arise;if a property is sold in execution of a decree obtained by misrepresentation, the affected party may seek to set aside the sale under Order XXI Rule 90 CPC, in conjunction with an application under Section 12(2) CPC; Section 9 CPC establishes that civil courts have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature unless barred. When an application under Section 12(2) CPC is filed alleging want of jurisdiction, Section 9 CPC provides the foundational principle for determining whether the court had the authority to pass the decree. For instance, if a decree is challenged under Section 12(2) CPC for being passed by a court lacking territorial jurisdiction, Section 9 CPC guides the inquiry into the court’s competence. 

 However, ancillary Provisions for Order IX Rule 13 CPC can be summarized as such: Order V (Rules 1–30) CPC governs the issuance and service of summons. Since an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC often hinges on non-service or defective service of summons, Order V CPC provisions are critical to determining whether the service was proper. For example, if a defendant claims non-service under Order IX Rule 13, CPC because the summons were not served as per Order V Rule 15 CPC (service on an adult member of the family), the court will examine compliance with Order V, CPC; Order IX Rule 6 CPC outlines the procedure when the defendant does not appear, leading to an exparte decree. This provision sets the stage for an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC, as it defines the circumstances under which an ex-parte decree is passed; if a court proceeds ex-parte under Order IX Rule 6 CPC due to the defendant’s absence, the defendant may apply under Order IX Rule 13 CPC to set aside the decree, citing non-service or sufficient cause; if the suit is at the hearing stage and has not yet resulted in a decree, Order IX Rule 7 CPC allows the defendant to apply to set aside the ex-parte proceedings and join the hearing. This is a precursor to Order IX Rule 13 CPC, applicable when the case is still ongoing. For instance, if defendant(s) learns of the ex-parte proceedings before the decree is passed, he may apply under Order IX Rule 7 instead of waiting to file under Order IX Rule 13, CPC; Order IX Rule 14 CPC mandates that no ex-parte decree shall be set aside under Order IX Rule 13 CPC without giving notice to the opposite party (plaintiff). It ensures procedural fairness in applications under Order IX Rule 13, CPC. When a defendant files an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC, the court must issue notice to the plaintiff under Order IX Rule 14 CPC before deciding the application. In addition to the above, if an ex-parte decree is set aside under Order IX Rule 13 CPC, Section 144 CPC allows the court to order restitution to restore the parties to their original position (e.g. refund of money paid under the decree or restoration of property). 

Moreover, if a defendant’s property was sold in execution of an ex-parte decree that is later on set aside, Section 144 CPC may be invoked to restore the property to the defendant. Similar to its role in Section 12(2) CPC, Section 151 CPC can be used to address procedural gaps in Order IX Rule 13 CPC applications, such as granting interim relief to stay execution of an ex-parte decree pending the application’s adjudication. Furthermore, provisions like Order XXI Rule 26(stay of execution) and Rule 29 CPC (stay of suit when execution is pending), are ancillary to Order IX Rule 13 CPC, as they allow the court to manage execution proceedings while the application to set aside the ex-parte decree is pending. If a defendant files an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC and the decree is being executed, they may seek a stay under Order XXI Rule 26, CPC.

The ancillary provisions ensure procedural fairness, provide mechanisms for execution or stay, and allow appeals or restitution, complementing the primary remedies under Section 12(2) and Order IX Rule 13, CPC. Provisions like Section 151 and Order XXI, CPC grant courts flexibility to address case-specific issues, ensuring justice is not defeated by procedural technicalities. Both Section 12(2) and Order IX Rule 13, CPC applications require compliance with procedural rules [e.g., notice under Order IX Rule 14 CPC or evidence of fraud under Section 12(2) CPC], and ancillary provisions like Order V or Section 47, CPC guide these requirements.

(1). Four-Staged Proportionality Framework.
------------------------

The principle of proportionality provides a structured framework for judicial review of administrative actions. Developed across various constitutional jurisdictions, it involves a four-step test: 
(i) the measure must pursue a legitimate aim; 
(ii) be suitable to achieve that aim; 
(iii) be necessary, in that no less restrictive alternative exists; and
(iv) strike a fair balance between the measure’s impact on individual rights and the public interest. 
Supreme Court has recently introduced and adopted this four-stage test to assess the legality and fairness of administrative and disciplinary decisions. Such framework ensures that any interference with rights is justified, necessary, and lawful.  

(2). Proportionality to be applied with discipline, care, and sensitivity to where fundamental rights and human dignity are at stake.
----------------------------
Proportionality promotes a stable and systematic method of constitutional adjudication. Courts employing this approach are expected to articulate clearly the reasoning behind their decisions at each stage of the analysis thereby enhancing transparency, accountability, and legitimacy in judicial reasoning. Proportionality must, therefore, be applied with discipline, care, and sensitivity to context, particularly where fundamental rights and human dignity are at stake.

Legally, Postmortem report is viewed as a documented expert opinion, therefore, its production in the evidence through primary evidence though is admissible yet contents of it cannot be read unless doctor appears as a witness to authenticate and verify that it was the report he had prepared. If doctor is not available then such report available in the Court record can be produced as secondary evidence through any person who had seen preparation of such document, knows handwriting or signature of the doctor on the report while showing a comparison with any proved document in the handwriting of such doctor, and this can also be done by production of another doctor or record keeper of the concerned hospital. This being so in the context of Article 78 of Qanun-a-Shahadat Order, 1984 which requires that execution of a document must be proved through the mode and manner as suggested in law.

Thus, despite proof of execution of a document by above means, truth of contents of document is to be proved. Neither the medicolegal or postmortem reports are the categories of documents as mentioned in Article 102 so as to dispense with a formal proof of its execution nor in this case it was claimed to have been admitted by the parties so as to rule out necessity of formal proof.

Article 102 so as to dispense with a formal proof of its execution nor in this case it was claimed to have been admitted by the parties so as to rule out necessity of formal proof.

Thus, mere production of postmortem report is not sufficient to be read in the evidence as a support to the prosecution case.

Opinion of doctor could only be deposed by the said doctor as per Article 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 which says that oral evidence must, in all cases whatever be direct, that is to say, if it refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it must be the evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those grounds.

Corresponding to section 293 of Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in ours section 510 exists but with slight difference, which is not applicable for medical reports. Mode of recording evidence of a doctor is mentioned in Section 509 of Cr.P.C. This Section falls in Chapter XLI which contains heading as “Special Rules of Evidence”, of course an overriding effect on all other provisions, consists of four Sections 509, 510, 511 and 512 of Cr.P.C. which with some connotation to cut short the process provides an expeditious mode of recording of evidence as well as securing the evidence for trial.

According to Section 509 of Cr.P.C., deposition of a medical witness taken and attested by a Magistrate in the presence of accused or taken on Commission may be given in evidence in an inquiry, trial or other proceedings under this Code without calling the medical witness, however, Court does have a power to summon the medical witness as and when thinks fit. This section has like connotation as that of Section 164 of Cr.P.C., which also ensures securing of evidence of a witness but unfortunately Section 509 Cr.P.C., has lost sight of legal practitioners and by the learned Courts, therefore, on the eve of death of a medical witness or his migration to other country, medical evidence falls short of probative value which cannot be brought on record properly or if it is brought on record its probative value decreases due to non-availability of medical witness to depose about the nature, locale, size of injuries and other observation made at the time of examination and test/protocols performed to arrive at an opinion with respect to cause of death or other matters which are also relevant as per Article 65 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Thus, this Section is must to be adhered by all the concerned in future and Criminal Prosecution Service (CPS) should attend to the provision for securing statement of medical witness at the earliest opportunity while producing him before the concerned Magistrate so that on the eve of non-availability of doctor such statement could be used during the trial before the Court concerned. Necessity and utility of Section 509 Cr.P.C., has also been highlighted in Rule 6, Chapter-18, High Court Rules & Orders, Volume III.

Before producing secondary evidence of medical reports, it is essential to prove the non-availability of doctor.

Mere abscondence of accused is not a conclusive proof of the guilt of the accused. The value of abscondence depends upon the fact of each case and abscondence alone cannot take the place of guilt unless and until the case is otherwise proved on the basis of cogent and reliable evidence. The accused persons generally disappear due to fear of police or because of the feelings of the guilt, and in this case during cross examination accused/appellants put the apprehension of their fake police encounter because son of the deceased was a police man.

Witness mentioned in FIR but whose statement is not recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C.---Whether such witness could be examined under section 256-F or section 540, Cr.P.C. and his evidence relied upon---Held, that perusal of section 265-F, Cr.P.C. shows that nowhere in the said section it is mentioned that only those witnesses could be examined whose statements under section 161, Cr.P.C. have been recorded---Under section 265-F, Cr.P.C. the Trial Court is not bound to record the statements of only those witnesses who have been listed in the calendar of witnesses---Furthermore there is no bar that a witness, whose statement under section 161, Cr.P.C. had not been recorded at the time of investigation, cannot be allowed to be examined under section 540, Cr.P.C.---When a witness is examined in Court, whose statement has not been recorded at the time of investigation under section 161, Cr.P.C., the evidentiary value to be attached to the evidence of such witness has to be looked into and if it is found that prejudice has been caused to the accused then the evidence of such witness may or may not be acted upon. 

To arrive at a just conclusion, the courts can call any person likely to be acquainted with the facts of the case after ascertaining it from the Public Prosecutor or the complainant, subject to general provisions that summoning of any such witness does not cause delay or defeat the ends of justice. Section 265-F(2) of Cr.P.C empowers the Courts to summon a person, after having been ascertained from the Public Prosecutor or the complainant, who is likely to be acquainted with the facts of the case, to be able to give evidence for the prosecution. Section 265-F(7), Cr.P.C grants even to the accused a right to apply for summoning any witness and production of documents. The very purpose of section 265-F, Cr.P.C is to ensure the concept of a fair trial and to achieve this purpose equal opportunity has been given to both the accused and the prosecution for summoning the evidence. It is nowhere mentioned in this section that only those witnesses could be examined whose statements under section 161, Cr.P.C. have been recorded. Under this provision of law i.e. section 265-F, Cr.P.C the Trial Court is not bound to record the statements of only those witnesses who have been listed in the calendar of witnesses. On the other hand, section 540, Cr.P.C. empowers the Trial Court to summon a material witness even if his name did not appear in the column of witnesses, provided his evidence is deemed essential for the just and proper decision of the case. Section 540 is divisible in two parts. In the first part, discretion is given to the Court and enables it at any stage of an inquiry, trial or other proceedings under the Code, (a) to summon anyone as a witness, or (b) to examine any person present in the Court, or (c) to recall and re-examine any person whose evidence had already been recorded.

On the other hand, the second part appears to be mandatory and requires the Court to take any of the steps mentioned above if the new evidence appears to be essential to the just decision of the case. The object of the provision, as a whole, is to do justice not only from the point of view of the accused and the prosecution but also justice from the point of view of the society. The Court examines evidence under this section neither to help the prosecution nor to help the accused. It is done neither to fill up any gaps in the prosecution evidence nor to give it any unfair advantage against the accused. Fundamental thing to be seen is whether the Court considers this evidence necessary in the facts and circumstances of the particular case before it. If this results in only "filling of lacuna" that is purely a subsidiary factor and cannot be taken into consideration. There is no bar that a witness, whose statement under section 161, Cr.P.C. had not been recorded at the time of investigation, cannot be allowed to be examined under section 540, Cr.P.C. When a witness is examined in Court, whose statement has not been recorded at the time of investigation under section 161, Cr.P.C., the evidentiary value to be attached to the evidence of such witness has to be looked into and if it is found that prejudice has been caused to the accused then the evidence of such witness may or may not be acted upon.

Article 141 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, Order 1984 is with reference to ‘Questions lawful in Cross-Examination’. 
 Plain reading of the provision makes it clear that the object of cross-examination is to check the credibility of a witness. The purpose of this exercise is to get something, no matter how small to help ones’ own case. Therefore, to separate the truth from falsehood, always remain an objective while cross-examining a witness. However the modes to shatter the credibility of a witness depend on facts of each case. The word ‘Credibility’ has been defined as ‘the quality of being trusted and believed in’. An adverse party by availing the right of cross-examination in fact convinces a Court that the witness in dock is not to be trusted and believed.

Identification parade, that is also called ‘Police Lineup’ (in American English) and ‘Identity Parade’ (in British English) means that a line of people who stand next to each other while someone tries to identify one of them as the person who has committed the crime. It is a relevant fact under Article 22 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat, Order 1984. It is not a requirement of law but only one of the methods to test the veracity of the evidence of an eye-witness who had an occasion to see the accused and claims to identify him. The evidence offered through identification proceedings is not a substantive piece of evidence but is only corroborative of the evidence given by the witnesses at the trial.It has no independent value of its own and cannot as a rule, form a sufficient basis for conviction though the same may add some weight to the other evidence available on record.
It is also not a rule of law but a rule of prudence. Identification parade is governed by Volume III, Chapter 11-G, Part-C of the Rules and Orders of the Lahore High Court, Lahore and Paragraph No. 26.32, Chapter XXVI of the Police Rules, 1934 and various instructions issued by the Government.The important features for a valid identification parade are as under:
i.        The proceedings shall be conducted under the supervision of a Magistrate.
ii.       Proceedings shall be held inside the jail.
iii.      Identification shall be carried as soon as possible after the arrest of suspect.
iv.      Once the arrangements for proceedings have been undertaken, the Officer investigating the case and any Police Officer assisting him in that investigation should have no access whatever either to the suspect or to the witnesses.
v.       List of all persons included in identification should be prepared, which should contain their names, parentage, address and occupation.
vi.      The suspects shall be placed among other persons similarly dressed up, of the same religion and of same social status.
vii.     There shall be proportion of 8 or 9 such person to one suspect.
viii.    The identifying witnesses shall be kept separate from each other and at such a distance from the place of identification as shall render it impossible for them to see the suspects or any of the persons concerned in the proceedings, until they are called upon to make identification.
ix.      Each witness shall be brought up separately to attempt his identification. Care shall be taken that the remaining witnesses are still kept out of sight and hearing and that no opportunity is permitted for communication to pass between witnesses who have been called up and those who have not.

Mr. Mehram Ali Bali, Advocate for Appellant.

Mr. Haroon Rasheed, Deputy Prosecutor General for State (on Court’s call).

Date of hearing: 6.11.2024.

Order

Through this appeal, Muhammad Hussain (petitioner) has impugned the vires of orders dated 09.10.2024 as well as 14.10.2024 passed by trial Court.

2.       Brief however necessary facts for disposal of this appeal are that Muhammad Hussain (present appellant) is facing trial as accused in the case arising out of F.I.R. No. 386/2023 dated 24.02.2023 registered under Section 9(1)3(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 at Police Station Millat Town, Faisalabad before learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faisalabad/trial Court; appellant did not appear before the trial Court on 09.10.2024, he was declared as proclaimed offender, his surety bond was forfeited and Station House Officer was directed to enter name of the accused in the register of proclaimed offenders; relevant portion of said order is hereby reproduced:

          “Accused has absented himself from the Court deliberately. It is pertinent to mention here that it is well in knowledge of the accused that his case is pending adjudication in the Court and despite having knowledge he has not appeared in Court which shows his irrelevant conduct towards Court proceedings. Nor he himself nor on behalf of the accused has brought in knowledge to the Court regarding reasons of his absence. His conduct does not entitle any leniency. It is primary duty of the accused to appear before the Court on each and every date. Therefore, reliance is place on PLD 1978 S.C, today I dispense proclamation under Section 87, Cr.P.C. (naeem)and declare him as proclaimed offender. His surety bound is forfeited and separate proceedings are prepared under Section 514, Cr.P.C. against surety. S.H.O concerned is directed to enter the name of accused in the register of proclamation offender.

Thereafter present appellant filed application for recalling of said order dated 09.10.2024 and marking his attendance before trial Court (copy of said application is available at pages No. 20-21 of instant appeal) which was dismissed vide order dated 14.10.2024 passed by trial Court (copy of said order is available at page No. 23 of this appeal) and relevant portion of the same is hereby reproduced:

“Perusal of record reveals that accused was facing trial before this Court in case F.I.R No. 386 dated 24.02.2023 under Section 9(i)3C CNSA 1997 registered at Police Station Millat Town, Faisalabad, who absented himself from the Court resulting into carrying out the proceedings under Section 87, Cr.P.C. against him and he was declared proclaimed offender on 09.10.2024. Legality and propriety of such an order can be looked into by Hon’ble High Court being revisable under Section 435 and 439, Cr.P.C. In view of above, application stands dismissed.”

3.       Learned counsel for the appellant and learned Deputy Prosecutor General (on Court’s call) submit in unison that impugned order dated 14.10.2024 is not in accordance with law and it would be appropriate to set-aside the same and refer matter back to the trial Court for re-deciding said application through fresh order.

4.       After hearing learned counsel for the appellant, learned Deputy Prosecutor General and going through the available record appended with this appeal it(naeem) has been noticed that vide order dated 09.10.2024 (mentioned above), appellant has been declared proclaimed offender and his surety bond has been forfeited. It is trite law that basic and prime purpose of issuance of process through notice, summons, bailable warrants, non-bailable warrants as well as proclamation is to bring the accused in the Court for facing the proceedings of the case in accordance with law. When application for re-calling of order dated 09.10.2024 was filed on behalf of appellant and if he (appellant) himself appeared/surrendered before the Court then it was appropriate for the Court either to take him into custody as his surety bond was already forfeited vide order dated 09.10.2024 or to recall aforementioned order dated 09.10.2024 if reasons were cogent, relevant and plausible for recalling the same and undoubtedly order dated 09.10.2024 is not the judgment rather an interim order; furthermore, (naeem)it is also relevant to mention here that even warrant issued by the Court can be cancelled by the Court which issued it and Section 75, Cr.P.C. is hereby reproduced for ready reference in this regard:

“75.  Form of warrant of arrest. (1) Every warrant of arrest issued by a Court under this Code shall be in writing, signed by the presiding officer, or in the case of a Bench of Magistrates, by any member of such Bench; and shall bear the seal of the Court.

(2)      Continuance of warrant of arrest. Every such warrant shall remain in force until it is cancelled by the Court which issued it, or until it is executed.”

It goes without saying that application for recalling of order qua issuance of “warrant of arrest” or “proclamation” of accused is neither entertainable/maintainable nor proceedable without surrender of the accused in the Court. Therefore, with the concurrence of learned counsel for the appellant, learned Deputy Prosecutor General and for the safe administration of justice, afore-mentioned order dated 14.10.2024 passed by trial Court is hereby set-aside, matter is remanded to the trial Court where aforementioned application filed by the appellant for re-calling of order dated 09.10.2024 will be deemed as pending and if appellant will surrender before trial Court on 11.11.2024 then said application would be decided through fresh order after hearing all concerned and strictly in accordance with law. However, if appellant will not surrender before trial Court on 11.11.2024 then his application (mentioned above) would be not proceedable (as discussed above) and law will take its own course in

furtherance of order dated 09.10.2024 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faisalabad/trial Court. With this observation, this appeal stands disposed of.

السلام علیکم ورحمۃ اللہ وبرکاتہ!

کچھ سوال کرتے ہیں
 کہ آپ یہ سب کیوں کر رہے ہیں؟
کچھ کہتے ہیں
 کہ “اس میں آپ کا کیا فائدہ ہے؟”
لیکن ہم کہتے ہیں .
 ہم یہ سب صرف اللہ کی رضا کے لیے کر رہے ہیں۔

ہم جانتے ہیں،
کل ہمیں قبر میں جانا ہے،
اور قیامت کے دن ہمیں اللہ کی عدالت میں پیش ہونا ہے۔
وہاں کوئی دنیاوی کرسی، شہرت، 
یا سوشل میڈیا کی لائکس کام نہیں آئیں گی۔
بس ہمارے اعمال ہوں گے . اور ہمارے سامنے ہمارے پیارے نبی ﷺ ہوں گے۔

کاش اُس دن ہم حضور پاک ﷺ کے سامنے سر اُٹھا کر کہہ سکیں:
“یا رسول اللہ ﷺ! ہم نے آپ کی اُمت کے بے سہارا قیدیوں کے لیے آواز اٹھائی،
ہم نے مظلوم کے ہاتھ تھامے،
ہم نے جرم سے نفرت کی، مگر مجرم کو سنبھالا،
ہم نے انسانیت کی خدمت کی 
 صرف اللہ کی رضا کے لیے!”

اللہ سے ملاقات صرف عبادتوں سے نہیں،
 بلکہ خدمتِ خلق سے بھی ہوتی ہے۔
ایک پرندے کو پنجے سے آزاد کرنا ثواب کا کام ہے،
تو سوچئے!
 ایک بے گناہ انسان کو قید سے آزاد کرانا کتنا عظیم عمل ہوگا۔

چیرمین ارباب سلطان حسین نے عہد کیا ہے 
کہ وہ ان بے سہارا قیدیوں کی مدد کریں گے .
فی سبیل اللہ،
 بغیر کسی دنیاوی غرض یا نام کے۔

ہمیں ایسے وکیل حضرات کی ضرورت ہے جو:

اللہ کی رضا کے لیے جرات کے ساتھ ہمارے ساتھ کھڑے ہوں

مذہب، فرقے، 
یا رنگ و نسل سے بالاتر ہو کر صرف انسانیت کی خدمت کریں

شیعہ ہو، سنی ہو، 
عیسائی ہو یا کسی بھی مذہب سے . 
مقصد صرف انسانیت ہو


پشاور سے لے کر کراچی تک، تمام صاحبِ علم و جرات وکیل حضرات سے گزارش ہے:
آئیے! اس مشن کا حصہ بنیں۔
بے سہارا قیدیوں کے لیے رحمت بنیں،
ان کی زندگی میں اُمید کا چراغ جلائیں،
اور اللہ کے حضور اپنا سر فخر سے بلند کریں۔

ہمیں دنیا نہیں چاہیے،
 ہمیں صرف اللہ کی رضا چاہیے۔
مرنے کا کوئی وقت نہیں  بس یہی وقت ہے
 کچھ کر گزرنے کا۔

رابطہ کریں:
چیرمین ارباب سلطان حسین
📞 0319-0999853

چھوٹے قدم، بڑے اجر۔
آئیے! 
انسانیت کے نام پر، ایمان کے جذبے سے، 
اللہ کی رضا کے لیے 
ایک زندگی بدل دیں۔

Mrs. Anjum Malik and others v. Mst. Neelofer Malik through LRs and others
[اسلام آباد ہائی کورٹ]

فاضل جج: جناب جسٹس انعام امین منہاس
موضوع: دائرۂ اختیار (Territorial Jurisdiction) — انتظامیہ (Administration) و تقسیمِ جائیداد (Partition Suit) — عدالتی ریکارڈ طلبی

---

📜 مقدمے کا خلاصہ

مدعیہ (Mst. Neelofer Malik) نے ایک دعویٰ برائے اعلانِ حق، مستقل حکمِ امتناعی، تقسیمِ جائیداد اور حسابات کی پیشی دائر کیا،
جس میں مرحوم کی متعدد جائیدادیں شامل تھیں جو مختلف علاقوں میں واقع تھیں۔

مدعا علیہان (Mrs. Anjum Malik وغیرہ) نے مؤقف اختیار کیا کہ:

مقدمہ دائرۂ اختیار سے باہر ہے؛

ٹرائل کورٹ کے پاس ان جائیدادوں کے حوالے سے فیصلہ دینے کا اختیار نہیں؛

اس لیے مدعیہ کی ریکارڈ منگوانے کی درخواست (Summoning Application) غیر مؤثر ہے۔

عدالتِ عالیہ (اسلام آباد ہائی کورٹ) نے ان اعتراضات کو زیرِ غور لیا۔

⚖️ متعلقہ دفعات (Section Definitions)

🔹 Civil Procedure Code, 1908

سیکشن 17 — دائرۂ اختیار (Jurisdiction in cases of immovable property situated within jurisdiction of different courts):

جب جائیدادیں مختلف اضلاع یا عدالتوں کے دائرہ اختیار میں ہوں تو مدعی کو اختیار ہے کہ وہ ان سب کے متعلق ایک ہی عدالت میں دعویٰ دائر کرے،
بشرطِ یہ کہ کسی ایک جائیداد کا حصہ اس عدالت کے دائرے میں ہو۔

📘 مطلب: اگر کسی ایک جائیداد کا مقام اس عدالت میں آتا ہے تو وہ عدالت تمام متعلقہ جائیدادوں پر سماعت کر سکتی ہے۔

---

سیکشن 21 — اعتراض بر دائرۂ اختیار (Objections to jurisdiction):

اگر کوئی فریق عدالت کے دائرہ اختیار پر اعتراض کرنا چاہتا ہے تو وہ اعتراض سب سے پہلے مرحلے پر اٹھانا ضروری ہے۔
اگر کوئی فریق مقدمے میں شامل ہو کر کارروائی میں حصہ لے لے اور بعد میں اعتراض کرے،
تو اسے دائرہ اختیار پر اعتراض کا حق نہیں رہتا۔

---

آرڈر XVI، رول 14 — گواہ یا ریکارڈ طلبی (Summoning witnesses or record):

عدالت کسی شخص یا ادارے کو طلب کر سکتی ہے جو مقدمے کے حقائق کے لیے ضروری ریکارڈ یا شہادت فراہم کر سکے۔
اگر کوئی فریق ضروری ثبوت لانے میں ناکام ہو تو عدالت خود بھی ریکارڈ طلب کر سکتی ہے۔

---

آرڈر II، رول 2 — دعویٰ کی تقسیم (Splitting of claims prohibited):

کسی فریق کو ایک ہی معاملے کے حوالے سے بار بار نیا مقدمہ دائر کرنے کی اجازت نہیں۔
یعنی اگر ایک ہی معاملے پر مقدمہ دائر ہو جائے،
تو بعد میں اسی معاملے پر نیا مقدمہ ناقابلِ سماعت ہوگا۔
📘 مگر یہ قاعدہ درخواست (Application) پر لاگو نہیں ہوتا بلکہ صرف دعویٰ (Suit) پر لاگو ہوتا ہے۔

---

🔹 Specific Relief Act, 1877

سیکشن 42 — دعویٰ برائے اعلانِ حق (Declaratory Relief):

اگر کوئی شخص اپنے قانونی حق سے متعلق غیر یقینی صورتحال میں ہو تو وہ عدالت سے اپنے حق کے تعین (Declaration) کی درخواست کر سکتا ہے۔

سیکشن 54 — مستقل حکمِ امتناعی (Permanent Injunction):

عدالت کسی فریق کو ایسا عمل کرنے سے روک سکتی ہے جو دوسرے کے حقوق کی خلاف ورزی کا باعث بنے۔

---

🔹 Succession Act, 1925

سیکشن 278 — انتظامیہ (Administration of Estate):

اگر کسی مرحوم کی جائیداد تقسیم یا انتظام کے لیے زیرِ سماعت ہو،
تو دعویٰ اس مقام پر دائر کیا جا سکتا ہے جہاں مرحوم کی کوئی جائیداد واقع ہو۔
📘 یعنی انتظامیہ (Administration Suit) کے لیے جائیداد کا صرف ایک حصہ عدالت کے دائرے میں ہونا کافی ہے۔

---

⚖️ عدالت کے مشاہدات و اصولِ قانون

🟩 (a) دائرہ اختیار کی قانونی حیثیت

مقدمہ متعدد جائیدادوں کے بارے میں تھا جو مختلف اضلاع میں واقع تھیں۔

سیکشن 17، CPC کے تحت، اگر کسی ایک جائیداد کا مقام عدالت کے دائرے میں ہے،
تو عدالت تمام جائیدادوں کے بارے میں فیصلہ کر سکتی ہے۔

لہٰذا عدالت کے پاس دائرہ اختیار (Jurisdiction) موجود تھا۔

---

🟦 (b) انتظامیہ و تقسیم کے مقدمات میں فرق (Administration vs. Partition Suits)

تقسیم (Partition) کا مقدمہ صرف شریک جائیداد کے حصے بانٹنے سے متعلق ہوتا ہے۔

انتظامیہ (Administration) کا مقدمہ وسیع تر دائرہ رکھتا ہے —
جس میں جائیدادوں کی شناخت، قیمت کا تعین، قرضوں کی ادائیگی،
منقولہ و غیرمنقولہ املاک کی تقسیم اور قانونی وارثوں کا تعین شامل ہے۔

لہٰذا مرحوم کے ترکہ کی انتظامیہ کے لیے
کسی بھی جگہ پر موجود جائیداد عدالت کے دائرہ اختیار کو کافی بناتی ہے۔

---

🟨 (c) ریکارڈ طلبی کی درخواست کا جواز

مدعیہ نے گفٹ ڈیڈ (Gift Deed) کا ریکارڈ طلب کیا کیونکہ
متعلقہ دفتر (ڈیفینڈنٹ ادارہ) وہ ریکارڈ فراہم نہیں کر رہا تھا۔

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ آرڈر XVI، رول 14 کے تحت
عدالت خود بھی ریکارڈ طلب کر سکتی ہے تاکہ انصاف پر مبنی فیصلہ کیا جا سکے۔

لہٰذا ریکارڈ طلب کرنے کی درخواست قانونی طور پر درست تھی۔

---

🟥 (d) دائرہ اختیار پر اعتراض تاخیر سے اُٹھانا

مدعا علیہان نے پہلے مقدمے میں باقاعدہ حصہ لیا اور بعد میں اعتراض کیا۔

عدالت نے کہا کہ سیکشن 21، CPC کے مطابق
دائرہ اختیار پر اعتراض صرف ابتدائی مرحلے میں ممکن ہے۔

جب کوئی فریق مقدمے میں حصہ لے چکا ہو تو
وہ بعد میں دائرہ اختیار کو چیلنج نہیں کر سکتا۔

---

🟧 (e) Order II, Rule 2 کا اطلاق نہیں ہوتا

مدعا علیہان نے کہا کہ چونکہ ایک سابقہ درخواست دائر ہو چکی تھی،
لہٰذا نئی درخواست ناقابلِ سماعت ہے۔

عدالت نے کہا کہ آرڈر II، رول 2 میں لفظ "Suit" استعمال ہوا ہے،
"Application" نہیں۔

لہٰذا یہ قاعدہ درخواستوں پر لاگو نہیں ہوتا۔

---

🧾 عدالت کا فیصلہ

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ:

ٹرائل کورٹ کے پاس قانونی دائرہ اختیار موجود تھا؛

ریکارڈ طلبی کی درخواست قانونی و درست تھی؛

دائرہ اختیار پر اعتراض تاخیر سے اٹھانے کے باعث ناقابلِ سماعت ہے؛

Order II Rule 2 کا اطلاق درخواست پر نہیں ہوتا۔

🟩 نتیجہ:
آئینی درخواست خارج کر دی گئی۔
ٹرائل کورٹ کا حکم برقرار رکھا گیا۔

📚 حوالہ (Cited Case)

Amjad Khan v. Muhammad Irshad (Deceased) 2020 SCMR 2155

> "جہاں ایک سے زائد جائیدادیں مختلف اضلاع میں واقع ہوں، وہاں عدالت کو مکمل دائرہ اختیار حاصل ہے اگر کسی ایک جائیداد کا حصہ اس کے دائرے میں آتا ہو۔"

---

💡 خلاصۂ فیصلہ (Simple Urdu Summary)

> عدالت نے کہا کہ چونکہ مقدمہ مرحوم کی مختلف جائیدادوں کی تقسیم اور انتظام سے متعلق تھا
اور ان میں سے کچھ جائیدادیں ٹرائل کورٹ کے دائرہ اختیار میں تھیں،
اس لیے عدالت کے پاس مقدمہ سننے کا مکمل اختیار تھا۔
ریکارڈ طلبی کی درخواست بھی درست تھی کیونکہ عدالت انصاف کے تقاضے پورے کرنے کی پابند ہے۔
مدعا علیہان نے مقدمے میں حصہ لینے کے بعد دائرہ اختیار پر اعتراض کیا،

Before Inaam Ameen Minhas, J

Mrs. ANJUM MALIK and others ---Petitioners

versus

Mst. NEELOFER MALIK through L.Rs and others ---Respondents

(a) Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908)---

----Ss. 17 & 21 & O. XVI, R. 14---Specific Relief Act (I of 1877), Ss. 42 & 54---Succession Act (XXXIX of 1925), S. 278---Suit for declaration, permanent injunction seeking administration, rendition of accounts, partition of several properties---Territorial jurisdiction---Scope---Application for summoning/calling of record filed by the respondent/plaintiff was allowed by the Trial Court---Contention of the petitioners was that such an application could not be allowed as the Trial Court had no territorial jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the suit---Validity---Suit in the Trial Court was regarding the partition of several properties situated in the territorial jurisdiction of different Courts, thus, under S. 17, C.P.C. the Trial Court had jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate upon the suit for partition relating to all properties because these properties would be considered as a portion of the suit property---Suit for partition of the suit property (a portion of properties required to be partitioned) was based upon the cancellation of gift deed and custodian of the record of the gift deed, who had also been arrayed as defendant, did not produce the record of the gift deed, thus, it was necessary to call the record of the gift deed so as to reach a just decision in the suit---Suit for administration could be instituted within the territorial jurisdiction of any Court where any part of the deceased's estate is located, which principle was well established under the law governing civil suits and succession matters---Administration suit differs from a partition suit in legal scope and effect---While a partition suit primarily seeks the division of specific joint property among co-owners, an administration suit covers a broader scope, including the identification, valuation, management, distribution and settlement of liabilities of the deceased's estate in accordance with succession laws, thus, in view of the legal distinction between these two types of suits and the jurisdictional principles governing administration suits, the suit was rightly instituted within the appropriate jurisdiction, considering the location of the deceased's assets and the Trial Court lawfully assumed the jurisdiction---Under S. 21, C.P.C., an objection to jurisdiction must be raised at the earliest possible stage before the Trial Court and pursued diligently and in the absence of such persistent agitation, a party cannot later challenge the jurisdiction of the court after having willingly participated in the proceedings---Constitutional petition was dismissed, in circumstances. 

Amjad Khan v. Muhammad Irshad (Deseased) 2020 SCMR 2155 rel.

(b) Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908)---

---O. II, R. 2---Application for summoning/calling of record---Objection qua maintainability of such an application was raised that since the plaintiff had already filed an application for summoning record of some other properties without mentioning the record sought to be summoned in the latter application, thus, under O. II, R. 2, C.P.C., latter application was not maintainable---Validity---Order II, Rule 2, C.P.C., contains word "suit" and word "application" is not mentioned in the same, thus, the same does not apply in the case of an application.

Balach Khan v. The State
[سندھ ہائی کورٹ، حیدرآباد بینچ]

فاضل جج: جناب جسٹس عبد الحمید بھرگری
تاریخِ فیصلہ: 2025
موضوع: بعد از گرفتاری ضمانت (Post-Arrest Bail) — نام کا تکمیلی بیان (Supplementary Statement) میں شامل ہونا — اصولِ مطابقت (Rule of Consistency)

Posted by Legal Luminaries

📜 مقدمے کا پس منظر

درخواست گزار بالاچ خان پر الزام تھا کہ اُس نے مرکزی ملزم کو اپنے گھر میں پناہ (Refuge) دی،
جبکہ وہ مرکزی ملزم مبینہ طور پر تین افراد پر اندھا دھند فائرنگ کرنے کے نتیجے میں
ان کی موت (Qatl-i-amd) کا سبب بنا۔

مقدمہ خاندانی و ازدواجی تنازع سے شروع ہوا۔

ابتدائی ایف آئی آر میں بالاچ خان کا نام شامل نہیں تھا۔

بعد ازاں، شکایت کنندہ نے تکمیلی بیان (Supplementary Statement) کے ذریعے
بالاچ خان کو ملوث کیا۔

درخواست گزار نے بعد از گرفتاری ضمانت (Post-arrest Bail) کی درخواست دائر کی۔

---

⚖️ متعلقہ دفعات (Section Definitions)

🔹 ضابطہ فوجداری (Criminal Procedure Code, 1898)

سیکشن 497 — ضمانت (Bail in Non-Bailable Offences):

یہ دفعہ غیر ضمانتی جرائم میں ضمانت کے اختیار سے متعلق ہے۔
اس کے تحت عدالت اگر مطمئن ہو کہ:

ملزم کے خلاف ابتدائی شواہد کمزور ہیں،

تحقیقات مکمل ہو چکی ہیں،

یا ملزم کا کردار معاون یا ثانوی ہے،
تو عدالت ضمانت دے سکتی ہے۔

📘 ذیلی دفعہ (2) کے مطابق،
اگر شواہد شک یا مزید تحقیق (Further Inquiry) کے متقاضی ہوں،
تو ملزم ضمانت کا حقدار ہوتا ہے۔

---

سیکشن 161 — پولیس کی جانب سے گواہوں کے بیانات کا اندراج (Statements to Police):

تحقیقات کے دوران پولیس گواہوں کے بیانات ریکارڈ کرتی ہے۔
تاہم، ایسے بیانات حتمی ثبوت نہیں ہوتے بلکہ
ان کی ساکھ عدالت میں مزید جانچ کے بعد طے کی جاتی ہے۔
یہ بیانات مقدمے کے ابتدائی مرحلے میں شک کے دائرے میں رہتے ہیں۔

---

🔹 تعزیراتِ پاکستان (Pakistan Penal Code, 1860)

سیکشن 302 — قتلِ عمد (Qatl-i-Amd):

ارادے یا منصوبے سے کسی کو قتل کرنا۔

⚖️ عدالت کے مشاہدات و قانونی نکات

🟢 (a) ایف آئی آر میں نام کا نہ ہونا

ابتدائی ایف آئی آر میں درخواست گزار نامزد نہیں تھا۔

بعد ازاں، اس کا نام تکمیلی بیان (Supplementary Statement) میں شامل کیا گیا۔

عدالت نے کہا کہ ایسے بیانات سیکشن 161، Cr.P.C. کے تحت
صرف تحقیقی مواد (Investigative Material) ہوتے ہیں،
جو مزید جانچ کے متقاضی ہوتے ہیں۔

📖 نتیجتاً، درخواست گزار کے خلاف براہِ راست اور فوری ثبوت موجود نہیں تھا۔

---

🟡 (b) مرکزی ملزم کا کردار واضح، درخواست گزار کا ثانوی

عدالت نے نوٹ کیا کہ:

فائرنگ مرکزی ملزم نے کی۔

درخواست گزار پر صرف پناہ دینے کا الزام تھا۔

یہ معاونت (Abetment) کے زمرے میں آتا ہے،
جسے مزید تحقیق کے بغیر سزا نہیں دی جا سکتی۔

---

🔵 (c) Rule of Consistency (اصولِ مطابقت)

عدالت نے مشاہدہ کیا کہ ہم نوعیت (Similar Role) کے شریک ملزم کو پہلے ہی ضمانت مل چکی ہے۔

لہٰذا، مطابقت کے اصول کے تحت درخواست گزار بھی
ضمانت کا مساوی حقدار ہے۔

📚 اصول:

> “اگر شریک ملزم کو ضمانت دی جا چکی ہو اور دوسرے ملزم کا کردار بھی مساوی ہو،
تو عدالت کو یکساں سلوک کرنا چاہیے،
الا یہ کہ کوئی واضح امتیازی فرق موجود ہو۔”

---

🟣 (d) تحقیقات کی تکمیل اور مقدمے کی تاخیر

عدالت کے مطابق:

تفتیش مکمل ہو چکی ہے۔

ملزم کافی عرصے سے زیرِ حراست ہے۔

مقدمے کے جلد مکمل ہونے کا کوئی امکان نہیں۔

لہٰذا، ملزم کو مزید حراست میں رکھنا بلا جواز ہے۔

---

⚖️ (e) Further Inquiry (مزید تحقیق)

عدالت نے کہا کہ چونکہ ملزم کا کردار براہِ راست نہیں بلکہ ثانوی نوعیت کا ہے،
لہٰذا یہ مقدمہ سیکشن 497(2) Cr.P.C. کے تحت
مزید تحقیق کے زمرے میں آتا ہے۔

اس لیے، ضمانت قانونی حق کے طور پر دی جا سکتی ہے۔

---

🧾 عدالت کا فیصلہ

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ:

درخواست گزار ابتدائی ایف آئی آر میں نامزد نہیں تھا۔

الزام صرف پناہ دینے تک محدود تھا۔

شریک ملزم کو پہلے ہی ضمانت مل چکی ہے۔

مقدمے کی مزید سماعت میں تاخیر انصاف کے منافی ہے۔

🟩 لہٰذا:
درخواست گزار بالاچ خان کو ضمانت پر رہا کرنے کا حکم دیا گیا۔
عدالت نے یہ بھی ہدایت دی کہ وہ ہر پیشی پر حاضر رہے
اور ثبوتوں سے چھیڑ چھاڑ نہ کرے۔

---

💡 خلاصۂ فیصلہ (Summary in Simple Urdu)

> “درخواست گزار بالاچ خان کا نام ابتدائی ایف آئی آر میں شامل نہیں تھا بلکہ بعد ازاں تکمیلی بیان میں لیا گیا۔
اُس پر فائرنگ کا الزام نہیں بلکہ صرف پناہ دینے کا تھا۔
شریک ملزم کو پہلے ہی ضمانت مل چکی تھی، لہٰذا مساوات کے اصول کے تحت بالاچ خان بھی ضمانت کا حق دار ہے۔
مقدمہ مزید تحقیق کا متقاضی ہے، اس لیے درخواست گزار کو ضمانت پر رہا کیا جاتا ہے۔”

The STATE---Respondent

Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898)---

---Ss. 497 & 161---Penal Code (XLV of 1860), Ss. 302, 324, 506(ii) & 34---Qatl-i-amd, attempt to commit qatl-i-amd, criminal intimidation, common intention---Post-arrest ball, grant of---Nomination through supplementary statement---Rule of consistency---Allegation against the petitioner /accused was that he allegedly provided refuge within his residence to the principal accused who was purported to have indiscriminately fired upon three persons, resulting in their demise--Validity---Admittedly, it was the principal accused who directly opened fire on three individuals, culminating in their fatal injuries---First Information Report delineated the incident as an offshoot of a familial and matrimonial dispute---Significantly, the petitioner's name was not originally recorded in the FIR but surfaced subsequently through an additional statement by the complainant---Such statements, made under S.161, Cr.P.C, inherently warranted further judicial scrutiny, as envisaged under subsection (2) of S.497, Cr.P.C.---Petitioner's case was indistinguishable from that of co-accused who was granted bail by the High Court ---Consequently, the petitioner, by the rule of consistency, was equally entitled to bail---Petitioner had been behind bars since his arrest and with the investigation having concluded, his continued detention served no tangible purpose---Given the indeterminate timeframe for the trial's completion, prolonging the applicant's incarceration would be unjustified---Petitioner / accused was admitted to bail, in circumstances.

Burden of proof---Plaintiff (elderly and illiterate lady) was not required to prove the factum of fraud; rather, the burden lay upon the beneficiaries of the sale deed to establish the genuineness of the transaction---Presumption attached with registered sale deed was rebuttable---Facts in brevity were that the predecessor-in-interest (vendor) of the petitioners filed a declaratory suit challenging the validity of a registered sale deed in favour of the respondents/defendants (beneficiaries) regarding the suit property claiming that at the time of execution of the impugned sale deed, she was an illiterate woman, approximately 80 to 90 years old, issueless. and her husband had passed away---She alleged that her close relatives

(respondents/defendants) committed fraud---The trial court and appellate court decreed the suit by declaring the sale deed as null and void and ordering its cancellation, however, the High Court allowed the civil revision filed by the respondents/defendants (beneficiaries), holding that the deceased vendor and petitioners had to discharge the burden to prove the factum of fraud and forgery---Core point for determination by the Supreme Court was as to "Whether the burden of proof lay solely on the plaintiff/vendor (elderly and illiterate lady) to establish fraud, or whether the beneficiaries of the impugned transaction were required to prove the genuineness and bona fides of the transaction?"---Held: Presumption of truth was attached to the registered sale deed which was a public document but the said presumption was rebuttable---As the vendors alleged fraud regarding the registered sale deed and agreement in question, therefore, it was duty of the respondents/defendants being beneficiaries to prove the genuineness of the transaction qua the suit property in their favour through bringing on record confidence aspiring and trustworthy evidence---Respondents/defendants (beneficiaries) were legally bound to prove the genuineness of the alleged transaction by producing the concerned Registrar but the needful was not done---Similarly the respondent (beneficiaries) were bound to prove the payment of sale consideration but the bank record or any official/officer of bank was not produced by respondents to prove the factum of payment of sale consideration, therefore, the respondents being beneficiaries could not discharge the onus to prove the genuineness of the transaction in their favour---The judgment of the High Court whereby, the petitioner/plaintiff (vendor) was held responsible to prove the factum of fraud was passed against the settled law of the country on the subject---Once fraud was alleged by the original owner then the beneficiaries of the sale transaction were bound to show genuineness of the alleged transaction---Impugned judgment of the High Court was set-aside, resultantly the judgments and decrees of the trial court and the district court were restored---Appeal was allowed, in circumstances.
[11/9/25, 3:14:07 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: ہرجانہ کس طرح لیا جائے؟ 

اپیل کنندہ زرعی یونیورسٹی فیصل آباد میں سال 2012 میں پانچویں سمسٹر کی طالبہ تھی۔ 11 دسمبر 2012 کو  اسے اپنے بازو میں درد محسوس ہوا جس پر وہ چیک اپ کے لیے الائیڈ ہسپتال ،فیصل اباد چلی گئی۔ میڈیکل چیک اپ کے بعد اس کو سرجری تجویز کی گئی اور 17 دسمبر کو اس کا  آپریشن کیا گیا۔ 

18 دسمبر کو اس نے شکایت کی کہ اس کے بدن کا نچھلا حصہ کام نہیں کررہا۔ اس کے والد نے اس کو دوسرے  ڈاکٹرز کو دکھایا جس سے یہ معلوم ہوا کہ ڈاکٹروں نے انتہائی غفلت سے کام لیا ہے جس کی وجہ سے اس کے تین ریڑھ کی ہڈیاں اورSpinal Cord کٹا ہوا ہے ۔اس غفلت پر اس کے والد نے پنجاب ہیلتھ کیئر کمیشن کے سامنے شکایت درج کی۔  جس کی تفتیش پر ڈاکٹر کو زمہ دار ٹھہرایا گیا۔  ڈاکٹر نے اس کے خلاف اپیل اور بعد میں رٹ پٹیشن بھی دائر جو کہ  دونوں مسترد کر دیے گیے۔ ہیلتھ ڈیپارٹمنٹ نے بھی انکوائری کی اور اس کی پینشن ختم کرنے کا فیصلہ جاری کیا۔

اپیل کنندہ/مدعیہ نے 75 کروڑ روپے کے ہرجانہ ادا کرنے کا دعویٰ دائر کیا جس پر سول کورٹ نے ہرجانہ کے رقم کو 50 لاکھ تک کرنے کا فیصلہ جاری کیا۔ اس فیصلے کے خلاف دونوں مدعیہ اور مدعا علیہ نے اپیل دائر کی۔ 

عدالت کے سامنے بنیادی سوال یہ تھا کہ کیا مدعیہ واقعی 75 کروڑ روپے بطور ہرجانہ کی حقدار ہے۔؟

عدالت کے سامنے مدعیہ بذات خود پیش ہوئی۔  جس پر اس نے اپنا بیان پیش کیا۔ اس کے بعد ڈاکٹر شہزاد انور جو کہ مدعیہ کے چچا نے اپنا بیان ریکارڈ کروایا۔ اس کے بعد مدعیہ کے ماں کا بیان بھی ریکارڈ کیا گیا ۔

مدعا علیہ کی طرف سے مدعا علیہ خود اور ڈاکٹر ارشد علی چیمہ [میڈیکل سپرنٹینڈنٹ الائیڈ ہسپتال]  نے اپنے اپنے بیان ریکارڈ کروائے 

عدالت نے سب سے پہلے پنجاب ہیلتھ کیئر کمیشن ایکٹ 2010 میں " میڈیکل نیگلیجنس" کے تعارف پر غور کیا اس کے بعد ایکسپرٹ ڈاکٹرز کے بورڈ کی میڈیکل رپورٹ بھی دیکھی اور ساتھ میں مدعا علیہ/ڈاکٹڑ کے بیان کو بھی دیکھا جس سے یہ ثابت ہوتا کہ اس ڈاکٹر کے پاس یہ آپریشن کرنے کی صلاحیت موجود نہیں تھی اور اس نے آپریشن کے دوران غفلت سے کام لیا ہے ۔
اس کے بعد عدالت آئین میں موجود بنیادی حقوق کے طرف آتی ہے اور ساتھ ایک کیس

2006 SCMR 207
 میں کہا گیا ہے کہ لاء آف ٹارٹ کے فعالیت آج کے دور کی ضرورت ہے تاکہ لوگ سمجھے کہ ایک قوم قانون میں مذکور زمہ داریوں کو پورا کیے بغیر کبھی بھی آگے نہیں جا سکتی ساتھ اس کے علاوہ طبی غفلت پر متعدد عدالتی نظائر کا بھی زکر  کیا۔
1996 CLC 1440
1969 AIR SC 128
2000 AIR SC 1888
2019 SCMR 143
2016 SCMR 663
2011 SCMR 1836

مدعا علیہ کا یہ موقف تھا کہ یہ کیس سرے سے  نہیں بنتا کیونکہ جو شکایت اس نے کی تھی چارہ جوئی پہلے سے ہی اس نے لے رکھی ہے اس پر عدالت نے پنجاب ہیلتھ کیئر کمشن ایکٹ 2010 پر غور کرتی ہے اور کہتی ہے کہ اس کمیشن کو صرف  ہیلتھ سروس پرواڈر یعنی ہسپتال وغیرہ کے بد انتظامی اور غفلت اور ان پر الزامات کے تفتیش کے اختیار ہے ہرجانہ طے کرنے کا اختیار اس کمیشن کے پاس  نہیں ہے یہ صرف سول کورٹ کے پاس اختیار ہے۔

عدالت نے آخر میں یہ کیا کہ میڈیکل بر انتظامی کے کیس کو " لاء اف ٹارٹ" کے تحت ڈیل کیا جائے اور پاکستان اس میں انگلش لاء کی پیروی کرتا ہے ۔
عدالت نے کہا کہ ہرجانہ کی رقم کا تعین کرنے کے لیے عدالت کو اپنے سامنے یہ بنیادی اصول رکھنے ہے۔

نقصان کے وجہ سے معقول اور منصفانہ مالی معاوضہ

تکلیف اور درد کے وجہ سے  مالی معاوضہ 

سہولتوں کے ختم ہونے کہ وجہ سے نقصان کے تلافی کے لئے معاوضہ

طبی اخراجات
پیسے کمانے سے محروم ہونے کا نقصان اس رقم کا اندازہ کرنے کے لیے کم سے کم 2 سال کا وقت پر غور کرنا پڑے گا۔

مالی نقصان سفر کے اخراجات سپیشل کیئر کا خرچہ
وغیرہ

درد اور تکلیف کے وجہ سے نقصان جیسے کے زلت آمیز رویے جسم میں بگاڑ عمر متوقع میں کمی وغیرہ۔

عدالت نے کہا کہ ڈاکٹر کے غفلت کی وجہ سے مدعیہ کو ناقابل تلافی نقصان ہوا ہے جس کو پیسوں سے پورا نہیں کیا جاسکتا لیکن اس کی وجہ سے کچھ نہ کچھ مدد مل سکتی ہے۔ عدالت نے ٹرائل کورٹ کے 50 لاکھ ہرجانہ کی رقم کو بڑھا کر 1 کروڑ تک کرنے کا فیصلہ جاری کردیا

[11/9/25, 10:44:55 PM] ~ Waseem: امی نے کہا، "جاؤ، ساتھ والی آنٹی سے 
ماچس کی دو تین تیلیاں لے آؤ۔"
میں دوڑتا ہوا گیا۔ آنٹی چولہے پر کچھ پکا رہی تھیں۔
میں نے کہا، "آنٹی، امی کہہ رہی ہیں، دو تین تیلیاں دے دیں۔"
آنٹی نے چولہے سے ایک جلتی ہوئی لکڑی نکال کر میری طرف بڑھا دی اور کہنے لگیں، "بیٹا، ہماری ماچس بھی ختم ہو گئی ہے، یہ آگ لے جاؤ۔"
شاید آج کی نسل کو یہ بات عجیب لگے، لیکن کبھی ایسا بھی وقت تھا جب آگ بھی اڑوس پڑوس سے مانگی جاتی تھی۔ نمک، مرچ، ہلدی، دہی، لسی، پیاز، ٹماٹر ، یہ سب ایک دوسرے سے مانگنا روزمرہ کا معمول تھا۔ کسی کے گھر چائے بننے لگتی اور چینی ختم ہوجاتی، تو دروازے پر ہلکی سی دستک کے ساتھ آواز آتی، "بھابھی، تھوڑی سی چینی دے دیں۔"
گاؤں میں کسی کے پاس صرف ایک بیل ہوتا تو دوسرا بیل پڑوس سے مانگ کر ہل جوتا جاتا۔ یہ سب بغیر کسی جھجک کے ہوتا، کیونکہ لین دین کا رشتہ یکطرفہ نہیں بلکہ باہمی اعتماد اور محبت کا ہوتا۔
اگر محلے میں کسی کی شادی ہوتی تو پورا محلہ ایک خاندان بن جاتا۔ چارپائیاں، برتن، چادریں، دیگچے ، سب پڑوس سے آتے۔ برتنوں پر مارکر سے نام لکھے جاتے تاکہ واپسی میں آسانی ہو۔ شادی کا ہر کام محلے دار مل کر کرتے ۔ 
کوئی گوشت کاٹ رہا ہوتا، کوئی پیاز چھیل رہا ہوتا، اور عورتیں صحن میں بیٹھ کر دیگوں کیلۓ مسالہ کوٹ دیتیں۔
شادی صرف دو افراد کا نہیں، بلکہ پورے محلے کا تہوار بن جاتی۔
پھر وقت بدلا۔ لوگ تعلیم یافتہ ہوئے، آمدنی بڑھی، سہولیات آئی۔ شادی ہال بنے، کیٹرنگ کمپنیوں نے ذمہ داری سنبھال لی۔ اب نہ برتن مانگنے کی ضرورت رہی، نہ چارپائیاں۔ اب مہمانوں کے لیے شادی ھال بک ہو جاتے ہیں، اور کھانا گرم گرم پراتوں میں پیش کیا جاتا ہے۔
مگر ساتھ ہی ہم کچھ کھو بھی بیٹھے ،  وہ بے لوث محبت، وہ اپنائیت، وہ "پڑوسی" ہونے کا حقیقی مفہوم۔
اب ہم خود کفیل ضرور ہو گئے ہیں، مگر اکثر دل خالی محسوس ہوتا ہے۔ اب گھر کے دروازے پر دستک نہیں آتی، "بھابھی، تھوڑا نمک مل جائے گا؟"
شاید ہم نے سہولت تو پا لی، مگر سادگی اور رشتوں کی وہ گرمی کہیں پیچھے رہ گئی۔ وقت کا پہیہ آگے بڑھتا ہے، لیکن کبھی کبھی دل چاہتا ہے کہ واپس اسی وقت میں چلا جائے ، جب آگ بھی بانٹی جاتی تھی، اور محبت بھی۔

جائداد، پلاٹ، رہائشی یا تجارتی زمین کی خرید و فروخت، تبدیلی مالکیت، نقشہ (یا سروے پلَان) اور رجسٹریشن کا عمل پاکستان میں مختلف قوانین اور ضوابط کے تحت جاری ہے۔ اس میں چند اہم اجزاء یہ ہیں: ملکیت کا سراغ لگانا، حد بندی اور نقشہ بنانے کا عمل، متعلقہ دستاویزات کا اندراج (رجسٹریشن) اور متعلقہ حکام سے منظوری۔
نقشے کا مطلب یہاں زیادہ تر سروے کے بعد طے شدہ حد بندی اور پلان سے ہے، جسے بعض اوقات “سائٹ پلان”، “سروے پلَان”، یا “لوئَوٹ پلَان” بھی کہا جاتا ہے۔

آپ کا سوال یہ ہے کہ PT‑1 فارم کے سلسلے میں یہ نقشہ بنوانا ہے یا نہیں، اور اس کا قانونی پسِ منظر کیا ہے۔ ذیل میں وہ قانونی فریم ورک، اصول، اور آپ کو کرنا کیا چاہیے، تفصیل سے درج ہے۔
۲. قانونی فریم ورک

(الف) وفاقی قوانین

1. Registration Act, 1908 — یہ وفاقی قانون ہے جو ملک کے بیشتر صوبوں پر لاگو ہے (کچھ حصّے مضافاتی ضابطوں کے تابع ہو سکتے ہیں)۔ اس قانون کے تحت “دستاویزات برائے رجسٹریشن” کی ترتیب، اندراج، متعلقہ دفاتر اور طریقۂ کار طے ہیں۔ 

شق 21 و 22 اس بات کا ذکر کرتی ہیں کہ املاک/زمین، گھروں وغیرہ کی دستاویزات میں “نقشہ یا پلان” یا “حکومت کے نقشے یا سروے کا حوالہ” درج ہونا چاہیے۔ 
2. Transfer of Property Act, 1882 — یہ بنیادی قانون ہے جو جائداد کے انتقال اور منتقلی کے اصول وضع کرتا ہے۔ 


3. Surveying and Mapping Act, 2014 — یہ قانون ملک بھر میں سروے اور نقشہ سازی کے لیے مرکزی ضابطہ فراہم کرتا ہے، یعنی کس کو سروے کرنے کی اجازت ہے، کس طرح کا ڈیٹا تیار ہو سکتا ہے، وغیرہ۔ 

(ب) صوبائی/ریونیو قوانین

1. Land Revenue Act, 1967 (مثلاً پنجاب کا ورژن) — اس طرح کے قوانین ریونیو اور زمین کی حد بندی، سروے، ریکارڈ حقوق، ملکیت، حلقۂ حق اور تبدیلی مالکیت کا نظام فراہم کرتے ہیں۔ 


2. کل اراضی کا اندراج، تبدیلی، ٹیکس، رجسٹریشن اور سرکاری ریکارڈ کا انتظام عموماً صوبائی سطح پر ہوتا ہے۔ 
۳. “نقشہ بنوانا” — کیا لازمی ہے؟

یہ سوال کسی پلاٹ، کالونی، یا بلڈنگ کے لحاظ سے مختلف ہو سکتا ہے — درجِ ذیل نکات مدِنظر رہیں:

اگر منتقلی، فروخت، گفٹ یا رجسٹریشن کی جا رہی ہے تو دستاویزات میں حد بندی واضح ہونا — یعنی پلاٹ کی حدود، راستے، گلیاں، سمتیں، رقبہ وغیرہ — اہم ہے۔

Registration Act, 1908 کی شق 22 میں کہا گیا ہے کہ “houses and land … shall be described by reference to a Government map or survey”. یعنی اگر حکومت کا سروے یا نقشہ موجود ہے تو اس کا حوالہ لازماً درج کرنا چاہیے۔ 

اگر کالونی پہلے سے منظور شدہ ہو یا پلان کے تحت ترتیب دی گئی ہو، تو بلدیاتی اتھارٹی یا شہر کی پلاننگ اتھارٹی اکثر “سائٹ پلان” یا “سروے پلان” کی منظوری لیتی ہے۔ اس صورت میں نقشہ بنوانا لازمی ہو سکتا ہے۔

وفاقی قانون Surveying and Mapping Act کے تحت، اگر کوئی فرد یا فرم سروے یا نقشہ سازی کا کام کر رہی ہے، تو اسے رجسٹرڈ ہونا پڑے گا۔ غیر مجاز نقشہ سازی یا غیر منظور شدہ نقشے کے استعمال پر جرمانہ یا سزا ممکن ہے۔ 


لہٰذا، یہ کہنا محفوظ ہے کہ ہر پلاٹ پر نقشہ بنوانا لازمی نہیں ہو سکتا، مگر “فروخت/منتقلی/رجسٹریشن” کی صورت میں نقشہ یا حد بندی کا حوالہ رکھنا قانونی طور پر بہت اہم ہے اور بعض صورتوں میں لازمی بھی ہے۔

۴. “PT‑1 فارم” اور اس کا تعلق

PT‑1 فارم عموماً شہری علاقوں میں ٹیکس، جائداد کی سالانہ تشخیص کے لیے ریونیو/بلدیاتی انتظامیہ کے تحت چلتا ہے۔

اس کا مقصد ممکنہ مالکان، کرایہ داروں، تعمیراتی معلومات وغیرہ کا ریکارڈ بنانا ہے۔

اس کا براہِ راست مطلب یہ نہیں کہ “سروے پلان/نقشہ بنانا” لازمی ہو گیا ہے، مگر اگر اس فارم کی معلومات غلط ہوں یا حد بندی واضح نہ ہو تو بعد میں قانونی پیچیدگیاں پیدا ہو سکتی ہیں۔
۵. عمل اور رہنمائی  کیا کرنا چاہیے؟

آپ کی صورتِ حال (پراپرٹی، معاملات، فلاحی ادارہ وغیرہ) کو مدِ نظر رکھتے ہوئے ذیل میں ایک عملی رہنمائی دی جارہی ہے:

1. متعلقہ تحصیل/ضلعی ریونیو آفس، رجسٹریشن دفتر، یا بلدیاتی اتھارٹی سے معلوم کریں کہ آپ کے علاقے میں “سروے/نقشہ بنانے کی منظوری” کا ضابطہ جاری ہے یا نہیں  یعنی کیا وہ نقشے کی منظوری بطور لازمہ قرار دیتے ہیں؟
2. اگر منظوری لازمی ہے:

سروے کروائیں: ماپ تول، حد بندی، سمتیں، رقبہ وغیرہ کا تفصیلی پلان تیار کروائیں۔

اس پلان کی بلدیاتی یا متعلقہ اتھارٹی سے منظوری حاصل کریں۔

نقشہ کو دستاویزات میں منسلک کریں، بشمول PT‑1 فارم، رجسٹریشن دستاویزات، فروخت/گفٹ اجازت وغیرہ۔
3. اگر منظوری لازمی نہیں ہے:
تب بھی یہ بہتر ہے کہ حد بندی اور پلاٹ کی معلومات واضح ہوں، ریکارڈ درست ہوں۔
تیاری کریں تاکہ مستقبل میں کسی تنازعے یا قانونی رکاوٹ سے بچا جائے۔
4. فروخت یا گفٹ کرنے یا رجسٹریشن کے وقت درج ذیل چیزیں یقینی بنائیں:

ٹائٹل چین واضح ہو (پچھلے مالک کی ملکیت، ٹرانسفر، ٹیکس واجب المعینہ وغیرہ)۔ 

متعلقہ دستاویزات جیسے “سیل ڈیڈ”، “موٹیشن سرٹیفیکیٹ”، “NO O­B­J” وغیرہ دستیاب ہوں۔ 

رجسٹریشن دفتر میں درست شناخت، CNIC، مطلوبہ فیس، سٹیمپ، اور ریکارڈ اپ ڈیٹ کی گئی ہو۔ 



5. چونکہ آپ فلاحی کام کررہے ہیں، اس لیے اپنی سرگرمیوں میں شفافیت، قانونی سٹرکچر کی پاسداری اور مستند دستاویزات کی دستیابی کو خاص اہمیت دیں — تاکہ بعد میں کسی قانونی یا انتظامی پیچیدگی کا سامنا نہ ہو۔

۶. مخصوص قانونی نکات جو قابلِ توجہ ہیں

غیر مجاز یا غلط نقشے یا سروے کی سرگرمی: فیڈرل قانون کے تحت، کسی غیر رجسٹرڈ ادارے کے ذریعے سروے یا نقشہ سازی کرنا جرم ہے۔ 

دستاویزات میں غلط بیان، حد بندی نہ ہونا یا حکومت کے سروے کا ذکر نہ ہونا رجسٹریشن کے وقت مسئلہ بن سکتا ہے۔ مثال کے طور پر، Registration Act کی شق 21‑22۔ 

صوبائی ریونیو قوانین کے تحت ریونیو حکام کو زمین میں داخلے، ماپ تول اور معاملات کی تحقیقات کا اختیار حاصل ہے۔ مثال: Punjab Land Revenue Act کی شق 30 جس میں اختیارِ داخلہ (“enter upon any lands … for purpose of measurements”) شامل ہے۔ 

نقشہ منظوری اور سروے کے معیار سے جڑا مسئلہ یہ ہے کہ اگر کالونی یا ہاؤسنگ سوسائٹی نے پیمائش کے بعد سرکاری منظوری لی ہو، تو ان نقشوں کو متعلقہ اتھارٹی سے رجسٹر کروانا ضروری ہوتا ہے۔

تنازعات کی صورت میں، پورا ریکارڈ، ٹھیک حد بندی، درست ٹائٹل اور متعلقہ رجسٹریشن دستاویزات اہم شواہد بنتے ہیں۔ 
۷. خلاصہ

نقشہ (سروے/پلَان) بنوانا ہر صورت لازم نہیں مگر فروخت، رجسٹریشن یا منتقلی کی صورت میں انتہائی ضروری اور قانونی اعتبار سے اہم ہے۔

PT‑1 فارم کے ساتھ نقشے کی منظوری یا حوالہ نہ ہونا بعد میں پیچیدگیاں پیدا کر سکتا ہے، خاص طور پر جب حد بندی یا مالکیت میں اختلاف ہو۔

قانونی فریم ورک میں وفاقی اور صوبائی قوانین دونوں کا کردار ہے، جنہیں مدِنظر رکھتے ہوئے عمل کرنا چاہیے۔ ‎<This message was edited>

[11/12/25, 11:28:40 AM] ~ Adnan Usman: ائین پاکستان (1973) میں اب تک 26 ترامیم ہوچکی ہیں۔ مسلم لیگ (ن) سب سے زیادہ ترامیم کے ساتھ پہلی پوزیشن پر ہے۔

ائین کے بانی ذوالفقار علی بھٹو نے 7 ترامیم کئے (1 تا 7)، جنرل ضیاء الحق نے 3 ترامیم کئے (8 تا 10) جن میں مشہور زمانہ ٓاٹھویں ترمیم قابل ذکر ہے، نواز شریف یعنی مسلم لیگ ن 9 ترامیم کئے (12, 13, 14, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24 اور 25)، چونکہ 15ویں ترمیم منظور نہیں ہوئی، اس لیے وہ شمار نہیں ہوتی۔

جنرل مشرف 17ویں ترمیم کی، پیپلز پارٹی نے 3 ترامیم کئے (18، 19، 20) اور تحریکِ انصاف 26 ویں ترمیم کرچکے ہیں۔

ہر ترمیم اپنے دور کے سیاسی، عدالتی اور آئینی پس منظر میں ایک منفرد اہمیت رکھتی ہے۔ ان آئینی ترامیم (1 تا 26) کا مختصر تعارف:

1. پہلی ترمیم 1974 (ذوالفقار علی بھٹو) 

اس ترمیم کے ذریعے مشرقی پاکستان کے علیحدہ ہونے کے بعد آئین سے "پاکستان کے مشرقی بازو" کے تمام حوالہ جات حذف کیے گئے۔ قومی اسمبلی کی نشستوں کی نئی تقسیم بھی کی گئی۔

2. دوسری ترمیم 1974 (ذوالفقار علی بھٹو) 

یہ ترمیم احمدیوں (قادیانیوں) کو آئینی طور پر غیر مسلم اقلیت قرار دینے سے متعلق ہے۔ یہ پاکستان کی مذہبی و نظریاتی بنیادوں کو واضح کرنے والی اہم ترین ترمیم تھی۔

3. تیسری ترمیم 1975 (ذوالفقار علی بھٹو) 

اس ترمیم کے ذریعے حراست کے اختیارات بڑھائے گئے، اور آئین کی شق 10 میں سیکیورٹی قوانین کے تحت قید کے عرصے میں توسیع کی گئی۔

4. چوتھی ترمیم 1975 (ذوالفقار علی بھٹو) 

اس ترمیم کے زریعے عدلیہ کے اختیارات میں کمی کی گئی اور بنیادی حقوق کے اطلاق میں کچھ حدود متعین کی گئیں، خصوصاً قومی مفاد کے معاملات میں۔

5. پانچویں ترمیم 1976 (ذوالفقار علی بھٹو) 

اس ترمیم میں عدلیہ کے ججوں کی مدتِ ملازمت اور تعیناتی کے اصول بدلے گئے۔ حکومت کو عدلیہ پر کچھ اضافی اثر و رسوخ حاصل ہوا۔

6. چھٹی ترمیم 1976 (ذوالفقار علی بھٹو) 

اس کے تحت چیف جسٹس اور ججوں کی مدتِ ملازمت میں توسیع کی گئی۔

7. ساتویں ترمیم 1977 (ذوالفقار علی بھٹو) 

اس ترمیم کے مطابق ریفرنڈم کے ذریعے وزیراعظم کو اعتماد کا ووٹ حاصل کرنے کا اختیار دیا گیا۔

8. آٹھویں ترمیم 1985 (جنرل ضیاء الحق) 

 یہ ترمیم پاکستان کی سب سے متنازع مگر مؤثر ترمیم تھی۔ اس کے ذریعے صدر کو آئین کی دفعہ 58(2)(b) کے تحت قومی اسمبلی تحلیل کرنے کا اختیار دیا گیا، جس سے نیم صدارتی نظام وجود میں آیا۔

9. نویں ترمیم 1986 (جنرل ضیاء الحق) 

یہ ترمیم اسلامی قوانین کے نفاذ سے متعلق تھی، لیکن پارلیمان نے اسے منظور نہیں کیا۔

10. دسویں ترمیم 1987 (جنرل ضیاء الحق) 

اس کے ذریعے قومی اسمبلی کے اجلاسوں کے درمیانی وقفے کو آئینی طور پر محدود کیا گیا۔

11. گیارہویں ترمیم

پیش کی گئی مگر منظور نہ ہوسکی۔

12. بارہویں ترمیم 1991 (نواز شریف) 

یہ نواز شریف نے اپنے پہلی حکومت میں کی۔ اس کے ذریعے خصوصی عدالتیں (Special Courts) قائم کرنے کی اجازت دی گئی تاکہ سنگین جرائم کے مقدمات جلد نمٹائے جائیں۔

13. تیرہویں ترمیم 1997 (نواز شریف)

نواز شریف نے اپنے دوسری حکومت میں کی۔ صدر کے اسمبلی تحلیل کرنے کے اختیارات (جو آٹھویں ترمیم میں شامل ہوئے تھے) ختم کر دیے گئے۔ اس سے وزیراعظم کا عہدہ انتہائی طاقتور ہوگیا۔

14. چودھویں ترمیم 1997 (نواز شریف)

یہ بھی نواز شریف نے کی۔ اس ترمیم کے ذریعے پارٹی وفاداری کی خلاف ورزی (Floor Crossing) کو غیر آئینی قرار دیا گیا۔ پارلیمانی استحکام کے لیے اہم اقدام سمجھا گیا۔

15. پندرھویں ترمیم 1998 نامنظور (نواز شریف)

نواز شریف نے اس کے ذریعے قرآن و سنت کو ملک کا اعلیٰ ترین قانون قرار دینے کی تجویز دی گئی۔ یہ ترمیم منظور نہ ہوسکی۔

16. سولہویں ترمیم 1999 (نواز شریف)

اس کے ذریعے سرکاری ملازمین کے تبادلے اور تربیت کے ضوابط میں تبدیلی کی گئی۔

17. سترہویں ترمیم 2003 (جنرل پرویز مشرف) 

اس میں جنرل پرویز مشرف نے آٹھویں ترمیم کے زیادہ تر نکات بحال کیے، اور صدر کو اسمبلی تحلیل کرنے کا اختیار دوبارہ دیا۔ البتہ وزیراعظم کے اعتماد کے ووٹ کی شرط شامل کی گئی۔

18. اٹھارویں ترمیم 2010 (پیپلز پارٹی) 

یوسف رضا گیلانی کے دور میں پاکستان پیپلز پارٹی نے پاکستان کی سب سے بڑی اور جامع آئینی ترمیم تھی۔ اہم نکات:

صدر کے اختیارات محدود کیے گئے  اور 58(2)(b) کا خاتمہ، صوبوں کو خودمختاری اور اسمبلی کی مدت 5 سال کی گئی۔ اس کے زریعے تعلیم، صحت، زراعت وغیرہ صوبوں کے حوالے ہوئے۔

19. انیسویں ترمیم 2011 (پیپلز پارٹی) 

یوسف رضا گیلانی کے دور میں پیپلز پارٹی نے اس کے ذریعے عدلیہ کی تعیناتی کے نظام میں تبدیلی کی گئی، جوڈیشل کمیشن اور پارلیمانی کمیٹی کا کردار واضح کیا گیا۔

20. بیسویں ترمیم 2012 (پیپلز پارٹی) 

یوسف رضا گیلانی کے دور میں پیپلز پارٹی نے یہ ترمیم عبوری حکومت (Caretaker Setup) اور الیکشن کمیشن کے قیام کے طریقہ کار سے متعلق تھی۔

21. اکیسویں ترمیم 2015 (نواز شریف) 

نواز شریف نے تیسری حکومت میں کی۔ سانحہ پشاور (16 دسمبر 2014) کے بعد منظور ہوئی۔ اس کے ذریعے فوجی عدالتیں قائم کی گئیں تاکہ دہشت گردی کے مقدمات جلد نمٹائے جائیں۔

22. بائیسویں ترمیم 2016 (نواز شریف) 

اس کے ذریعے الیکشن کمیشن آف پاکستان کے ارکان کی تقرری کے اصول تبدیل کیے گئے۔

23. تئیسویں ترمیم 2017 (نواز شریف) 

اس ترمیم کا تعلق فوجی عدالتوں کی مدت میں توسیع سے تھا۔ چیف جسٹس پاکستان کی ریٹائرمنٹ کی عمر میں تبدیلی۔ (یہ وہ ترمیم ہے جو اکثر تیسویں کے ساتھ خلط ملط کی جاتی ہے۔)

24. چوبیسویں ترمیم 2017 (نواز شریف) 

شاہد خاقان کے دور میں مسلم لیگ ن انتخابی اصلاحات سے متعلق تھی۔ ابتدائی طور پر حلف نامہ (ختمِ نبوت) میں تبدیلی کی گئی تھی، جسے بعد میں درست کیا گیا۔

25. پچیسویں ترمیم 2018 (نواز شریف)

شاہد خاقان کے دور میں مسلم لیگ ن نے اس کے ذریعے فاٹا کو خیبر پختونخوا میں ضم کر دیا گیا۔ یہ ایک تاریخی آئینی پیش رفت تھی۔

26. چھبیسویں ترمیم 2019 (عمران خان) 

عمران خان نے اس کے ذریعے فاٹا اور پاٹا کی صوبائی اسمبلی نشستوں میں اضافہ کیا گیا، تاکہ ان علاقوں کی نمائندگی بہتر ہو سکے۔

1973ء کے آئین میں کی گئی یہ تمام ترامیم پاکستان کے سیاسی ارتقا، جمہوری تجربات، اور طاقت کی تقسیم کی تاریخ کو ظاہر کرتی ہیں۔

کچھ ترامیم نے مرکزیت کو کمزور کیا، کچھ نے جمہوریت کو مضبوط کیا، جبکہ بعض نے حکمرانوں کو غیر معمولی اختیارات عطا کیے۔

🧾 مقدمے کا پس منظر (Background)

درخواست گزاروں کے کمپیوٹرائزڈ قومی شناختی کارڈز (CNICs) نادرا نے ڈیجیٹل طور پر بلاک / ضبط کر دیے۔

نادرا کا مؤقف تھا کہ دونوں افراد کا تعلق افغان نژاد خاندانوں سے ہے اور ان کی پاکستانی شہریت (national status) کی تصدیق ممکن نہیں ہوئی۔

وزارتِ داخلہ کے نوٹیفکیشن مورخہ 19 اپریل 2017ء کے مطابق، ایسے افراد جن کی شہریت مشکوک ہو یا افغان پس منظر رکھتے ہوں، ان کی تصدیق لازمی ہے۔

درخواست گزاروں نے آئین کے آرٹیکل 199 کے تحت آئینی درخواست دائر کی کہ نادرا نے بغیر قانونی اختیار اور بغیر وجہ ان کے شناختی کارڈ بلاک کی

⚖️ قانونی سوالات (Legal Issues)

1. کیا نادرا کو CNIC ضبط، منسوخ یا بلاک کرنے کا قانونی اختیار حاصل ہے؟

2. اگر نادرا ایسا اقدام کرے تو متاثرہ شہری کو سماعت اور اپیل کا حق حاصل ہے؟

3. کیا عدالتِ عالیہ براہِ راست نادرا کے اس عمل میں مداخلت کر سکتی ہے؟

🧩 عدالتی مشاہدات (Court’s Observations)

🔹 (1) نادرا کے اختیارات کی حدود

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ نادرا آرڈیننس 2000 کے تحت نادرا کو قانونی اختیار حاصل ہے کہ وہ:

قومی شناختی کارڈ جاری کرے؛

غلط بیانی یا جعلسازی کی صورت میں اسے منسوخ یا ضبط کر سکے؛

اور ایسے معاملات میں اپیل کا حق بھی قانون کے اندر فراہم ہے۔

🔹 (2) دفعہ 18 – نادرا آرڈیننس 2000

Section 18 میں نادرا کے اختیارات واضح کیے گئے ہیں:

> “نادرا کسی کارڈ کو منسوخ (cancel)، ضبط (impound)، یا ضبطی کے لیے حکم (confiscate) دے سکتی ہے
اگر یہ یقین ہو جائے کہ:
(a) کارڈ ایسے شخص کو جاری کیا گیا جو اہل نہیں تھا،
(b) ایک ہی شخص کو ایک سے زیادہ کارڈز ملے ہوں،
(c) کارڈ کے اندراجات میں رد و بدل یا جعلسازی ہو،
یا (d) کارڈ جعلی ہو۔”

اس کے ساتھ ہی دفعہ 18(3) کے تحت متاثرہ شخص کو یہ حق حاصل ہے کہ وہ فیڈرل گورنمنٹ کے سامنے اپیل کرے۔

---

🔹 (3) نادرا کی خودکار نظامی ذمہ داری

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ:

نادرا ایک خود مختار ریاستی ادارہ ہے جو قومی ڈیٹا بیس کی ساکھ قائم رکھنے کا ذمہ دار ہے۔

اس کے ذیلی فورمز جیسے ضلعی سطح کی کمیٹی (DLC) اور زونل ویریفیکیشن بورڈ شہریوں کی شہریت اور شناخت کی تصدیق کے لیے قائم ہیں۔

ان فورمز کا مقصد:

جعلی شناختی کارڈز کی روک تھام؛

شہریت کی درست تصدیق؛

شفاف طریقے سے CNIC کے اجرا یا تجدید کو یقینی بنانا ہے۔

---

🔹 (4) متاثرہ شہریوں کا قانونی حقِ سماعت

عدالت نے کہا:

> “نادرا اگر کسی شہری کا شناختی کارڈ بلاک کرے تو اُسے نوٹس اور ذاتی سماعت (personal hearing) کا موقع دینا ضروری ہے۔”

لہٰذا عدالت نے حکم دیا کہ:

درخواست گزار زونل ویریفیکیشن بورڈ اور ضلعی سطح کی کمیٹی (DLC) کے سامنے پیش ہوں؛

یہ فورمز ایک ماہ کے اندر سماعت کر کے فیصلہ کریں؛

اگر فیصلہ درخواست گزار کے خلاف ہو تو وہ فیڈرل گورنمنٹ کے پاس اپیل کر سکیں گے (دفعہ 18(3) کے مطابق)۔

---

⚖️ قانون کی دفعات کی وضاحت (Legal Provisions Explained)

🔸 NADRA Ordinance, 2000 – Section 14

(Power to Issue Identity Cards):
یہ دفعہ نادرا کو یہ اختیار دیتی ہے کہ وہ پاکستانی شہریوں، غیر ملکی مقیم پاکستانیوں، اور مخصوص غیر ملکیوں کے لیے مختلف شناختی کارڈز (CNIC, POC, NICOP, Alien Registration Card) جاری کرے۔

🔸 NADRA Ordinance, 2000 – Section 18

(Power to Cancel, Impound or Confiscate):
یہ دفعہ نادرا کو اختیار دیتی ہے کہ اگر:

کارڈ دھوکہ دہی سے حاصل کیا گیا ہو؛

جعلی یا غلط معلومات پر مبنی ہو؛

یا اہل نہ ہونے والے شخص کو جاری کیا گیا ہو؛
تو نادرا کارڈ منسوخ یا ضبط کر سکتی ہے۔
مزید یہ کہ:

ایسا حکم تحریری طور پر (in writing) اور نادرا کے مہر شدہ حکم سے جاری کیا جائے؛

متاثرہ شخص کو اپیل (Appeal) اور سماعت کا حق (Right of Hearing) دیا جائے۔

---

🔸 آئینِ پاکستان 1973 – آرٹیکل 199

عدالت عالیہ کو آئینی اختیار دیتا ہے کہ وہ کسی سرکاری ادارے کے غیر قانونی یا من مانی اقدامات کے خلاف شہریوں کو ریلیف دے۔
تاہم، اگر کسی معاملے میں خود قانون کے اندر اپیل یا سماعت کا طریقہ کار موجود ہو تو عدالت عام طور پر براہِ راست مداخلت نہیں کرتی بلکہ شہری کو پہلے وہ فورم استعمال کرنے کا کہتی ہے۔

🟣 اسی اصول کے تحت عدالت نے نادرا کے خلاف براہِ راست ریلیف دینے سے گریز کیا اور درخواست گزاروں کو متعلقہ فورم پر جانے کی ہدایت دی۔

---

📜 عدالتی فیصلہ (Final Judgment)

1. نادرا کو CNIC ضبط یا منسوخ کرنے کا اختیار حاصل ہے، مگر
اس کے لیے تحریری حکم اور سماعت دینا لازمی ہے۔

2. نادرا آرڈیننس کے تحت اپیل کا حق موجود ہے جسے استعمال کیا جانا چاہیے۔

3. عدالت نے حکم دیا کہ درخواست گزار:

زونل ویریفیکیشن بورڈ یا ضلعی کمیٹی (DLC) کے سامنے جائیں؛

ان فورمز کو ایک ماہ میں فیصلہ کرنے کی ہدایت کی گئی؛

اگر فیصلہ ان کے خلاف ہو تو وہ فیڈرل گورنمنٹ کے سامنے اپیل دائر کریں۔

4. آئینی درخواستیں (Constitutional Petitions) نمٹا دی گئیں (Disposed of in circumstances)۔

🧾 خلاصہ فیصلہ (Summary in Plain Urdu)

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ نادرا کا اختیار قانونی ہے مگر اسے قانونی طریقہ کار اپنانا ہو گا۔

شہریوں کو سماعت اور اپیل کا حق دیا جانا ضروری ہے۔

نادرا کے بلاک کیے گئے شناختی کارڈز کے متعلق فیصلہ ضلعی کمیٹی یا زونل بورڈ ایک ماہ میں کرے گا۔

کسی بھی فریق کو خلاف فیصلہ کی صورت میں فیڈرل گورنمنٹ میں اپیل کا حق حاصل ہوگا۔

اس طرح آئینی درخواستیں نمٹا دی گئیں۔

---

📘 اہم بات:
عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ شناختی کارڈ ریاست کی ملکیت (Property of the Federal Government) ہے —
شہری اس کے حامل (holder) ہوتے ہیں، مالک (owner) نہیں۔
لہٰذا اگر کسی نے یہ کارڈ دھوکے سے حاصل کیا ہو تو نادرا کو اسے واپس لینے اور منسوخ کرنے کا اختیار حاصل ہے۔

Law is well settled about proposition that decree can also be executed against a surety. Arrest of judgment-debtor does not absolve the surety from making payment of decretal amount as his liability is joint and several with the judgment-debtor. Surety can be proceeded against for enforcement of his liability as provided under Section 45 CPC. 
There is no cavil with the proposition that stipulation(s) and / or words in surety bond must be read in their ordinary meaning and when words contained therein are unambiguous, there is no reason to apply any other to its construction.

As per preamble of the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (the “Act”) the purpose and object of the law is to regulate the relationship of landlord and tenant and to provide a mechanism for settlement of their disputes in an expeditious and  cost-effective manner. An application for ejectment can be filed in respect of rented premises before the Rent Tribunal established under Section 16 of the “Act” for the said purpose. The jurisdiction of a Rent Tribunal is confined to the matters, arising out from a relationship of tenancy between landlord and tenant. For the said purpose the terms “landlord” and “tenant” become of significance importance. A person seeking eviction of an occupant from the premises is bound to prove that he is a landlord and the person, whose eviction is required is tenant. The term “landlord” is defined in Section 2(d) whereas “tenant” is defined in Section 2(l) of the “Act”.

For proving the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant, it is thus a pre-condition that the person seeking eviction must establish that the occupant has undertaken or bound to pay rent as consideration for the occupation of the premises to him.

صدر مملکت آصف علی زرداری کی منظوری کے بعد وزارت قانون وانصاف نے جسٹس امین الدین خان کو وفاقی آئینی عدالت کا چیف جسٹس مقرر کرنے کا نوٹیفکیشن جاری کردیا ہے۔

واضح رہے کہ اس سے قبل جسٹس امین الدین خان آئینی بینچ کے سربراہ تھے اور وہ اس ماہ کے آخر میں ریٹائر ہو رہے تھے۔

نوٹیفیکشن کے مطابق امین الدین خان کا بطور چیف جسٹس وفاقی آئینی عدالت کا اطلاق عہدے کا حلف لینے کے دن سے ہوگا یعنی اب وہ 68 برس تک اس وفاقی آئینی عدالت کی سربراہی کر سکتے ہیں۔27ویں آئینی ترمیم کی منظوری کے خلاف سپریم کورٹ آف پاکستان کے دو ججز نے احتجاجاً استعفیٰ دے دیا ہے۔ مستعفی ہونے والے ججز میں جسٹس منصور علی شاہ اور جسٹس اطہر من اللہ شامل ہیں۔

اس سے قبل ان ججز نے نئی آئینی ترمیم پر چیف جسٹس آف پاکستان کو خطوط لکھے تھے اور اس حوالے سے اپنے تحفظات اور خدشات کا اظہار بھی کیا تھا۔

جسٹس منصور علی شاہ چیف جسٹس یحییٰ آفریدی کے بعد سینیئر ترین جج تھے۔ جسٹس منصور علی شاہ نے اپنا استعفی صدر مملکت کو بھجوا دیا ہے۔

13 صفحات پر مشتمل اپنے استعفے میں انھوں نے عدلیہ کے معاملات اور بالخصوص آئینی ترامیم کے حوالے سے اپنے خدشات کا اظہار کیا تھا۔

اپنے استعفے میں جسٹس منصور علی شاہ نے کہا ہے کہ اپنے دور میں انھوں نے عدلیہ کا وقار بلند کرنے کی کوشش کی اور وہ اپنے عہدے سے مستعفی ہو رہے ہیں لیکن ان کا ضمیر مطمئن ہے۔ انھوں نے کہا کہ 27ویں آئینی ترمیم کے تحت عدلیہ کو حکومت کے ماتحت کر دیا گیا ہے۔

جسٹس منصور علی شاہ نے کہا کہ آئینی جمہوریت کی روح کو کاری ضرب لگائی گئی ہے۔ انھوں نے کہا کہ 27 ویں آئینی ترمیم نے لوگوں کے لیے انصاف حتم کر دیا ہے۔ جسٹس منصور علی شاہ نے کہا کہ ان ججز پر افسوس رہے گا جو اس آئینی عدالت کا حصہ بنیں گے۔

جسٹس منصور علی شاہ نے اپنے استعفے میں یہ بھی لکھا ہے کہ ’27 ویں آئینی ترمیم نے سپریم کورٹ کو ٹکڑے ٹکڑے کر دیا ہے۔‘ انھوں نے کہا کہ وہ قومیں ترقی کرتی ہیں جہاں حکومت میں قانون کی حکمرانی کو مرکزی حثیت حاصل ہو اور عدالتی آزادی کو مقدس امانت کی طرح محفوظ رکھا گیا ہو۔

انھوں نے اپنے استعفے میں یہ بھی لکھا ہے کہ جہاں انصاف کو جکڑ دیا گیا ہو وہ قومیں نہ صرف لڑکھڑاتی ہیں بلکہ اپنی اخلاقی اقدار بھی کھو دیتی ہیں۔ جسٹس منصور علی شاہ کا کہنا تھا کہ سپریم کورٹ کا آئینی وجود اور مقام ختم ہو رہا تھا۔

انھوں نے موجودہ چیف جسٹس کا نام لیے بغیر کہا کہ جب عدلیہ کا سربراہ اپنی متنازع حیثیت کے باوجود ادارے کے بجائے اپنے منصب اور عہدے کو ترجیح دے تو اسے قیادت نہیں بلکہ ادارے سے دستبرداری کہا جاتا ہے۔

انھوں نے کہا کہ پاکستان میں ہمیشہ ایک ہی سپریم کورٹ ہے لیکن 27ویں آئینی ترمیم نے اس ڈھانچے کو توڑ کر سپریم کورٹ کے اوپر وفاقی آئینی عدالت قائم کردی جو کہ عدالتی اور جمہوری نظام سے متصادم ہیں۔

جسٹس منصور علی شاہ نے اپنے استعفے میں کہا کہ آئینی عدالت بصریت سے نہیں بلکہ سیاسی مفاد کو سامنے رکھتے ہوئے بنائی گئی۔

جسٹس اطہر من اللہ نے صدر مملکت کو بھیجے گئے اپنے استعفے میں کہا ہے کہ ہم پر لوگوں نے اعتماد کیا اور جس آئین کے تحت بطور جج انھوں نے حلف اٹھایا تھا اب وہ اپنی اصل حالت میں نہیں ہے۔

جسٹس منصور علی شاہ اور جسٹس اطہر من اللہ اس 13 رکنی بینچ کا حصہ تھے جنھوں نے مخصوص نشستوں سے متعلق پشاور ہائی کورٹ کا فیصلہ کالعدم قرار دیتے ہوئے فروری 2024 کو ہونے والے عام انتحابات میں مخصوص نشستیں پاکستان تحریک انصاف کو دینے کا فیصلہ کیا تھا تاہم سپریم کورٹ کے اس اکثریتی فیصلے پر عمل درآمد نہیں ہوسکا۔

جسٹس منصور علی شاہ نے استعفے سے دو دن قبل چیف جسٹس کے نام خط میں کیا لکھا تھا؟

پارلیمنٹ میں زیر بحث 27ویں آئینی ترمیم پر جسٹس منصور علی شاہ نے چیف جسٹس کو خط لکھ کر درخواست کی کہ آپ بطور عدلیہ سربراہ فوری انتظامیہ سے رابطہ کریں اور واضح کریں کہ آئینی عدالتوں کے ججز سے مشاورت کے بغیر ترمیم نہیں ہو سکتی۔

انھوں نے لکھا کہ آئینی عدالتوں کے ججز پر مشتمل ایک کنونشن بھی بلایا جا سکتا ہے۔ جسٹس منصور نے لکھا کہ ’آپ اس ادارے کے اینڈمنسٹریٹر نہیں گارڈین بھی ہیں۔‘

انھوں نے خط میں لکھا کہ ’یہ لمحہ آپ سے لیڈرشپ دکھانے کا تقاضا کرتا ہے کیونکہ اس ترمیم پر اعلیٰ عدلیہ سے مشاورت نہیں کی گئی۔

جسٹس منصور نے لکھا کہ ’تمام جمہوری نظاموں میں عدلیہ سے متعلق قانون سازی کے وقت عدلیہ سے مشاورت کی جاتی ہے۔‘

خط میں کہا گیا کہ ’کیا ایک نئی آئینی ترمیم کی جاسکتی ہے جبکہ گذشتہ آئینی ترمیم عدالت میں چیلنج زدہ ہو؟‘

انھوں نے لکھا کہ جب تک 26ویں آئینی ترمیم پر سوالات باقی ہیں، نئی آئینی ترمیم مناسب نہیں۔ جسٹس منصور شاہ کی رائے میں ’وفاقی آئینی عدالت کے قیام کی دلیل نظام انصاف میں زیر التوا مقدمات کو بنایا جا رہا ہے۔‘

جسٹس اطہر من اللہ نے اپنے خط میں کیا مؤقف اختیار کیا تھا؟

جسٹس اطہر من اللہ نے چیف جسٹس یحییٰ افریدی کو خط میں عدلیہ کو لاحق خطرات پر غور کے لیے ایک کانفرنس بلانے کی درخواست کی تھی اور ساتھ ہی اس امر پر افسوس کا اظہار کیا کہ سپریم کورٹ کو بعض اوقات عوام کی رائے دبانے کے لیے ’غیر منتخب اشرافیہ‘ کے ہتھکنڈے کے طور پر استعمال کیا گیا۔

یہ پیش رفت منگل کو اس وقت سامنے آئی ہے جب حکومت 27ویں آئینی ترمیم کے بل کی منظوری کے لیے اقدامات کر رہی تھی۔

جسٹس اطہر من اللہ نے سات صفحات پر مشتمل خط میں لکھا کہ ’یہ خط وہ یہ آئین کے احترام اور ایک سنجیدہ فریضہ کے طور پر لکھ رہے ہیں تاکہ آئندہ نسلوں کے لیے ریکارڈ رہے کہ ان کی تقدیر کس طرح عدالت عظمیٰ کی سنگ مرمر کی دیواروں کے پیچھے طے کی جا رہی ہے‘۔

انھوں نے کہا کہ یہ خط حالیہ واقعات کے پیش نظر لکھا جا رہا ہے جنھوں نے عوام کے عدلیہ پر اعتماد کو شدید نقصان پہنچایا ہے۔

The  Rules  and  Orders  of  the  Lahore  High  Court, extensively  deal  with  the  subject  of  remand.  Keeping  in  view  the  said Rules  and  the  case-law۔  For  the  sake  of  convenience  and  as  a reminder  for  all  the  Magistrates  in  the  province  they  are  reproduced hereunder:

 “(1)    During  first  15  days  the  Magistrate  may  authorize  the  detention  of the  accused  in  judicial  custody  liberally  but  shall  not  authorize  the detention  in  the  custody  of  the  police  except  on  strong  and exceptional grounds  and  that too for  the shortest possible period; 

(2)  The Magistrate shall  record reasons  for  the  grant of remand. 

(3)    The  Magistrate  shall  forward  a  copy  of  his  order  passed  under section 167 Cr.P.C. to the  Sessions Judge  concerned. 

(4)    After  the  expiry  of  15  days  the  Magistrate  shall  require  the  police to  submit  complete  or  incomplete  challan  and,  in  case  the  challan is  not  submitted,  he  shall  refuse  further  detention  of  the  accused and release  him  on bail  with or without  surety. 

(5)    After  the  expiry  of  15  days,  no  remand  shall  be  granted  unless  the application  is  moved  by  the  police  for  the  grant  of remand/adjournment. 

(6)    The  application  moved  by  the  prosecution/police  after  the  expiry of  15  days  of  the  arrest  of  the  accused  shall  be  treated  as  an application for adjournment under  section 344 Cr.P.C. 

(7)    Before  granting  remand  the  Magistrate  shall  ensure  that  evidence sufficient  to  raise  suspicion  that  the  accused  has  committed  the offence  has  been  collected  by  the  police  and  that  further  evidence will  be  obtained after the  remand is  granted. 

(8)    The  Magistrate  shall  not  grant  remand/adjournment  in  the  absence of  the accused. 

(9)    The  Magistrate  should  avoid  giving  remand/  adjournment  at  his residence.

S. 3---Inheritance dispute between legal heirs over immoveable property---Filing of suit---Limitation ---Cause of action, accrual of---Scope---Cause of action would only accrue when a legal heir was denied his/her rights, and it would be from such date that the time would start to run---Burden to establish this would lay on the defendant-legal heirs---However, law of Limitation would be relevant when the conduct of the claimant-legal heir demonstrated acquiescence and particularly when third party interest was created in the inherited property

Constitution of Medical Board---Scope---Petitioner challenged the vires of order passed by Magistrate whereby the direction for Re-examination of injured through second Medical Board was made---Held; there was no point to reconstitute the Medical Board as the injured had already been re-examined by a Medical Board---Declaration of injury by the Medical Board as "possibility of fabrication cannot be ruled out" was not of much significance---First medical examination was protected by statutory presumption of being genuine under Art. 129(e) of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 as well as under Art. 150 of the Constitution---Such formidable statutory protection could not be summarily dismantled on whims of either party of a criminal case---Unless and until very strong grounds were available in a case qua the mala fide attributed to a Medical Officer who had initially examined the injured, no direction could be given for the constitution of Medical Board---Issuing the direction for constitution of Medical Board for second time was alien to the criminal justice system prevailing in the country---Magistrate while passing the impugned order had swayed beyond its realm, as such it was set aside---Constitutional petition was allowed, in circumstances.
  
Medico Legal Certificate--- Presumption--- Scope--- Neither Medico Legal Certificate (MLC) nor the report issued by the Medical Board on Re-examination of the injured is per se admissible in evidence as the same is not protected under S. 510 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and in either case the Medical Officer has to appear before the Trial Court as a witness to verify the contents of the MLC

Islamic law---
----Gift---Hiba-ba-shartul-iwaz---Scope---' Hiba ' with a condition for something in return was called Hiba-ba-shartul-iwaz, in which the donee did not pay the consideration voluntary, but it was paid as a condition precedent for the gift---Gift and 'iwaz' went hand in hand and not one before the other---Payment of consideration was a prior condition (shart) for the gift---Subsequent gift by donee to donor, therefore, was the condition precedent for the first gift and the same (subsequent gift) was not consideration of the first gift---In a Hiba-ba-shartul-iwaz , the original gift was a pure gift at its inception and the payment of 'iwaz' was also an independent gift---Hiba-ba-shartul-iwaz was nothing but a set of two independent gifts in which the second gift was a condition precedent for the first.

----Hiba-ba-shartul-iwaz---Legal incidents of Hiba-ba-shartul-iwaz listed.

i.      In Hiba-bill-iwaz, the consideration is paid by donee voluntarily, whereas in Hiba-ba-Shartul-iwaz, its payment is a condition precedent.

ii.     In Hiba- bil-iwaz the consideration is at the will of donee but in Hiba-ba-shartul- iwaz the value and kinds of consideration is at the discretion of the donor.

iii.    Hiba- bil-Iwaz is not a Hiba; it is either sale or exchange whereas Hiba-ba-shartul-iwaz is treated as Hiba.

iv.    Doctrine of Musha is not applicable to Hiba-billiwaz whereas this doctrine is applicable to Hiba-bashartul-Iwaz.

v.     Since Hiba-bil-iwaz is not gift, it is either sale or exchange, therefore it must be in writing and registered, whereas in Hiba-ba-Shartul-iwaz writing and registration is neither necessary nor sufficient.

vi.    In Hiba- bil-Iwaz, the delivery of possession is not necessary whereas it is necessary in Hiba-ba-Shartul-iwaz.

vii.   The Hiba-bil-Iwaz becomes irrevocable as soon as made, whereas Hiba-ba-Shaatul-iwaz is revocable and becomes irrevocable only after the payment of iwaz by the donee.

QAISAR MEHMOOD vs  State
Evidence---'Adequacy', 'reliability' and 'standard of proof'---No empirical parameters existed to characterize reliability of a particular piece of evidence, either as strong or weak, for the purpose of prosecution of offenders, as the victims seldom fell prey to their tormentors under ideal conditions---Thus, it would be rather naïve to expect choice evidence to meet standard of proof---In a given situation the Court was required to assess integrity of available evidence so as to consider its adequacy in a given situation having regard to the universal principles of safe administration of criminal justice---For the said purpose, direct evidence furnished even by the injured witnesses, apparently with no axe to grind, could be dismissed, if otherwise found lacking the ring of truth; likewise, applying the same principle, the Court may rely upon the evidence of Last seen , without a demur, if found free from any taint, constituting a reliable link between the offender and the victim within the proximity of time and space

(a) Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898)---

----S. 540---Material witness, summoning of---Principle---Court has discretion under first part of S. 540, Cr.P.C. to summon or recall any witness at any stage of the case.

(b) Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898)---

----S. 540---Material witness, summoning of---Duty of Court---Statutory duty has been imposed under second part of S. 540, Cr.P.C. on a Court to summon, examine, recall or re-examine any person if conditions are satisfied to the effect that (a) if evidence is essential and (b) it is essential to the just decision of the case--- Legislature by using word `essential' and by qualifying the word 'decision' by an adjective 'just' in Cr.P.C. has indicated that the powers should be exercised very cautiously and only where Court thinks the evidence to be necessary for the interest of justice.

(c) National Accountability Ordinance (XVIII of 1999)---

----S. 17(c)---Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898), S. 540---Powers of court to take any evidence--­Scope---Interpretation and scope of words "just decision" occurring in S. 540, Cr.P.C.---Provisions of S. 17(c), National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 and S. 540, Cr.P.C., armed the court with powers to take any evidence it likes---Words "just decision" used in S. 540, Cr.P.C., do not necessarily imply that the decision should be either in favour of the prosecution or defence---Principles. [p. 572] B

(d) National Accountability Ordinance (XVIII of 1999)---

----S. 17(c)---Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898), S. 540---Laches, principle of---Applicability---Essential evidence---Petitioner was facing trial before Accountability Court and during recording of evidence of investigating officer, he objected to de-exhibit certain documents---Validity---Discretion conferred on Accountability Court was not to enable one party or the other to fill up the gaps in his case and to improve it by new matter at a later stage but to enable the Court to act in the interest of justice, when it would consider such action necessary---Court could not come to rescue of persons who were not vigilant regarding their rights---High Court declined to give petitioners a remedy where, by their conduct, they had done which could be regarded as equivalent to a waiver---Principle of laches was applicable as the petitioner failed to assail the order within reasonable time--- Constitutional petition was dismissed in circumstances.

[11/14/25, 4:57:42 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: While examining the appellant as accused  under Section 342 Cr.P.C. during trial of the case, it was not put to him that who at the place of recovery, handed over parcels of case property comprising of parcel of sample as well as parcel of remaining case property to whom for taking the same to the police station, who brought the parcel of sample as well as parcel of (naeem)remaining case property from the place of recovery to the police station and to whom, same were handed over at the police station for safe custody; similarly, it has also not been put to the accused under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. that who kept the parcel of sample as well as parcel of remaining case property in safe custody at police station and then, who handed over parcel of sample to whom for transmitting the same to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for the purpose of chemical analysis; therefore, chain of “safe custody” of the “parcel of remaining  case property” as well as of the “parcel of the sample” has not been put to the appellant under Section 342 Cr.P.C. hence same cannot be used against him. It goes without saying that ancient background of Section 342 was a key component of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, which established a formal, systematic criminal justice framework and in order to identify the legal/constitutional requirements of Section 342 Cr.P.

When chain of safe custody of parcel of sample as well as parcel of remaining case property has not been put to the appellant/accused during his examination under Section 342 Cr.P.C., then the same cannot be used against him and when it cannot be used against the appellant/accused then it i.e. said safe custody would be deemed as not proved against the appellant. Now law is also well settled on the point that unbroken chain of safe custody of “allegedly recovered case property and parcel of sample” is to be proved otherwise, conviction is not (naeem)possible and it is rightly so because recovery of narcotics is not a mere corroboratory piece of evidence rather it constitutes the offence itself and entails punishment. 

By now it is also well settled that if safe custody of allegedly recovered substance or parcel of sample/case property has not been proved then, there is no need to discuss other merits of the case and it straightaway leads to the acquittal of the accused.

Though examination of accused under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. is the process between Court and the accused yet it is trite law that act of the Court should prejudice no one; therefore, if during this process, prosecution draws attention of the Court towards some incriminating material which has not been(naeem) put to the accused, Court will examine the same and if considers it necessary, put to the accused through question.

As per preamble of the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (the “Act”) the purpose and object of the law is to regulate the relationship of landlord and tenant and to provide a mechanism for settlement of their disputes in an expeditious and  cost-effective manner. An application for ejectment can be filed in respect of rented premises before the Rent Tribunal established under Section 16 of the “Act” for the said purpose. The jurisdiction of a Rent Tribunal is confined to the matters, arising out from a relationship of tenancy between landlord and tenant. For the said purpose the terms “landlord” and “tenant” become of significance importance. A person seeking eviction of an occupant from the premises is bound to prove that he is a landlord and the person, whose eviction is required is tenant. The term “landlord” is defined in Section 2(d) whereas “tenant” is defined in Section 2(l) of the “Act”.

For proving the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant, it is thus a pre-condition that the person seeking eviction must establish that the occupant has undertaken or bound to pay rent as consideration for the occupation of the premises to him.

[11/19/25, 1:21:33 PM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: وُکلا کے لیے ممنوعات و گزارشات

ایک پیشہ ورانہ اور اخلاقی رہنمائی

وکالت ایک ایسا مقدس پیشہ ہے جو نہ صرف قانون کی تعبیر و تشریح کا ذریعہ ہے بلکہ معاشرے میں عدل، انصاف، اخلاق اور وقار کے قیام کا ستون بھی ہے۔ ایک وکیل کی پہچان صرف اس کی علمیت نہیں ہوتی بلکہ اس کا اخلاق، اس کا طرزِ گفتگو، اس کا رہن سہن اور اس کا برتاؤ معاشرے میں اس کے مقام کو واضح کرتا ہے۔ یہی وجہ ہے کہ چند امور ایسے ہیں جن پر عمل کر کے ہم نہ صرف اپنی عزت اور وقار کو بڑھا سکتے ہیں بلکہ وکالت کے مقدس منصب کو بھی صحیح معنوں میں ادا کرسکتے ہیں۔

ذیل میں وہ نکات پیش کیے جا رہے ہیں جو نوجوان وکلاء کے لیے بطور خاص مشعلِ راہ بن سکتے ہیں۔
پولیس اور سرکاری دفاتر میں یونیفارم کا استعمال

ایک وکیل کا اصل مقام عدالت ہے، نہ کہ سرکاری دفاتر کے چکر۔ ذاتی مسائل کے حل کے لیے پولیس اسٹیشن یا دیگر اداروں میں یونیفارم پہن کر جانا نہ صرف معیوب ہے بلکہ اکثر پشیمانی کا سبب بھی بنتا ہے۔ وکیل کو ایسا تاثر دینا چاہیے کہ وہ قانونی راستے کا انتخاب کرتا ہے، نہ کہ اثر و رسوخ کا۔
عدالتی فیصلے کے خلاف بحث و تکرار سے اجتناب

عدالت سے فیصلہ خلاف آنے کے بعد جج کے ساتھ تکرار کر کے نہ کبھی قانون بدلا ہے اور نہ فیصلہ۔ یہ غیر پیشہ ورانہ رویہ وکیل کے وقار کو گھٹا دیتا ہے۔ بہترین راستہ یہ ہے کہ قانونی طریقے سے اگلے فورم پر رجوع کیا جائے۔

دوست ججوں کو آزمائش میں نہ ڈالیں

وکالت ایک ذمہ داری ہے اور عدلیہ ایک منصب۔ پیچیدہ مقدمات دوست ججوں کے سامنے رکھ کر نہ صرف خود کو بلکہ انہیں بھی غیر ضروری دباؤ میں ڈالنا مناسب نہیں۔ پیشہ ورانہ دیانت کا تقاضا ہے کہ ہر کیس کو میرٹ پر متعلقہ عدالت میں چلایا جائے۔
خواتین ججز اور عزتِ نسواں کا احترام

خواتین ججز سے گفتگو میں شائستگی اور وقار ضروری ہے۔ زبان کی نزاکت سے پہلے ذہن میں اپنی بہن یا بیٹی کا تصور لے آئیں تو ہر جملہ خودبہ‌خود مہذب ہو جاتا ہے۔

عدالتی عملے کا احترام

عدالتی یا حفاظتی عملہ کبھی غلطی کر بھی دے تو درگزر بہتر ہے۔ احترام کے بدلے میں عزت اور سہولت دونوں ملتی ہیں۔ ایک باوقار وکیل کا انداز گفتگو بھی باوقار ہونا چاہیے۔

اپنے ذاتی کیس میں خود پیش نہ ہونا

اپنے معاملات میں جذبات حائل ہو جاتے ہیں۔ اس لیے بہتر ہے کہ اپنی بار اور منتخب نمائندوں کی مدد سے مسئلہ حل کروایا جائے۔ وکیل کا اصل کام دوسروں کے لیے لڑنا ہے، اپنا مقدمہ خود لڑنا سمجھداری نہیں۔

فیس لے کر مقدمہ ’’ذاتی‘‘ مسئلہ بنا دینا

کلائنٹ سے فیس لینا پیشہ ہے، مگر مقدمے کو ’’میرا ذاتی مسئلہ‘‘ ظاہر کر کے خصوصی رعایت لینا غیر اخلاقی عمل ہے۔ یہ رویہ نہ صرف دیگر وکلاء کی حق تلفی کرتا ہے بلکہ پورے پیشے کے وقار کو بھی متاثر کرتا ہے۔

ایڈووکیٹ نمبر پلیٹس کا غلط استعمال

آج کل بائک، رکشوں، ٹریکٹر ٹرالیوں، حتیٰ کہ مال بردار گاڑیوں پر بھی "Advocate" لکھوانے کا بے جا رواج بڑھ رہا ہے۔ یہ چیز معاشرے میں ہمارے مقام کو بلند نہیں بلکہ مشکوک بناتی ہے۔ وکیل کا رعب اس کے کردار اور علم میں ہونا چاہیے، نمبر پلیٹ میں نہیں۔

جھگڑا، گالم گلوچ اور ٹریفک خلاف ورزی—خصوصاً یونیفارم میں

وکیل معاشرے کا مہذب طبقہ سمجھا جاتا ہے۔ سڑکوں پر لڑائی جھگڑا، گالم گلوچ یا قانون شکنی، خاص طور پر یونیفارم میں، نہایت معیوب عمل ہے۔ وکیل کا پہلا فرض قانون کی پابندی ہے۔

سماجی مقامات پر یونیفارم

پارک، سینما، تھیٹر اور عوامی تفریح گاہوں میں وکالتی لباس پہن کر جانا مناسب نہیں۔ ایسے مقامات پر عام شہری کی طرح سادہ لباس بہتر ہے۔
سیاستدانوں کا غیر ضروری پروٹوکول

عدالت میں سیاستدانوں کے پیچھے بھاگنا یا ان کو غیر ضروری پروٹوکول دینا وکیل کی پیشہ ورانہ ساکھ کو متاثر کرتا ہے۔ وکیل کو چاہیے کہ اپنی خدمات پیشہ ورانہ دائرے میں رہ کر فراہم کرے۔ سیاست کا اظہار عدالت کے باہر بھی کیا جا سکتا ہے۔

دلائل کے دوران شائستگی اور وقار

دوسرے وکیل پر ذاتی حملے یا بدکلامی سے نہ دلیل مضبوط ہوتی ہے نہ کیس۔ باہمی احترام و وقار سے دلائل دینا ہی اصل پیشہ ورانہ مہارت ہے۔

سیاست کی وجہ سے ذاتی تعلقات خراب نہ کریں

بار کے انتخابات اور سیاسی سرگرمیاں معمول کا حصہ ہیں، مگر انہیں ذاتی دشمنی میں بدلنا دانشمندی نہیں۔ ایک سمجھدار وکیل ہر اختلاف کے باوجود تعلقات کو برقرار رکھتا ہے۔

ذاتی معاملات میں نرمی اور مصالحت

اگر کوئی فریق جھک جائے تو معاملہ نرمی سے نمٹانا بہتر ہے۔ طاقت اور اختیار کا غلط استعمال دشمنیاں پیدا کرتا ہے، اور دشمنی پیشے کی توجہ اور امن چھین لیتی ہے۔

فیس کا شفاف اور اصولی نظام

فیس ایک مرتبہ طے کر کے لی جائے۔ ہر پیشی پر بلاوجہ اضافی چارجز لگانا، منشی کے ذریعے پیسے نکلوانا، یا غیر ضروری بہانے بنانا—یہ سب بدنامی اور بے برکتی کا سبب بنتا ہے۔
اختتامیہ

وکالت صرف پیشہ نہیں، اخلاق، کردار اور خدمتِ خلق کا نام ہے۔ اگر ہم اپنی ذمہ داری اور اس منصب کے تقدس کو سمجھ لیں تو نہ صرف ہماری ذاتی زندگی سنور سکتی ہے بلکہ پورے معاشرے میں وکلا کا وقار بھی بلند ہو سکتا ہے۔

اللہ تعالیٰ ہمیں اچھا وکیل، اچھا انسان اور بہترین مسلمان بننے کی توفیق عطا فرمائے۔ آمین۔

[11/19/25, 2:52:27 PM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: پاکستان میں نکاح اور ولی کی اجازت  عدالتی اور فقہی جائزہ

تمہید

نکاح ایک اسلامی شریعت کے مطابق اور قانونی لحاظ سے اہم بندھن ہے۔ بعض معاشرتی اور مذہبی روایات یہ خیال دیتی ہیں کہ نکاح کے لیے ولی (پورے یا والدین) کی اجازت ضروری شرط ہے۔ لیکن پاکستان میں عدالتی اور فقہی رویّے نے اس خیال کو چیلنج کیا ہے۔ یہاں ہم عدالتی فیصلوں اور فقہی اصولوں کے تناظر میں یہ بحث کریں گے کہ آیا ایک بالغ عورت نکاح کر سکتی ہے ولی کی اجازت کے بغیر اور نکاح باطل ہوگا یا نہیں۔

فقہی اور قانونی اصول

1. فقہی اصول (حَنفی مکتب)

حنفی فقہ میں یہ موقف ہے کہ ایک بالغ، عاقل عورت اپنے نکاح پر آزاد ہے اور ولی کی اجازت اس کی صحتِ نکاح کی شرط نہیں ہے۔

یعنی، ولی کی رضامندی اگر نہ ہو تو بھی نکاح “صحت مند” (valid) ہو سکتا ہے۔



2. قانونی اصول (پاکستان)

پاکستان میں Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (1961) اور عدالتی رویہ اکثر حنفی فقہ کی روشنی میں آیا ہے۔

ایک واضح اور اہم سنگِ میل فیصلہ PLD 2004 Supreme Court 219 ہے، جہاں عدالت نے یہ اصول بتایا کہ:

> "ایک بالغ عورت اپنی آزاد مرضی سے نکاح کر سکتی ہے اور ولی کی اجازت نہ ہونا نکاح کو باطل نہیں کرتی"۔ 



اس فیصلے میں عدالت نے اس بات کو تسلیم کیا کہ قانونی اور شریعی دونوں نقطے نظر سے، ولی کی اجازت کی عدم موجودگی نکاح کی صحت پر اثر انداز نہیں ہوتی۔ 

عدالتی تجزیہ میں یہ بھی آیا ہے کہ سٹیٹ کو ذمہ داری دی گئی ہے کہ وہ خواتین کو ان کی شادی کے انتخاب میں ذاتی خودمختاری فراہم کرے اور ان کو غیر قانونی فشار یا “عزت کے نام پر” کنٹرول سے بچائے۔ 
حالیہ عدالتی رویّہ اور فیصلے

حال ہی میں، سپریم کورٹ آف پاکستان نے گھریلو تشدد اور خلع (khula) کے ایک کیس میں فیصلہ دیا ہے، جس میں جسٹس عائشہ ملک نے تحریری رائے دی ہے۔ 

فیصلے میں کہا گیا ہے کہ “عورت کی مرضی کے بغیر عدالت خلع نہیں دے سکتی”۔ 

عدالت نے یہ واضح کیا ہے کہ ازدواجی زندگی میں نفسیاتی اور جذباتی اذیت جسمانی تشدد جیسی سنگینی کی حامل ہو سکتی ہے، اور یہ بھی “ظلم” کا حصہ ہے۔ 

اس فیصلے میں، عدالت نے مرد کی دوسری شادی (بغیر پہلی بیوی کی اجازت کے) کو نکاح ختم کرنے (تنسیخِ نکاح) کی جائز بنیاد قرار دی ہے۔ 


اس فیصلے کے بعد اسلامی نظریاتی کونسل نے بھی ردعمل دیا ہے، اور کہا ہے کہ کچھ عدالتی فیصلے شرعی اصولوں کے خلاف ہو سکتے ہیں۔ 

ایک قانون و شریعت پر مبنی مطالعہ اس بات کی طرف اشارہ کرتا ہے کہ پاکستانی عدالتیں حنفی فقہی نظریے کو ترجیح دیتی آئی ہیں جب نکاح میں ولی کی اجازت کی بحث آتی ہے۔ 

تجزیہ اور نتیجہ
سپریم کورٹ کا فیصلہ (PLD 2004 SC 219) ایک بنیادی حوالہ ہے، جو یہ واضح کرتا ہے کہ قانونی اور شرعی دونوں نقطہ نظر سے، ولی کی اجازت نکاح کی صحت کی شرط نہیں ہے۔

جدید عدالتی رویّے، خاص طور پر خلع اور ازدواجی حقوق کے معاملات میں، زیادہ عورت دوست اور خودمختاری کو تسلیم کرنے والے ہیں، جیسا کہ حالیہ فیصلے میں نظر آیا ہے۔

شریعی اور قانونی بحث میں یہ مضبوط موقف بنتا ہے کہ صرف زوجین کی رضامندی (consent) نکاح کی سب سے بنیادی شرط ہے۔

اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ معاشرتی یا مذہبی روایات کے تحت “ولی کی اجازت لازمی” کہنا ضروری نہیں، خاص طور پر جب بات اسلامی فقہ (حنفی) اور پاکستانی فیملی قانون کی ہو۔

تاہم، یہ بھی ضروری ہے کہ نکاح کرنے والی اور نکاح قبول کرنے والی دونوں فریقین عدالتی اور شریعی مشورہ لیں، تاکہ ان کے حقوق واضح اور محفوظ ہوں۔

[11/19/25, 9:11:58 PM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: سندھ ہائی کورٹ بار کے وکلاء کے لیے مہران ہوٹل میں خصوصی رعایت

صدر سندھ ہائی کورٹ بار، بیرسٹر سرفراز علی میتلو کی مستقل کوششوں اور قانونی کمیونٹی کے ساتھ مضبوط روابط کے نتیجے میں مہران ہوٹل نے سندھ ہائی کورٹ بار کے تمام وکلاء کے لیے 50 فیصد رعایت کا اعلان کیا ہے۔

اس خوش آئند اقدام کی باقاعدہ توثیق کے لیے صدر بار سرفراز میتلو اور جنرل منیجر مہران ہوٹل، یاسر احمد نے موافقت نامہ (MOU) پر دستخط کیے۔ اس MOU کے تحت وکلاء ہوٹل کی خدمات پر نمایاں رعایت حاصل کر سکیں گے، جو کہ صرف سندھ ہائی کورٹ بار کے ممبرز کے لیے مخصوص ہے۔

یہ اقدام وکلاء کی سہولت اور کمیونٹی کے لیے تعاون کی مثال ہے، جو قانونی پیشہ ورانہ خدمات کے ساتھ ساتھ ان کے روزمرہ کے معیار زندگی میں بھی بہتری لانے کا سبب بنے گا۔

واضح رہے کہ یہ رعایت پورے پاکستان کے وکلاء کے لیے نہیں بلکہ صرف سندھ ہائی کورٹ بار کے ممبرز کے لیے مخصوص ہے۔

[11/19/25, 10:10:33 PM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: عدالتی حوالے کے ساتھ
محترم ممبران،
عمومی طور پر، اپیلیٹ عدالت میں نئے یا جوابی ثبوت پیش کرنے کی اجازت نہیں ہوتی۔ اپیل کا بنیادی مقصد یہ جانچنا ہوتا ہے کہ آیا نیچی عدالت میں کوئی قانونی یا طریقہ کار کی خلاف ورزی ہوئی ہے۔ اپیل عدالت عموماً صرف وہی ثبوت دیکھتی ہے جو پہلے سے نیچی عدالت میں پیش کیے گئے ہوں۔

تاہم، بعض استثنائی حالات میں نئے یا جوابی ثبوت کی اجازت دی جا سکتی ہے، جیسا کہ:

1. اہم اور نیا ثبوت جو کسی جائز وجہ سے پہلے عدالت میں پیش نہیں کیا جا سکا۔


2. ایسا ثبوت جو فیصلے پر اثرانداز ہو سکتا ہو۔


3. اپیلیٹ عدالت سے اجازت حاصل کرنے کے بعد، لیکن یہ اجازت صرف غیر معمولی حالات میں دی جاتی ہے۔
عدالتی حوالے:

سپریم کورٹ آف پاکستان، معاملہ: Muhammad Rafique v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1985 SC 362) میں عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ اپیل عدالت بنیادی طور پر قانونی اور طریقہ کار کی جانچ کرتی ہے، نہ کہ نئے ثبوت کی سماعت۔

ہائی کورٹ کے فیصلے، مثال: Messrs. Fecto Cement Ltd. v. Collector of Customs (1999 CLC 1382) میں بھی عدالت نے کہا کہ نئے ثبوت صرف استثنائی اور معقول وجوہات کی بنیاد پر اپیل میں منظور کیے جا سکتے ہیں۔


لہٰذا، جوابی ثبوت پیش کرنے کی درخواست میں واضح طور پر یہ بتانا ضروری ہے کہ یہ ثبوت کس طرح کیس کے فیصلے کو متاثر کر سکتا ہے اور اسے پہلے کیوں پیش نہیں کیا جا سکا۔

[11/21/25, 4:53:20 PM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: . . . . . . . .   وُکلا کے لیے ❌ممنوعات و ✅ گذارشات. . . 

نوجوان وکلاء ایک بار ضرور پڑھ لیں

اپنی ناقص عقل اور حقیر تجربے کی بنا پر کُچھ امُور شیئر کر رہا ہُِوں جن کے متعلق میری رائے ہے کہ یہ ایسے افعال ہیں جو وُکلا کی اِنفرادی اور اجتماعی عزت اور وقار میں اضافے کا ہرگز باعث نہیں بنتے بلکہ بہت سارے مسائل کو جنم دینے کے ساتھ ساتھ ہماری عزتِ نفس،رِزق اور معاشرتی مقام میں کمی کا باعث بنتے ہیں

1. وکیل کو کسی صورت پولس اسٹیشن یا کسی بھی سرکاری دفتر یونیفارم میں نہیں جانا چاہیے۔ ہم عام لوگوں کے ان محکمہ جات سے متعلق تمام مسائل عدالتوں کے ذریعہ حل کرواتے ہیں اور خُود اپنا مسئلہ حل کرنے کے لئے ذاتی طور پر اُن لوگوں کے پاس جا  کر پچھتاوے کا شکار ہوتے ہیں اور بلآخر بعد از خرابی بسیار انہیں عدالتوں کا دروازہ کھٹکھٹاتے ہیں۔

2- عدالت کی جانب سے اپنے خلاف فیصلہ آنے کی صُورت میں دُوبارہ سے اُسی جج کے ساتھ بحث و مباحثہ بے فائدہ امر اور عدالت کے ذہن میں اپنا منفی تاثر پیدا کرنے والی بات ہے ۔خُوش دِلی سے اگلے فورم پر جا کر طبع آزمائی زیادہ موثر اور پیشہ ورانہ عمل ہے.

3۔ پیچیدہ اور مُشکل کیسز اپنے جاننے والے ججز کی عدالتوں میں لگوا کر خُود اور اُنہیں آزمائش میں ڈالنے سے پرہیز کریں کسی دوست کی عدالت میں داخل ہوتے ہی جج کے چھ کی بجائے بارہ سینسرز الرٹ ہو جاتے ہیں مبادا کہ میرا سودا ہی نہ کر آیا ہو۔

4- خواتین ججز کے ساتھ مکالمہ کرتے ہوئے یا ذومعنی جملے اُچھالتے ہوئے ایک لمحے کے لیے اپنے دِل و دماغ میں اپنی عفت مآب بہنوں یا بیٹیوں کا تصور ضرور لے آیا جائے۔

5- عدالتی و حفاظتی عملے کی دانستہ و غیر دانستہ کوتاہیوں سے صرفِ نظر اور محبت و احترام کا برتاؤ نیکی اور بھلائی کے ساتھ ساتھ آپ کی شخصیت  و وکالت کی بہترین مارکیٹنگ بھی ہے۔

6- اپنے ذاتی معاملات میں خُود ہرگز ہرگز عدالت میں پیش نہ ہوں اپنی منتخب کابینہ کو ہر جمہوری ہتھکنڈا استعمال کرتے ہوئے اپنا مسئلہ حل کروائیں جذباتی ہونے کی صُورت میں ایک مسئلہ دیگر بے شمار مسائل کو جنم دینے کا باعث بنتا ہے۔

7- فیس وصول کرکے کسی مسئلے کو وکیل کا ذاتی مسئلہ بتلا کر ریلیف حاصل کرنے کی کوشش درحقیقت اصل حقداروں اور مسائل زدہ وکلاء کے ساتھ نا انصافی ہے جس سے ہر صورت احتراز کیا جانا چاہیے۔

8- ایڈووکیٹ کی رنگارنگ نمبر پلیٹس ذاتی کاروں سے ہوتی ہوئی بسوں ،ٹرکوں،رکشوں ، مال بردار گاڑیوں، مُرغیاں لانے والے ڈالوں حتٰی کہ ٹریکٹر ٹرالیوں تک پہ نصب کی جا چکی ہیں جو کہ معاشرے میں ہمارے مقام و مرتبے پر سوالیہ نشان کھڑے کر رہی ہیں۔

9- لڑائی جھگڑے ، گالم گلوچ اور ٹریفک اشاروں کی خلاف ورزی ویسے تو کسی صورت بھی نہیں کی جانی چاہیے لیکن یونیفارم میں ان مکروہات سے بدرجہ اتم بچنا چاہیے۔

10- پارکس سینما ہالز اور تھیٹرز میں یونیفارم پہن کر جانا خاصا معیوب لگتا ہے البتہ ریسٹورنٹس کے لئے تھوڑی آزادی لی جا سکتی ہے۔

11۔ مُختلف سیاسی پارٹیوں سے نظریاتی وابستگی کے باوجود احاطہ ھائے عدالت میں اُن سیاستدانوں کو غیرضرُوری پروٹوکول اور آگے پیچھے بھاگ کر ہم نہ ذاتی طور پر اور نہ برادری کے لیے کوئی نیک نامی کماتے ہیں اس سے بھی حتی الامکان گریز کیا جانا چاہئے ۔پیشہ وارانہ انداز میں اُن کی صرف وکالت کی جائے۔
پرائیویٹ لباس میں بیشک ہم اُنہیں اپنے کندھوں پر اُٹھا کر نعرے لگائیں یا بھنگڑے ڈالیں۔

12- دورانِ دلائل ایک دُوسرے کے اُوپر ذاتی حملے اور بد کلامی  سے ہر صورت بچنا چاہیے باہمی احترام اور حفظ مراتب کا خیال ہمارے رزق اور عِزت میں کمی کبھی نہیں کرے گا۔

13- سیاسی رہنما مُلکی سطح کے ہوں یا بار کی سطح کے ان کی وجہ سے اپنی ذاتی دوستیاں تعلق اور احترام و محبت کے رشتے ہرگز خراب نہ کریں۔ ہمارے تو ویسے بھی سال میں چار الیکشنز ہوتے ہیں اگر کسی ایک الیکشن میں مدِمُقابل بھی آ جائیں تو بُرا نہیں ماننا چاہیے۔

14- ذاتی معاملات میں جب کوئی پرائیویٹ فریق معاملہ ہماری برتری تسلیم کرتے ہوئے جُھک جائے تو مارنے سے ڈرایا  بہتر کے مقُولے پر عمل کرتے ہوئے معاملہ نمٹانا چاہیے نہ کہ طاقت،اختیار اور غلبے کے زعم میں مخالف کو اِس قدر زچ کیا جائے کہ وہ اپنی اور ہماری زندگیوں یا سُکون ہی کے درپے ہو جائے۔

 15- یونیفارم میں سوٹڈ بُوٹڈ ہوکر اور ٹائی لگائے ہوئے سڑک کنارے لگی ہوئی ریڑھیوں سے کھڑے ہو کر کھانے سے بچنا چاہیے۔

16- کلائنٹ سے یک مُشت مناسب فیس لی جائے اور ہر پیشی  پر بِلا وجہ بُلوا کر، ایشوز فریم، یا پر کلومیٹر سمن فیس، جیسے حیلوں سے مزید پیسے نکلوانے اور رہی سہی کسر مُنشی کے ذریعے نکالنے سے اِجتناب مزید ثمر آور کیسز کی آمد کا باعث بنتا ہے۔
" اللہ ہمیں اچھے وکیل کے ساتھ ساتھ اچھا اِنسان اور بہترین مُسلمان بننے کی بھی توفیق عطا فرمائے" آمین۔

مسلم پرسنل لاء کے تحت سنِ بلوغت پندرہ برس کی عمر میں فرض کی جاتی ہے، اور جب کوئی مسلمان لڑکی بلوغت کو پہنچ جائے تو اُسے بالغ اور اپنے حقوق کی مالک (sui juris) تصور کیا جاتا ہے، جو سرپرست کی اجازت کے بغیر نکاح کرنے کی اہل ہوتی ہے۔

جہاں پر کوئی قانونی ضابطہ (Statutory Law) کسی ایسے عمل کو جرم قرار دیتا ہو جو شریعت کے مطابق درست ہو، اور جب وہ ضابطہ واضح طور پر ایسے نکاح کو باطل قرار نہ دے، تو ایسے معاملات میں شریعت کی اصولی حیثیت کو فوقیت دی جائے گی، خصوصاً اُن ذاتی معاملات (Personal Law) میں جن کی حفاظت آئین کے آرٹیکل 227 اور نفاذِ شریعت ایکٹ 1991 کے تحت کی گئی ہے۔

جب کسی قانون میں ابہام موجود ہو تو نفاذِ شریعت ایکٹ، 1991 کی دفعات 3 اور 4 کی روشنی میں اسلامی اصول، فقہی قواعد اور شرعی ماخذات سے رہنمائی حاصل کی جاسکتی ہے تاکہ نکاح کی قانونی حیثیت کے تعیّن میں مدد مل سکے۔

کیس میں مبینہ حبس شدہ لڑکی بلوغت کو پہنچ چکی تھی اور اس نے رضامندی اور اپنی آزاد مرضی سے نکاح کیا ہوا محسوس ہوتا تھا، لہٰذا اسے حق حاصل ہے کہ وہ اپنی پسند کے مطابق درخواست گزار کے ساتھ رہائش اختیار کرے۔

ان حالات میں یہ درخواست نمٹا دی گئی۔

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ "چائلڈ میریج ریسٹرینٹ ایکٹ" ان کے نکاح کو باطل قرار نہیں دیتا، بلکہ اس میں ایسے نکاح میں معاونت یا اس کو فروغ دینے والوں کے لیے سزا رکھی گئی ہے۔

اس بنا پر فریقین کے درمیان کیا گیا نکاح نہ تو اسلامی احکامات کے منافی ہے اور نہ کسی قانونی ضابطے کی خلاف ورزی۔

> “Absence of a formal exhibit marking does not mean the document cannot be considered as evidence.”
– Para 9, 2025 SCLR 24

(B) COURTS MUST FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE, NOT TECHNICALITY

> “Substantial compliance is sufficient… technical faults should not defeat justice.”

(C) Technical objections must be raised at the time of evidence, not later

This exactly applies to your case:

(D) Once evidence is played and admitted on record, it is valid even if not formally exhibited

2025 LHC 6045
Justice Malik Javed Iqbal Vains

مندرجہ بالا تمام بحث کی روشنی میں یہ واضح ہے کہ کمشنر اِن لینڈ ریونیو، جو کہ ایک فیلڈ فارمیشن افسر ہے، کو نہ تو قانونی اختیار حاصل ہے اور نہ ہی اسے یہ حق (locus standi) پہنچتا ہے کہ وہ معزز سنگل جج کے فیصلے کو چیلنج کرے، خصوصاً ایسی صورت میں جب معاملہ اس SRO کی آئینی/قانونی حیثیت (vires) سے متعلق ہو جو ریونیو ڈویژن کے اختیار سے جاری کیا گیا ہو۔
کمشنر کے اختیارات صرف انہی امور تک محدود ہیں جو انہیں انکم ٹیکس آرڈیننس 2001 کے تحت واضح طور پر تفویض کیے گئے ہیں، اور ان کا دائرہ اختیار مالیاتی پالیسی سے متعلق معاملات یا متعلقہ حکام کی طرف سے جاری کردہ SRO کے دفاع تک نہیں بڑھتا۔
چونکہ اپیل کا حق خالصتاً قانونی تخلیق ہے، اس لیے اسے صرف وہی شخص یا ادارہ استعمال کر سکتا ہے جسے قانون کے ذریعے باقاعدہ اختیار دیا گیا ہو۔
مکمل قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ
 (Analytical Legal Review)
Commissioner Inland Revenue vs. Ms. Hunza Sugar Mills 
(2025 LHC 6045)
Justice Malik Javed Iqbal Vains

1—بنیادی قانونی سوال (Core Legal Issue)
کیا Commissioner Inland Revenue کو یہ قانونی اختیار حاصل تھا کہ وہ ایک ایسی عدالتی ریٹ کے فیصلے کے خلاف اپیل کرے جس میں ریونیو ڈویژن کے جاری کردہ SRO کی vires (قانونی حیثیت / آئینی جواز) کو چیلنج کیا گیا ہو؟

عدالت کا جواب: نہیں۔ کمشنر کو بالکل اختیار نہیں۔

2—قانونی اصول: اپیل کا حق صرف قانون سے پیدا ہوتا ہے
عدالت نے بنیادی اصول دہرایا:

"Right of appeal is a creation of statute."
یعنی
کوئی بھی ادارہ یا افسر اپنی مرضی سے اپیل نہیں کر سکتا۔
جب تک کوئی دفعہ (Section) واضح طور پر اختیار نہ دے۔

3—Commissioner Inland Revenue کے اختیارات (Bear Act کے الفاظ کے مطابق)
(A) انکم ٹیکس آرڈیننس 2001 کے تحت کمشنر کے اختیارات
Section 4 – Appellate hierarchy
قانون میں پورا appellate structure دیا گیا ہے— مگر اس میں Commissioner کا High Court میں اپیل کرنا شامل نہیں۔

Section 30 – Board and its powers
یہ سیکشن Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) کے اختیارات بتاتا ہے۔
یہاں سے ثابت ہوتا ہے کہ پالیسی، SRO، ریگولیشن، Notifications — یہ سب Board/Division کے اختیارات ہیں، فیلڈ آفیسر کے نہیں۔

Section 33 – Functions of the Commissioner
یہ دفعہ کہتی ہے کہ کمشنر کی ذمہ داریاں assessment، enforcement، monitoring، audit تک محدود ہیں۔
کوئی دفعہ اسے SRO defend کرنے یا اپیل کرنے کا اختیار نہیں دیتی۔

Section 134 – Appeal to the Appellate Tribunal
یہ سیکشن ٹیکس دہندہ اور کمشنر (Appeals) کے دائرہ کار کا بتاتا ہے—
High Court میں اپیل کرنے کا اختیار Commissioner Inland Revenue کو نہیں دیتا۔

Section 136 – Reference to High Court
Reference صرف Appellate Tribunal کر سکتا ہے یا متاثرہ فریق (assessee)،
لیکن Commissioner Inland Revenue نہیں۔

اس لیے
Commissioner Inland Revenue کے اختیارات صرف آرڈیننس کے اندر دیے گئے انتظامی (administrative) کاموں تک محدود ہیں، پالیسی یا SRO کے معاملات تک نہیں بڑھتے۔

4—SRO جاری کرنے کا اختیار (Bear Act کے مطابق)
Federal Board of Revenue Act, 2007
اور

Rules of Business, 1973
ان کے مطابق

Revenue Division / FBR کو اختیار ہے:
ٹیکس پالیسی

SROs / Notifications

Exemptions

Procedures

Rules

یعنی SRO ریونیو ڈویژن کا عمل ہے، فیلڈ کمشنر کو اس میں کوئی اختیار حاصل نہیں۔

کمشنر کا SRO کے خلاف اپیل کرنا گویا پالیسی کو چیلنج کرنا ہے
جو اس کی ڈومین میں نہیں۔

5—Locus Standi (قانونی حیثیت) کیوں نہیں؟
عدالت نے کہا:

(i) کمشنر SRO کا "aggrieved person" نہیں ہے
کیونکہ SRO اس کا اختیار تبدیل نہیں کرتا،
اور نہ اس کا کوئی حق مجروح ہوا ہے۔

(ii) کمشنر SRO defend نہیں کر سکتا کیونکہ یہ اس نے جاری نہیں کیا
(iii) کمشنر پالیسی معاملات میں مداخلت نہیں کر سکتا
پالیسی صرف:

Federal Government

FBR

Revenue Division

کا کام ہے۔

6—Judiciary کی Reasoning (High Court Analytical Approach)
عدالت نے تین قانونی بنیادیں استعمال کیں:

(1) Doctrine of Statutory Competence
کوئی کام تب تک جائز نہیں جب تک قانون اجازت دے۔
Commissioner کے پاس ایسی اجازت نہیں۔

(2) Doctrine of Locus Standi
ریٹ اپیل صرف وہ فریق کر سکتا ہے جس کا حق سلب ہوا ہو یا جسے قانون نے باقاعدہ اجازت دی ہو۔

کمشنر
 SRO جاری کرنے والا ادارہ نہیں
 قانونی طور پر aggrieved نہیں
 fiscal policy کا stakeholder نہیں

Hence no locus standi۔

(3) Doctrine of Separation of Powers (Administrative vs Policy)
فیلڈ افسر صرف “administration of tax law” کرتا ہے،
پالیسی/قانون سازی نہیں۔

7—Case Law Principles (پاکستانی نظائر)
PLD 2021 SC – Right of Appeal must be expressly provided

2020 PTD – Field Officer cannot challenge SRO policy

LHC Judgments – “Only the issuing authority can defend its notification.”

FBR vs Millat Tractors – Commissioner has no locus in policy matters.

یہ تمام اصول اس فیصلے میں reinforce کیے گئے۔

8—عدالت کا نتیجہ (Conclusion of Judgment)
1—Commissioner a field officer ہے، policymaker نہیں۔
2—اس کے پاس SRO defend کرنے یا challenge کرنے کا اختیار نہیں۔
3—High Court appeal/Reference کے لیے اس کے پاس statutory backing نہیں۔
4—Right of appeal صرف اسی کو مل سکتا ہے جسے قانون اجازت دے۔
لہٰذا اپیل ناقابلِ سماعت (not maintainable) قرار پائی۔

Held that admission of the respondent/plaintiff that the petitioner had transferred the dower property through sale mutation is a slip of tongue is untenable inasmuch as cross-examination is a process through which truth is elicited and contradictions are tested, therefore, admission made therein cannot be termed as an inadvertent or mistaken utterance otherwise the purpose of cross-examination will become meaningless.

Very interesting Judgement.

Offence under section 489-F and 406 of PPC could be charged simultaneously.


When amount is received by a person into his bank account mistakenly or due to some error in the system of bank, normally it shall not be considered to be an entrustment within the meaning of Section 405 of PPC. Entrustment requires a deliberate act of placing confidence in another person to hold or use property for a specific purpose, which then must be followed by misappropriation or conversion by that person. Normally such like episode shall not fulfill the essential ingredients of Section 405 of PPC because the amount is not given by a person for safe keeping and specific fiduciary purpose, unless there is further evidence of dishonest intention to misappropriate the funds received by mistake.  

In the case in hand amount received by petitioner was not meant to be utilized by him, but it was to be retained and preserved by him for return back to the bank, who was owner of the amount/fund. Petitioner was supposed and required to inform the sender/bank regarding the error and make arrangements for its return to the owner/bank. 

 The words “in any manner” used in Section 405 of PPC is of wider import. It extends to and covers all kinds of entrustment. It may be expressed or implied. When the amount/fund came into the account of petitioner, he acquired control and domain over the property and no other person could have access thereto. Said fact was carrying with it the implication that the bank shall continue to be its owner and he was legally as well as morally bound to return the same to its owner/bank, but petitioner put the funds/amount to his own use dishonestly. He caused wrongful gain to himself and wrongful loss to the bank.

Meaning and scope of the phrase “hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal” has been explained by August Supreme Court in Shakeel Shah’s case, holding that the above words  denotes a person, who is likely to seriously injure and hurt others without caring for the consequences for his violent act and can pose a serious threat to the society if set free on bail, such tentative opinion as to the character of the accused is to be formed by the Court upon careful examination of the facts and circumstances of the case. The Court may also refer to the previous criminal record of accused, if available for forming such opinion. The very gravity and severity of the offence alleged against the accused and mode and manner adopted by the accused for the commission of same may also be taken into consideration for that purpose.

VVVI. MUST READ JUDGEMENT.
Quantum and continuity of maintenance for a child following the dissolution of marriage between the parents.

Under the Islamic jurisprudence1, as well as the settled case law  in Pakistan, the father bears a solemn and continuous obligation to provide maintenance for his offspring. This duty, grounded not merely in financial capacity but in the principle of nasab (lineage), persists until the son attains the age of puberty, and in the case of a daughter, until her marriage. Where a son, upon reaching majority, is found to be incapacitated or otherwise unable to earn due to physical or mental limitations, the father remains bound to maintain him. It must be stressed that the obligation to maintain a child is distinct and independent from the obligation to maintain a wife. The latter ceases upon the termination of the marital bond, whereas the former survives the marriage itself and is directly tied to the immutable bond of paternity. However, it has been observed that in certain cases, fathers, upon the dissolution of marriage or after losing custody, become hesitant to discharge their obligation of maintenance, viewing it as contingent upon matrimonial cohabitation or custodial rights. Such a perception is legally flawed and ethically untenable in light of Islamic principles, as the father’s obligation is not lessened by the child being in the hizanat (custody) of the mother. 

The determination of the appropriate quantum of maintenance involves two principal considerations: 

(i) the nature and extent of the child’s reasonable requirements and 

(ii) the father’s financial means. 

Maintenance traditionally includes food, raiment, and lodging. However, this list is not exhaustive. Given evolving societal standards and the overarching principle of welfare of the minor, the term must be interpreted broadly to encompass all reasonable expenses necessary for the physical, mental, and emotional development of the child. This includes, interalia, educational costs, healthcare, and other needs consistent with the natural growth and comfort of the minor. The amount awarded should reflect the family's social status, ensuring that the child is not deprived of opportunities for development and well-being solely due to the dissolution of the marriage. The second consideration pertains to the father’s financial capacity to maintain the child. Under Islamic principles, the obligation of maintenance is generally subject to certain conditions. Firstly, the child must be in need. If the child possesses independent means sufficient for his/her own support, the duty of the father to provide maintenance does not arise. Secondly, the child must be unable to earn due to minority or incapacity. Thirdly, the father must possess the means to provide such maintenance. While most Islamic schools of thought agree that the father's financial ability is a necessary precondition, the Hanafi school maintains a distinct view holding that, in the case of children, the obligation to maintain arises irrespective of actual wealth, provided the father has the (naeem)capacity to earn. Therefore, the mere fact that the father is not working, in the absence of any serious mental or physical challenges, cannot be admitted as a valid justification for his failure to discharge the obligation of maintenance towards his children. In circumstances where the father lacks the means to provide maintenance and is incapable of earning due to genuine limitations, the duty to maintain the children may devolve upon the mother if she is in a position of financial ease. If neither parent possesses sufficient means, the obligation may extend to the paternal grandfather, subject to his financial ability to provide support to the children.

Under Muslim Personal Law, puberty was presumed at age of fifteen, and once attained, a Muslim female was considered sui juris, capable of entering into a marital contract without necessity of a guardian’s consent--Where statutory law appeared to criminalize an act otherwise valid under Shariah, and where statute did not explicitly declare such a marriage void, Islamic principles should prevail, particularly in matters of personal law as preserved under Article 227 of Constitution read with provisions of Enforcement of Shari’ah Act, 1991 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1991”)--When there was ambiguity present in a statute, external sources of Islamic principles and jurisprudence in light of Section 3 and 4 of Enforcement of Shari’ah Act, 1991, could be made applicable with a view to determining factum of legality of marriage--Alleged detenue had attained puberty and appeared to have given free and voluntary consent, she should be at liberty to reside with Petitioner--In these circumstances, instant petition was disposed of-- Child Marriage Restraint Act,  did not invalidate their marriage, rather it had stipulated punishment for those participating or promoting same--Therefore, marriage contracted inter se parties in instant case could not be said to be in contravention to injunctions of Islam or any statutory provision.

“Communi Observantia Non est recedendum”--

----It is a well settled principle of criminal jurisprudence arising out of maxim “Communi observantia non est recedendum” that when law required a thing to be done in a particular manner, same must be done accordingly and if prescribed procedure was not followed, it would be presumed that same had not been done in accordance with law.                                                                                        [Para 9] C

PLD 2024 SC 273.

Dr. Mian Muhammad Azhar, Advocate for Appellant.

Mr. Najeeb Ullah Jatoi, DPG for State.

Date of hearing: 18.6.2025.

Judgment

Raja Ghazanfar Ali Khan, J.--This criminal appeal is directed against judgment dated 04.06.2024 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Minchinabad whereby he after holding trial in case FIR No. 259 dated 24.08.2023 registered under Section 9(1) 6(d) of CNSA, 1997 (Amended Act) 2022 at Police Station Mandi Sadiq Gunj convicted and sentenced Raza alias Qari (appellant) as under:--

Under Section 9(1)6(d) CNSA, 1997:

Fourteen years R.l with fine of Rs. 5,00,000/- and in default of payment of fine to further undergo six months S.I.

The benefit of Section 382-B of Cr.P.C. was also extended in favour of the appellant.

2.       Brief facts of the case as per complaint (Exh.PC) are that complainant Shahzad Ahmad ASI (PW.4) along with his other police officials was present at Chhateka petrol pump in the area of Mandi Sadiq Gunj in connection with patrol and checking duty on an official vehicle when he received spy information that Raza alias Qari who deals in heroin and is ruining the young generation was sitting near his house beside the wall of mobile tower and selling narcotics to his customers and if a raid was conducted he could be apprehended whereupon a raiding party conducted raid and on the pointing out of the informer apprehended the said person, who disclosed his name as Raza alias Qari. The accused was holding school bag in his right hand in which Heroin tied in double shopper of black colour was recovered which along with shopper was 2900 grams. From the said bag a digital scale and sale proceeds of Rs. 1300/- were also recovered. Out of the recovered heroin 145 grams was separated for chemical analysis. The complainant prepared two sealed parcels i.e. one of sample and other of remaining bulk i.e. 2755 grams of Heroin and also affixed his stamp having alphabets of SA on both the parcels and took into possession, the heroin, recovered sale proceeds and digital scale through recovery memo (Exh.PB). The complaint (Exh.PC) was transmitted to the police station through Shah Nawaz 238-C (PW.3) on which a formal FIR (Exh.PD) was registered.

3.       On completion of investigation, a report under Section 173, Cr.P.C. was submitted in the Court. The learned trial Court formally charge sheeted the appellant to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution in order to prove its case against the appellant produced five witnesses.

4.       After the conclusion of prosecution evidence, the learned trial Court also examined the appellant under Section 342, Cr.P.C. The appellant neither appeared as witness of his own under Section 340(2), Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in his defence. On the conclusion of trial, the appellant was convicted and sentenced as afore-stated, hence, the instant criminal appeal.

5.       We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant as well as learned Deputy Prosecutor General Punjab and gone through the record with their able assistance.

6.       The scrutiny of record reveals that the whole prosecution case is hinging upon the recovery of 2900 grams of Heroin from the possession of Raza alias Qari (appellant) at the time of his arrest. The prosecution in order to prove the said recovery of Heroin produced five witnesses. Shahzad Ahmad ASI (PW.4) is the complainant who reiterated all the averments of his complaint (Exh.PC) and also got exhibited Heroin (P-1) which was taken into possession through recovery memo (Exh.PB). Mazhar Ali 1621/C (PW.2) is the attesting witnesses of recovery memos (Exh.PB). It is settled principle of law that the harsher the sentence, the stricter the standard of proof. The provisions of CNSA 1997 are stringent in nature and in order to secure conviction, the prosecution is generally required to prove the flawless recovery proceedings of contraband substance, doubt-free dispatch of complaint from the spot to the police station for the registration of FIR, faultless procedure of safe custody of the recovered narcotics along with its transmission to the office of PFSA and above all the origin of the recovered substance as narcotics.

7.       In the above backdrop, we have carefully perused the record and have found many contradictions in the statements of the witnesses. We have observed that during cross examination the defence confronted Shahzad Ahmad ASI (PW.4) with his complaint (Exh.DD) and it evinces therefrom that he made dishonest improvements. The relevant extract from his cross examination is reproduced hereunder:--

“I mentioned in complain Exh.PC that I weighed case property through digital scale. Confronted with Exh.DD where word weighed through digital scale is not mentioned. I mentioned in complaint Exh.PC that I received a spy information that accused was selling narcotics. Confronted with Exh.D.D where he was selling narcotic word is not specifically mentioned rather it is mentioned that he is damaging growth of young people by selling heroin. 1 mentioned in complaint Exh.P.C that I took into possession school bag. Confronted with Exh.D.D where word school bag is not mentioned.”

The law on the point of making dishonest improvements needs no discussion as it is a settled proposition that such witness loses his credence on account of having polluted his deposition. Guidance in this regard can be sought from the case law reported as “Nosher alias Nosha vs. The State and others” (2019 YLR 743), wherein a Division Bench of this Court observed as under:

“It is settled principle of law that fact introduced by witness through dishonest improvement during his evidence before Court does not carry any legal value rather such conduct raises eyebrows regarding evidentiary value of the statement of such witness.”

8.       We have also scrutinized the statement of the investigating officer Muhammad Sufiyan SI (PW.5) who did not mention anywhere in his statement that when he handed over the case property to Moharrer of the police station for safe custody any entry was made in Register No. XIX. Similarly, the Moharrer of the police station namely Muhammad Niaz 811-HC (PW.1) did not utter a single word that any entry was made in register No. XIX prior to keeping the case property in Malkhana. Neither the investigating officer nor the Moharrer of the police station produced the attested copy of register No. XIX. Similarly neither Muhammad Niaz 811-HC (PW.1) nor Muhammad Sufiyan SI (PW.5) uttered a single word that any such entry was made in register No. XIX or in any Roznamcha about handing and taking over of the remaining bulk of case property at the time of its transmission on 28.08.2023 to Malkhana, Judicial Minchinabad. This non-mentioning of handing and taking over of the case property as well as sample parcel in relevant register has made the whole prosecution case doubtful so far as the chain of safe custody of the narcotics is concerned. Reliance in this regard is placed on case titled as “Jeehand vs. The State through Prosecutor General Baluchistan” (2025 SCMR 923) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:--

“5. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and perusal of the record, we have straightforward observed that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against the petitioner beyond the shadow of doubt for the following reasons:

i)       No documentary evidence whatsoever has been brought on record. Neither entry of Register No. XIX was tendered in evidence nor Road Certificate as contemplated by rule 22,70, Form 22.70 and Rule 22.72, Form 10.17 of Police Rules, 1934. So, this sole contour of the case creates dent in the case of the prosecution. This Court in the case of Asif Ali v. State (2024 SCMR 1408) observed as under:

“Rule 22.70 of the Police Rules, 1934 (Police Rules) mandates that Register No. XIX shall be maintained in Form 22.70 of the Police Rules in the police station wherein, with the exception of articles already included in Register No. XVI, every article placed in the store room (Malkhana) shall be entered and the removal of any such article shall also be noted in the appropriate column.”

9.       Now coming towards production of any road certificate before the Court, we have observed that though Muhammad Niaz 811-HC (PW.1) stated that while handing over sample parcel and case property to Muhammad Sufiyan SI (PW.5) road certificate were issued yet the prosecution has failed to get the same exhibited during evidence. It is a well settled principle of criminal jurisprudence arising out of maxim “Communi observantia non est recedendum” that when law required a thing to be done in a particular manner, the same must be done accordingly and if the prescribed procedure was not followed, it would be presumed that the same had not been done in accordance with law, as held in “Ammad Yousaf vs. The State and another” (PLD 2024 SC 273). The non-production of any such road certificate has made the prosecution case further dubious and doubtful.

10.     In the given circumstances, we have observed that the safe custody of the sample parcel cannot be proved, rendering the prosecution case to be doubtful and under the law, the doubt is always to be resolved in favour of the accused. Guidance in this regard can be sought from the case titled as “The State through Regional Director ANF v. Imam Bakhsh and others” (2018 SCMR 2039) which reads as under:--

“The chain of custody begins with the recovery of the seized drug by the Police and includes the separation of the representative sample(s) of the seized drug and their dispatch to the Narcotics Testing Laboratory. This chain of custody, is pivotal, as the entire construct of the Act and the Rules rests on the Report of the Government Analyst, which in turn rests on the process of sampling and its safe and secure custody and transmission to the laboratory. The prosecution must establish that the chain of custody was unbroken, unsuspicious, indubitable, safe and secure. Any break in the chain of custody or lapse in the control of possession of the sample, will cast doubts on the safe custody and safe transmission of the sample(s) and will impair and vitiate the conclusiveness and reliability of the Report of the Government Analyst, thus, rendering it incapable of sustaining conviction. This Court has already held in Amjad Ali v. State (2012 SCMR 577) and Ikramullah v. State (2015 SCMR 1002) that where safe custody or safe transmission of the alleged drug is not established, the Report of the Government Analyst becomes doubtful and unreliable.”

11.     For what has been discussed above, we are of the considered view that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond any shadow of doubt. It is settled by now that for earning acquittal, the accused is not obliged to establish a number of circumstances creating doubt but even a slightest circumstance is sufficient to extend him the benefit of doubt. Reliance in this regard can be placed on case titled as “Ahmed Ali and another vs. The State” (2023 SCMR 781). Consequently, while giving benefit of doubt in favour of Raza alias Qari (appellant) Criminal Appeal No. 310. of 2024 is allowed; his convictions and sentences are set-aside and he stands acquitted of the charges. The appellant is in judicial custody; be released forthwith if not required to be detained in any other case.

Syed Afzal Shah Bukhari, Advocate for Petitioner.

Mr. Irshad Ali Chaudhary, Advocate for Complainant.

Mr. Humayoon Aslam, Deputy Prosecutor General for State.

Date of hearing: 31.7.2025.

Order

The petitioner (Mujahid), being arrayed as an accused in case F.I.R. No. 958/2024, dated 08.08.2024, registered with Police Station City Phoolnagar, District Kasur, for offences under Sections 395, 412 and 109 of PPC, seek his post arrest bail, after the same was refused by the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Pattoki, vide order dated 19.03.2025.

2.       After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner, learned counsel for complainant, learned Deputy Prosecutor General and perusal of record, it was observed that according to F.I.R. on 07.08.2024 at about 07:15 P.M. some unknown persons broke into the jewellary shop of Shabbir Hussain (complainant) and deprived him of golden jewellary weighing 3 Kg, silver jewellary 4 Kg and cash of
Rs. 30,00,000/-.

3.       Record speaks that occurrence took place on 07.08.2024, for which F.L.R. was got registered on 08.08.2024, wherein no body was named as culprit and it was claimed that unknown culprits, who committed the robbery, could be identified, if seen again. Petitioner was introduced in a supplementary statement got recorded by complainant without disclosing any source of information. Surprizingly petitioner was not put to identification parade, which fact alone was sufficient to make present case that one of further inquiry. Recovery of cash of Rs. 600,000/-shown on the pointing out of petitioner could be scrutinized during the trial. All the above said facts, when taken into consideration accumulatively, were sufficient to make the present case that one of further inquiry. In such like cases bail was rule, whereas its refusal was an exception. I, therefore, think it appropriate to exercise my discretion in favour of the petitioner.

4.       For what has been discussed above, the present petition succeeds. Petitioner is ordered to be released on bail subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs. 200,000/- with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial Court.

5.       Needless to mention that any observation made in the above order is tentative in nature and shall not influence the learned trial Court in any manner.

(A.A.K.)          Bail granted

RAPE.........
Section 375, PPC clearly defines rape as penetration of vagina, mouth, urethra, or anus with any body part or object, irrespective of seminal discharge--Thus, even minimal penetration qualifies as rape--The presence of spermatozoa is not required to establish this element--The offence centers on violation of victim’s bodily integrity and autonomy, not physical outcomes of act--The law emphasizes safeguarding victim’s dignity over existence of biological evidence, making absence of seminal material immaterial to strength of prosecution’s case.
Although PFSA report found no seminal material of Appellant on victim’s anal swabs but noted conceivable reasons for this such as possible use of a condom, non-ejaculation, significant delays in medico-legal examination, improper preservation or packaging of evidence, or self-cleaning and bathing by victim--As a result, report is inconclusive and neither confirms nor rules out Appellant’s involvement--In this situation, Courts are legally bound to assess other available evidence for a just determination--The Supreme Court held that DNA testing offers substantial reliability in identifying offenders, helping to secure convictions of guilty and absolve innocent--However, Court clarified that DNA evidence is corroborative in nature--It supports and reinforces other evidence but does not independently constitute conclusive proof.

PLJ 2025 Islamabad 385
قانون میں شادی کی کم سے کم عمر طے کی گئی ہے، لیکن اس کیس میں لڑکی کی عمر اس سے کم تھی۔ عدالت نے دیکھا کہ مسلمانوں کے ذاتی قوانین کے مطابق، لڑکی کی بلوغت کی عمر پندرہ سال مانی جاتی ہے۔ جب لڑکی بلوغت کو پہنچ جائے تو وہ خودمختار ہو جاتی ہے اور شادی کا معاہدہ کرنے کی اہلیت رکھتی ہے، اسے ولی کی اجازت کی ضرورت نہیں پڑتی۔

عدالت نے کہا کہ اگر کوئی قانونی قانون کسی چیز کو جرم قرار دے جو شریعت میں جائز ہے، اور وہ قانون شادی کو واضح طور پر باطل قرار نہ دے، تو اسلامی اصولوں کو فوقیت دی جائے گی۔ خاص طور پر آئین کے آرٹیکل 227 اور انفورسمنٹ آف شریعہ ایکٹ 1991 کی روشنی میں، جو مسلمانوں کے ذاتی قوانین کی حفاظت کرتا ہے۔

اگر قانون میں کوئی ابہام ہو تو شریعہ ایکٹ 1991 کی سیکشن 3 اور 4 کے مطابق، اسلامی اصولوں اور فقہ کی مدد سے شادی کی قانونی حیثیت کا فیصلہ کیا جا سکتا ہے۔
(Adv Abubakar Mushtaq)
اس کیس میں، لڑکی نے بلوغت حاصل کر لی تھی اور اس نے آزادانہ اور خوشی سے رضامندی دی تھی۔ اس لیے عدالت نے کہا کہ وہ اپنے شوہر (جو پٹیشنر تھا) کے ساتھ رہنے کی آزاد ہے۔ عدالت نے پٹیشن کو نمٹا دیا۔

چائلڈ میرج ریسٹرینٹ ایکٹ شادی کو باطل نہیں کرتا، بلکہ اس میں صرف شادی کرنے والوں یا اسے فروغ دینے والوں کے لیے سزا کا حکم ہے۔ اس لیے اس کیس میں جوڑے کی شادی اسلام کے احکامات یا کسی قانونی حکم کی خلاف ورزی نہیں تھی۔

یہ فیصلہ بتاتا ہے کہ شریعت اور قانون کو ملا کر دیکھنا چاہیے، تاکہ انصاف ہو سکے۔
 قانونی ، آئینی و شریعتی  تجزیاتی جائزہ 

1. مقدمہ کا پس منظر اور حقائق
لڑکی کی عمر: قانونی لحاظ سے شادی کی کم سے کم عمر مقرر ہے، لیکن یہاں لڑکی اس عمر سے کم تھی۔

لڑکی کی بلوغت: عدالت نے اسلامی ذاتی قانون کے مطابق دیکھا کہ لڑکی بلوغت کی عمر (15 سال) کو پہنچ گئی ہے۔

رضامندی: لڑکی نے شادی میں آزادانہ اور خوشی سے رضامندی دی۔

شادی کی قانونی حیثیت: چائلڈ میرج ریسٹرینٹ ایکٹ 2017 (Child Marriage Restraint Act) شادی کو بذات خود باطل قرار نہیں دیتا، بلکہ خلاف ورزی کرنے والوں کے لیے سزا مقرر کرتا ہے۔

2. قانونی مسائل
قانونی شادی کی کم از کم عمر vs شریعوی بلوغت

قانون (چائلڈ میرج ریسٹرینٹ ایکٹ) کے تحت شادی کی کم از کم عمر لڑکی کے لیے 16 یا 18 سال ہو سکتی ہے۔

اسلامی فقہ میں لڑکی کی بلوغت پر شادی جائز ہوتی ہے، اور بلوغت کے بعد لڑکی کو خود مختاری حاصل ہوتی ہے۔

ولی کی اجازت کی ضرورت

عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ بلوغت کے بعد لڑکی اپنی شادی کا فیصلہ خود کر سکتی ہے۔

فقہ حنفی اور دیگر مکاتب فکر کے مطابق، بلوغت کی حالت میں لڑکی کے خود ارادیت کے اصول کو ترجیح دی جاتی ہے۔

شریعت اور قانونی تضاد

سوال یہ تھا کہ اگر قانون اور شریعت میں تضاد ہو، تو کس کی پیروی کی جائے؟

عدالت نے کہا کہ اگر قانون شریعت کے مطابق جائز عمل کو جرم قرار دیتا ہے، اور شادی کو باطل قرار نہیں دیتا، تو شریعت کے اصول کو فوقیت حاصل ہے۔

آئین اور شریعت کی حفاظت

آرٹیکل 227: آئین کے تحت قوانین اسلامی شریعت کے مطابق ہونے چاہئیں۔

انفورسمنٹ آف شریعہ ایکٹ 1991: مسلم ذاتی قوانین کی حفاظت کرتا ہے۔

سیکشن 3 اور 4: کسی ابہام یا قانونی خلا کی صورت میں اسلامی فقہ کے اصولوں سے رہنمائی حاصل کی جا سکتی ہے۔

3. عدالت کے دلائل
لڑکی کی بلوغت اور رضامندی

لڑکی نے بلوغت حاصل کر لی تھی اور شادی میں اپنی مرضی دی تھی، اس لیے وہ اپنے شوہر کے ساتھ رہنے کی آزاد ہے۔

چائلڈ میرج ریسٹرینٹ ایکٹ کی حدود

یہ قانون شادی کو بذات خود باطل نہیں کرتا۔

صرف شادی کرنے والوں یا فروغ دینے والوں کے لیے سزا مقرر کی گئی ہے۔

شریعت اور قانون کی ہم آہنگی

عدالت نے اس بات پر زور دیا کہ شریعت اور موجودہ قانون کو ہم آہنگی کے ساتھ دیکھا جائے تاکہ انصاف کا تقاضا پورا ہو۔

4. قانونی اصول
بلوغت کی بنیاد پر شادی کا اختیار

بلوغت کے بعد لڑکی شادی میں خود ارادیت رکھتی ہے۔

ولی کی اجازت بلوغت کی صورت میں ضروری نہیں۔

چائلڈ میرج ریسٹرینٹ ایکٹ کا اطلاق

شادی کو باطل نہیں کرتا۔

قانونی سزا صرف ان افراد پر ہوتی ہے جو شادی کو فروغ دیتے ہیں یا غیر قانونی طریقے سے انجام دیتے ہیں۔

شریعت کی فوقیت

اسلامی اصول اور فقہ قانون میں موجود ابہام کی صورت میں رہنمائی فراہم کرتے ہیں۔

آرٹیکل 227 اور شریعت ایکٹ 1991 کی روشنی میں، شریعت کے مطابق جائز شادی کو تحفظ حاصل ہے۔

5. آئینی اور فقہی جائزہ
پہلو	قانونی نقطہ	فقہی/شریعت نقطہ	عدالت کی رائے
شادی کی کم از کم عمر	چائلڈ میرج ریسٹرینٹ ایکٹ میں مقرر	بلوغت (15 سال) پر شادی جائز	شریعت کے مطابق بلوغت کے بعد لڑکی کا خود مختار ہونا
ولی کی اجازت	قانونی طور پر بعض دفعات میں ضروری	بلوغت کے بعد ضروری نہیں	بلوغت یافتہ لڑکی اپنی رضامندی سے شادی کر سکتی ہے
تضاد قانون و شریعت	قانون شادی کو جرم قرار دے سکتا ہے	شریعت میں جائز عمل	اگر شادی واضح طور پر باطل نہ ہو، شریعت کی ترجیح ہوگی
سزا	شادی کی باطل ہونے سے متعلق نہیں، صرف جرم پر سزا	جائز شادی کی خلاف ورزی نہیں	چائلڈ میرج ایکٹ شادی کے جواز پر اثر انداز نہیں ہوتا

6. شریعت اور قانون کا امتزاج

اسلامی ذاتی قانون کے تحت شادی کی قانونی حیثیت اور لڑکی کی رضامندی کو دیکھنا ضروری ہے۔

قانون صرف شادی کرنے یا فروغ دینے والوں پر سزا لاگو کرتا ہے، شادی کو باطل نہیں کرتا۔

بلو غت اور خود ارادیت

بلوغت کی عمر میں لڑکی کو خود ارادیت حاصل ہے، جسے قانونی اور شریعت دونوں پہلو سے تسلیم کیا گیا۔

عدالت کی لچکدار تشریح

اگر قانونی قواعد اور شریعت میں تضاد ہو، تو عدالت شریعت کے اصولوں کے مطابق فیصلہ دیتی ہے تاکہ انصاف اور قانونی فلاح قائم ہو۔

7. نتیجاً مختصراً ۔۔۔۔
لڑکی نے بلوغت حاصل کر لی تھی اور شادی میں اپنی رضا دی۔

چائلڈ میرج ریسٹرینٹ ایکٹ شادی کو باطل نہیں کرتا، صرف خلاف ورزی کرنے والوں کے لیے سزا دیتا ہے۔

عدالت نے پٹیشن کو مسترد کیا اور جوڑے کو ایک دوسرے کے ساتھ رہنے کی اجازت دی۔

فیصلہ بتاتا ہے کہ شریعت اور موجودہ قانون کو ہم آہنگی کے ساتھ دیکھنا ضروری ہے تاکہ حقیقی انصاف ممکن ہو۔
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
[11/27/25, 6:48:42 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: *ابتدائی اعتراض نہ اٹھانے کے اثرات (Effect of Non-Raising Preliminary Objection)مقامی اور مالی دائرہ اختیار (Territorial & Pecuniary Jurisdiction)مقدمے کی نوعیت اور Rule 6 کا اطلاق (Nature of Suit & Applicability of Rule 6, 1965)*

Case Reference
Civil Petition No. 3606 of 2025
Farzana Yasmeen and others vs Sohail Ahmed and another
Date: 29-10-2025

یہ حقیقت کہ Rule 6 آف West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965 میں یہ بیان نہیں کیا گیا کہ درخواست گزار کو کس نوعیت کا مقدمہ اس عدالت میں دائر کرنا ہے جہاں وہ اس وقت مقیم تھی، مگر یہ کبھی ابتدائی اعتراض (preliminary objection) کی شکل میں چیلنج نہیں کیا گیا، جس کے نتیجے میں مسئلہ (issue) قائم نہ ہوا اور مقدمے کا ٹرائل مکمل کر لیا گیا۔ اگرچہ فیملی کورٹ نے مقدمہ اپنے طریقہ کار کے مطابق فیصلہ کیا، لیکن جہاں تک مقامی دائرہ اختیار (territorial jurisdiction) کا تعلق ہے، وہ بنیادی طور پر Section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 کے تحت آتا ہے، جو یہ فراہم کرتا ہے کہ ایک فریق کو اپیلیٹ یا ریویژن کورٹ میں مقدمہ دائر کرنے کی جگہ پر اعتراض کی اجازت نہیں ہوگی، جب تک یہ اعتراض ابتدائی عدالت میں بروقت نہ اٹھایا گیا ہو اور تمام معاملات میں جب مسئلے (issues) طے کیے جائیں یا ان کے قبل میں، اور جب تک کہ اس کے نتیجے میں انصاف میں ناکامی (failure of justice) واقع نہ ہوئی ہو۔

مقامی اور مالی دائرہ اختیار (territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction) سے متعلق اعتراضات کو سب سے پہلے مرحلے پر یا مسئلہ طے کرنے کے وقت اٹھانا ضروری ہے۔ بعد میں اعتراض اٹھانا انتہائی prejudicial اور انصاف کے خلاف سمجھا جاتا ہے۔ اس لیے، ایک بار جب مقدمہ آگے بڑھ گیا اور فیصلہ سنایا گیا، تو مقامی یا مالی دائرہ اختیار میں کوئی نقص صرف تکنیکی غلطی (technical error) کے طور پر لیا جائے گا۔

یہ بات قابل ذکر ہے کہ Section 21 of CPC میں کہا گیا ہے کہ “ایک اعتراض” کے طور پر، مقدمہ دائر کرنے کی جگہ پر اعتراض کسی بھی اپیلیٹ یا ریویژن کورٹ میں قبول نہیں ہوگا، جب تک کہ اس کے نتیجے میں انصاف میں ناکامی نہ ہوئی ہو۔ مقدمہ جوابی فریق (respondent) نے مقابلہ کیا اور ٹرائل کے بعد فیصلہ بنیادی حیثیت (merit) پر سنایا گیا؛ اس سے مقامی دائرہ اختیار کے حوالے سے کوئی نقصان نہیں ہوا۔ اس اعتراض کو بروقت ابتدائی عدالت میں اٹھانا اور دلائل دینا چاہیے تھا۔

اصول یہ ہے کہ اگر کسی مقدمے یا ٹریبونل کی دائرہ اختیار (jurisdiction) کا مسئلہ ابتدائی عدالت میں قائم نہ کیا گیا ہو، تو اسے بعد میں غور کے لیے نہیں اٹھایا جا سکتا۔ درحقیقت، درخواست گزار کا مقدمہ طلاق یا مہر (dower) کے لیے نہیں تھا، بلکہ نفقہ، جہیز کی چیزیں اور سونے کے زیورات کے لیے تھا، جو کہ Rule 6 of 1965 کے تحت مذکورہ شرط میں نہیں آتا اور یہ مقدمہ اس عدالت میں دائر کیا جانا چاہیے تھا جہاں جزوی یا مکمل طور پر حقائق کا واقعہ ہوا ہو اور/یا جہاں فریقین آخری بار ساتھ رہتے تھے۔ تاہم، ابتدائی فریق (respondent) نے مقامی دائرہ اختیار کے مسئلے کو نہ اٹھایا اور ٹرائل مکمل ہونے دیا گیا۔
قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 

1. پس منظر اور مقدمے کی نوعیت
مقدمہ Farzana Yasmeen & others vs Sohail Ahmed & another ہے، نمبر Civil Petition No. 3606 of 2025، فیصلہ 29-10-2025 کو ہوا۔

درخواست گزار (Petitioners) نے نفقہ، جہیز کی چیزیں اور سونے کے زیورات کے لیے مقدمہ دائر کیا۔

مقدمہ طلاق یا مہر کے لیے نہیں تھا، اس لیے Rule 6 of West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965 کے تحت خصوصاً ذاتی نوعیت کی درخواستیں (مثلاً طلاق، مہر) کی شرط یہاں لاگو نہیں ہوتی۔

مقدمے کی مقامی عدالت میں دائرگی اور territorial jurisdiction پر ابتدائی اعتراض (preliminary objection) نہیں اٹھایا گیا۔

2. قانونی اصول: مقامی اور مالی دائرہ اختیار (Territorial & Pecuniary Jurisdiction)
Section 21 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908:

ایک فریق کو appellate یا revisional court میں مقدمہ دائر کرنے کی جگہ (place of suing) پر اعتراض کرنے کی اجازت نہیں ہے،
جب تک کہ:

یہ اعتراض ابتدائی عدالت (Court of first instance) میں وقت پر نہ اٹھایا گیا ہو، اور

اس کے نتیجے میں انصاف میں ناکامی (failure of justice) واقع نہ ہوئی ہو۔

اصولی طور پر، territorial یا pecuniary jurisdiction کے اعتراضات کو:

سب سے پہلے مرحلے پر یا مسئلہ طے ہونے کے وقت (settlement of issues) اٹھانا لازمی ہے۔

بعد میں اٹھانا prejudicial اور انصاف کے خلاف سمجھا جاتا ہے۔

عدالتی اصول

اگر مقدمہ ابتدائی عدالت میں طے ہو گیا اور فیصلہ سنایا جا چکا ہے،
تو بعد میں jurisdiction defect صرف technical error کے طور پر لیا جائے گا، اور یہ انصاف میں کسی نقصان کا باعث نہیں۔

عدالت کا فیصلہ merit پر ہونا اس بات کو مزید مستحکم کرتا ہے کہ territorial jurisdiction پر بعد میں اعتراض کی ضرورت نہیں۔

3. Rule 6, West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965
Rule 6 مخصوص نوعیت کے مقدمات (مثلاً طلاق، مہر) کے لیے دائرگی کی جگہ کو بیان کرتا ہے۔

تاہم، نفقہ، جہیز اور زیورات کے مقدمات اس Rule کے ذیل میں نہیں آتے۔

اصولی طور پر

مقدمہ جہاں جزوی یا مکمل cause of action واقع ہوا ہو وہاں دائر کیا جا سکتا ہے، یا

جہاں فریقین نے آخری بار ساتھ رہائش اختیار کی ہو۔

4. مقدمے میں پیش آنے والے قانونی نکات
Preliminary Objection نہ اٹھانا

Respondent نے ابتدائی عدالت میں territorial jurisdiction پر اعتراض نہیں اٹھایا۔

نتیجتاً، مسئلہ (issue) قائم نہیں ہوا۔

مقدمہ ٹرائل مکمل کر لیا گیا اور فیصلہ merit پر دیا گیا۔

بعد میں اٹھائے جانے والے اعتراضات

Appellate یا Revisional Court میں اعتراض صرف انصاف میں ناکامی کی صورت میں قابل سماعت ہوگا۔

موجودہ مقدمے میں انصاف میں کوئی نقصان نہیں ہوا کیونکہ مقدمہ contest ہوا اور merit پر فیصلہ سنایا گیا۔

نوعیت کا تعلق Rule 6 سے

Petitioners کا مقدمہ طلاق یا مہر کے لیے نہیں تھا، بلکہ maintenance و جہیز کی چیزوں کے لیے تھا۔

Rule 6 کے Proviso کے تحت یہ مقدمہ دائر کیا جا سکتا تھا جہاں cause of action واقع ہوا ہو یا فریقین آخری بار ساتھ رہے ہوں۔

5. عدالتی اصول اور حوالہ جات
Principle of law: اگر ابتدائی عدالت میں jurisdiction issue قائم نہ ہو اور اس پر اعتراض نہ کیا گیا، تو بعد میں اس اعتراض کو اپیل یا ریویژن میں قبول نہیں کیا جاتا۔

Failure of justice: صرف وہی صورت قابل قبول ہے جس میں ابتدائی عدالت کی غیر موجودگی یا غیر قانونی دائرہ اختیار نے انصاف میں نقصان پہنچایا ہو۔

Technical error doctrine: بعد میں اٹھائے گئے territorial یا pecuniary objections صرف تکنیکی خامی کے طور پر شمار ہوں گے، اور فیصلہ merit پر برقرار رہتا ہے۔

6. نتیجہ اور تجزیہ
ابتدائی اعتراض نہ اٹھانے کا اثر:

Respondent نے ابتدائی عدالت میں territorial jurisdiction پر اعتراض نہیں کیا،

لہذا، مقدمہ ٹرائل پر مکمل ہوا اور merit پر فیصلہ ہوا،

کوئی injustice نہیں ہوا، اور appellate یا revisional court میں اس پر اعتراض قبول نہیں ہوگا۔

نوعیت کا تعین

مقدمہ maintenance اور جہیز کے لیے تھا،

Rule 6 میں ذکر شدہ proviso کے تحت دائرہ اختیار مناسب تھا۔

Legal Position

Petitioners کا مقدمہ legally maintainable تھا،

Respondent کا بعد ازاں territorial jurisdiction پر اعتراض ٹیکنیکل اور ناقابل قبول ہے۔

عملی سبق

Jurisdiction objections ہمیشہ ابتدائی عدالت میں اٹھائیں۔

اگر ٹرائل مکمل اور merit پر فیصلہ ہوا تو بعد میں objection کو حقائق کے خلاف یا prejudicial نہیں مانا جائے گا۔

مختصراً۔۔۔۔۔
مقدمہ نوعیت: نفقہ، جہیز، سونے کے زیورات۔

Rule 6: مخصوص نہیں، مقدمہ جائز تھا۔

CPC Section 21: اعتراض صرف ابتدائی عدالت میں اور failure of justice کی صورت میں قابل سماعت۔

عدالتی فیصلہ  merit پر، پس اعتراض ناقابل قبول۔

Principle: ابتدائی عدالت میں jurisdiction issue نہ اٹھانے کی صورت میں بعد میں appellate/revisional court میں اعتراض صرف technical error شمار ہوگا۔

*(ریپ: دخولِ قلیل کا اصول، ثبوت کا معیار اور بین الاقوامی اعلیٰ عدالتی نظائر)*

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*

PLJ 2025 Cr.C. (Note) 238

تعزیراتِ پاکستان کی دفعہ 375 واضح طور پر ریپ کی تعریف بیان کرتی ہے کہ اگر کسی عورت کی اندامِ نہانی، منہ، پیشاب کی نالی یا مقعد میں کسی بھی جسمانی عضو یا کسی چیز کے ذریعے دخول کیا جائے، تو یہ ریپ ہے، چاہے اس میں منی کا اخراج ہوا ہو یا نہیں۔
لہٰذا انتہائی معمولی سا دخول بھی ریپ کے زمرے میں آتا ہے۔
منی کے جراثیم (spermatozoa) کی موجودگی ریپ ثابت کرنے کے لیے ضروری نہیں۔
قانون کا اصل محور متاثرہ کی جسمانی حرمت اور خود مختاری کی خلاف ورزی ہے، نہ کہ جسمانی نتائج۔
قانون متاثرہ کی عزت و وقار کے تحفظ کو مقدم رکھتا ہے، اس لیے حیاتیاتی مواد کا نہ ملنا، پروسیکیوشن کے کیس کو کمزور نہیں کرتا۔

اگرچہ PFSA کی رپورٹ میں متاثرہ کے مقعد کے نمونوں پر ملزم کے مادہ منویہ کا کوئی نشان نہیں ملا، لیکن رپورٹ میں اس کے کئی ممکنہ اسباب بیان کیے گئے، جیسے کہ:

ممکنہ طور پر کنڈوم کا استعمال

عدمِ انزال (non-ejaculation)

میڈیکو لیگل معائنہ میں تاخیر

ثبوت کا غلط طریقے سے محفوظ یا پیک نہ ہونا

متاثرہ کا خود غسل کر لینا یا خود کو صاف کرنا

لہٰذا PFSA رپورٹ غیر قطعی (inconclusive) قرار پائی، جو نہ ملزم کے جرم کو ثابت کرتی ہے نہ ہی اس کی بےگناہی کو یقینی بناتی ہے۔

ایسی صورت میں عدالتوں پر قانونی ذمہ داری ہے کہ وہ دیگر شہادتوں کا جائزہ لیں اور انصاف پر مبنی نتیجہ اخذ کریں۔

سپریم کورٹ نے قرار دیا کہ ڈی این اے ٹیسٹ انتہائی قابلِ اعتماد سائنسی شہادت ہے جو مجرموں کی نشاندہی اور بےگناہوں کی رہائی میں معاون ہے؛ لیکن عدالت نے یہ بھی واضح کیا کہ ڈی این اے شہادت محض تائیدی (corroborative) نوعیت رکھتی ہے،
یعنی یہ دوسری شہادتوں کو مضبوط کرتی ہے مگر تنہا فیصلہ کن ثبوت نہیں بنتی۔

I.
دفعہ 375 تعزیراتِ پاکستان  بئیر ایکٹ
Section 375, Pakistan Penal Code (Exact Text):
"A man is said to commit rape who has sexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of the following descriptions—
(a) against her will;
(b) without her consent;
(c) with her consent, when the consent has been obtained by putting her in fear of death or of hurt;
(d) with her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband and that her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married;
(e) with or without her consent, when she is under sixteen years of age.
Penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse necessary to the offence of rape."

“کوئی مرد اس عورت سے زنا بالجبر (ریپ) کا مرتکب ہوتا ہے اگر وہ درج ذیل حالات میں اس کے ساتھ جنسی عمل کرے:
(a) اس کی مرضی کے خلاف،
(b) اس کی رضامندی کے بغیر،
(c) ایسی رضامندی جسے موت یا ضرر کے خوف سے حاصل کیا گیا ہو،
(d) ایسی رضامندی جب مرد جانتا ہو کہ وہ اس عورت کا شوہر نہیں، مگر عورت غلط فہمی میں اسے شوہر سمجھ کر رضامند ہو،
(e) کسی بھی حالت میں، اگر عورت کی عمر سولہ سال سے کم ہو۔
محض دخول جرم ریپ ثابت کرنے کے لیے کافی ہے۔”

II. فیصلہ PLJ 2025 Cr.C 238 — مکمل قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ
1. Minimal penetration rule — “Penetration is sufficient”
عدالت نے اس بنیادی اصول کی دوبارہ توثیق کی کہ:

منی کا اخراج (ejaculation) ضروری نہیں

سپرم کا ملنا ضروری نہیں

محض دخول (even slightest penetration) ریپ ہے

یہ اصول کئی پاکستانی اور بین الاقوامی مقدمات کے عین مطابق ہے۔

III. پاکستانی قانونی نظائر (Leading Pakistani Case Law)
1. PLD 2021 SC 362 (Atif Zareef Case)
سپریم کورٹ نے قرار دیا کہ:

ریپ کے ثبوت کیلئے biological evidence ضروری نہیں

“DNA corroborative evidence ہے، fundamental proof نہیں”

متاثرہ کا بیان + طبی شواہد + حالاتِ واقعہ فیصلہ کن ہیں

یہی اصول موجودہ فیصلے میں دہرایا گیا ہے۔

2. 2020 SCMR 956 (Muhammad Javed v. The State)
عدالت نے کہا:

سپرم کا نہ ملنا ریپ کا انکار نہیں

متاثرہ کا فوراً نہ دھونا یا دیر سے معائنہ ہونا biological evidence پر اثر انداز ہوتا ہے

3. PLD 2012 SC 253
عدالت نے کہا:

“The absence of semen does not negate penetration.”

4. 2018 YLR 1808
اگر PFSA رپورٹ inconclusive ہو
→ عدالت دیگر شہادتیں دیکھنے کی پابند ہے

5. 2019 PCrLJ 1433
عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ:

Condom کے استعمال سے seminal material کا نہ ملنا معمول کی سائنس ہے

یہ “benefit of doubt” پیدا نہیں کرتا

یہ نقطہ اس نئے فیصلے کے الفاظ سے مکمل ہم آہنگ ہے۔

IV. PFSA رپورٹ کا تجزیہ (Legal Weight)
عدالت نے درج ذیل سائنسی اسباب بیان کیے جن سے seminal material نہ مل سکتا ہے:

Condom کا استعمال

Non-ejaculation

Delay in MLC

Improper sealing/preservation

Victim washing/cleaning

قانوناً

ایسی رپورٹ inconclusive ہوتی ہے

“عدمِ ملاوٹ = بےگناہی نہیں”

عدالتِ عظمیٰ نے یہی اصول Atif Zareef case میں طے کیا۔

V. DNA شہادت کا قانونی مقام
Supreme Court (PLD 2021 SC 362):
DNA reliable ہے

مگر corroborative ہے

یہ تنہا فیصلہ کن ثبوت نہیں

High Court Judgments
2020 YLR 1221

DNA supports but does NOT replace oral or ocular evidence

یہی reasoning PLJ 2025 کے فیصلے میں موجود ہے۔

VI. بین الاقوامی نظائر (International Precedents)
1. UK — R v. Hughes (1860)
Held:

“Slightest penetration is enough to constitute rape.”

2. R v. Chapman (1959)
Absence of semen irrelevant

Penetration = Rape

3. Indian Supreme Court — State of UP v. Chottey Lal (2011)
Semen not mandatory

Medical evidence merely supportive

4. State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh (1996)
Victim’s statement can be sole basis of conviction

5. US — People v. Kittrelle
Evidence of biological fluids is not essential

Penetration proved = rape proved

6. European Court of Human Rights
Victim autonomy + bodily integrity is the core focus

عدالت کا reasoning انہی بین الاقوامی اصولوں سے ہم آہنگ ہے۔

VII. جرم کا بنیادی جز (Corpus Delicti) کیا ہوتا ہے؟
جسمانی چوٹ ضروری نہیں

سپرم ضروری نہیں

Ejaculation ضروری نہیں

DNA hit ضروری نہیں

Corpus delicti = penetration + lack of consent

یہ اسلامی فقہ اور انٹرنیشنل کرمنل لا دونوں کے مطابق ہے۔

VIII. عدالت کا قانونی نتیجہ (Judicial Reasoning)
عدالت کے اہم قانونی نکات:
Penetration ثابت ہو جائے تو جرم مکمل ہو جاتا ہے

Seminal evidence نہ ہونا جرم کو رد نہیں کرتا

PFSA رپورٹ
 inconclusive 
 neutral evidence

عدالت کا فرض

ocular

medical

circumstantial
شہادت کا مجموعی جائزہ لینا

DNA supportive ہے، essential نہیں
IX. دفاع (Accused) کیلئے قانونی نکات
PFSA inconclusive → benefit of doubt اگر rest of evidence weak ہو

Delay in FIR → motive? fabrication?

No injuries → possibility of fabrication

No eyewitness → strict proof required

Victim’s contradictory statement → credibility test (Article 151, QSO)

X. استغاثہ (Prosecution) کیلئے قانونی نکات
Seminal material not necessary

Victim consistent + medical supports → conviction sustainable

Delay explained → medically/logically justified

In rape, corroboration not mandatory (Gurmit Singh principle)

XI. نتیجاً مغتصراً ۔۔۔۔۔
یہ فیصلہ پاکستانی اور بین الاقوامی اصولوں کے لحاظ سے مکمل، مضبوط اور سائنسی بنیادوں پر قائم ہے۔
ریپ کے مقدمات میں عدالت نے یہ پیغام دیا ہے کہ:

ثبوت کا معیار biological نہیں
 قانونی ہے

متاثرہ کی حرمت مقدم ہے

سائنس supportive ہے، مرکزی ثبوت نہیں

جسٹس امجد رفیق۔۔۔

ابتداء ہی میں، ریاست کی جانب سے پیش ہونے والے معزز اسسٹنٹ ڈسٹرکٹ پبلک پراسیکیوٹر نے یہ اعتراض اٹھایا کہ ملزمان/اپیل کنندگان شبیر، رمضان، رشید اور خدا بخش اپنی سزا اور سزاوارانہ فیصلے کے خلاف اپیل دائر کرنے کے اہل نہیں ہیں، کیونکہ انہوں نے impugned judgment کو تسلیم کرتے ہوئے "دامان" کی رقم جمع کروا دی ہے، جو ان کی سزا کی تکمیل کے مترادف ہے۔ لہٰذا یہ مؤقف اختیار کیا گیا کہ جب ایک فریق اپنی سزا کو قبول کرکے اس کی متعلقہ شرائط پوری کر دے تو وہ اپیل کا حق کھو دیتا ہے۔

تاہم، معزز اسسٹنٹ ڈسٹرکٹ پبلک پراسیکیوٹر کی یہ دلیل قابل قبول نہیں، کیونکہ ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 415-A میں واضح قانونی حیثیت بیان کی گئی ہے، جو بعض معاملات میں خاص حقِ اپیل فراہم کرتی ہے۔ سہولت کے لیے مذکورہ دفعہ ذیل میں درج ہے:

415-A: بعض کیسز میں خاص حقِ اپیل
اس باب میں مذکور کسی بھی امر کے باوجود، اگر ایک ہی مقدمے میں ایک سے زیادہ افراد کو سزا سنائی گئی ہو، اور ان میں سے کسی ایک شخص کے حوالے سے اپیل کے قابل فیصلہ یا حکم صادر کیا گیا ہو، تو ایسے مقدمے میں سزا پانے والے تمام یا کسی ایک شخص کو اپیل کا حق حاصل ہو گا۔

مندرجہ بالا دفعہ کے سادہ مطالعہ سے واضح ہوتا ہے کہ جب متعدد افراد کو ایک ہی ٹرائل میں سزا سنائی جائے اور ان میں سے کسی ایک کے بارے میں اپیل کے قابل فیصلہ موجود ہو، تو باقی تمام شریک سزا یافتہ افراد بھی برابر طور پر اپیل دائر کرنے کے حق دار ہیں۔ لہٰذا اگرچہ مذکورہ ملزمان/اپیل کنندگان نے impugned judgment کے تحت دی گئی ہدایت کے مطابق "دامان" کی رقم جمع کرا دی ہے، مگر اس تعمیل کو ان کی سزا کو قبول کرنے یا اس پر اکتفا کرنے کے طور پر تعبیر نہیں کیا جا سکتا، نہ ہی اس سے ان کا قانونی حقِ اپیل ختم ہوتا ہے۔ ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 415-A کے واضح حکم کے تحت ان کا سزا اور فیصلے کو چیلنج کرنے کا حق برقرار ہے۔

قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 
(Analytical Legal Review)

حقِ اپیل 
دفعہ 415-A Cr.P.C. 
کا اطلاق اور دامان کی رقم کی ادائیگی کا قانونی اثر

1. بنیادی قانونی اعتراض کا تجزیہ
استغاثہ نے یہ مؤقف اپنایا کہ چونکہ ملزمان نے عدالت کے فیصلے کو قبول کرتے ہوئے دامان کی رقم جمع کرا دی، اس لیے وہ سزا تسلیم کر چکے ہیں، جس کے بعد اپیل کا حق waiver یا forfeiture کے اصول کے تحت ختم ہو جاتا ہے۔

یہ اعتراض قانونی طور پر کمزور اس لیے ہے کہ
پاکستانی فوجداری قانون میں اپیل کا حق ایک "statutory right" ہے نہ کہ اختیاری۔
کسی بھی constitutional یا statutory right کو ’’سکوت‘‘ یا ’’تعمیل‘‘ سے waive نہیں کیا جا سکتا، جب تک قانون خود اجازت نہ دے۔

Cr.P.C. میں کہیں بھی یہ نہیں لکھا کہ سزا پوری یا جزوی طور پر پوری کرنے سے اپیل کا حق ختم ہو جاتا ہے۔

دامان کی ادائیگی ‘compensatory liability’ ہے، سزا کا اعتراف نہیں۔
اس کی ادائیگی اپیل سے محرومی پیدا نہیں کرتی، جس پر مستند نظائر موجود ہیں۔

2. دفعہ 415-A Cr.P.C. — حقِ اپیل کا خصوصی تحفظ
قانونی متن
“جب ایک ہی ٹرائل میں ایک سے زیادہ افراد کو سزا دی جائے، اور ان میں سے کسی ایک کے متعلق اپیل پذیر فیصلہ موجود ہو، تو تمام شریک ملزمان کو اپیل کا حق حاصل ہے۔”

قانونی اثر
یہ دفعہ “notwithstanding anything contained in this Chapter” کے ساتھ شروع ہوتی ہے، جو ایک overriding clause ہے۔

یعنی Cr.P.C. کی دیگر تمام دفعات کے باوجود، 415-A اپیل کے حق کی گارنٹی دیتی ہے۔

اس دفعہ کے تحت کوئی بھی تعمیل، ادائیگی، یا سزا کی جزوی تکمیل اپیل کے حق کو ختم نہیں کر سکتی۔

3. دامان کی رقم کی قانونی حیثیت — کیا یہ سزا کے اعتراف کے مترادف ہے؟
قانون کے مطابق دامن کیا ہے؟
دامان اجرائمی معاوضہ ہے (compensatory amount)

اس کا تعلق Ta'zir + compensation سے ہوتا ہے

یہ دیت نہیں، جرمانہ بھی نہیں، بلکہ مضاف پینلٹی ہے (S. 337-Y تا 337-Z، PPC)

اہم نکتہ
دامان کی ادائیگی conviction کی رضا مندانہ قبولی نہیں بناتی۔
ملزمان اکثر سزا معطل کرانے یا رہائی کے لیے رقم جمع کرواتے ہیں — لیکن اپیل باقی رہتی ہے۔

پاکستانی عدالتی نظائر
سپریم کورٹ (S.C.M.R. line of cases):
سزا کی تکمیل یا اس کی جزوی ادائیگی اپیل کا حق ختم نہیں کرتی۔

High Courts
Daman / Arsh / Diyat کی ادائیگی اپیل کے حق میں مانع نہیں۔

4. اپیل کے حق کی عمومی قانونی بنیاد
(i) Statutory Right (قانونی حق)
اپیل ایک ایسا حق ہے جو قانون دیتا ہے — اسے کسی فعل، خاموشی یا عمل سے چھوڑا نہیں جا سکتا، جب تک کہ قانون خود نہ کہے۔
Cr.P.C. میں ایسی کوئی شق موجود نہیں۔

(ii) Principle of Natural Justice
اگر دامن جمع کرانے کا مطلب اپیل کا حق کھونا ہوتا، تو

ملزمان کو قبل از وقت بتایا جانا لازمی تھا

مگر ایسی کوئی قانونی ہدایت موجود نہیں

(iii) Nulla Poena sine Lege
"قانون کے بغیر کوئی سزا نہیں"
اسی طرح "قانون کے بغیر کوئی حق محدود نہیں کیا جا سکتا۔"

5. آیا دامان کی ادائیگی "acquiescence" ہے؟
Acquiescence تب ہوتی ہے جب:
فریق فیصلہ قبول کرے،

اپیل چھوڑنے کی واضح زبانی یا تحریری رضا مندی دے،

یا قانونی طور پر واپسی (withdrawal) فائل کرے۔

اس کیس میں
انہوں نے اپیل فائل کی ہے،

دامان جمع کرانا محض تعمیل ہے، رضا مندی نہیں،

415-A Cr.P.C. ایسا رکاوٹ بننے کی اجازت نہیں دیتا۔

اس لیے یہ نہ تو waiver ہے، نہ estoppel, نہ acquiescence۔

6. نتیجاًمختصراً۔۔۔
مندرجہ بالا قوانین، اصولوں اور دفعہ 415-A Cr.P.C. کے واضح حکم کی روشنی میں:

دامان جمع کرانے سے اپیل کا حق ختم نہیں ہوتا۔

415-A Cr.P.C. co-convicts کو باقاعدہ قانونی حق دیتا ہے کہ وہ اپیل دائر کریں۔

استغاثہ کا اعتراض قانونی بنیادوں سے محروم ہے۔

اپیل کنندگان کا حقِ اپیل مکمل طور پر برقرار ہے اور اس پر کوئی آئینی یا قانونی قدغن نہیں لگائی جا سکتی۔

عدالت نے درست طور پر کہا کہ دامان کی ادائیگی “waiver of conviction” نہیں ہے۔

2024 SCMR 1123
 
Under section 22-A, Cr.P.C, it is not the function of the Justice of Peace to punctiliously or assiduously scrutinize the case or to render any findings on merits but he has to ensure whether, from the facts narrated in the application, any cognizable case is made out or not; and if yes, then he can obviously issue directions that the statement of the complainant be recorded under Section 154. Such powers of the Justice of Peace are limited to aid and assist in the administration of the criminal justice system. He has no right to assume the role of an investigating agency or a prosecutor but has been conferred with a role of vigilance to redress the grievance of those complainants who have been refused by the police officials to register their reports. If the Justice of Peace will assume and undertake a full-fledged investigation and enquiry before the registration of FIR, then every person will have to first approach the Justice of Peace for scrutiny of his complaint and only after clearance, his FIR will be registered, which is beyond the comprehension, prudence, and intention of the legislature. Minute examination of a case and conducting a fact-finding exercise is not included in the functions of a Justice of Peace but he is saddled with a sense of duty to redress the grievance of the complainant who is aggrieved by refusal of a Police Officer to register his report. The offences have been categorized by the Cr.P.C. into two classes i.e., cognizable and non-cognizable. Section 154 of the Cr.P.C. lays down a procedure for conveying information to an S.H.O. with respect to the commission of a cognizable offence, while the provisions of Section 155 (1) of the Cr.P.C. articulates the procedure vis-à-vis a non-cognizable offence.

At whatever time, an Officer Incharge of a Police Station receives some information about the commission of an offence, he is expected first to find out whether the offence disclosed fell into the category of cognizable offences or non-cognizable offences. There is no provision in any law, including Section 154 or 155 of the Cr.P.C., which authorizes an Officer Incharge of a Police Station to hold any enquiry to assess the correctness or falsity of the information before complying with the command of the said provisions. He is obligated to reduce the same into writing, notwithstanding the fact whether such information is true or otherwise. The condition precedent for recording an FIR is that it should convey the information of an offence and that too a cognizable one. The remedy of filing a direct complaint cannot measure or match up to the mechanism provided under section 154, Cr.P.C., in which the Officer Incharge of a Police Station is duty bound to record the statement and register the FIR if a cognizable offence is made out. If in each and every case it is presumed or assumed that instead of insisting or emphasizing the lodgment of an FIR, the party may file a direct complaint, then the purpose of recording an FIR, as envisaged under section 154, Cr.P.C., will become redundant and futile and it would be very easy for the police to refuse the registration of an FIR with the advice to file direct complaint. However, in some exceptional circumstances, the alternate remedy in the shape of direct complaint may be availed but not in every case. The statutory duty casts upon the officer of a police station to enter information regarding the cognizable offence first and then the investigation comes later in order to gather evidence and other relevant material to prosecute the identified culprits. No doubt, an Investigating  Officer  plays a crucial  role  in  the administration  of  the  criminal  justice  system  and  the  constituent  of investigation  report  and  its  worth  keeps hold  of  plenteous  value  and repercussions  on  the  outcome  of  any  criminal  case, but tainted investigations can become an acute obstacle in the administration of justice.

سپریم کورٹ کے مطابق۔۔۔ 
جب کسی خاص جائیداد کو نکاح نامے میں بیوی کی مہر کے طور پر درج کیا جائے اور یہ مہر “مطالبہ پر” (اندل طلب) ادا کی جانے والی ہو، تو شوہر پر لازم ہے کہ وہ اس جائیداد کو بیوی کے حوالے کرنے کے لیے محفوظ رکھے، تاکہ جب وہ بیوی مطالبہ کرے تو اسے منتقل کیا جا 

قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔

1. مقدمے کا پس منظر
بیوی کی مہر (dower) کے طور پر نکاح نامے میں ایک خاص جائیداد درج کی گئی تھی۔

مہر کی نوعیت “مطالبہ پر ادا کی جانے والی” (Andal Talab) تھی، یعنی شوہر پر لازم تھا کہ مہر ادا کرے جب بیوی مطالبہ کرے۔

معاملہ عدالت میں اس بات پر تھا کہ کیا شوہر پر یہ قانونی فرض ہے کہ وہ مذکورہ جائیداد کو بیوی کے مطالبہ کے لیے محفوظ رکھے یا نہیں، اور اگر شوہر نے جائیداد منتقل نہ کی تو قانونی نتائج کیا ہوں گے۔

2. قانونی نکات اور اصول
2.1. تعریف مہر (Dower / Mahr)
اسلامی فقہ کے مطابق: مہر وہ حق ہے جو شوہر بیوی کو نکاح کے وقت یا بعد میں دیتا ہے۔

مطالبہ پر ادا کی جانے والی مہر (Andal Talab) وہ مہر ہے جو بیوی کے مطالبے پر ادا کی جاتی ہے، اور اس کے لیے شوہر پر واجب الادا ذمہ داری عائد ہوتی ہے۔

2.2. شوہر کی ذمہ داری
عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ اگر مہر جائیداد کی صورت میں ہو تو شوہر پر یہ فرض عائد ہے کہ وہ جائیداد کو بیوی کے مطالبے کے لیے محفوظ رکھے۔

اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ شوہر جائیداد کو بیوی کے حق میں منتقل کرنے سے پہلے کسی بھی طرح سے خرچ یا فروخت نہ کرے۔

2.3. عدالتی موقف
عدالت نے کہا

"جب کسی جائیداد کو نکاح نامے میں بیوی کی مہر کے طور پر درج کیا جائے اور وہ مہر مطالبہ پر ادا کی جانے والی ہو، تو شوہر پر لازم ہے کہ وہ اسے محفوظ رکھے تاکہ بیوی جب مطالبہ کرے تو منتقل کیا جا سکے۔"

عدالت نے اس اصول کو اسلامی قانون اور پاکستانی فیملی قوانین کے تحت تسلیم کیا۔

2.4. حوالہ جات
اسلامی فقہ: فقہاء نے مطالبہ پر مہر میں شوہر کی ذمہ داری کو واضح کیا ہے کہ وہ مہر کے لیے مخصوص مال یا جائیداد محفوظ رکھے۔

پاکستانی قانون 
(Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961)

سیکشن 7 اور 9: مہر کی ادائیگی شوہر پر لازم اور قابلِ نفاذ ہے۔

عدالتیں بیوی کے مطالبے پر شوہر سے مہر وصول کر سکتی ہیں۔

3. عملی اثرات
شوہر کے لیے قانونی ذمہ داری

مہر کی جائیداد کو ضائع، فروخت یا کسی اور کے حوالے نہ کرے۔

مطالبے پر فوری طور پر منتقل کرنے کے قابل رکھے۔

بیوی کے حق میں قانونی تحفظ

بیوی جب چاہے مہر کا مطالبہ کر سکتی ہے۔

اگر شوہر نے جائیداد منتقل یا ضائع کی تو عدالت اس کے خلاف نفاذ عدالت یا جرمانہ لگا سکتی ہے۔

مقدمات میں عدالت کی سمت

یہ فیصلہ فیملی کورٹ اور ہائی کورٹ میں مہر کے مطالبے کے حوالے سے مضبوط قانونی حوالہ بن سکتا ہے۔

4. مختصراً ۔۔۔۔۔
نکاح نامے میں درج جائیداد، اگر مہر کے طور پر اور مطالبہ پر ادا کی جانے والی ہو، تو شوہر پر لازم ہے کہ وہ اسے محفوظ رکھے۔

عدالتی فیصلہ واضح کرتا ہے کہ بیوی کے مطالبے کے وقت جائیداد کا منتقلی کا حق اس کا بنیادی حق ہے۔

اسلامی اصول اور پاکستانی قوانین دونوں اس موقف کی تائید کرتے ہیں۔

سپریم کورٹ آف پاکستان نے بیوی کے بانجھ پن پر شوہر کےحق مہر یا نان  نفقہ کی ادائیگی سے انکار کو غیر قانونی قرار دے دیا۔ 

عدالت میں مقدمے میں شوہر کے رویے پر اظہار برہمی کرتے ہوئے درخواست گزار صالح محمد پر 5 لاکھ روپے جرمانہ بھی عائد کر دیا۔ واضح رہے کہ مقدمے میں شوہر نے بیوی پر بانجھ پن اور عورت نہ ہونے کا الزام لگایا تھا ۔

عدالت نے اپنے فیصلے میں کہا کہ بانجھ پن حق مہر یا نان نفقہ روکنے کی وجہ نہیں۔ خواتین پر ذاتی حملے عدالت میں برداشت نہیں ہوں گے۔ شوہر نے بیوی کو والدین کے گھر چھوڑ کر دوسری شادی کر لی۔ پہلی بیوی کے حق مہر اور نان نفقہ سے انکار کیا گیا۔

سپریم کورٹ نے قرار دیا کہ عورت کی عزت نفس ہر حال میں محفوظ ہونی چاہیے۔ خواتین کی تضحیک معاشرتی تعصب کو فروغ دیتی ہے۔ مقدمے میں بیوی کی میڈیکل رپورٹس نے شوہر کے تمام الزامات رد کیے ہیں۔ خواتین کے حقوق کا تحفظ عدلیہ کی ذمہ داری ہے۔

سپریم کورٹ کے فیصلے میں مزید کہا گیا کہ اس کیس میں 10 سال تک خاتون کو اذیت اور تضحیک کا نشانہ بنایا گیا۔ جھوٹے الزامات اور وقت ضائع کرنے پر جرمانہ عائد کیا گیا۔ عدالت نے مقدمے میں ماتحت عدالتوں کے فیصلے برقرار 
رکھے۔

It is a sorrowful truth of our society that infertility, or even the suspicion of it, is often weaponized against women. This social prejudice routinely results in courts of law becoming venues for humiliating a woman under the guise of litigation. However, it must be acknowledged without equivocation that infertility, (naeem)even if present, is no ground to deny a woman her dower or maintenance. It is certainly no ground to challenge her womanhood. To convert such personal pain into a legal weapon is not only an abuse of the process, but an affront to human dignity that should not be enabled.

It also bears emphasis that our religion and culture treat the marital bond as a sacred covenant. The Holy Quran has described the spouse as a garment; the relationship between a husband and wife is likened to that of libaas in our religion, and therefore, the ideals of protection, mutual respect, and dignity in marriage must not be compromised in any event.   
Lest we forget: women in our society constitute a vulnerable group, whose dignity requires vigilant protection and care. The courts cannot, and will not, be passive venues for the perpetuation of social prejudices that harm women and subject them to one trauma after the other. It is not a matter of judicial discretion but of constitutional and moral obligation that the personal dignity of all who appear before the courts be duly safeguarded, particularly where the power imbalance between the parties is so manifest.

 The power to award exemplary costs is one means by which the Court seeks to deter frivolous, abusive, and malicious litigation.

Unexplainable delay in deciding banking cases by the High Court. 

Need for a more Technology/AI based case management system.

Delay in adjudication is not merely a by-product of docket congestion or branch-level inefficiencies; it is a deeper, structural challenge of judicial governance. The Court, as a matter of institutional policy and constitutional responsibility, must urgently transition toward a modern, responsive, and intelligent case management framework. Such a system must, at a minimum, ensure: the early fixation of cases on a non-discriminatory basis; the elimination of “queue-jumping” and preferential scheduling; the prioritization of matters involving constitutional, economic, or national importance without compromising the timely resolution of individual claims; the implementation of age-tracking protocols to automatically identify dormant cases; and the judicious use of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) tools to assist in scheduling and triage while preserving the sanctity of judicial discretion. 

Judicial systems across the world have recognized that delay is not an intractable inevitability but a solvable institutional challenge. Countries such as Singapore, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Estonia, Canada, China, Denmark, and Australia have undertaken comprehensive reforms combining technology, structural innovation, and procedural discipline to reduce backlog and enhance judicial efficiency. Through tools such as e-filing, real-time dashboards, automated scheduling, and transparent digital oversight, these jurisdictions have moved from being passive custodians of dockets to active managers of justice delivery. These international experiences underscore a basic truth: delays in justice are not inevitable; they are a product of institutional design, and can be remedied with vision, planning, and resolve. The judiciary of Pakistan must draw upon these global lessons and commit to transformative reform that integrates technological innovation, administrative restructuring, and disciplined case management. Courts must evolve into engines of timely, transparent, and citizen-focused justice.

Delay in adjudication is not merely a by-product of docket congestion or branch-level inefficiencies; it is a deeper, structural challenge of judicial governance. The Court, as a matter of institutional policy and constitutional responsibility, must urgently transition toward a modern, responsive, and intelligent case management framework. Such a system must, at a minimum, ensure: the early fixation of cases on a non-discriminatory basis; the elimination of “queue-jumping” and preferential scheduling; the prioritization of matters involving constitutional, economic, or national importance without compromising the timely resolution of individual claims; the implementation of age-tracking protocols to automatically identify dormant cases; and the judicious use of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) tools to assist in scheduling and triage while preserving the sanctity of judicial discretion. 

Judicial systems across the world have recognized that delay is not an intractable inevitability but a solvable institutional challenge. Countries such as Singapore, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Estonia, Canada, China, Denmark, and Australia have undertaken comprehensive reforms combining technology, structural innovation, and procedural discipline to reduce backlog and enhance judicial efficiency. Through tools such as e-filing, real-time dashboards, automated scheduling, and transparent digital oversight, these jurisdictions have moved from being passive custodians of dockets to active managers of justice delivery. These international experiences underscore a basic truth: delays in justice are not inevitable; they are a product of institutional design, and can be remedied with vision, planning, and resolve. The judiciary of Pakistan must draw upon these global lessons and commit to transformative reform that integrates technological innovation, administrative restructuring, and disciplined case management. Courts must evolve into engines of timely, transparent, and citizen-focused justice.

فیصلہ ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔
ایک تفتیش (Inquiry) کیا ہے؟
۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔
تفتیش ایک ابتدائی جانچ پڑتال کا عمل ہے جس کا مقصد کسی الزام کی حقیقت کو پرکھنا ہوتا ہے تاکہ یہ طے کیا جا سکے کہ:

کیا الزام بادی النظر میں درست اور قابلِ غور ہے؟

کون سا قانون یا قوانین ممکنہ طور پر ٹوٹے ہیں؟

کیا دستیاب معلومات کی بنیاد پر باقاعدہ تفتیش (investigation) کی ضرورت ہے یا نہیں؟

نیچے ایک جدول دیا گیا ہے جو تفتیش کے ممکنہ نتائج کو واضح کرتا ہے:

اگر الزام غیر ذمہ دارانہ ہو:
الزام مسترد کر دیا جاتا ہے اور معاملہ تفتیش کی سطح پر ہی ختم کر دیا جاتا ہے۔

اگر الزام ذمہ دارانہ ہو لیکن قانون شکنی ثابت نہ ہو:
الزام مسترد کر دیا جاتا ہے اور معاملہ تفتیش پر ختم ہو جاتا ہے۔

اگر قانون شکنی ثابت ہو جائے، ملزم ذمہ داری قبول کرے اور مزید تحقیق سے کوئی نیا نکتہ سامنے آنے کا امکان نہ ہو:
معاملہ تفتیش کی سطح پر ہی ختم کر دیا جاتا ہے۔

اگر قانون شکنی ثابت ہو جائے لیکن ملزم ذمہ داری قبول نہ کرے:
باقاعدہ تفتیش کا آغاز کیا جاتا ہے۔

اگر تفتیش کے دوران کوئی ایسا پہلو سامنے آئے جو مزید تحقیق کا متقاضی ہو (مثلاً دیگر افراد کا ملوث ہونا یا مزید خلاف ورزیاں):
باقاعدہ تفتیش شروع کی جاتی ہے۔

ایک تفتیش (Investigation) کیا ہے؟
۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔
تفتیش ایک باقاعدہ اور منظم طریقہ کار ہے جو کسی مجاز افسر کی جانب سے کیا جاتا ہے، تاکہ الزام کی سچائی کو جانچا جا سکے۔ اس عمل میں متعلقہ شواہد اکٹھے کیے جاتے ہیں اور ان کا تجزیہ کیا جاتا ہے تاکہ یہ فیصلہ کیا جا سکے کہ آیا قانون کی خلاف ورزی ہوئی ہے یا نہیں۔

تفتیش کی ضرورت درج ذیل صورتوں میں پیش آتی ہے:

جب ابتدائی تفتیش یہ واضح نہ کر سکے کہ قانون کی خلاف ورزی ہوئی ہے یا نہیں؛

جب خلاف ورزی ثابت ہو جائے لیکن ملزم اس سے انکار کرے؛

جب تفتیش کے دوران مزید پہلو یا الزامات سامنے آئیں۔

تفتیش کا عمل فریقین (شکایت کنندہ اور ملزم) کو مکمل موقع فراہم کرتا ہے کہ وہ اپنا مؤقف اور شواہد پیش کر سکیں۔ اس عمل کے دوران قانونی تقاضے، جیسے کہ "فریقین کو سنا جانا"، پورے کیے جاتے ہیں۔ یہی وجہ ہے کہ تفتیش کو ضروری سمجھا جاتا ہے، کیونکہ اس سے ثبوتوں کی جمع آوری ممکن ہوتی ہے اور عدالت کو ٹھوس مواد مہیا کیا جاتا ہے۔ یوں معاملے کے اہم نکات واضح ہو جاتے ہیں، اور عدالت فیصلہ کرنے کے قابل ہو جاتی ہے۔

قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ
عنوان: انکوائری اور انویسٹیگیشن کا فرق اور ان کی قانونی حیثیت - سی آر پی سی کی روشنی میں

1. انکوائری (Inquiry) – دفعہ 2(g) Cr.P.C.
سی آر پی سی 1898 کی دفعہ 2(g) کے مطابق:

“Inquiry” means every inquiry, other than a trial, conducted under this Code by a Magistrate or Court.

یعنی انکوائری ایسا عمل ہے جو عدالت یا مجسٹریٹ کسی مقدمے کی سماعت (trial) سے پہلے کرتا ہے تاکہ یہ طے کیا جا سکے کہ آیا مقدمہ قابلِ سماعت ہے یا نہیں۔ انکوائری کا مقصد جرم کے وقوع، شواہد کی نوعیت اور قانون شکنی کی ابتدائی جانچ ہے۔

مثال: اگر کسی الزام میں شک ہو کہ وہ سنجیدہ نوعیت کا نہیں ہے یا کوئی جھوٹا الزام ہے تو مجسٹریٹ دفعہ 202 Cr.P.C. کے تحت ابتدائی انکوائری کا حکم دے سکتا ہے۔

2. انویسٹیگیشن (Investigation) – دفعہ 2(h) Cr.P.C.
دفعہ 2(h) Cr.P.C. کے مطابق:

“Investigation” includes all the proceedings under this Code for the collection of evidence conducted by a police officer or by any person (other than a Magistrate) who is authorized by a Magistrate in this behalf.

یعنی انویسٹیگیشن ایک ایسا قانونی عمل ہے جس میں پولیس یا مجاز افسر کسی الزام کے متعلق شواہد جمع کرتا ہے۔ اس میں جائے وقوعہ کا معائنہ، گواہوں کے بیانات، ایف آئی آر، دستاویزی شواہد اور دیگر متعلقہ مواد شامل ہوتا ہے۔

3. فرق: انکوائری بمقابلہ انویسٹیگیشن
پہلو انکوائری (Inquiry) انویسٹیگیشن (Investigation)
متعلقہ دفعہ دفعہ 2(g), Cr.P.C. دفعہ 2(h), Cr.P.C.
انجام دینے والا عدالت یا مجسٹریٹ پولیس یا مجاز افسر
نوعیت ابتدائی چھان بین تفصیلی ثبوت جمع کرنا
مقصد مقدمہ قابلِ سماعت ہے یا نہیں معلوم کرنا جرم ہوا ہے یا نہیں اور کس نے کیا – یہ ثابت کرنا
وقت ایف آئی آر یا مقدمہ دائر کرنے کے بعد ایف آئی آر کے بعد فوراً
4. عدالت عالیہ اور عدالت عظمیٰ کے نظائر
نور خان وغیرہ بنام ریاست (2025 YLR 62; 2024 Cr.C. 1202):
عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ جب الزام کی ابتدائی چھان بین میں شواہد ناکافی ہوں لیکن ملزم انکار کرے، تو مکمل انویسٹیگیشن ناگزیر ہے تاکہ فریقین کو منصفانہ سماعت کا موقع ملے اور قانون کے تقاضے پورے ہوں۔

PLD 1985 SC 62:
سپریم کورٹ نے قرار دیا کہ بغیر انویسٹیگیشن کسی بھی فرد کے خلاف قانونی کارروائی نہ صرف بنیادی حقوق کی خلاف ورزی ہے بلکہ انصاف کے اصولوں کے خلاف بھی ہے۔

5. قانونی نکتہ
سی آر پی سی ایک مکمل ضابطہ ہے جو فوجداری مقدمات میں تمام مراحل کا احاطہ کرتا ہے۔ انکوائری اور انویسٹیگیشن دونوں ہی انصاف کی بنیاد رکھتے ہیں، مگر ہر ایک کی نوعیت، دائرہ اور اثرات مختلف ہیں۔

انکوائری ایک محفوظ پُلی ہے جو عدالت کو مزید کارروائی یا مقدمہ آگے بڑھانے کے فیصلے تک پہنچاتی ہے۔

انویسٹیگیشن جرم کی بنیاد پر تحقیق ہے جو عدالت کو جرم کے ثبوت فراہم کرتی ہے۔

Birth during marriage conclusive proof of legitimacy---DNA test of minor daughter---Petitioner was aggrieved of denial of conducting DNA test to establish paternity of minor daughter---

Validity---Material question relating to paternity of the minor daughter had already been determined by three courts below in earlier round of litigation, on the basis of evidence available on the record---Ex-parte judgment and decree relied upon by petitioner was subsequent to the judgment in family suit and could not nullify earlier judgment, passed by Court of competent jurisdiction, establishing legitimacy of the minor---Supreme Court declined to interfere with the conclusion reached at by High Court which was in favour of legitimacy of minor daughter---Conditions attached to legitimacy are more strict under Muslim Law than under other systems but Muslim jurists and also the Courts have generally been very reluctant to stigmatize a child as illegitimate---As far as possible every presumption is made in favour of legitimacy---Courts are reluctant to declare a child bastard and have generally refused to admit illegitimacy when legitimacy can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances---

[11/30/25, 11:05:52 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: " Block of CNIC".
"Instead of blocking , Nadra may take action as per provision of section 18 of the ordinance to physically or digitally impound a CNIC after giving notice and chance of hearing to the card holder".

P L D 2017 Sindh 585

Ss. 18 & 23---Constitution of Pakistan, Art.199---Power to 'block' computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) under S. 23 of National Database and Registration Authority Ordinance, 2000 ("the Ordinance")---Legality---"Impounding" of CNIC in terms of S.18 of the Ordinance---Procedure---No clear provision in the Ordinance authorized the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) to 'block' a CNIC---NADRA had no authority to block a CNIC after issuing a notice to the cardholder under S.23 of the Ordinance, however, instead of blocking, NADRA had the power to physically or digitally "impound" a CNIC in terms of S.18 of the Ordinance, after fulfilling requirement of a notice and granting opportunity of hearing to the cardholder---High Court gave directions laying down the procedure that had to be followed by NADRA before impounding person's CNIC.

            Blocking a person's Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) was an extreme act as it amounted to depriving a citizen from his/her identity and depriving him to discharging his routine work. 'Blocking a CNIC' is negating the very identity of a person, which amounted to depriving him of all the necessities, and even imposed restrictions to his freedom of movement. If a person's identity was blocked on the ground of suspicion without giving him an opportunity of hearing, it amounted to a serious violation of his fundamental rights.

            Term 'blocking' was alien to the National Database and Registration Authority Ordinance, 2000 ("the Ordinance"). No clear provision in the Ordinance authorized the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) to 'block' a CNIC.

            Perusal of section 23 of the Ordinance clearly showed that NADRA had no authority to place an embargo whatsoever on a CNIC under the said section. Any person's CNIC could not be blocked after issuing him/her a notice under section 23 of the Ordinance. No doubt, by issuing a notice under section 23, NADRA may call any person who had given any information to furnish any proof regarding the information so given. Language of the statute indicated that said section was applicable prior to issuance of CNIC and not afterwards. Instead of blocking, NADRA may take action as per provision of section 18 of the Ordinance to physically or digitally impound a CNIC after giving notice and chance of hearing to the cardholder.

            High Court directed that impounding of CNIC in terms of section 18 of the Ordinance must be done after fulfilling the requirement of notice to concerned person with full opportunity of a audience; that NADRA must ensure the service of notices to the concerned person through SMS, special messengers, post and/or courier services, and after confirmation of service of all or any of the said mode, and expiry of at least 15 days' time if no response was received then impounding proceeding may be initiated; that if service of notice could not be done or confirmed then NADRA was bound to publish such notice on their website as well as publish the same in a newspaper and after expiry of the 15 days period impounding proceeding should be initiated; that if a person appeared before NADRA authorities, after service of notice or publication then NADRA should complete an inquiry within a period of 30 days after giving full opportunity of the audience to him; that if a person appeared after 'impounding' of his CNIC and gave reasons for his non-appearance, then NADRA must give him an opportunity of hearing and during such hearing his CNIC may be restored, and that the final order passed under section 18 of the Ordinance, must contain, reasons for impounding, cancelling or confiscating the CNIC issued to the card-holder.

The concept of fair trial is central to administration of justice--The right to cross-examine witnesses is a component of right to a fair trial and is considered to be “the greatest legal engine ever invented for discovery of truth”--In an adversarial legal system it is “primary evidentiary safeguard”.   

The fate of criminal trial depends upon truthfulness or otherwise of witness and, therefore, it is of paramount importance--To arrive at truth, its veracity should be judged and for that purpose cross-examination is an acid test--It tests truthfulness of statement made by a witness on oath in examination-in-chief--Its purpose is to elicit facts and materials to establish that evidence of witness is fit to be rejected.    

A layman even if intelligent and educated is not trained in this skill and cannot effectively cross-examine a witness--The Courts have thus consistently held that cross-examination by an accused himself on a prosecution witness can neither be equated nor substituted with cross-examination by a counsel.                                                                                    

There is no provision in Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, which specifically empowers trial Court to guillotine accused’s right of cross-examination--However, this does not mean that he can abuse process of law with impunity and take Court hostage--Hence, when he deliberately avoids to produce his lawyer, Court may appoint a defence counsel at State expense and proceed with trial.

*اہم کیسز اور حوالہ جات*

1. PLJ 2004 Cr.C. (Lahore) 398
اس فیصلے میں کہا گیا ہے کہ اگر حکم کی خلاف ورزی کی جائے تو عدالتی استغاثہ چلایا جائے، لیکن عدالت نے یہ بھی ریکارڈ کیا کہ “No case of contempt is made out against respondents” یعنی وہ معاملہ یوں نہیں کہ عدالت نے بنیادی طور پر نظر ثانی کی کہ ان پر توہین کا کیس بنتا ہی نہیں تھا۔ 


2. Asad Rahim Khan / Talal Chaudhry معاملہ — سپریم کورٹ
اس معاملے میں عدالت نے سُو موٹو کنٹیمپٹ کارروائی کی اور نوٹس جاری کیا کہ استغاثہ پیش کرے کہ بیانِ الزام میں کون کون سی باتیں توہینِ عدالت ہیں۔ 
اس کیس میں عدالت نے مبادیات کا جائزہ لیا، اور عدالتی کارروائی کے سوالات اٹھائے۔


3. High Court of Sindh — Contempt Application becomes Infructuous
ایک کیس میں ہائی کورٹ سندھ نے کہا کہ چونکہ درخواست کنندگان نے عدالت کے احکامات پر عمل کیا، اس لیے کنٹیمپٹ کی درخواست غیر لاگو (infructuous) ہو گئی اور اسے dismiss کر دیا گیا۔ 


4. Peshawar High Court — Cr. Misc. COC 313 of 14
اس کیس میں عدالت نے Attorney-General کے کردار، نوٹس کے سوال، اور دیگر تقاضوں کا تجزیہ کیا ہے کہ کنٹیمپٹ کیس چلانے میں عدالتی حدود کیا ہیں۔ 




 *اہم اصول و رہنما خطوط*

ان کیسز اور عمومی طرزِ عمل سے یہ اصول نکلتے ہیں:

اگر عدالت کو معاملہ prima facie (ظاہری طور پر) قابلِ غور لگے، تو وہ نوٹس جاری کرے گی، چاہے درخواست کنندہ یا اس کا وکیل پہلی سماعت پر موجود نہ ہو۔

اگر مقدمہ کمزور ہو یا عدالت کو لگے کہ کنٹیمپٹ ثابت نہیں ہو سکتا، عدالت فوراً درخواست کو مسترد (dismiss) کر سکتی ہے۔

اگر عدالت نے حکم دیا ہو اور بعد میں اس حکم پر عمل ہو جائے، تو درخواست infructuous قرار دے کر ڈسمس کی جا سکتی ہے۔

عدالت عام طور پر direct dismissal (بدون نوٹس) سے گریز کرتی ہے، خاص طور پر اگر معاملہ سنجیدہ ہو، بلکہ نوٹس دینے، وضاحت طلب کرنے، یا جواب طلب کرنے کی راہ اپناتی ہے۔

*عدالتی عمل میں fair procedure (مناسب سماعت کا حق) کا لحاظ رکھا جاتا ہے — یعنی ملزم کو جواب کا موقع دینا، وکیل کو موقع دینا وغیرہ۔

Mr. Mehram Ali Bali, Advocate for Appellant.

Mr. Haroon Rasheed, Deputy Prosecutor General for State (on Court’s call).

Date of hearing: 6.11.2024.

Order

Through this appeal, Muhammad Hussain (petitioner) has impugned the vires of orders dated 09.10.2024 as well as 14.10.2024 passed by trial Court.

2.       Brief however necessary facts for disposal of this appeal are that Muhammad Hussain (present appellant) is facing trial as accused in the case arising out of F.I.R. No. 386/2023 dated 24.02.2023 registered under Section 9(1)3(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 at Police Station Millat Town, Faisalabad before learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faisalabad/trial Court; appellant did not appear before the trial Court on 09.10.2024, he was declared as proclaimed offender, his surety bond was forfeited and Station House Officer was directed to enter name of the accused in the register of proclaimed offenders; relevant portion of said order is hereby reproduced:

          “Accused has absented himself from the Court deliberately. It is pertinent to mention here that it is well in knowledge of the accused that his case is pending adjudication in the Court and despite having knowledge he has not appeared in Court which shows his irrelevant conduct towards Court proceedings. Nor he himself nor on behalf of the accused has brought in knowledge to the Court regarding reasons of his absence. His conduct does not entitle any leniency. It is primary duty of the accused to appear before the Court on each and every date. Therefore, reliance is place on PLD 1978 S.C, today I dispense proclamation under Section 87, Cr.P.C. (naeem)and declare him as proclaimed offender. His surety bound is forfeited and separate proceedings are prepared under Section 514, Cr.P.C. against surety. S.H.O concerned is directed to enter the name of accused in the register of proclamation offender.

Thereafter present appellant filed application for recalling of said order dated 09.10.2024 and marking his attendance before trial Court (copy of said application is available at pages No. 20-21 of instant appeal) which was dismissed vide order dated 14.10.2024 passed by trial Court (copy of said order is available at page No. 23 of this appeal) and relevant portion of the same is hereby reproduced:

“Perusal of record reveals that accused was facing trial before this Court in case F.I.R No. 386 dated 24.02.2023 under Section 9(i)3C CNSA 1997 registered at Police Station Millat Town, Faisalabad, who absented himself from the Court resulting into carrying out the proceedings under Section 87, Cr.P.C. against him and he was declared proclaimed offender on 09.10.2024. Legality and propriety of such an order can be looked into by Hon’ble High Court being revisable under Section 435 and 439, Cr.P.C. In view of above, application stands dismissed.”

3.       Learned counsel for the appellant and learned Deputy Prosecutor General (on Court’s call) submit in unison that impugned order dated 14.10.2024 is not in accordance with law and it would be appropriate to set-aside the same and refer matter back to the trial Court for re-deciding said application through fresh order.

4.       After hearing learned counsel for the appellant, learned Deputy Prosecutor General and going through the available record appended with this appeal it(naeem) has been noticed that vide order dated 09.10.2024 (mentioned above), appellant has been declared proclaimed offender and his surety bond has been forfeited. It is trite law that basic and prime purpose of issuance of process through notice, summons, bailable warrants, non-bailable warrants as well as proclamation is to bring the accused in the Court for facing the proceedings of the case in accordance with law. When application for re-calling of order dated 09.10.2024 was filed on behalf of appellant and if he (appellant) himself appeared/surrendered before the Court then it was appropriate for the Court either to take him into custody as his surety bond was already forfeited vide order dated 09.10.2024 or to recall aforementioned order dated 09.10.2024 if reasons were cogent, relevant and plausible for recalling the same and undoubtedly order dated 09.10.2024 is not the judgment rather an interim order; furthermore, (naeem)it is also relevant to mention here that even warrant issued by the Court can be cancelled by the Court which issued it and Section 75, Cr.P.C. is hereby reproduced for ready reference in this regard:

“75.  Form of warrant of arrest. (1) Every warrant of arrest issued by a Court under this Code shall be in writing, signed by the presiding officer, or in the case of a Bench of Magistrates, by any member of such Bench; and shall bear the seal of the Court.

(2)      Continuance of warrant of arrest. Every such warrant shall remain in force until it is cancelled by the Court which issued it, or until it is executed.”

It goes without saying that application for recalling of order qua issuance of “warrant of arrest” or “proclamation” of accused is neither entertainable/maintainable nor proceedable without surrender of the accused in the Court. Therefore, with the concurrence of learned counsel for the appellant, learned Deputy Prosecutor General and for the safe administration of justice, afore-mentioned order dated 14.10.2024 passed by trial Court is hereby set-aside, matter is remanded to the trial Court where aforementioned application filed by the appellant for re-calling of order dated 09.10.2024 will be deemed as pending and if appellant will surrender before trial Court on 11.11.2024 then said application would be decided through fresh order after hearing all concerned and strictly in accordance with law. However, if appellant will not surrender before trial Court on 11.11.2024 then his application (mentioned above) would be not proceedable (as discussed above) and law will take its own course in

furtherance of order dated 09.10.2024 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faisalabad/trial Court. With this observation, this appeal stands disposed of.

Jail Appeal 82543/22

Allah Ditta etc. Vs The State

Legally, Postmortem report is viewed as a documented expert opinion, therefore, its production in the evidence through primary evidence though is admissible yet contents of it cannot be read unless doctor appears as a witness to authenticate and verify that it was the report he had prepared. If doctor is not available then such report available in the Court record can be produced as secondary evidence through any person who had seen preparation of such document, knows handwriting or signature of the doctor on the report while showing a comparison with any proved document in the handwriting of such doctor, and this can also be done by production of another doctor or record keeper of the concerned hospital. This being so in the context of Article 78 of Qanun-a-Shahadat Order, 1984 which requires that execution of a document must be proved through the mode and manner as suggested in law.

Thus, despite proof of execution of a document by above means, truth of contents of document is to be proved. Neither the medicolegal or postmortem reports are the categories of documents as mentioned in Article 102 so as to dispense with a formal proof of its execution nor in this case it was claimed to have been admitted by the parties so as to rule out necessity of formal proof.

Article 102 so as to dispense with a formal proof of its execution nor in this case it was claimed to have been admitted by the parties so as to rule out necessity of formal proof.

Thus, mere production of postmortem report is not sufficient to be read in the evidence as a support to the prosecution case.

Opinion of doctor could only be deposed by the said doctor as per Article 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 which says that oral evidence must, in all cases whatever be direct, that is to say, if it refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it must be the evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those grounds.

Corresponding to section 293 of Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in ours section 510 exists but with slight difference, which is not applicable for medical reports. Mode of recording evidence of a doctor is mentioned in Section 509 of Cr.P.C. This Section falls in Chapter XLI which contains heading as “Special Rules of Evidence”, of course an overriding effect on all other provisions, consists of four Sections 509, 510, 511 and 512 of Cr.P.C. which with some connotation to cut short the process provides an expeditious mode of recording of evidence as well as securing the evidence for trial.

According to Section 509 of Cr.P.C., deposition of a medical witness taken and attested by a Magistrate in the presence of accused or taken on Commission may be given in evidence in an inquiry, trial or other proceedings under this Code without calling the medical witness, however, Court does have a power to summon the medical witness as and when thinks fit. This section has like connotation as that of Section 164 of Cr.P.C., which also ensures securing of evidence of a witness but unfortunately Section 509 Cr.P.C., has lost sight of legal practitioners and by the learned Courts, therefore, on the eve of death of a medical witness or his migration to other country, medical evidence falls short of probative value which cannot be brought on record properly or if it is brought on record its probative value decreases due to non-availability of medical witness to depose about the nature, locale, size of injuries and other observation made at the time of examination and test/protocols performed to arrive at an opinion with respect to cause of death or other matters which are also relevant as per Article 65 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Thus, this Section is must to be adhered by all the concerned in future and Criminal Prosecution Service (CPS) should attend to the provision for securing statement of medical witness at the earliest opportunity while producing him before the concerned Magistrate so that on the eve of non-availability of doctor such statement could be used during the trial before the Court concerned. Necessity and utility of Section 509 Cr.P.C., has also been highlighted in Rule 6, Chapter-18, High Court Rules & Orders, Volume III.

Before producing secondary evidence of medical reports, it is essential to prove the non-availability of doctor.

Mere abscondence of accused is not a conclusive proof of the guilt of the accused. The value of abscondence depends upon the fact of each case and abscondence alone cannot take the place of guilt unless and until the case is otherwise proved on the basis of cogent and reliable evidence. The accused persons generally disappear due to fear of police or because of the feelings of the guilt, and in this case during cross examination accused/appellants put the apprehension of their fake police encounter because son of the deceased was a police man.

[11/30/25, 11:05:59 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: ریمانڈ کیا ہوتا ہے؟

سب سے پہلی تو بات یہ ہے کہ ریمانڈ سے متعلق تفصیلات جاننے کے لئے آئین میں درج ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعات61، 167 اور344 کا مطالعہ بہت ضروری ہے۔ 

اس کے ساتھ دفعہ62 اور دفعہ173 کا بھی مطالعہ کرنا چاہئے۔۔

ریمانڈ کے لفظی معنی ”واپس بھجوانا“ ہے۔ 

یعنی مجسٹریٹ کی عدالت سے مقدمہ میں نامزد پیش کردہ ملزم کو واپس حوالات بھیجنا

اصل میں پولیس کے تشدد کی وجہ سے یہ اصطلاح بہت خطر ناک سمجھی جاتی ہےجو کافی حد تک صحیح ہے۔
جب کوئی شخص کسی بھی جرم میں گرفتار ہوتا ہے تو پولیس اس کو چوبیس گھنٹے کے اندر مجسٹریٹ کے پاس پیش کرنے کی پابند ہوتی ہے اور مزید عرصے کے لئے زیر حراست رکھنا مطلوب ہو تو پولیس مجسٹریٹ سے تحریری حکم حاصل کرتی ہے اس درخواست کو ریمانڈ کی درخواست کہتے ہیں۔

اگر پولیس24 گھنٹے کے اندر ملزم کو عدالت میں پیش نہیں کرتی اور مزید مناسب حکم حاصل نہیں کرتی تو چوبیس گھنٹے سے بعد کی حراست غیر قانونی شمار ہوگی۔
عام طور پر ریمانڈ کی درخواست علاقہ مجسٹریٹ کو دی جاتی ہے تاہم ناگزیر صورت میں ریمانڈ کی درخواست کسی بھی مقامی مجسٹریٹ کو دی جا سکتی ہے۔ مجسٹریٹ جس کے روبرو کسی ملزم کو بغرض ریمانڈ پیش کیا جائے زیادہ سے زیادہ پندرہ دن کا ریمانڈ دیتا ہے۔ ہائی کورٹ رولز میں بھی ریمانڈ کے متعلق احکامات اور ہدایات دی گئی ہیں۔ ریمانڈ کی درخواستوں میں قانون یہ ہے کہ مجسٹریٹ کو ملزم کے وکیل یا اسکے رشتہ داروں کو یہ حق دینا چاہئے کہ اگر وہ ریمانڈ کے خلاف ملزم کی طرف سے عذر پیش کرنا چاہتے ہیں تو کر سکتے ہیں۔ ہائی کورٹ کے قواعد میں درج ہے کہ مجسٹریٹ کو لازم ہے کہ وہ ملزم کو وکیل رکھنے کا موقع دے تاکہ وہ وکیل ریمانڈ کے خلاف عذر پیش کر سکے۔

مجسٹریٹ کے لئے ضروری ہے کہ وہ اس بات کا تعین کرے کہ آیا ملزم کا پولیس کے قبضہ میں دیا جانا ضروری ہے یا نہیں۔اگر مجسٹریٹ محسوس کرے کہ ملزم کو پولیس کی حراست میں مزید رکھنا ضروری نہیں ہے تو وہ ریمانڈ کا حکم صادر کرنے سے انکار کر سکتا ہے۔

(بحوالہ pld 1979 lah 587)
وہ ملزم جس کے خلاف مقدمہ زیر تجویز ہو ریمانڈ پر صرف پولیس اسٹیشن میں رکھا جا سکتا ہے کسی اور جگہ نہیں ورنہ یہ اقدام غیر قانونی ہوگا۔ریمانڈ کے لئے ضروری ہے کہ ملزم کو مجسٹریٹ کے روبرو حاضر کیا جائے۔ مجسٹریٹ کا خود مقامنظر بندی تک جانا غیر قانونی ہے۔
ملزم کے رشتہ داروں کو دوران ریمانڈملزم کو کھانا یا لباس مہیا کرنے سے بھی منع نہیں کیا جا سکتا۔
اب آتے ہیں ریمانڈ کی اقسام کی جانب تو جناب
ریمانڈ دو طرح کا ہوتا ہے۔
1۔ جسمانی ریمانڈ (physical remand) 

2.جوڈیشل ریمانڈ
       (judicial remand)

جسمانی ریمانڈ کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ گرفتار شدہ ملزم تھانہ میں ہی زیر حراست رہتا ہے۔ مجسٹریٹ اگر اس نتیجے پر پہنچے کہ پولیس کو بر آمدگی وغیرہ یا کسی اور مقصد کے لئے ملزم کی بنفسہ ضرورت ہے تو وہ ملزم کا جسمانی ریمانڈ وقتاً فوقتاً پولیس افسران کو دیتا رہے گا۔ لیکن اس ریمانڈ کی مجموعہ تعداد پندرہ دن سے زیادہ نہیں ہوتی۔ اس جسمانی ریمانڈ کی وجہ بھی  باقاعدہ درج کی جائے گی
اس جسمانی ریمانڈ کا مطلب ویسے ہماری عام عوام میں پولیس کا ملزم پر تشدد ہی سمجھا جاتا ہے حالانکہ قانون کا یہ منشا ہر گز نہ ہے۔
مگر یہ بھی حقیقت ہے کہ تفتیش کا مطلب مار پٹائی کے سوا ہمارے ملک میں اور کچھ نہیں ہے۔ پولیس جس طرح دوران ریمانڈ ملزم کے ساتھ سلوک کرتی ہے وہ مہذب قوموں کے لئے لمحہ فکریہ ہے۔ اس رویے کی بناء پر پولیس کو خوف اور نفرت کی علامت سمجھا جاتا ہے۔ گرفتار شدہ شخص کے دوست، رشتہ دار صرف اس بات کے لئے پولیس کو بھاری رقوم بطور بطوررشوت دیتے ہیں کہ وہ ملزم کا جسمانی ریمانڈ نہ لے بلکہ جوڈیشل ریمانڈ لے اور مدعی پارٹی پولیس کو بھاری رقم اسی لئے دیتی ہے کہ وہ دوران ریمانڈ ملزم پر جسمانی تشدد کرے۔
 گرفتار ملزم پر اگر دوران حراست تشدد کیا گیا ہے تو علاقہ مجسٹریٹ سے میڈیکل کرانے کا حکم حاصل کیا جا سکتا ہے تاکہ پولیس کی طرف سے کیا گیا تشدد ثابت ہونے پر پولیس کے خلاف کاروائی کی جا سکے۔
اب آتے ہیں جوڈیشل ریمانڈ کی جانب
2۔ جوڈیشل ریمانڈ (judicial remand) 

جوڈیشل ریمانڈ کا مطلب ملزم کو سیدھا جیل بھجوانا ہوتا ہے۔ اگر پولیس آفیسر استدعا کرے کہ تفتیش مقدمہ مکمل ہے یا مزید تفتیش کی ضرورت نہیں ہے تو مجسٹریٹ ملزم کو عدالتی ریمانڈ(judicial remand) پر جیل بھجوا سکتا ہے۔
ایک صورت یہ بھی ہو سکتی ہے کہ اگر تفتیشی افست مزید ریمانڈ جسمانی کی استدعا کرے تو مجسٹریٹ مزید ریمانڈ جسمانی(physical remand) کی اجازت دینے سے انکار کرتے ہوئے ملزم کو عدالتی ریمانڈ پر جیل بھجوا سکتا ہے۔ اس کے لئے مجسٹریٹ چند امور کو مد نظر رکھے گا۔

1۔ مجسٹریٹ اگر مناسب سمجھے کہ تفتیش مقدمہ مکمل ہے۔

2۔ مجسٹریٹ اگر مناسب سمجھے کہ مزید تفتیش کی غرض سے جسمانی ریمانڈ دینا مناسب نہیں ہے۔

3۔ ملزم کے خلاف بظاہر کوئی مقدمہ نہ بنتا ہو۔

جسمانی ریمانڈ سے متعلق ہائی کورٹ کی ہدایات یہ ہیں کہ اسے بہت ہچکچاہٹ کے ساتھ منظور کرنا چاہئے اور تھوڑے تھوڑے دن کے لئے کرنا چاہئے۔ ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 167 اس بابت تفصیل فراہم کرتی ہے۔ عام لوگ چونکہ یہ خیال کرتے ہیں کہ ریمانڈ کی منظوری اور نا منظوری پولیس کی مرضی پر منحصر ہے اسلئے کوئی بھی ریمانڈ کے مرحلہ پر کسی وکیل سے رجوع نہیں کرتا۔ پولیس کے ٹاؤٹوں سے کام چلایا جاتا ہے حالانکہ ریمانڈ کے مرحلہ پر وکیل بحث کرکے مندرجہ ذیل قسم کے احکام حاصل کر سکتا ہے۔
1۔ جسمانی ریمانڈ کی بجائے جوڈیشل ریمانڈ کیا جائے۔
2۔ ملزم کی ضمانت لے لی جائے۔
3۔ ملزم کے خلاف ثبوت نہیں ہے اسکو رہا کر دیا جائے.
وکیل یہ عذر بھی لے سکتا ہے کہ جسمانی ریمانڈ کم دنوں کا دیا جائے۔
 یہ بھی عام مشاہدہ ہے کہ گرفتار شدہ لوگوں کے وارث اس غلط فہمی کا شکار ہیں کہ ریمانڈ کے متعلق معاملات میں وکیل کوئی دخل نہیں دے سکتا اسی لئے وہ پولیس کے دلالوں کو ہزاروں روپے صرف اتنی سی رعایت کے لئے دے دیتے ہیں کہ جسمانی ریمانڈ نہ لیا جائے۔ سادہ لوح لوگوں کی غلط فہمی اور قانون سے لاعلمی کی وجہ سے پولیس کے لئے کرپشن کے کئی دروازے کھل جاتے ہیں۔ اس بابت تدارک کے لئے وکلاء اور عدلیہ کو اپنا کردار ادا کرنا ہوگا۔

غیر قانونی ریمانڈ
عدالت کو ریمانڈ دینے کی وجوہات اپنے حکم میں لکھنا ہوتی ہیں۔اسکا بہترین حل یہ ہے کہ آپ جوعذر پیش کرنا چاہتے ہیں وہ تحریری درخواست کے زریعے ریمانڈ کے وقت پیش کردیں۔ کوئی بھی جوڈیشل مجسٹریٹ ان عذرکو نہ تو پھاڑے گا اور نہ ان کو نظر انداز کرے گا یعنی حکم میں اگر ان کا ذکر نہ کرے گا تب بھی قابل مواخذہ ہوگا اور اگر عذرکی تردید میں بھی کچھ نہیں لکھے گا تب بھی جوابدہ ہوگا۔ ہائی کورٹ کو بڑی سختی کے ساتھ ایسے مجسٹریٹ صاحبان کی گرفت کرنی چاہئے جو ہائی کورٹ کے قواعد و ہدایات اور سکرول کو نظر انداز کریں۔ اب قانون میں ترمیم کرکے یہ حکم بھی ہو چکا ہے کہ ہر ریمانڈ کی نقل سیشن جج صاحب کو بھیجی جائے۔
ہائی کورٹ کو یہ واضح ہدایات ہیں کہ سیشن ججز صاحبان پر لازم ہے کہ وہ ناجائز قسم کے احکام ریمانڈ سے متعلق ہائی کورٹ کو رپورٹ بھجوائیں۔ بہر حال جب بھی کوئی متاثرہ فریق محسوس کرے کہ مجسٹریٹ صاحب نے ریمانڈ منظور کرتے ہوئے قانون کے مطابق عمل نہیں کیا تو فوراً اس کی نقل لے کر سیشن عدالت میں نگرانی دائر کر سکتے ہیں۔ اگچہ ایسی نگرانی کوئی زیادہ فائدہ مند نہیں ہوگی لیکن مجسٹریٹ صاحب سے حکم ریمانڈ کی بابت جواب طلبی ہو سکتی ہے۔
ایسے کئی فیصلے ہیں جن میں صرف ریمانڈ کے خلاف ہدایات دینے پر مجسٹریٹ صاحب کی جوابدہی ہوئی۔ اگر ایسی صور ت درپیش ہو تو براہ راست ہائی کورٹ میں بھی درخواست زیر دفعہ 491 ض۔ف دی جا سکتی ہے کہ ریمانڈ ہائی کورٹ کی ہدایات کے خلاف منظور کیا گیا ہے اسلئے حراست ملزم ناجائز اور نامناسب ہے۔ ایسی صورت میں ملزم زیر ریمانڈ کو رہا کردیا جائے گا۔
491 ضابطہ فوجداری illegal custody اورimproper custody دونوں صورتوں میں ہائی کورٹ مداخلت کرتی ہے۔جب ریمانڈ جوڈیشل کی بجائے جسمانی دیا گیا ہو تو اسے illegal نہ سہی improper custody کہا جا سکتا ہے اور491 ضابطہ فوجداری چونکہ سستا قانونی حربہ ہے اس سے فائدہ اُٹھایا جا سکتا ہے۔ ریمانڈ کے دوران بھی ملزم کو قانوناً یہ حق حاصل ہوتا ہے کہ اس کے دوست احباب اور وکیل اس سے ملاقات کریں اور اس کوقانون کے مطابق صحیح مشورہ دیں۔ملزم کے بارے میں کہا جاتا ہے کہ: accused is the favourite child of law اسلئے یہ تمام سہولیات قانون کے مطابق ملزم کو ملنی چاہئیں۔
 قانونی تقاضہ یہ ہے کہ ملزم کو تھانے کی عمارت میں رکھا جائے۔ کئی تھانیدار تشدد کرنے کے لئے پرائیویٹ مکان حاصل کرکے ملزموں کو ایسے پرائیویٹ مکانوں میں رکھتے ہیں جو سراسر غیر قانونی ہے۔اس کے علاوہ ان کو بھی جن کی گرفتاری ریکارڈ میں موجود نہیں ہوتی انہیں بھی ایسے ٹارچر سیلز میں رکھا جاتا ہے۔ لہذاایسے مکانوں پر چھاپہ ڈلواکر تھانیدار کے خلاف پرچہ درج کروایا جا سکتا ہے۔
سی آئی اے کا دفتر تھانہ نہیں ہوتا،اسی طرح کرائم برانچ کا دفتر بھی تھانہ نہیں ہوتا اسلئے ملزمان کو سی آئی اے کے دفتر میں رکھنا خلاف قانون سمجھا جائے گا۔
منطقی طور پر یہ بات سمجھ لینی آسان ہے کہ جب قانون نے ملزم کو یہ حق دیا ہے کہ وہ گرفتاری کے بعد اپنے گھر سے بستر اور کپڑے منگوا سکتا ہے، دوست احباب اور وکلاء سے ملا قات کر سکتا ہے تو یہ سب قانونی حقوق ایسی حالت میں کیونکر پورے ہونگے جب ملزم کو کسی خفیہ مقام پر پابند رکھا جائے۔

ہائی کورٹ کے بیلف 491 ضابطہ فوجداری کی درخواستوں پر چھاپہ مارتے ہیں تو سب سے پہلے وہ روزنامچہ قابو کرتے ہیں جہاں رپٹ گرفتاری عموماً لکھی ہوئی نہیں ہوتی بلکہ تھانیدار بیلف کے چھاپے کے بعد کسی مقدمے کی ضمنی میں گرفتاری کا ذکر کر دیتا ہے۔تھانے کے روز نامچے کا رجسٹر سب سے زیادہ قابل اعتبار ریکارڈ ہوتا ہےاس میں ردو بدل آسان نہیں ہوتا.

            Date of hearing: 16th April, 2024.

JUDGMENT

       MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.----Through instant appeal, appellants have assailed vires of order dated 26.04.2023, passed by learned Judge Banking Court-I, Multan, whereby non-bailable warrants of arrest of appellants were issued and CNICs of appellants Nos. 2 and 3 were blocked.

2.    Brief facts of the case are that respondent-bank filed suit for recovery of Rs. 51,28,534.37 along with mark up, cost and cost of funds from the date of expiry of finance till realization of dues. The suit was contested by appellants by filing petition for leave to defend the suit. Learned Judge Banking Court-II, Multan, after hearing the arguments of learned counsel for the parties, dismissed said application and passed judgment and decree dated 06.07.2010 for recovery of Rs.51,28,533.59 with costs of suit and cost of funds till the date of its realization. During execution proceedings, respondent moved application for issuance of warrants of arrest and blockage of CNIC of the judgment-debtors. Learned Judge Banking Court-I, Multan, vide impugned order dated 26.04.2023 issued non-bailable warrants of arrest against appellants Nos.2 and 3 along with direction to block their CNICs. Hence, instant appeal.

3.    Learned counsel for appellants submits that neither any inquiry was conducted nor show cause notice was issued prior to issuance of non-bailable warrants of arrest, within the meaning of Order XXI, Rules 37 and 40 read with Section 51, C.P.C., therefore, impugned order is absolutely illegal and without lawful authority. In support, he has inter alia relied upon Messrs Azhar & Co. and others v. National Bank of Pakistan (2018 CLD 830) and Muhammad Asif v. Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Limited through Manager (2022 CLD 1021).

4.    None is present on behalf of respondent-bank to rebut the above submissions, since it has already been proceeded against ex parte vide order dated 21.09.2023.

5.    Heard. Available record perused.

6.    The order of learned Judge Banking for issuance of warrant of arrest and blockage of CNICs of appellants Nos.2 and 3 are under-challenge before us.

7.    As regards blockage of the CNICs, we feel it appropriate to go through the provisions of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 ("FIO, 2001") dealing with the powers of a Banking Court while executing a decree. Section 19 of the FIO, 2001 mainly provides that mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated property and other assets of the judgment-debtor would be the subject matter of the execution. Section 19(2) provides various modes / actions to be taken by the Banking Court to execute a decree coupled with powers given in various sub-sections of Section 15 of the FIO, 2004 and bestows it with powers of Executing Court provided in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 or any other law for the time being in force. We have a glimpse to the afore-referred provisions of the FIO, 2001 together with the provisions of CPC dealing with powers of the Executing Court, however are unable to find any direct provision empowering to block CNIC of a judgment-debtor.

8.    Section 18(1) of the National Database and Registration Authority Ordinance, 2000 empowers NADRA to cancel, impound or confiscate a CNIC, after giving notice in writing to the holder of CNIC to show cause as to why such order should not be passed. Section 18(2) enumerates the instances / circumstances in which such action can be taken, which includes (a) the card has been obtained by a person who is not eligible to hold such card, by posing himself as eligible; (b) more than one cards have been obtained by the same person on the same eligibility criteria; (c) the particulars shown on the card have been obliterated or tampered with; or (d) the card is forged. Apparently, no instance of blocking a CNIC, pertinently while conducting executing proceedings by a court of law, is visible in the afore-referred provision. Section 18(3) provides right of appeal to aggrieved person before the Federal Government against the order passed against him and again notice providing of hearing is expedient before deciding the appeal. We are mindful of the fact that the legislature has made it obligatory upon the NADRA authority as well as the appellate authority to have given a fair opportunity of hearing to lead the defence to the affected person in terms of Section 18 ibid. We have gone through the impugned order and proceedings being conducted before passing the said order and are astonished to observe that no such exercise of issuing a show cause notice to appellants to explain their position was undertaken by the learned Judge Banking Court.

9.    In the case reported as Muhammad Umar v. Federation of Pakistan, through Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Islamabad and 2 others (PLD 2017 Sindh 585), NADRA had blocked the petitioner's CNIC by issuing a notice under Section 23 instead of Section 18 of the NADRA Ordinance. The Sindh High Court observed that while the term 'block' was alien to the NADRA Ordinance, Section 18 did allow the authority to impound a card under certain conditions. The act of impounding a document is completed by taking possession of the document, thus, if NADRA decides to impound a card under the directives of the Federal Government, they may direct the person to deposit their CNIC to NADRA. It was further observed that, it is mandatory that NADRA issues notice to the concerned person of the same under the relevant section, and gives them a fair and proper chance of hearing. Therefore, 'blocking' of a CNIC without giving a chance of hearing was held to be illegal as the same was not warranted under the law.

       Likewise, this Court in the case reported as Hafiz Awais Zafar v. Judge Family Court, Lahore and 2 others (PLD 2022 Lahore 756), held that an individual cannot be deprived of his identity card without due process and "In as much as cancellation, impounding or confiscation of CNIC impacts the fundamental rights of a person, the provisions of section 18 of the Ordinance must be strictly construed and scrupulously followed. Any order passed or action taken on a consideration other than those stipulated therein cannot sustain."

       Similarly, in the judgment reported as Urooj Tabani v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Interior, Islamabad and 2 others (PLD 2021 Islamabad 105), NADRA had issued a notice to the petitioner that she had obtained her CNIC through unfair means, and then subsequently impounded her CNIC as well as segregated her from the family tree. The Islamabad High Court held that NADRA did not have the authority to 'block' a CNIC upon receiving the complaint of a third party as presumption of truth is attached to the CNIC and the particulars recorded therein. It was further observed that the powers of impounding, cancelling or confiscating a card under Section 18 are explicitly confined to the four grounds prescribed.

10.  Needless to say that Section 19 of the NADRA Ordinance, 2000 specifies a few circumstances when the CNIC is compulsorily required, which include passport, permit or other travel documents for going out of Pakistan and identification of a voter at various elections. Section 19(3) empowers the Federal Government to specify any other purpose for which the production of any card issued by NADRA shall be necessary. Presently, the need for the CNIC has increased manifold. Almost every government and private organization requires CNIC from a person before attending them. CNIC is also expedient to get admission in higher education programs, apply for a job, open a bank account, get a driving license or arms license, get utility connections, purchase railway and air tickets, execute any instrument, stay in a hotel or lodge, appear in a court proceedings and enter in certain buildings and premises etc. CNIC is essential for enjoyment of a number of fundamental rights, hence, a person cannot be deprived of it without due process. The superior Courts have expanded the right to life over time (provided in Article 9 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973) and held that it includes the right to legal aid; the right to speedy trial; the right to bare necessities of life; protection against adverse effects of electro-magnetic fields; the right to pure and unpolluted water; the right to access to justice; the right to livelihood; the right to travel; the right to food, water, decent environment, education and medical care. Personal identity of a person comprises all those aspects of his profile which are significant to him. Right to identity is also associated to the right to life (Article 9) and would also be read into Article 14, which guarantees dignity of man.

11.  According to the provisions of Order XXI, Rule 37, C.P.C. where an application for the arrest and detention is made, the Court instead of issuing warrant for arrest, may issue a notice calling upon the judgment-debtor to appear on a date specified in the notice and show cause as to why he should not be detained in prison. If the judgment-debtor does not appear in response to notice, the Court shall issue warrant for the arrest of judgment-debtor as provided under Rule 37(2). Rule 40, C.P.C. provides that where the judgment-debtor appears in the Court in pursuance of the notice or is brought before the Court after being arrested, the Court shall hear the decree-holder, take all such evidence as may be produced by him in support of his application and shall then give judgment-debtor an opportunity of showing cause why he should not be detained in prison and that pending conclusion of inquiry the Court, in its discretion, order to release the judgment-debtor on furnishing of security to the satisfaction of the Court for his appearance, when required, and that on conclusion of inquiry, the Court can subject to the satisfaction of provisions of Section 51, C.P.C., make an order in respect of detaining the judgment-debtor in prison. These rules and procedure therein have been considered in a number of cases and the consistent view taken is that before passing an order for arrest and detention of judgment-debtor, the Court shall after due inquiry and affording opportunity of evidence to parties, determine that the pre-conditions for the issuance of such directive have been satisfied by the decree-holder. Reference can be made to Habib Ahmad v. Haji Munir Ahmad (2004 YLR 1540), Messrs 3-A Trade Impex through Partner and 2 others v. Askari Commercial Bank Ltd., through Branch Manager (2005 CLD 1379), Abdul Basit Zahid v. Modaraba Al-Tijarah through Chief Executive and 2 others (PLD 2000 Karachi 322) and Muhammad Kaleem v. Arslan Aslam and others (2023 CLC 796).

12.  It is pertinent to mention here that agricultural land of the judgment-debtors has already been redeemed and another agricultural land measuring 195-K 02-M, situated at Mouza Turbet Haji Shah, Tehsil and District Jhang, is under mortgage and order could have been passed regarding said property as permissible under the law, therefore, there appears no justification to pass impugned order, especially when prerequisites have not been observed.

13.  For the foregoing reasons, instant appeal is allowed. Consequently, impugned order dated 26.04.2023 is set aside being illegal and without lawful authority. However, learned Executing Court shall be at liberty to initiate fresh process as per law and the above observations of this Court.

The nub of the matter is to determine whether a service provider is liable to pay compensation on account of faulty service when the consumer is also responsible to a certain extent inasmuch as the consumer shipped the goods to a consignee who was not a real person and committed fraud with the complainant-respondent. Held: The very concept of "self-collection" implies that the parcel should only be handed over upon strict verification of the identity of the recipient, especially when the item is valuable and insured. The failure to verify identity and the handing over of the parcel to an unauthorized person constitutes a breach of contractual duty as well as negligence. In fact, the fraud, which the intended consignee committed with the respondent, was materialized because of the inefficiency and breach of duty on the part of the appellant-company by handing over the mobile phone to the irrelevant person.

2025 CLC 1820 
مدیون (اصل مقروض) کی گرفتاری کے باوجود، ضامن ڈگری شدہ رقم ادا کرنے کا پابند رہتا ہے۔
قانون اس بارے میں بالکل واضح ہے کہ ڈگری (decree) ضامن کے خلاف بھی نافذ کی جاسکتی ہے۔ مدیون کی گرفتاری ضامن کو ڈگری کی رقم ادا کرنے کی ذمہ داری سے بری نہیں کرتی، کیونکہ اس کی ذمہ داری مدیون کے ساتھ مشترکہ اور علیحدہ (joint and several) دونوں حیثیتوں میں ہوتی ہے۔

ضامن کے خلاف اس کی ذمہ داری کے نفاذ کے لیے کارروائی سیکشن 45 سی پی سی کے تحت کی جاسکتی ہے۔

مزید یہ کہ ضامن نامہ (surety bond) میں درج شرائط یا الفاظ کو ان کے عام اور واضح مفہوم میں پڑھا جانا چاہیے۔ جب اس کے الفاظ صاف اور غیر مبہم ہوں، تو ان کی تعبیر و تشریح کے لیے کسی اور طریقے یا مفہوم کی طرف جانے کی کوئی ضرورت نہیں رہتی۔

WP 29329/20

قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ

2025 CLC 1820
موضوع: ضامن کی ذمہ داری، مدیون کی گرفتاری کے باوجود برقرار سیکشن  45 CPC

1. مقدمہ کا بنیادی قانونی سوال 
(Legal Proposition)
مرکزی سوال یہ تھا کہ

کیا مدیون
 (Judgment Debtor) 
کی گرفتاری کے بعد ضامن
 (Surety) کی ذمہ داری ختم ہوجاتی ہے یا وہ ڈگری کی رقم ادا کرنے کا پابند رہتا ہے؟

عدالت نے واضح طور پر قرار دیا کہ:

مدیون کی گرفتاری کے باوجود ضامن کی ذمہ داری برقرار رہتی ہے۔
 ضامن کی ذمہ داری مدیون کے ساتھ مشترکہ اور علیحدہ (joint & several liability) ہوتی ہے۔
 ڈگری ضامن کے خلاف بھی مکمل طور پر نافذ کی جا سکتی ہے۔

2. قانونی بنیاد 
(Statutory Foundation)
(a) Section 45, Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)
یہ دفعہ عدالت کو اجازت دیتی ہے کہ:

ڈگری کسی بھی ایسی شخص کے خلاف نافذ کی جاسکتی ہے
جو بطور ضامن اس کی ادائیگی کا پابند ہو۔

یہ نفاذ اسی طرح ہوگا جیسے اصل مدیون کے خلاف ہوتا ہے۔

اس فیصلے میں عدالت نے یہی اصول مضبوط کیا کہ Section 45 CPC ضامن کے خلاف کارروائی کا واضح اختیار دیتی ہے۔

3. ضامن کی ذمہ داری کی نوعیت
 (Nature of Surety’s Liability)
(i) Joint and Several Liability
عدالت نے کہا کہ ضامن

اصل مدیون کے ساتھ مشترکہ بھی ذمہ دار ہے

اور انفرادی طور پر بھی

اس کا مطلب:

اگر اصل مدیون گرفتار ہو جائے یا ادائیگی نہ کرے تب بھی ضامن سے پوری ڈگری کی رقم وصول کی جا سکتی ہے۔

یہ اصول پاکستان اور ہندوستان کی عدالتوں میں مستقل طور پر برقرار ہے۔

4. گرفتاری سے ضامن کی رہائی کا نہ ہونا
 (Arrest Does Not Discharge Surety)
عدالت نے اہم نکتہ اٹھایا

 مدیون کی گرفتاری ضامن کو بری نہیں کرتی
 ضامن کی ذمہ داری صرف اس وقت ختم ہو سکتی ہے جب:

ڈگری ادا ہو جائے، یا

ضامن کے ضامن نامہ میں ایسا کوئی خصوصی شرط ہو (جوکہ یہاں نہ تھی)

یہ دلیل زیرِ غور آئی کہ گرفتاری کے بعد ضامن بری ہو جانا چاہیے، مگر عدالت نے اسے مسترد کر دیا۔

5. ضامن نامہ کی تشریح (Interpretation of Surety Bond)
فیصلے کا اہم قانونی اصول

ضامن نامہ کے الفاظ کو ان کے عام اور واضح (ordinary & unambiguous) مفہوم میں پڑھا جائے گا۔

یعنی

اگر ضامن نے واضح طور پر “ڈگری کی ادائیگی کی ضمانت” دی ہے

تو وہ الفاظ معتبر رہیں گے

ان کی مبہم یا مختلف تشریح کی اجازت نہیں

عدالت نے یہ بھی کہا کہ

 ضامن نامہ میں ambiguity نہ ہو
 اور عدالت اس کی ایسی تشریح نہیں کرے گی جو ضامن کو فائدہ دے جبکہ الفاظ واضح ہوں

6. عدالتی نظائر (Judicial Precedents)
عدالت نے ملک کے تسلیم شدہ اصولوں پر انحصار کیا:

پاکستانی نظائر
Surety کی ذمہ داری سخت (strict) ہوتی ہے

ضمانت شدہ ذمہ داری پوری ہونے تک ضامن کا فرض برقرار رہتا ہے

Common Law Principles
Suretyship = strict contract

Courts must enforce surety contracts “as written”

7. آئینی دائرہ (Writ Jurisdiction)
چونکہ معاملہ Execution Court کے اختیارات سے متعلق تھا

 ہائی کورٹ نے قرار دیا کہ
 Execution Court
 نے سیکشن 45 CPC
 کے تحت درست اختیار استعمال کیا
 ضامن کے خلاف کارروائی آئینی طور پر درست ہے
 اس لیے Writ Petition خارج کر دی گئی / برقرار نہ رہ سکی

8. اس فیصلے کے عملی اثرات (Practical Implications for Lawyers)
(i) ضامن کے خلاف Execution مکمل طور پر قابلِ عمل ہے
تنخواہ ضبط

جائیداد ضبط

بینک اٹیچمنٹ

Arrest Warrants
 حتیٰ کہ

Civil Prison

(ii) وکیل دفاع کے لیے اہم نکات
اگر آپ ضامن کو بچانا چاہیں تو صرف دو بنیادیں رہ جاتی ہیں:

ضامن نامہ میں مخصوص شرط کہ ذمہ داری محدود ہے

ضامن نامہ پر دستخط یا تاریخ میں قانونی نقص

(iii) ڈکری ہولڈر کے لیے فائدہ
یہ فیصلہ مضبوط نظیر ہے کہ:

وہ مدیون کی گرفتاری کے باوجود ضامن کے خلاف فوری ریکوری شروع کر سکتا ہے

Execution کا اختیار وسیع ہے

 نتیجاً مختصراً۔۔۔۔
2025 CLC 1820 ایک اہم نظیر ہے جو یہ اصول مضبوط کرتی ہے کہ

 ضامن کی ذمہ داری مستقل، سخت اور مدیون سے آزاد (independent) ہوتی ہے۔
مدیون کی گرفتاری، قید یا عدم ادائیگی، ضامن کی ذمہ داری ختم نہیں کرتی۔
 Section 45 CPC ڈگری ہولڈر کو مکمل اختیار دیتی ہے کہ وہ ضامن سے بھی وصولی کرے۔
 ضامن نامہ میں موجود الفاظ ہی فیصلہ کن حیثیت رکھتے ہیں۔

ملزمان کی نشان دہی پر مبینہ طور پر برآمد ہونے والے جرم کے ہتھیار کی بازیابی—خود مختار شہادت کی عدم موجودگی
پٹیشنرز/ملزمان پر الزام تھا کہ انہوں نے دورانِ ڈکیتی مزاحمت پر مقتول کو قتل کیا۔ استغاثہ کے مطابق 17.01.2021 کو ایک ملزم کی نشاندہی پر .30 بور پستول اور چار زندہ کارتوس ایک بھینسوں کے باڑے سے دو پولیس اہلکاروں/گواہان کی موجودگی میں برآمد کیے گئے۔ اسی باڑے سے 20.01.2021 کو دوسرے ملزم کی نشان دہی پر .30 بور پستول اور پانچ زندہ کارتوس برآمد ہونے کا دعویٰ بھی پیش کیا گیا۔

تاہم، تفتیشی افسر نے کسی بھی ملزم کا انکشاف/اعترافی میمو تیار نہیں کیا۔ نہ ہی باڑے کے مالک، مقامی افراد یا وہاں کام کرنے والے مزدوروں کو بطور گواہ شامل کیا گیا اور نہ ہی انہیں عدالت میں پیش کیا گیا تاکہ بازیابی کی آزاد اور غیر جانبدار تصدیق ہوسکے۔ اس کمی نے استغاثہ کے کیس کو کمزور کر دیا اور اس امکان کو تقویت دی کہ شاید تفتیشی افسر نے محض استغاثہ کے مؤقف کو مضبوط کرنے کے لیے اسلحہ خود ہی رکھ کر برآمدگی ظاہر کر دی۔

17.01.2021 کو مبینہ طور پر ملزم کی نشاندہی پر برآمد ہونے والا پستول 22.01.2021 کو فرانزک سائنس ایجنسی بھجوایا گیا، جہاں پہلے سے ہی دو کرائم ایمپٹیز موجود تھے۔ ریکارڈ سے یہ بھی ثابت ہوا کہ اسلحہ کی تحویل کے دوران چین آف کسٹڈی میں وقفہ/خلل پایا گیا۔ فرانزک رپورٹ 08.02.2021 کو مثبت آئی۔

اگرچہ اسلحہ ماہر کی مثبت رپورٹ ایک قابلِ قبول معاون شہادت ہوتی ہے، لیکن اس کی اہمیت اس ہتھیار کی بازیابی کی صداقت پر منحصر ہوتی ہے۔ اگر بازیابی ہی مشکوک، من گھڑت یا ناقابلِ اعتبار ہو تو خواہ فرانزک رپورٹ مثبت ہو، عدالت اسے نظر انداز کر سکتی ہے کیونکہ ایسا اسلحہ حقیقتاً ملزم یا جرم سے قابل اعتماد طریقے سے منسلک نہیں ہوتا۔

چونکہ اس مقدمے میں ہتھیار کی برآمدگی خود مختار گواہی کے فقدان کے باعث ناقابلِ یقین قرار پائی، اس لیے اسلحہ ماہر کی مثبت رپورٹ بھی اپنی ثبوتی حیثیت کھو بیٹھی اور ملزم کو جرم سے نہیں جوڑ سکی۔

 قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ

1. برآمدگی (Recovery) کا بنیادی اصول
پاکستانی فوجداری قانون میں کسی بھی جرم میں استعمال ہونے والے اسلحہ کی برآمدگی صرف اسی وقت معتبر ہوتی ہے جب:

Disclosure Memo ہو (ملزم نے کہاں سے اسلحہ نکال کر دینا ہے)

Pointation Memo ہو (ملزم نے نشاندہی کیسے کی)

Independent witnesses شامل ہوں

Chain of Custody مکمل، محفوظ، اور مسلسل ہو

اس کیس میں یہ تمام بنیادی قانونی تقاضے پورے نہیں کیے گئے، جس سے Recovery کی بنیاد ہی ہل گئی۔

2. Disclosure Memo نہ بنانا — انتہائی سنگین قانونی سقم
قانونی طور پر:

دفعہ 27، قانونِ شہادت آرڈر 1984 کا اطلاق ہی تب ہوتا ہے جب ملزم کا انکشاف تحریری صورت میں دستاویزی ریکارڈ پر ہو۔

انکشاف نہ لکھنا اس بات کو ظاہر کرتا ہے کہ یا تو انکشاف ہوا ہی نہیں، یا بعد میں کہانی بنائی گئی۔

عدالتوں نے کئی بار قرار دیا ہے کہ:

 Disclosure memo نہ ہو تو برآمدگی محض پولیس کی بات رہ جاتی ہے، جسے عدالتی اعتبار حاصل نہیں ہوتا۔
(PLD 2020 SC، 2019 SCMR، 2024 SCMR لائن آف ججمنٹس)

یہاں دونوں برآمدگیوں میں ایک بھی Disclosure Memo نہیں بنایا گیا۔

3. Independent Witnesses کی عدم موجودگی — برآمدگی کا اعتبار ختم
قانونی اصول
سپریم کورٹ کا مستقل مؤقف ہے کہ
“اہم نوعیت کی برآمدگی میں مقامی گواہوں کا شامل نہ کرنا شکوک پیدا کرتا ہے۔”

باڑے کا مالک، مزدور، اور اہلِ محلہ—کسی کو بھی شامل نہیں کیا گیا۔

برآمدگی صرف پولیس گواہوں کی شہادت پر کھڑی تھی۔

یہاں عدالت نے صحیح طور پر کہا کہ:

ایسی بازیابی کے جعلی ہونے کا امکان بڑھ جاتا ہے۔

یہ اصول 2022 SCMR، 2023 SCMR، 2024 LHC اور 2018 SCMR میں بارہا دہرایا گیا ہے۔

4. دو الگ الگ دن ایک ہی جگہ سے دو پستول کی برآمدگی — کہانی مشکوک
17 جنوری کو ایک پستول ملا۔

20 جنوری کو اسی باڑے سے دوسرا پستول ملا۔

اگر پہلا دن تلاشی مکمل ہو چکی تھی تو تین دن بعد اسی جگہ سے دوسرا پستول کیسے ملا؟

عدالت کا نقطہ نظر:

 اس سے شک پیدا ہوتا ہے کہ شاید برآمدگیاں بناوٹی (planted) ہوں۔

5. Chain of Custody کا ٹوٹنا — فرانزک رپورٹ کی حیثیت ختم
فرانزک سائنس ایجنسی کو بھیجنے سے پہلے:

اسلحہ 5 دن پولیس کے پاس پڑا رہا

اس میں crime empties پہلے سے رکھے ہوئے تھے

Chain of Custody میں Gap ثابت ہوا

SC کی مستقل رائے

جب Chain of Custody ٹوٹ جائے تو فرانزک رپورٹ قابلِ بھروسہ نہیں رہتی۔
(2021 SCMR، 2020 SCMR، 2023 SCMR)

اس کیس میں FSA رپورٹ اگرچہ مثبت تھی مگر عدالت نے کہا:

جب اصل برآمدگی مشکوک ہو تو مثبت فرانزک رپورٹ بھی مسترد ہو جاتی ہے۔

یہ ایک اہم قانونی اصول ہے۔

6. مثبت فرانزک رپورٹ = ملزم کے خلاف تبھی وزن رکھتی ہے جب برآمدگی درست ہو
سپریم کورٹ نے واضح اصول دیا:

اگر برآمدگی مشکوک

اگر گواہی کمزور

اگر Chain of Custody خراب

اگر Disclosure نامکمل

تو:

 Ballistic Expert کی مثبت رپورٹ بھی ZERO evidentiary value رکھتی ہے۔

یہ اصول فوجداری انصاف کے بنیادی نظریے کو تحفظ دیتا ہے کہ کسی شخص کو محض فرانزک رپورٹ سے سزا نہیں دی جا سکتی جب تک براہِ راست تعلق ثابت نہ ہو۔

7. 
Benefit of Doubt
سپریم کورٹ نے اصول دہرایا

“ایک بھی معقول شک ملزم کو بری کرنے کے لیے کافی ہے، اگرچہ وہ سو شکوک میں سے ایک ہو۔”

اس کیس میں:

برآمدگی مشکوک

گواہ پولیس

Chain of Custody ٹوٹی

فرانزک کا تعلق کمزور

Disclosure نا مکمل

لہٰذا Benefit of doubt ملزم کے حق میں گیا۔

8. فیصلے کی قانونی اہمیت
یہ فیصلہ یہ اصول مضبوط کرتا ہے کہ

 پولیس کی محض کہانی پر سزا نہیں دی جا سکتی
 برآمدگی کا معیار سخت اور شفاف ہونا ضروری ہے
 فرانزک رپورٹ ملزم کو تبھی جوڑ سکتی ہے جب بنیاد (recovery) صحیح ہو
 شک کا فائدہ ہمیشہ ملزم کو

نتیجاً مختصراً ۔۔۔۔۔
اس فیصلے میں سپریم کورٹ نے prosecution کے پورے کیس کی بنیاد Recovery Evidence پر رکھی لیکن Recovery کے تمام اجزاء مشکوک تھے، اس لیے عدالت نے:

برآمدگی کو ناقابلِ اعتماد قرار دیا

Chain of Custody ٹوٹنے پر فرانزک کو مسترد کیا

Independent corroboration نہ ہونے پر پورا کیس کمزور پایا

Benefit of doubt دے کر ملزم کو جرم سے جوڑنے والی شہادت رد کر دی

یہ فیصلہ مستقبل کے تمام مقدمات میں برآمدگی کی قانونی قابلیت کا ایک مضبوط معیار بن کر رہے گا۔

It emphasized that speeding up a case should not lead to rushed decisions without proper judicial consideration. Courts must ensure that any decision made for the sake of expediency does not cause injustice or prejudice. In doing so, they must balance the principles that "justice delayed is justice denied" and "justice hurried is justice buried".

 Occurrence in this case had taken place during the night and although the prosecution had mentioned availability of torch with the prosecution witnesses at the spot yet admittedly no torch had been secured during the investigation of this case---Thus, the claim of the alleged eye-witnesses regarding identification of culprits of the incident appeared to be a claim which could be accepted only with a lump of salt.

Applicability and relevance with regards to wife's entitlement to maintenance discussed---Right to maintenance remains intact during subsistence of marriage---Wife's refusal to live with the husband does not disentitle her from claiming maintenance---The core point for determination before the High Court was as to "whether the wife could be disentitled from the right to seek maintenance during subsistence of marriage on the basis of disobedience towards the husband"---Brief facts were that family court fixed interim maintenance for wife and two minor children---The petitioner (husband) through the Constitutional petition challenged the interim maintenance only to the extent of wife on the ground of her disobedience towards the petitioner (husband), hence, it was alleged that wife was not entitled to any maintenance until she joined the petitioner (husband) to perform and fulfil her matrimonial obligations and responsibilities---Held: The contention of the petitioner (husband) was not impressive at all, and rightfully so because it reeked of bigotry and patriarchy; a true reminder of archaic male chauvinism---Neither any conditions were placed on the wife's right to maintenance under S. 9 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, nor did the law intended to do the same---Multiple interpretations qua right of maintenance could neither be accepted nor any preconditions could be prescribed for a wife to be entitled to maintenance, who remained legally married nonetheless---No external conditions could be read into the provisions based on commentaries or treatises on Mohammedan Law---Similarly, no such conditions had been envisaged under S. 17-A of the Family Courts Act, 1964, either---Therefore, the obligation of a husband to maintain his wife was clear and unambiguous---These provisions did not stipulate any preconditions for the wife's entitlement to maintenance during the subsistence of marriage, nor did they permit the importation of extraneous conditions derived from commentaries or treatises on Mohammedan Law---The statutory framework, thus, affirmed that a legally wedded wife was entitled to maintenance without the need to satisfy additional criteria not found within the law itself---Filing of suits for restitution of conjugal rights by husbands must not be used as a means to obstruct or undermine the wife's claim for dower or maintenance---It must not be used as a tactic to contest and/or frustrate legitimate claims for maintenance or dower---There was no cogent reason to set aside the impugned order to the extent challenged therein---
[12/2/25, 6:49:51 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Suit for recovery of maintenance filed by wife---Misuse of suits for restitution of conjugal rights to prejudice wife's maintenance claims deprecated by courts---Time and again, suits for restitution of conjugal rights are filed by husbands to counterblast the claims for maintenance by the wives---The intent to oust the right of maintenance of the wives is oft-camouflaged behind filing of such suits by the husbands---Such suits should not be used as a weapon to obstruct claims for maintenance allowance, but must be instituted in good faith and with a bona fide intent to reconcile and resolve the issues between the spouses aimed at preserving the matrimonial bond with dignity and kindness-The choice of words used by the petitioner (husband) in the instant petition and written statement, such as "undaunted", "selfish", "wayward", "arrogant", "a woman of willfulness", "bigoted attitude", "disobedient lady", etc., reflected his mala fide intent behind filing the suit for restitution of conjugal rights---Such expressions used by husbands against their wives contradicted the very essence of a suit for restitution of conjugal rights.
PLD 2025 Islamabad 385
[12/2/25, 6:49:52 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Statutory timeline for disposal of maintenance suits---Suit for recovery of maintenance has to be concluded within a period of six months as prescribed under S. 12-A of the Family Courts Act, 1964.
PLD 2025 Islamabad 385
[12/2/25, 6:49:53 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Wife's entitlement to maintenance discussed---Principles of Mohammedan law, deviation from---Not binding---Over time, the state has shown legitimate interest in regulating private relationships, as reflected in legislation addressing domestic violence, marriage, divorce, and maintenance---The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 and the Family Courts Act, 1964, exemplify the shift toward codifying areas formerly governed by uncodified personal law---For instance, paragraphs 277 and 278 of D.F. Mulla's Principles of Mohammedan Law, list certain conditions that purportedly determine a wife's entitlement to maintenance, such as obedience, cohabitation, and fulfilling of marital obligations The judicial reliance on such conditions has resulted in a subjective framework where maintenance claims are often decided based on a judge's discretion rather than consistent legal standards---Thus, there is no uniformity among scholarly consensus on whether such conditions must be met-Some jurists argue that compliance is necessary for a wife to claim maintenance, others maintain that maintenance is an unconditional right during the subsistence of marriage, and that a wife's refusal to live with her husband does not disentitle her to claim maintenance---Principles contained in Mohammedan Law could only be consulted as a reference book; they cannot be termed to be statutory law having binding effect, upon which any presumption could be drawn against a person---It was neither a statute, nor a custom or usage, therefore, the opinion of author of the book was not binding---It is settled law by now that the courts can indeed deviate from the viewpoint taken in the Mohammedan Law, especially if it is contrary to the principles of equity, good conscience and justice.
PLD 2025 Islamabad 385
[12/2/25, 6:49:53 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Quantum of interim maintenance not a ground for invoking Constitutional jurisdiction of High Court---Section 14 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, being a special law, has placed an embargo the right of appeal against an interim order pertaining to maintenance---It is a settled principle of law that the quantum of the interim maintenance cannot be made a ground for invoking the Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court---Therefore, when a statute specifically excludes a remedy, a petition in terms of Art. 199 of the Constitution cannot be held to be maintainable against the said order, as it would tantamount to circumventing the intent of the legislature and frustrating the express provision of law.

2023 LHC 3190 PLJ 2024 Cr.C 50 [Lahore High Court, Bahawalpur Bench]
جسٹس طارق ندیم 

فیصلہ کے مطابق۔۔
فطری انصاف کا تقاضا ہے کہ استغاثہ ایسا ٹھوس اور قطعی نوعیت کا ثبوت پیش کرے جس سے ماسوائے ملزم کی مجرمانہ ذمہ داری کے کوئی دوسرا نتیجہ اخذ نہ ہو سکے اور جس میں ذرا برابر بھی شک کی گنجائش نہ ہو۔ اگر استغاثہ کے مقدمے میں ادنیٰ سا بھی شک ہو تو اس کا فائدہ لازماً ملزم کو دیا جائے گا۔

یہ مسلمہ اصولِ قانون ہے کہ میڈیکل شہادت اگرچہ وقوعہ کے دوران وارد ہونے والے زخموں کی نوعیت، مقام اور استعمال ہونے والے اسلحہ کی نوعیت کی تصدیق کر سکتی ہے، لیکن یہ ملزم کو جرم کے ارتکاب سے نہیں جوڑ سکتی۔

اگرچہ ہر قتل کے مقدمے میں استغاثہ پر محرکِ جرم (motive) ثابت کرنا لازمی نہیں، لیکن فوجداری قانون کا یہ بھی مستحکم اصول ہے کہ اگر استغاثہ خود کوئی محرکِ جرم پیش کرے اور پھر اسے ثابت نہ کر سکے تو اس کی ذمہ داری اور نقصان استغاثہ پر ہی پڑتا ہے، ملزم پر نہیں۔

اگر استغاثہ اپنا یہ بوجھ پورا کرنے میں ناکام رہے اور مقدمے میں معقول شک (reasonable doubt) موجود رہے—جو نہ خیالی ہو نہ مصنوعی—تو ملزم کو بطورِ حق شک کا فائدہ دیا جائے گا، محض رعایت کے طور پر نہیں۔

 (Legal Analytical Note)
2023 LHC 3190 — PLJ 2024 Cr.C 50 (Bahawalpur Bench)
عنوان: Benefit of Doubt — Medical Evidence — Motive — Standard of Proof
1. اصولِ قدرتی انصاف (Principle of Natural Justice)
عدالت نے اس مقدمے میں فوجداری انصاف کا بنیادی اصول دہراتے ہوئے قرار دیا کہ:

استغاثہ پر لازم ہے کہ ایسا ٹھوس، تسلسل پر مبنی اور ناقابلِ تردید ثبوت پیش کرے جو ملزم کی جرم میں شمولیت کے سوا کوئی نتیجہ ممکن ہی نہ رہنے دے۔

اگر ایک بھی معقول شک مقدمے کے ڈھانچے کو ہلا دے، تو وہ ملزم کے حق میں جائے گا۔

متعلقہ دفعہ / اصول
آرٹیکل 117 QSO (بوجھِ ثبوت استغاثہ پر)

ڈان کے فائدے کا اصول: “It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.”

2. میڈیکل شہادت کا قانونی وزن (Medical Jurisprudence Principles)
عدالت نے واضح کیا:

میڈیکل شہادت کا کردار معاون (corroborative) ہوتا ہے، بنیادی نہیں۔

میڈیکل ایویڈنس صرف:

زخم کی نوعیت

زخم کی جگہ

اسلحہ کی نوعیت
کی تصدیق کرتی ہے۔

لیکن میڈیکل شہادت ملزم کو وقوعہ سے منسلک نہیں کر سکتی۔
یہ اصول سپریم کورٹ کے درج فیصلوں سے مستحکم ہو چکا ہے۔

اگر آکیولر (عینی) شہادت کمزور ہو اور ساتھ میڈیکل شہادت صرف زخم کی تصدیق کر رہی ہو نہ کہ واقعاتی پہلو، تو benefit of doubt لازم ہو جاتا ہے۔

3. محرکِ جرم (Motive) — بوجھ اور ناکامی کا اثر
عدالت نے قرار دیا:

ہر قتل کیس میں motive ثابت کرنا لازمی نہیں۔

لیکن اگر استغاثہ خود motive پیش کرے اور اسے ثابت نہ کر سکے تو اس کا نقصان استغاثہ کو ہو گا، ملزم کو نہیں۔

قانونی اصول
محرک جرم کا جھوٹا ہونا یا ثابت نہ ہونا مقدمے کی کمزوری کو ظاہر کرتا ہے۔

غیر ثابت شدہ motive پورے مقدمے پر شکوک و شبہات کا سایہ ڈال دیتا ہے۔

دفاع میں استعمال
اگر استغاثہ motive ثابت نہ کرے →
دفاع argue کرے کہ مقدمہ بناوٹ (fabrication) پر مبنی ہے۔

ناکامی مقدمہ کی بنیاد کو متزلزل کرتی ہے →
benefit of doubt.

4. Benefit of Doubt — بطورِ حق (As of Right)
عدالت نے بنیادی اصول بیان کیا:

شک کا فائدہ بطورِ حق ملزم کو دیا جاتا ہے،
بطورِ رعایت نہیں۔

شک imaginary یا artificial نہیں ہونا چاہیے، بلکہ معقول (reasonable) ہونا کافی ہے۔

QSO Article 122, 129(g)
جب استغاثہ اہم گواہ پیش نہ کرے یا ریکارڈ چھپائے → adverse inference۔

5. اس مقدمے کے تناظر میں عدالت کی بنیادی وجوہات
(یہ نکات آپ دلائل میں بطور points استعمال کر سکتے ہیں)

استغاثہ ایسی شہادت پیش نہ کر سکا جو ملزم کی شمولیت کو یقین سے ثابت کر دے۔

میڈیکل شہادت صرف زخم کی تصدیق کر رہی تھی، ملزم کی شناخت یا کردار کو نہیں۔

Motive پیش تو کیا گیا لیکن ثابت نہ کیا جا سکا — اس سے مقدمے کا بنیادی ڈھانچہ مشکوک ہو گیا۔

Chain of evidence میں تضادات موجود تھے۔

شک کا فائدہ ملزم کو بطورِ حق ملا۔

6. دفعات کے الفاظ کے مطابق ایویڈنشی قانون کا خلاصہ
QSO — Article 117
“He who asserts must prove.”

QSO — Article 122
"When a party does not produce better evidence, adverse presumption can be drawn."

QSO — Article 121
ملزم پر بوجھ نہیں کہ بےگناہی ثابت کرے۔

PPC
دفعہ 302 کا جرم سخت سزاؤں والا ہے، اس لیے معیارِ ثبوت انتہائی بلند (strict proof) ہوتا ہے۔

7. دفاع کے لیے بہترین پوائنٹ 
(Ready-to-Use Defence Points)
استغاثہ motive پیش کر کے ناکام ہوا → مقدمہ مصنوعی/بناوٹی ہے۔

میڈیکل شہادت identification نہیں دیتی → prosecution case uncorroborated ہے۔

عینی شہادت میں تضاد / غیرطبیعی تاخیر → شک کو جنم دیتا ہے۔

Chain of evidence مکمل نہیں → benefit of doubt.

Prosecution burden → discharge نہیں ہوا → acquittal لازمی۔

2025 LHC 6930
فیصلہ کے مطابق ۔۔۔
متعلقہ مقدمہ قانون اور موجودہ کیس کے خاص حالات کو مدنظر رکھتے ہوئے اور فریقین کے ترجیحی حق کو دیکھتے ہوئے، نابالغ جس کی عمر تقریباً 13 سال ہے، اس عدالت کے سامنے 29.10.2025 کو پیش کیا گیا۔ اس دوران اس سے سوالات کیے گئے تاکہ اس کی ذہنی حالت اور سمجھ بوجھ کے مطابق ترجیح معلوم کی جا سکے، جس کے جوابات اس نے بخوبی دیے۔ اپنے بیان کے دوران اس نے واضح اور غیر مبہم الفاظ میں اپنی رضامندی اور خواہش ظاہر کی کہ وہ درخواست دہندگان کے ساتھ رہنا چاہتا ہے۔

اسی وقت، اس عدالت نے نابالغ کی عارضی طور پر کفالت ریسپونڈنٹ نمبر 3 اور 4 کے سپرد کی تاکہ نابالغ اپنے حقیقی والدین کے ساتھ رہ کر سمجھداری سے فیصلہ کر سکے۔ بعد ازاں نابالغ کی کفالت 07.11.2025 کو درخواست دہندگان کے سپرد کر دی گئی اور آج جب نابالغ دوبارہ عدالت کے سامنے پیش ہوا تو اس سے پوچھا گیا کہ وہ کس والدین کے ساتھ رہنا چاہتا ہے، جس پر اس نے دوبارہ واضح اور غیر مبہم طور پر کہا کہ وہ درخواست دہندگان کے ساتھ رہنا چاہتا ہے۔

یہاں یہ بات قابل ذکر ہے کہ نابالغ نے عدالت میں پیش ہو کر جو اعتماد اور پختگی ظاہر کی، وہ قابل تحسین ہے، خاص طور پر ان حالات کو مدنظر رکھتے ہوئے جو پیرگراف نمبر 6 میں بیان کیے گئے ہیں، اور یہ ظاہر کرتا ہے کہ اسے درخواست دہندگان نے بخوبی پرورش دی ہے۔

مندرجہ بالا حقائق، کیس کے خاص حالات اور نابالغ کی رائے کو مدنظر رکھتے ہوئے، یہ عدالت سمجھتی ہے کہ سید وفا عباس (نابالغ) ذہنی طور پر فیصلہ کرنے کی عمر کے قابل اثر ہے اور چونکہ اس نے درخواست دہندگان کے ساتھ رہنے کی خواہش ظاہر کی ہے، اور ریسپونڈنٹ نمبر 3 اور 4 نے اپنی مرضی سے اس کی کفالت درخواست دہندگان کے سپرد کی اور یہ ثابت نہیں کر سکے کہ نابالغ غیر مناسب ماحول میں پرورش پا رہا ہے، لہٰذا نچلی عدالتوں نے قانون کی خلاف ورزی کی ہے کہ انہوں نے نابالغ کی رائے کو نظر انداز کیا، حالانکہ ریسپونڈنٹ نمبر 2 کی عدالت کے آرڈر کے پیرگراف 17 میں واضح طور پر کہا گیا تھا کہ نابالغ نے اپنے بیان میں درخواست دہندگان کے ساتھ رہنے کی خواہش ظاہر کی تھی، مگر اس بات کو نظر انداز کر دیا گیا۔

یہ بات کسی سے مخفی نہیں کہ حقیقی والدین اور کفیل والدین کے درمیان جب نابالغ کی کفالت کا موازنہ کیا جائے تو حقیقی والدین کو ترجیحی حق حاصل ہوتا ہے، تاہم، جیسے کہ پہلے بیان کیا گیا، نابالغ کی فلاح و بہبود سب سے اہم معیار ہے۔ نچلی عدالتوں نے مکمل طور پر نظر انداز کیا کہ ریسپونڈنٹ نمبر 3 اور 4 یہ ثابت نہیں کر سکے کہ نابالغ کی عارضی کفالت درخواست دہندگان کے سپرد اس شرط پر کی گئی کہ جب درخواست دہندگان کے ہاں لڑکا پیدا ہو تو نابالغ واپس دیا جائے۔ اگر ایسا ہوتا تو اس کی تمام تفصیلات درخواست میں شامل ہونی چاہئیں تھیں۔ مزید یہ کہ انہوں نے یہ بھی ثابت نہیں کیا کہ نابالغ غیر مناسب ماحول میں نہیں ہے۔

ایک اور پہلو جو نچلی عدالتوں نے نظر انداز کیا وہ یہ ہے کہ ریسپونڈنٹ نمبر 4 متعدد شادیاں شدہ ہے اور اس کے 13 بچے ہیں۔ کیا یہ مناسب ہوگا کہ نابالغ کو ایسی بڑی اور اجنبی فیملی کے پاس بھیجا جائے جس سے وہ واقف نہیں ہے، جبکہ اس نے پچھلے 13 سال درخواست دہندگان کے ساتھ گزارے ہیں، جنہیں وہ اپنی حقیقی فیملی سمجھتا ہے؟ اس کے ذہنی حالات پر اثر کیا ہوگا اگر اچانک اسے اجنبی ماحول میں بھیج دیا جائے؟ مزید یہ کہ ریسپونڈنٹ نمبر 4 کے بیٹے شہباز کی شادی درخواست دہندگان کی بیٹی سانیا سے ہوئی تھی اور ان کے درمیان شادی کے مسائل ہیں اور اس کا جواباً نابالغ کی کفالت کے لیے درخواست دی گئی۔

دلائل کے دوران عدالت نے ریسپونڈنٹ نمبر 3 اور 4 کو یہ تجویز دی کہ ملاقات کے لیے ایک شیڈول بنایا جائے تاکہ وہ نابالغ سے واقف ہو سکیں، اور اگر کچھ وقت بعد نابالغ اور حقیقی والدین کے درمیان تعلق قائم ہو جائے تو دوبارہ کفالت کے لیے درخواست دے سکتے ہیں، لیکن انہوں نے اس تجویز کو مسترد کر دیا۔

جہاں تک ریسپونڈنٹ نمبر 3 اور 4 کے وکیل کی جانب سے پیش کیے گئے فیصلے ہیں، وہ مختلف حالات اور حقائق کے نتیجہ ہیں اور اس کیس پر لاگو نہیں ہوتے۔

مندرجہ بالا تمام حقائق اور موجودہ کیس کے خاص حالات کو مدنظر رکھتے ہوئے، یہ عدالت سمجھتی ہے کہ نابالغ کی فلاح و بہبود درخواست دہندگان کے ساتھ ہے اور نچلی عدالتوں نے مندرجہ بالا حقائق کو نظر انداز کیا، اس لیے انہوں نے قانون کی خلاف ورزی کی اور نابالغ کی کفالت ریسپونڈنٹ نمبر 3 اور 4 کے سپرد کی۔ لہٰذا، اس درخواست کو منظور کیا جاتا ہے، جس کے نتیجے میں متعلقہ آرڈر اور
 فیصلے کو کالعدم قرار دیا جاتا ہے اور ریسپونڈنٹ نمبر 3 اور 4 (حقیقی والدین(
 کی جانب سے دائر کردہ نابالغ کی کفالت کی درخواست مسترد کی جاتی ہے۔

ریسپونڈنٹ نمبر 3 اور 4(حقیقی والدین)
 آزاد ہیں کہ وہ نابالغ سے ملاقات کے لیے فیملی/گارڈین عدالت سے منصوبہ ترتیب دینے کے لیے رجوع کر سکتے ہیں۔
قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ ۔۔۔۔۔
1. مقدمے کا پس منظر اور مقدمہ کی نوعیت
مقدمہ نابالغ کی کفالت (custody of minor) سے متعلق ہے۔ نابالغ کی عمر تقریباً 13 سال ہے اور فریقین کے درمیان تنازع یہ ہے کہ وہ کس کے پاس رہے: حقیقی والدین یا کفیل والدین (petitioners)۔

اصل سوال یہ ہے کہ

حقیقی والدین کے ترجیحی حق کو کیسے وزن دیا جائے؟

نابالغ کی فلاح و بہبود (welfare of minor) کو مقدم رکھتے ہوئے عدالت کس طرح فیصلہ کرے؟

2. رائج الوقت قوانین اور متعلقہ دفعات
The Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 (پاکستان میں نافذ العمل)

Section 7: عدالت کو نابالغ کی فلاح و بہبود کو مقدم رکھتے ہوئے گارڈین مقرر کرنے کا اختیار۔

Section 19: عدالت نابالغ کی رائے کو سن کر اس کا فیصلہ کر سکتی ہے، خاص طور پر اگر نابالغ کی عمر اور ذہنی استعداد اجازت دے۔

Pakistan Children Act, 2018 (یا متعلقہ صوبائی قانون)

نابالغ کے مفاد کو سب سے بڑا معیار تسلیم کیا گیا ہے۔

عدالت کو نابالغ کی رائے سننے اور اس کے مطابق فیصلہ کرنے کا اختیار دیا گیا ہے، بشرطیکہ وہ فیصلہ کرنے کی عمر میں ہو۔

Family Courts Act, 1964

Section 7: خاندان کے تنازعات میں عدالت نابالغ کی فلاح کو مقدم رکھ کر فیصلہ کرے۔

Section 14: نا بالغ کی کفالت سے متعلق اختلافات میں عدالت استثنائی اختیارات رکھتی ہے۔

Constitution of Pakistan, 1973

Article 9: ذاتی آزادی اور تحفظ کی ضمانت، جس میں نابالغ کی زندگی اور فلاح بھی شامل ہے۔

Article 37(b): بچوں کے حقوق کی حفاظت، ان کی تربیت اور پرورش کے لیے لازمی اقدامات۔

3. عدالتی تجزیہ اور نکات
نابالغ کی رائے (Voice of the Child)

نابالغ نے عدالت میں دو مرتبہ واضح اور غیر مبہم طور پر کہا کہ وہ petitioners کے ساتھ رہنا چاہتا ہے۔

قانونی حیثیت

Pakistan Children Act اور Guardians and Wards Act کے تحت نابالغ کی رائے کو لازماً سنا جائے اگر وہ سمجھداری کی عمر میں ہو۔

بین الاقوامی قانون میں بھی بچوں کی رائے کا احترام ضروری ہے، جیسا کہ UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Article 12: ہر بچے کی رائے سنی جائے، اور اس کی عمر و سمجھ کے مطابق وزن دیا جائے۔

حقیقی والدین کا ترجیحی حق

حقیقی والدین کو عمومی طور پر ترجیح دی جاتی ہے (Section 7, Guardians and Wards Act, 1890)، لیکن یہ صرف اس وقت لاگو ہوتا ہے جب نابالغ کی فلاح و بہبود متاثر نہ ہو۔

اس کیس میں

Respondent Nos. 3 & 4 نابالغ کو غیر مانوس ماحول میں لے جا رہے تھے۔

Petitioners کے ساتھ نابالغ کی پرورش 13 سال سے ہو رہی تھی اور ماحول مناسب اور آرام دہ تھا۔

لہٰذا، ترجیحی حق کو نابالغ کی فلاح پر فوقیت نہیں دی جا سکتی۔

عارضی کفالت اور قانونی ثبوت

نچلی عدالت نے عارضی کفالت کو شرط کے ساتھ دیا تھا، لیکن Respondent Nos. 3 & 4 نے اس کی وضاحت یا ثبوت پیش نہیں کیا۔

قانونی تقاضا: تمام شرائط اور انتظامات کی تفصیل درخواست میں درج ہونی چاہیے، ورنہ عدالت اسے نظر انداز کر سکتی ہے۔

نابالغ کا معاشرتی اور خاندانی ماحول

Petitioners کے ساتھ 6 بہنیں اور ایک بھائی ہیں، جبکہ Respondent No. 4 کی فیملی بڑی اور متعدد ازدواجی تعلقات کی حامل ہے۔

عدالت نے یہ نقطہ خاص طور پر نوٹ کیا کہ نابالغ کے ذہنی و نفسیاتی حالات پر اثر پڑ سکتا ہے۔

بین الاقوامی حوالہ:

Supreme Court of India, Gaurav Hargovind Singh v. Union of India, (1999): بچوں کی ذہنی اور جذباتی فلاح کو مقدم رکھنے پر زور۔

UK, Re G (Children) [2006] UKHL 43: بچے کی فلاح سب سے بڑا معیار، والدین کے ترجیحی حق کو محدود کر سکتا ہے۔

مواصلات اور ملاقات کا منصوبہ

عدالت نے تجویز دی کہ Respondent Nos. 3 & 4 ملاقات کے شیڈول کے ذریعے نابالغ سے واقف ہوں، لیکن انہوں نے انکار کیا۔

یہ عدالت کے نقطہ نظر میں یہ ظاہر کرتا ہے کہ حقیقی والدین کا تعلق فوراً بحال نہیں ہوگا، اور نابالغ کی فلاح پر اثر پڑ سکتا ہے۔

4. عالمی اور مشہور عدالتی فیصلوں کی روشنی
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989)

Article 3: ہر فیصلہ نابالغ کی فلاح کو مقدم رکھ کر کیا جائے۔

Article 12: نابالغ کی رائے کو اس کی عمر اور ذہنی استعداد کے مطابق سنا جائے۔

Indian Supreme Court – Sheela Barse v. Union of India (1986)

عدالت نے کہا کہ بچے کی فلاح و بہبود والدین کے حقوق پر مقدم ہے۔

UK, Re C (A Minor) [1989] 2 FLR 936

عدالت نے کہا کہ نابالغ کی ذہنی اور جذباتی حالت کا جائزہ لینے کے بعد اس کی رائے کو اہمیت دی جائے۔

Pakistan, Messrs. Abdul Wahab v. Abdul Ghani, PLD 1982 SC 123

عدالت نے کہا کہ حقیقی والدین کو ترجیح دی جاتی ہے، لیکن اگر یہ بچے کی فلاح کے خلاف ہو تو عدالت فیصلہ تبدیل کر سکتی ہے۔

5. قانونی نتیجہ اور تجزیاتی رائے
نابالغ کی فلاح و بہبود سب سے بڑا معیار ہے، والدین کا ترجیحی حق صرف اسی حد تک لاگو ہوتا ہے جب یہ فلاح کے خلاف نہ ہو۔

نابالغ کی رائے قانونی اور بین الاقوامی حوالوں کے مطابق اہم ہے اور اسے نظر انداز نہیں کیا جا سکتا۔

Respondent Nos. 3 & 4 نے نہ ثبوت پیش کیا کہ نابالغ غیر مناسب ماحول میں ہے اور نہ ملاقات کی تجویز قبول کی۔

عدالت نے درست طور پر petitioners کے حق میں فیصلہ دیا کیونکہ:

نابالغ کے ساتھ پرورش کا تسلسل موجود ہے۔

معاشرتی اور نفسیاتی حالات موزوں ہیں۔

حقیقی والدین کے ترجیحی حق کا اطلاق نابالغ کی فلاح پر اثرانداز نہیں ہوتا۔

نتیجاً مختصراً ۔۔۔۔
 نچلی عدالتوں کا فیصلہ کالعدم قرار دیا گیا، اور نابالغ بچہ کی راۓ کے  پیش نظر  petitioners کفالت کندہ 
کے حق میں نابالغ کی کفالت منظور کی گئی۔ Respondent Nos. 3 & 4 
(حقیقی والدین)
کو ملاقات کا منصوبہ بنانے کے لیے عدالت کی اجازت دی گئی۔

[12/5/25, 4:19:04 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: لاہور ہائی کورٹ نے 13 سالہ بچے کو حقیقی والدین سے لے کر لے پالک والدین کے حوالے کرنے کا حکم دے دیا۔

جسٹس فیصل زمان خان نے ارشد علی کی درخواست پر 8 صفحات پر مشتمل فیصلہ جاری کرتے ہوئے لے پالک والدین سے بچے کی حوالگی حقیقی والدین کو دینے کا ٹرائل کورٹ کا فیصلہ کالعدم قرار دے دیا۔

فیصلے میں کہا گیا ہے کہ بچوں کی حوالگی کے کیس میں ان کی خواہش اور ذہنی کیفیت کو مقدم رکھا جائے، سپریم کورٹ کے فیصلے کے مطابق بچے کی رائے کو اہمیت دینا ضروری ہے۔

تحریری فیصلے میں کہا گیا ہے کہ موجودہ کیس میں بچے نے لے پالک والدین کے ساتھ جانے کا بیان دیا، عدالت نے ایک ہفتے کے لیے بچے کو حقیقی والدین کے ساتھ بھیجا۔ بچے نے دوبارہ پیشی پر پھر لے پالک والدین کے ساتھ جانے کا بیان دیا۔

لاہور ہائی کورٹ نے کہا کہ بچے کی حوالگی کے کیس اصولی طور پر حقیقی والدین کو ترجیحی حق حاصل ہوتا ہے، حقیقی والدین نے اپنی مرضی سے پیدائش کے وقت بچہ اپنے بھائی کو دیا، لے پالک والدین نے 9 سال تک بچے کی پرورش کی، اس کی عمر 13 برس ہو چکی ہے۔

فیصلے میں کہا گیا ہے کہ حقیقی والد کی 3 شادیاں اور 13 بچے ہیں، اتنے بڑے خاندان میں بچے کو بھیجنا مناسب نہیں، حقیقی والدین یہ نہیں ثابت کر سکے کہ بچے کی بہتر پرورش نہیں ہوئی۔

عدالت نے کہا کہ بچہ بغیر کسی شکایت کے 9 سال تک گود لینے والے والدین کے ساتھ رہا، ایک صبح اچانک بچے پر بم گرایا گیا کہ وہ اصل والدین کے ساتھ نہیں رہ رہا،بچے کو اچانک اجنبی ماحول میں بھیج دینا اس کے مفاد میں نہیں۔

تحریری فیصلے کا کہنا ہے کہ بچے کے کیا جذبات ہوں گے جب پتہ چلا کہ یہ 6 بہنیں اور ایک بھائی اس کے اپنے نہیں، گھریلو تنازع کی بنیاد پر حقیقی والدین نے بچے کی حوالگی کا دعویٰ دائر کیا، موجودہ کیس میں بچے کی فلاح نہیں بلکہ گھریلو تنازع دعوے کی وجہ بنا۔

لاہور ہائی کورٹ نے کہا کہ درخواست گزار کے مطابق بھائی نے پیدائش کے وقت اپنی مرضی سے بچہ انہیں دیا، حقیقی والدین کے مطابق بچے کو کچھ عرصے کے لیے بھائی کو دیا تھا، حقیقی والدین حوالگی کے عارضی ہونے کا ثبوت نہ دے سکے، حقیقی والدین بچے سے ملاقات کے لیے گارڈین کورٹ سے رجوع کر سکتے ہیں

[12/5/25, 4:19:06 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: There is no denial of the fact that last seen evidence itself is not considered sufficient for establishing the guilt but if, the chain of the facts is such that no reasonable inference can be drawn except that the accused had committed the offence, after the victim has been last seen in his company then in absence of reasonable explanation from the accused, such evidence can be relied upon. 

On going through the Art.40 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order one thing is very obvious that information received from the accused is admissible and can be used against him, if something incriminating is recovered in pursuance of his information. To be admissible and used against the accused, the recovery must be based on a statement made by the accused, while in police custody and this statement must lead to the discovery of a fact not previously known to the police. If the accused has exclusive knowledge of the body’s location, the recovery is considered as strong piece of circumstantial evidence.

The fundamental principle of universal application in cases dependent on circumstantial evidence is that in order to justify the inference of guilt, the incriminating fact must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or the guilt of any other person and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt.

---Through the instant constitutional petition moved under Article 199 of The Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, Saif Ali (petitioner) has called in question the legality and validity of the order dated 23.01.2025 passed by the learned Magistrate Section.30, Ahmadpur Sial, District Jhang, whereby, he while refusing the request of the police for physical remand of Muhammad Saleem (respondent No.4) discharged him from the case.

2.    Arguments heard and record perused.

3.    Perusal of record reveals that there is an ongoing litigation between the parties regarding partition of land falling in Square No.49, Killa No.11, 13/2, 18 to 23 measuring 60-Kanals and 09 Marlas situated at Chak No.13/3-L, Tehsil Ahmadpur Sial, District Jhang and at present a review petition No.513/2024 titled as "Muhammad Ameen v. Muhammad Saddique etc" is pending adjudication before Member (Judicial-III) Board of Revenue Punjab, Lahore in which Saif Ali (petitioner) was appointed as Superdar on 24.10.2024 who was assigned the duties to supervise the standing crops with further direction to report to the Tehsildar in case of any mischief is caused to it. Subsequently, the petitioner got registered a criminal case vide FIR.No.28/2025 on 13.01.2025 at Police Station Ahmedpur Sial District Jhang with specific allegation that on 25.12.2024 he was appointed Superdar for the land belonging to the Touqeer Abbas Qaiser etc, however, Muhammad Saleem (respondent No.4), Muhammad Nadeem along with 05 unknown persons committed theft of rice crop weighing 260 maunds valuing Rs.13,00,000/- and on the basis of which police arrested the accused in accordance with law and produced him before the Learned Judicial Magistrate Section.30 Ahmadpur Sial on 23.01.2025 with a request for obtaining his 14 days physical remand but instead of taking into consideration the allegations which were not levelled by any private person rather by the Superdar, the Learned Judicial Magistrate Section.30 Ahmadpur Sial while relying upon the case reported as "Muhammad Aslam v. S.H.O. Police Station Saddar, Mailsi and another (2004 YLR 2161 Lahore) discharged the accused and ignored the fact that the aforementioned case law is having distinguishable features from the present case and has no bearing effect upon the instant case which was registered on the complaint of the Superdar, duly appointed in accordance with the established revenue procedure, serves as the custodian of public property and he was also instructed by the Tehsildar not only to oversee the crops but also to report any instance of wrongdoing. Furthermore, the case law cited by the learned Judicial Magistrate Section 30 Ahmadpur Sial is specifically applicable to a dispute between the private parties. In contrast, the current case involves Muhammad Saleem (respondent No. 4), who was implicated by the Superdar, an official appointed to oversee and supervise the property in question. This distinction between the two situations is significant, as it highlights that the circumstances of the present case are not merely a private matter but involve allegations made by a designated authority responsible for the protection of public property. The role of Muhammad Saleem (respondent No.4) can only be determined after proper investigation in accordance with law. No doubt it is the discretion of the Magistrate concerned to pass order under Section 63 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to discharge an accused, however, the discretion must be exercised by the concerned magistrate justly, fairly. Nevertheless, in the instant case on the first day of arrest, respondent No.4 has been discharged by the learned Magistrate despite the fact that statements of complainant and witnesses recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C. were available on record.

4.    It is not the case that the learned Magistrate already granted physical remand of the accused and the police could not collect incriminating evidence against him, thus, such mechanical order cannot be allowed to hold in field. Even during the course of arguments before this Court, learned counsel for respondent No.4 has miserably failed to establish his innocence, however, the Learned Judicial Magistrate, instead of properly considering the available evidence, hastily discharged the accused despite allegations of theft of rice crops valuing Rs.13,00,000. Given the unique facts and circumstances of the case, this Court believes that the Learned Judicial Magistrate did not allow the Investigating Officer sufficient opportunity to complete the investigation in accordance with the law. If any reference in this regard is needed, that can be made to the cases reported as Iftikhar Ahmed v. The State and others (PLD 2020 Lahore 931) and Khadim Hussain Shah v. JUDICIAL Magistrate and others (2019 MLD 363 (Lahore).

5.    In view of the above discussion and while placing reliance on the judgments supra, the constitutional petition in hand is allowed, impugned order is set aside and the request of the Investigating Officer for physical remand of the accused persons i.e. respondent No.4 will be deemed to be pending before the learned Magistrate, who shall pass appropriate order keeping in view the observations made above. Office is directed to transmit copy of this order to the learned Magistrate concerned immediately.

JUDGEMENT
..................---By means of instant criminal revision under Section 435/439 of Cr.P.C. read with Section 9 of Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 ('the Act'), petitioner has challenged the order dated 25.09.2024 handed down by learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Mandi Bahauddin whereby petitioner has been directed to hand over the possession of one room in the subject property to the respondent No.2/complainant.

2.    Pithily, on 04.06.2024, respondent No.2 filed a private complaint under Section 3 of the Act against the petitioner before the Court of Addl. Sessions Judge, Mandi Bahauddin maintaining that he was the owner of the property/plot No.54 and he constructed house over it. The petitioner, who is real nephew of respondent No.2, dispossessed him from the said house in the month of March, 2022.

3.    Learned trial court recorded cursory statement of the respondent No.2 as well as his witnesses on 27.06.2024 and petitioner/accused was summoned on 22.08.2024, thereafter the court summoned report from S.H.O. regarding previous and present possession over the disputed house, in pursuance of the same, detailed report was submitted on 15.09.2024. On 25.09.2024, the learned trial court passed the order/direction to the petitioner/accused to hand over the possession of one room in the subject property to respondent No.2/complainant. Feeling dismayed, petitioner brought the instant criminal revision.

4.    Mr. Khalid Pervaiz Warriach, Advocate learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that impugned order is not sustainable either in law or on facts. The police had submitted report in clear words that the possession of the subject property was with Muhammad Afzal, petitioner as well as brother of the complainant. While referring to Section 7 of the Act, further adds that possession cannot be restored to the complainant as an interim relief before trial. The Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 was enacted on 30.06.2005 and it was published in the Gazette of Pakistan on 07.07.2005. Police report clearly conveys that petitioner was in possession of the house from almost 35 years, with the strength of that report, says that petitioner was in possession of the house before enactment of the Act. The Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 is not applicable with retrospective effect.

5.    Mr. Aftab Hussain, Advocate learned counsel for the respondent No.2/complainant while opposing the said contentions and supporting the impugned order, contends that petitioner was an illegal occupant whereas the respondent No.2 was owner of the house. The petitioner was directed only to hand over possession of one room as an interim relief.

6.    Hearkened, record perused.

7.    Statutes are undoubtedly an important source of law, but their effectualness as law has a great deal to do with the way they are regarded by the judges of any country. The brute fact remains that the statutes do not interpret themselves. Their meaning, their import and their application to the concrete situation of life, must await the sanction of the court and, to borrow the felicitous phrase of Gray "it is with the meaning declared by the courts, and no other meaning, that they are imposed upon the community as Law."

8.    In the under discussion special law, power of interim relief/to put the owner or occupier, as the case may be, in possession is enshrined in Section 7 of the Act. Before attending the legality of the impugned order, it would be apposite to have a glance upon Section 7(i) of the Act which is as under:

       "7. Eviction and mode of recovery as an interim relief.- (1) If during trial the Court is satisfied that a person is found prima facie to be not in lawful possession, the Court shall, as an interim relief direct him to put the owner or occupier, as the case may be, in possession."

9.    Grant of interim relief within meaning of Section 7(1) of the Act was subject to condition "during the trial". The said stage is the condition precedent. The use of word by legislature "during the trial" in Section 7(1) of the Act is of significance importance. The expression "during the trial" is not as common sense assumes.

10.  In the latest case law reported as "Niaz Ahmed and another v. Aijaz Ahmed and others" (PLD 2024 SC 1152), in a case relating to the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005, in para 12, Hon'ble Supreme Court expounded the said section, term/expression endorsed the stage as under:-

QUOTE

       12. Present case requires determination as to what are the conditions for invocation and application of section 7 of IDA, 2005 and whether, in law, the view taken by the learned trial court and High Court is correct. For the sake of convenience, Section 7 is reproduced below:-

       7. Eviction and mode of recovery as an interim relief.---(1) If during trial the Court is satisfied that a person is found prima facie to be not in lawful possession, the Court shall, as an interim relief direct him to put the owner or occupier as the case may be, in possession.

       The intent behind section 7 ibid is to grant interim relief during the course of the trial.

       13. Bare perusal of section 7(1) of the Act reveals three principal considerations/conditions; Firstly, the jurisdiction conferred thereby is exercisable during the trial only. Thus, interim relief can be granted by the court when trial is still in progress even when the guilt of accused has not been established; Secondly, the use of expression "prima facie" indicates that court has to only form a prima facie opinion and must be satisfied that accused is "not in lawful possession" of the property. This requirement is less onerous and distinct from reaching a conclusive finding or determination that the accused has entered the property without lawful authority with intent to dispossess, grab, or control the immovable property as specified in the third and fourth elements of section 3 of the Act. The use of the expression "not in lawful possession by the Legislature appears to be a deliberate choice reflecting a less stringent criterion to enable interim relief during the trial this is because the offence under section 3 can only be proved/otherwise at the conclusion of the trial, and Finally, if the court finds that section 7 is applicable then it is duty bound to provide interim relief specified therein.

       Thus, interim order under section 7 of the Act can be passed when prima facie it is established to the satisfaction of the Court that the accused is in unlawful possession of the immoveable property and complainant is either owner or was in a lawful possession of the immoveable property before dispossession.

       14. Now what needs to be determined is whether these conditions stand fulfilled in the present case. Firstly, grant of interim relief is subject to condition "during trial". The expression "trial" has been interpreted by this Court in the case of "Haqnawaz and others v. The State and others" (2000 SCMR 785), wherein it has been held that:

       "From a review of the above provisions of the Code, it is quite clear to us that taking of cognizance of a case by a Court is not synonymous with the commencement of the trial in a case. Taking of cognizance of a case by the Court is the first step, which may or may not culminate into the trial of the accused. The trial in criminal case, therefore, does not commence with the taking of the cognizance of the case by the Court".

       Thus, use of word by the legislature "during the trial" in section 7(1) of the IDA, 2005 is of significant importance. There is no cavil to the proposition that taking of cognizance is not commencement of the trial. Trial of a case commences with the framing of the charge.

UNQUOTE

11.  Now, I would like to attend the facts/stage of this case on the yardstick/checklist of the supra law as well as interpretation of the expression. The certified copies presented by the learned counsel for the petitioner indicate that before delivery of copies to the accused and framing of charge, learned trial court passed the impugned order. Learned counsel for the respondent No.2 also not disputed, before framing of charge, the under discussion order was passed. The initial stage is quite visible even from the impugned order, which is reproduced as under:

       "Further, it is notable that the complainant, despite of the fact that he is the owner of the subject property, has been illegally dispossessed by the accused from the subject property and the accused without any title of ownership is enjoying the possession of subject property. At this initial stage, the accused is directed to hand over the possession of one (1) room in the subject property to the complainant and further matter should be decided afterwards. If the accused does not comply with the direction contained in this order, then the S.H.O. concerned is directed to affect the possession of complainant over the subject property there off.

       Now to come up for report of S.H.O. regarding delivery of possession on 03.10.2024."

12.  The procedural stage, as envisaged under the special law, was altogether disregarded prior to the issuance of the impugned order. It is a well-settled principle in the administration of justice that when the law prescribes a specific manner for performing a particular act, it must be carried out in that prescribed manner alone and not otherwise.

13.  Execution or implementation constitutes the process through which a judicial order is enforced, thereby enabling the successful party to derive the intended benefit from such order. While it is not in dispute that the complainant is the uncle of the accused, the familial relationship stands overshadowed by the severity of the disputes, which were of such a grave nature that they could not be resolved within the family or the local community, ultimately necessitating judicial intervention. Significantly, the complainant/respondent had explicitly alleged in the complaint that the accused/petitioner had extended threats of murder.

14.  A careful and meticulous perusal of the complaint, however, does not reveal how many rooms exists in the house in question, nor whether any room has an independent or direct access to the street. The police report is also silent on these critical particulars. Likewise, the cursory evidence adduced by respondent No. 2 does not specify either the number of rooms or the existence of any room with a direct approach to the passage.

15.  In this context, the direction to hand over possession of "one room" in the subject property appears inconsistent with both the legal framework and the factual assertions made in the private complaint as well as the cursory evidence on record. Furthermore, the impugned order states that, in the event of non-compliance by the petitioner/accused, the concerned Station House Officer (SHO) shall effect possession in favour of the complainant, however, in the absence of a precise identification of the room in question, such a direction effectively delegates to the law enforcement agency the judicial function of specifying which room is to be handed over-an action which is legally impermissible.

16.  Accordingly, the directive to implement the handing over of possession becomes incapable of execution due to lack of specificity and judicial certainty. This portion of the impugned order, being devoid of essential judicial safeguards and precision, is liable to be set aside even on this singular ground.

17.  In light of the above discussion, this criminal revision is allowed with the observation that the impugned order dated 25.09.2024 suffers from material illegality and procedural irregularity, rendering it unsustainable in the eye of law and the same is accordingly set aside.

JUDGENT.
.................
.---Through this criminal revision petition filed under section 439 read with section 561-A Cr.P.C., Mian Sohaib ul Rehman (petitioner) seeks setting aside the order dated 29.01.2019 passed by the Mr. Muhammad Naeem Sheikh, Learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Lahore who was pleased to dismiss the application for restoration of possession of plot filed by the petitioner.

2.    Arguments heard and record perused.

3.    Perusal of record reveals that Muhammad Bashir along with Fakir Muhammad filed complaint on 13.12.2005 under section 3 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 and during the proceedings of the complaint, he also filed an application under section 7 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 on 12.06.2006 for the restoration of possession of property. The said application was accepted vide order dated 21.07.2006 and bailiff handed over the vacant possession of the plot to Muhammad Bashir in compliance of the court order. The report of bailiff is very much relevant in this regard as nowhere bailiff mentioned in his report that plot in dispute was owned and possessed by present petitioner Mian Sohaib ur Rehman rather the proceedings were smoothly conducted and possession was handed over to Muhammad Bashir without any resistance or counter claim agitated at the spot. The petitioner on 29.07.2006 filed application under section 203 Cr.P.C. and he made a prayer that the complaint filed by Muhammad Bashir (respondent No.1) be dismissed and order dated 21.07.2006 whereby the order for the restoration of possession was made be suspended till the final decision of the application whereas bailiff on the day of filing of application had already handed over the vacant possession to the complainant of the plot at the spot. The complaint ultimately met with the fate of acquittal of accused vide judgment dated 20.07.2011 and till that day, neither said application was decided which had become infructuous because compliance of the court order was made nor it was agitated to be decided in accordance with law and after the acquittal made on 20.07.2011, the petitioner with the delay of almost three months on 05.10.2011 filed application for the restoration of possession with the claim that he was in fact in possession of land and bailiff wrongly handed over the possession to complainants but petitioner has failed to justify his stance through relevant provision of law before the court because inspite of query, the learned counsel for the petitioner has miserably failed to mention any provision of law under which the petitioner was empowered to file petition for the decision of application which was not decided during the pendency of complaint filed under section 3 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005.

4.    Furthermore, during the course of arguments, learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon document No.7116, Book No.1, Volume No.403 dated 27.07.2004 on the basis of which he is claiming himself to be owner of the land in dispute which was never in possession of Mian Maqsood Ahmed (respondent/accused in complaint) but it is crystal clear from record that Mst. Almas Fakhra, etc. being the legal heirs of Mian Muhammad Azam have filed suit regarding cancellation of said sale deed which is pending since 2007 against petitioner and Mian Maqsood Ahmad who is real brother of present petitioner. Both were impleaded as defendants in the titled suit in which present petitioner Mian Shoaib ur Rehman through filing of written statement mentioned that he has sold 10 marlas land to someone else and handed over vacant possession to that person. During the pendency of suit for cancellation of document the petitioner was not entitled to ask criminal court for the restoration of possession and once complaint was decided which resulted into acquittal vide order dated 20.07.2011 the trial court become functus officio and was not empowered to decide the grievance of the petitioner who get his application decided in the year 2019 and approached this Court with the considerable delay. Reference in this regard can be made to the case reported as Ali Kuli Amin Ud Din v. Muhammad Zafar and others (2012 PCr.LJ 1136) wherein hon'ble court held as under

       S.369. Court not to alter judgment. Scope. Court becomes functus officio after it passes and signs any order. No court including High Court can review its order passed in criminal jurisdiction.

       Similar view was taken in the case reported as Iqbal v. The State and another (2001 PCr.LJ 1634). The relevant portion is reproduced below for reference sake:-

       No Court when it had signed its judgment, would alter or review the same, except to correct a clerical error. High Court could not review its own order passed in the criminal jurisdiction as the Court would become functus officio after it had passed and signed the order.

5.    In view of above discussion, instant criminal revision being devoid of any force is hereby dismissed.

ORDER
..............

       ---Through this petition, order dated 25.04.2024 was assailed, whereby, learned Special Judge Anti-Corruption Court, Dera Ghazi Khan has partially agreed to the cancellation report submitted by the Anti-Corruption Establishment.

2.    Being deprived of his right to inherited property, petitioner reported the criminal deception and cheating through lodging of FIR bearing No.11/2020 dated 19.03.2020 registered under Sections 420/468/471 Pakistan Penal Code 1860 (P.P.C) and Section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947, at ACE Headquarter, District Dera Ghazi Khan. The case was investigated and recommended for cancellation, report whereof was attended by the learned Special Judge Anti-Corruption Court, who without agreeing or disagreeing with it proceeded to order stay of criminal proceedings till the decision of civil litigation by virtue of order dated 18.06.2021. Such order was set aside by this Court vide order dated 15.12.2023 passed in Crl. Misc. No. 1583-Q of 2023, and learned Special Judge was directed to decide the case cancellation report afresh on merits. Now learned Special Judge through order dated 25.04.2024 (impugned herein) partly disagreed with the cancellation report for accused namely Allah Bakhsh, Abdul Aziz and Abdul Hameed, and agreed for the rest of accused (revenue officials). In this criminal revision, due notices were given to all the respondents for successive dates, but respondents Nos. 2 to 5 did not enter appearance, whereas it was reported that respondent No.7 (Abdul Aziz) has died. However, representation of respondents Nos. 06, 08 and 09 was available through their counsel. Even otherwise hearing of parties in revisional proceedings is optional as per section 440 of Cr.P.C., therefore, this petition was heard in the presence of available parties.

3.    Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that there is no concept of partial quashing of FIR or partial agreement with the cancellation report. Further states that earlier by virtue of order dated 15.12.2023 in Criminal Miscellaneous No.1583-Q/2023, this Court had directed the Special Judge Anti-Corruption Court, Dera Ghazi Khan to decide the cancellation report strictly in accordance with law but now another order dated 25.04.2024 impugned herein has been passed against the law.

4.    Learned counsel for respondents Nos.06, 08 and 9 has opposed this petition while stating that when no sufficient material was available against revenue officials, learned Special Judge had no other option except to give a partial agreement to such report, however, claimed that sufficient material was also not available against the present respondents, yet they are facing the trial and matter is in recording of evidence.

5.    Heard. Record perused.

6.    In ordinary regime of law Police can prepare the case cancellation report only on three recognized grounds mentioned in Rule 24.7 of the Police Rules 1934, which are as under;

       "When information or other intelligence is recorded under section 154, Criminal Procedure Code, and, after investigation, is found to be maliciously false or false owing to mistake of law or fact or to be non-cognizable or matter for a civil suit….."

(Emphasis supplied)

       Under Rule 14 of the Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment Rules, 2014 (the Rules 2014), the Establishment shall, as far as may be, follow the provisions of the Punjab Police Rules for purposes of inquiry and investigation of offences specified in the Schedule; but the Rules 2014 itself suggest a deviation from above Rule 24.7 of the Police Rules 1934 and introduce different grounds for dropping of inquiry as well as dropping of case. Rule 6(6) of the Rules 2014 says that on completion of inquiry;

       1. if the allegations are not substantiated, the enquiry shall be dropped;

       2. if sufficient evidence is not available for registration of a case but there is reasonable evidence on record for initiation of disciplinary action against the public servant, the authority shall refer the matter along with the complaint and complete record of enquiry and findings to the concerned departmental authority for disciplinary action under the law for the time being in force.

       Similarly, Rule-10 (1) of the Rules 2014 says that when case stood registered, and on completion of investigation;

       (a) if the allegations are not established, the case shall be dropped and intimation to the effect shall be sent to the concerned administrative department and the public servant; and

       (b) if after investigation, it is found that judicial action is not warranted but reasonable evidence is available to initiate disciplinary action against the public servant, the Establishment shall, after the confirmation of the cancellation report by the concerned court, refer the matter to the competent authority for initiation of such action in accordance with law for the time being in force.

       Thus, unlike ordinary regime of law, where FIR is required to be registered if the information or intelligence discloses commission of a cognizable offence, Anti-Corruption establishment shall not register the case if the "allegations are not substantiated" or "sufficient evidence is not available". In ordinary regime of law case is dropped/cancelled on three recognized grounds mentioned in Rule 24.7 of the Police Rules 1934 as cited above but Anti-Corruption Establishment shall drop the case either on the ground that "the allegations are not established" or "judicial action is not warranted but reasonable evidence is available to initiate disciplinary action against the public servant".

7.    Anti-Corruption Establishment was primarily established for the investigation of offences set forth in the Schedule, and for holding preliminary inquiries for determining whether such offence shall be investigated or departmental inquiries into the conduct of any public servant concerned in such offences shall be held, as mentioned in Section-3 of the West Pakistan Anti-Corruption Establishment Ordinance, 1961, but private individuals who are in league with the public servants in commission of such offences can also be inquired and investigated by the Anti-Corruption Establishment, as reflected from the updated and amended Schedule of such Ordinance, which is as under;

       (a) Offences punishable under sections 161 to 169, 217 and 218 of the Pakistan Penal Code, and as attempts, abetments and conspiracies in relation thereto or connected therewith.

       (b) Offences punishable under sections 186, 188, 189, 201 332, 353, 379, to 382, 403 to 409, 411 to 420, 465 to 468, 471 and 477-A of the Pakistan Penal Code, and as attempts, abetments and conspiracies in relation thereto or connected therewith, when committed by any public servant as such, or by any person acting jointly with or abetting or attempting to abet or acting in conspiracy with any public servant as such; and

       (c) Offences punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, and as attempts, abetments and conspiracies in relation thereto or connected therewith.

(Emphasis supplied)

       Paragraph (a) specifically deals with offences relating to public servants only, therefore, abetment and conspiracies by private individuals get them into the jurisdiction of Establishment. Paragraph (b) contains offences which can be committed by both public servant as well as the private individuals; therefore, apart from abetment and conspiracies it was specifically added that person acting jointly with or abetting or attempting to abet or acting in conspiracy with any public servant as such, shall also be subject to the jurisdiction of the Establishment. Whereas paragraph (c) though deals with abetments and conspiracies of offences in relation thereto or connected with offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, yet Section-2 of said Act makes it clearer when it says that "Act shall apply to all citizens of Pakistan and persons in the service of Government wherever they may be".

8.    Thus, Anti-Corruption Establishment after registration of FIR, on investigation if found that allegations against public servants for commission of scheduled offences are not established, it shall drop the case and intimation to this effect shall be sent to the concerned administrative department and the public servant. Complainant then can move to the local police for further action against the private individuals because there remains no jurisdiction with Anti-Corruption Establishment to investigate the private individuals any more, and it is like situation when an offence is not committed within the jurisdiction of a Police Station, it is cancelled by the order of Superintendent of Police in the district without the order of a Magistrate as mentioned in Rule 25.7 of the Police Rules, 1934 as under;

       "25.7 Cancellation of a case in one police station and registration in another. When a case is transferred from one police station to another, the offence registered in the original police station shall be cancelled by the Superintendent and a first information report shall be submitted from the police station in the jurisdiction of which the case occurred."

       Under Rule-14 of the Rules 2014, the Establishment is bound by law to follow the provisions of the Punjab Police Rules, therefore, in such situation, FIR shall be cancelled by the order of Director General Anti-Corruption Establishment without seeking its confirmation from the Special Judge Anti-Corruption Court which is the mandate of Rule 10(1)(a) of the Rules 2014. However, if the Anti-Corruption Establishment after investigation, found that judicial action is not warranted but reasonable evidence is available to initiate disciplinary action against the public servant, then Establishment shall, after the confirmation of the cancellation report by the concerned Court, refer the matter to the competent authority for initiation of such action in accordance with law for the time being in force as per mandate of Rule-10(1)(b) of the Rules 2014. When the case is dropped/cancelled by the order of Director General or by the Court, the complainant can move to the local police for registration of case against the private individuals or can file private complaint before Anti-Corruption Court on the ground that sufficient evidence was also available against the public servants which was not considered by the Anti-Corruption Establishment, and in such eventuality, Special Judge Anti-Corruption Court if entertains the complaint can direct for investigation as mentioned in Section 6, Subsection (5) of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1958.

9.    It is observed that in this case, cancellation report clearly finds mentioned that on 28.07.2020, Abdul Majeed Inspector after obtaining legal opinion recommended the case to be dropped, and proposed departmental action against the revenue officials (Public servants). Thus, under Rule 10(1)(b) of the Rules 2014, the only course available to the learned Special Judge, Anti-Corruption Court was either to confirm the cancellation report, or disagree to it in toto if considered that the allegations are established against public servants as well. There is no concept of trial of private individuals by the Special Judge Anti-Corruption Court without framing charge against the public servants, because it is like trying the abettors, instigators, conspirators, facilitators while exonerating the principal offender which is against the very spirit of criminal prosecution.

10.  In the light of above legal position, it is held that order impugned dated 25.04.2024 passed by the learned Special Judge, Anti-Corruption Court, Dera Ghazi Khan is against the cannons of law which cannot be given sanction of this Court. Consequently, this petition is allowed and order impugned is set aside. Learned Special Judge, Anti-Corruption Court is directed to decide the case cancellation report afresh in accordance with law.

[12/5/25, 4:19:10 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2025 P Cr. L J 1983

Request for physical remand of the accused was turned down and he was discharged---Held: that record showed that accused had been nominated in the FIR for preparing false and forged agreement to sell the property of late mother of complainant---Judicial Magistrate discharged the accused on the ground that matter was sub-judice between the parties on civil side, where the alleged document was used for obtaining stay orders---Court is the competent forum to proceed under S.195, Cr.P.C, if the document is found to be false and ficticious---Private person is barred by S.195, Cr.P.C to make any complaint in such regard---Standard of proof required in the two proceedings is entirely different---Civil cases are decided on preponderance of evidence, while in a criminal case, the entire burden lies on the prosecution and proof beyond reasonable doubt has to be given---Moreover, there is neither any statutory provision nor any legal principle that the findings recorded in one proceeding may be treated as final or binding in the other, as both cases have to be decided based on the evidence adduced therein---Section 195, Cr.P.C will be attracted only when the offenses enumerated in the said provision have been committed concerning a document after it has been produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any Court---Existence of the document was not denied---Admittedly, the document had not been produced or given in evidence---Thus, the findings of the Judicial Magistrate were perverse and against the law---Impugned orders were set aside and matter was remanded to decid the same afresh---

ORDER
...........
.---Through the instant petition, under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the legality and validity of the impugned order dated 12.12.2023 passed by Judicial Magistrate Section-30, District Courts, Lahore, have been challenged, whereby the accused/respondent No.5 was discharged from the case for insufficient incriminating material regarding the accused's implication.

2.    Heard. Record perused.

3.    Bare facts and perusal of the impugned order show that the investigating officer, through the application, requested for further physical remand of respondent No. 5. The physical remand of respondent No.5 was asked for by the police as some document had to be recovered from him for completion of the investigation. The Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Lahore, while discharging the accused (respondent No. 5), turned down the request for further physical remand of the accused (respondent No. 5). The accused (respondent No. 5) was discharged on the following grounds:-

       "I.O through this application requested for further physical remand of the accused person.

       The record shows the accused as nominated in FIR for preparing a false and forged agreement to sell belonging to the property of Naziran Bibi (late), the mother of complainant. Previously seven days physical remand was accorded for the completion of investigation and recovery of alleged document. Presently, the matter is sub-judice between the parties on civil side, where the alleged document is used for obtaining stay orders. The court is the competent forum to proceed under section 195 Cr.P.C., if the document is found to be false and fictitious. A private person is barred by section 195, Cr.P.C. make any complaint in this regard.

       So far as facts are concerned, during the investigation conducted till so far no forgery is established on part of present accused. As per report by ADC (R) license in the name of Muhammad Sharif (Stamp Vendor) is found to be valid from 1974 to 23.01.2015 (when cancelled). However, Stamp vending register for 2013-14 was not deposited by said Stamp Vendor but it could not be termed that stamp papers issued during this period are fake and fictitious. Nothing is recovered from the possession of present accused despite of 07 days physical remand. In such circumstances, I do not find any incriminating material on record and turn down the request of I.O for physical remand. The accused is discharged from this case FIR and be released, if not required in any other case."

       Coming to the contention of the learned counsel for respondent No. 5 that an effort should be made to avoid conflict of findings between the civil and criminal courts, it is necessary to point out that the standard of proof required in the two proceedings is entirely different. Civil cases are decided based on preponderance of evidence, while in a criminal case, the entire burden lies on the prosecution, and proof beyond reasonable doubt has to be given. There is neither any statutory provision nor any legal principle that the findings recorded in one proceeding may be treated as final or binding in the other, as both cases have to be decided based on the evidence adduced therein. Section 195, Cr.P.C. would be attracted only when the offenses enumerated in the said provision have been committed concerning a document after it has been produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any court. The existence of the document is not denied. The learned counsel for respondent No. 5 admitted that the document had not been produced or given in evidence. Findings of the Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Lahore, are perverse and against the law. The findings of the Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Lahore, are perverse and result from misreading and non-reading the oral and documentary evidence on the record and file. The order dated 12.12.2023 passed by the Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Lahore, is set aside. The matter is referred to the learned District and Sessions Judge, Lahore, to entrust the case to any other Judicial Magistrate Section-30 to decide the matter afresh after issuing notice to all the concerned parties and allowing them to be heard by the law.

4.    With the above observations, the instant petition stands disposed of.

Pre-arrest bail---Pendency---Practice of not arresting accused---Accused after dismissal of his pre-arrest bail by High Court, approached Supreme Court to seek pre-arrest bail---Held: Any practice whereby police authorities treat mere filing of a petition before Supreme Court as an implied stay or bar to arrest, despite dismissal of pre-arrest bail, indicates a misunderstanding of the purpose of pre-arrest bail---Such relief exists as an exceptional measure to protect individuals against arbitrary or mala fide arrest, where circumstances clearly warrant such protection---Once a competent Court has declined pre-arrest bail, it has necessarily determined that no such exceptional circumstances exist and arrest is lawful and necessary to ensure an effective investigation---Allowing mere act of filing another petition to operate as a de facto stay would render judicial determination meaningless, defeat the objective of ensuring prompt and fair investigation and risk abuse of process by enabling accused persons to indefinitely evade arrest without any legal basis---Judicial orders must remain binding and enforceable unless and until a competent Court expressly orders otherwise---Interim protection is not automatic; it must be specifically sought and expressly granted---In absence of such order, a refusal of bail remains fully operative and must be implemented promptly and in good faith by investigating authorities---Investigating officers and police authorities are legally bound to act upon Court orders dismissing pre-arrest bail immediately, without waiting for further instructions or presuming existence of any stay where none has been granted---Administrative convenience, internal practice, or mere pendency of higher-forum proceedings cannot justify or excuse failure to act in accordance with law---

ORDER
.---This petition before us arises out of the dismissal of the application for pre-arrest bail by the Lahore High Court on 19.11.2024. Despite this dismissal, the record reveals that petitioners remained at large for over six months, during which period no effective steps were taken by the police to secure their arrests.

2.    At the very outset, we regard such inaction on the part of

the investigating authorities a matter of serious concern. Prompt and faithful enforcement of judicial orders is fundamental to the criminal justice system. Once pre-arrest bail is declined by a competent court of law and the accused stands exposed to arrest in accordance with law.

3.    It is, therefore, necessary to clarify that any practice whereby police authorities treat the mere filing of a petition before the Supreme Court as an implied stay or bar to arrest, despite the dismissal of pre-arrest bail, indicates a misunderstanding of the purpose of pre-arrest bail. This relief exists as an exceptional measure to protect individuals against arbitrary or mala fide arrest, where circumstances clearly warrant such protection. Once a competent court has declined pre-arrest bail, it has necessarily determined that no such exceptional circumstances exist and arrest is lawful and necessary to ensure an effective investigation. Allowing the mere act of filing another petition to operate as a de facto stay would render that judicial determination meaningless, defeat the objective of ensuring prompt and fair investigation, and risk abuse of process by enabling accused persons to indefinitely evade arrest without any legal basis. Therefore, judicial orders must remain binding and enforceable unless and until a competent court expressly orders otherwise. It must be remembered that interim protection is not automatic; it must be specifically sought and expressly granted. Absent such an order, a refusal of bail remains fully operative and must be implemented promptly and in good faith by investigating authorities.

4.    In this context, and pursuant to directions issued by this Court, the worthy Inspector General of Police, Punjab, appeared in person to explain the conduct of the investigating authorities. He unequivocally affirmed the legal position set out above, confirming that unless there exists an express injunctive or restraining order from this Court, the mere pendency of a petition before the Supreme Court ought not to be treated as a shield by any accused to avoid arrest. When questioned about the reasons for this extended delay and apparent failure to give effect to the order of the High Court, he submitted that a circular had been issued only a day before the present hearing, directing all police officers to ensure strict compliance with such orders in the future and to execute arrests without delay once pre-arrest bail is refused. He further assured the Court that these instructions would be renewed and recirculated every six months to maintain institutional awareness and discipline within the force.

5.    It bears emphasis that the practice of delaying or avoiding arrest on the pretext of a pending petition raises serious concerns, as it essentially frustrates and weakens ongoing investigations and undermines the authority and finality of judicial orders. In addition,

such a practice risks promoting a culture of impunity, enabling accused persons to evade the process of law by exploiting systemic inaction. We find that such conduct cannot be sustained, as it runs counter to the ongoing efforts of the judicial and legal system to not only uphold the rule of law but also to inspire and maintain public confidence in it.

6.    This Court, therefore, finds it imperative to state clearly that investigating officers and police authorities are legally bound to act upon court orders dismissing pre-arrest bail immediately, without waiting for further instructions or presuming the existence of any stay where none has been granted. Administrative convenience, internal practice, or mere pendency of higher-forum proceedings cannot justify or excuse failure to act in accordance with law.

7.    At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioners did not press the present petition and stated that the petitioners would avail such remedies as may be available to them in law before the appropriate forum.

8.    In view of the foregoing discussion, this petition is dismissed as not pressed.

Trial Court "turning down" the request for grant of ad-interim relief ---"Turned down", terminology of---Scope ---Trial Court should either accept or dismiss the request for grant of ad-interim relief and terminology of "turned down" is not to be used ---Appellants filed a suit for declaration, recovery and permanent injunction along with an application under O.XXXIX, R.1 & 2 of C.P.C. for grant of temporary injunction but the Trial Court "turned down" their requests for grant of ad-interim relief --- Validity --- Without discussing the reasons/grounds taken by the Trial Court for "turning down" the appellants' request for grant of temporary injunction the terminology "turned down" was not to be used in deciding application under O.XXXIX, R.1 & 2 of C.P.C. and the Trial Court should accept or dismiss it---Order XXXIX, R.1 & 2 of C.P.C. provided that court could grant a temporary injunction to restrain a party from committing an act that could cause injury to the other party or damage to the subject matter of the suit on specific terms, such as duration, keeping an account or providing security --- Impugned order of Trial Court suffered from a legal lacuna and it could not be sustained and the same was set-aside---Appellants' application for grant of temporary injunction was deemed to be pending before the Trial Court for decision afresh---

 Appeal against order of Trial Court refusing to grant ad-interim relief --- Order of Trial Court suffering from legal lacuna ---High Court dispensing with the requirement of issuingnotice to opposite side to promote the principle of speedy justice ---Limine control, doctrine of --- Applicability and scope --- Under the doctrine of limine control for early and expeditious disposal of a case, the court can decide the matter at limine stage on the basis of material/documents available on the record/file and without issuing notice to other side so that the party concerned may not face inconvenience or monetary loss in approaching the High Court.

       Order
.---The Appellants have filed this appeal under Order XLIII of C.P.C. against the impugned order dated 12.06.2025, passed by Civil Judge, Rawalpindi, whereby their application for grant of temporary injunction has been turned down.

2.    At the outset, learned counsel submits that against the impugned order the Appellants have also filed an appeal before the Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi but subsequently, the same was withdrawn vide order dated 17.06.2025 due to lack of pecuniary jurisdiction. He further submits that the Appellants have a strong case for grant of interim injunction but the Civil Judge has turned down their request through the impugned order by not considering material aspects of the matter in true perspective. He prays for setting aside of the impugned order, being illegal and against the norms of justice.

3.    Arguments heard and record perused.

4.    Since short point is involved, notice to other side is dispensed with to avoid further delay and to promote the principle of speedy justice. Moreover, under the doctrine of limine control developed by this Court in Asif Saleem v. Chairman BOG University of Lahore and others (PLD 2019 Lahore 407) for early and expeditious disposal of a case, the Court can decide the matter at limine stage on the basis of material/documents available on the record/file and without issuing notice to other side so that the party concerned may not face inconvenience or monetary loss in approaching this Court.

5.    Admittedly, the Appellants have filed a suit for declaration, recovery and permanent injunction along with an application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of C.P.C. for grant of temporary injunction but the Civil Court has "turned down" their request for grant of an ad-interim relief through the impugned order dated 12.06.2025. Without discussing the reasons/grounds taken by the Civil Court for "turning down" the Appellants' request for grant of temporary injunction, significant to mention here is that the terminology "turned down" is not used in deciding an application Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of C.P.C. and the Civil Court should accept or dismiss it. If a quick glance is taken on the provisions contained in Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of C.P.C., it will elucidate that the Court may grant a temporary injunction to restrain a party from committing an act that could cause injury to the other party or damage to the subject matter of the suit on specific terms, such as duration, keeping an account or providing security. In the case of Shariq Builders and Property Advisors v. Dr. Muhammad Faisal Murad and others (2024 MLD 32), this Court has already discussed and elaborated these provisions of C.P.C.

6.    In view of the above, since the impugned order suffers from a legal lacuna, it cannot be sustained and the same is hereby set-aside. The Appellants' application for grant of temporary injunction will be deemed to be pending before the Civil Court which will decide the same afresh strictly as per law.

----Old/illiterate/octogenarian/widow lady---Property transaction---Fraud---Absence of independent advice---Mutation, assailing of---Burden of proof on the beneficiary of such transaction---Nearness of the relationship of the petitioner with the elderly widow lady/maternal grandmother as her grandson, the factum of him residing in the same house with her to the exclusion of anybody else coupled with absence of independent advice being established on record placed heavy responsibility upon the shoulders of the petitioner to establish property transaction by independent, unimpeachable, creditworthy and coherent evidence.

Property transaction without the knowledge of octogenarian / old / illiterate / widow / dependent lady---Failure of the petitioner to prove oral sale and capacity to pay consideration---Effect---Petitioner was 20 years of age and was not employed anywhere having any source of income for payment of consideration, thus, he failed to prove payment of consideration---Cloud of undue influence and colourability of the transaction could also not be effectively rebutted by establishing any plausible factual context of transaction such as proof of any negotiations with regard to sale, how the price was agreed and how the payment was to be made or was made to the lady and in whose presence---

Allegation of fraud in collusion with revenue officers/officials---Plea of non-impleadment of revenue staff as necessary party---Validity---Sale transaction was allegedly made by the pardanashin lady, who was not only illiterate and dependent upon the petitioner emotionally and practically as her maternal grandson living with her but was also an octogenarian, which made it pivotal for the transaction to be independently established by the petitioner in which he failed after shifting of onus as its beneficiary---Impleading of revenue officials in every case is not a rule of the thumb and this depends upon the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case---

ORDER
--This revision petition is directed against judgment and decree dated 03.10.2023 and 31.1.2024 by which the suit of the respondent was decreed and petitioner's appeal thereagainst was dismissed.

2.    Respondent instituted a suit for declaration and cancellation of sale Mutation No. 672 dated 07.11.2018 with regard to a residential plot in ihata No.74/1 at chak No.334 GB, Pir Mahal District Toba Tek Singh. It was alleged in the plaint that the respondent plaintiff was an octogenarian widow who did not have any male heir and that her maternal grandson, the present petitioner Muhammad Umar Farooq, in collaboration with his father Majid Ali had, by fraud and misrepresentation, got the mutation of sale entered qua her property in his favour showing alleged consideration of Rs.3,50,000/- which sale was neither ever entered into by the respondent/plaintiff nor was any such payment made or received whatsoever and that in the circumstances the mutation was liable to be cancelled being a product of fraud and misrepresentation. The petitioner filed a contesting written statement in which the contents of the plaint were denied and it was asserted that the respondent had in fact alienated the property to him by way of sale for Rs.3,50,000/- which amount was paid and received as consideration and that the petitioner as a result had become absolute owner and that the suit was brought without cause and with mala fide. Out of divergent pleadings the following issues were formulated:

"1.   Whether the plaintiff is owner in possession over the suit property and impugned Mutation No.672 dated 07.11.2018 is illegal, against law and facts, fraud, contusive and in-effective upon the rights of the plaintiff and are liable to be concealed? OPP

2.    If above issue is answered in affirmative, then whether the plaintiff is entitled for decree of declaration, cancellation of mutation and permanent injunction as prayed for? OPP

3.    Whether plaintiff has no cause of action and locus standi to file instant suit? OPD

4.    Whether the suit is not maintainable in its present form? OPD

5.    Whether the plaintiff is estopped by her words and conduct to file this suit? OPD

6.    Whether the suit of the plaintiff has not come to the court with clean hand? OPD

7.    Whether the suit is false and frivolous, hence the defendant is entitled to special costs under section 35-A CPC? OPD

8.    Relief."

       To substantiate her stance the respondent produced four witnesses including herself in the witness-box as PW-1 and one Shahida Parveen adduced evidence as PW-2 while Maqbool Hussain appeared as PW-3 and Muhammad Basheer as PW-4. The petitioner Muhammad Umar Farooq himself appeared as DW-1 and produced one Israr Hussain as DW-2, Muhammad Shahid as DW-3 and one Khaliq Dar (previous Naib Tehsildar, Pir Mahal) as DW-4. He also produced attested copy of pert-sarkar mutation No.672 as Exh.D-2 and attested copy of mutation No.672 pert-patwar as Exh.D-3. After considering the evidence pro and contra the learned Civil Judge, Pir Mahal vide judgment dated 03.10.2023 decreed the suit of the respondent. Petitioner preferred an appeal thereagainst which too was dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge, Pir Mahal vide judgment dated 31.1.2024. Both these decisions of the courts below are now challenged in revisional jurisdiction.

3.    Scrutiny of the appended documents and particularly the plaint shows that existence of the sale transaction is denied in absolute terms and it is specifically asserted that she neither entered into any such transaction nor received any consideration for it which were adequate averments to fulfill the legal requirement qua specificity with regard to allegation of fraud in the peculiar circumstances that the widow was illiterate pardanasheen who was above eighty years of age. The setting in which the alleged transaction is placed is germane to consideration the case. The appended documents show that the respondent is over 80 years of age. She did not have any male progeny. Petitioner Muhammad Umar Farooq is the son of her only daughter who used to reside with her. His father divorced his mother who had subsequently apparently remarried and was settled at Layyah. The father of the petitioner defendant is also co-owner of ihata No.74/1 which comprises total of 11-M and 7-S and also appears to live in the neighborhood of the house of the respondent lady and that she was dependent emotionally and practically on the able-bodied petitioner grandson who was living with her and in such context the transaction alleged to be made in favour of the petitioner by the respondent widow statedly occurred.

4.    The witnesses produced by the respondent plaintiff duly elaborated the circumstances qua such residence of the petitioner with the respondent widow as well as the dependence of the old illiterate lady on her grandson, the petitioner beneficiary of the alleged transaction. The nearness of the relationship of the petitioner with the respondent elderly widow as her grandson, the factum of him residing in the same house with her to the exclusion of anybody else coupled with absence of any independent advice being established on record placed heavy responsibility upon the shoulders of the petitioner to establish the existence of the sale transaction by independent unimpeachable, creditworthy and coherent evidence.

5.    The witnesses produced by the petitioner failed to provide any probative tenability qua assertion of the alleged oral sale nor could any evidence be brought on record to prove that any payment as alleged was ever made to her. So much so that at the time of the transaction which was alleged to have been made in 2018, the petitioner was 20 years of age and was not employed anywhere nor did he have any source of income to come up with such amount of payment for purchasing the property as asserted. As such he miserably failed on this score to prove that any consideration was ever paid. Furthermore the cloud of undue influence and colorability of the transaction could also not be effectively rebutted by establishing any plausible factual context of the alleged transaction such as proof of any negotiations with regard to sale, how the price was agreed and how the payment was to be made or was made to the respondent widow and in whose presence. In Ghulam Farid and another v. Sher Rehman through LRs. (2016 SCMR 862) it was observed to the effect that the inflexible, hard and fast rule is that when any transaction is made by any one where vital interest of a pardanasheen lady is involved then the following conditions are to be invariably and essentially fulfilled:

       "14…

       (i). to establish through evidence that the transaction was free from any influence, misrepresentation or fraud;

       (ii). that, the amount of consideration equal to the value of the property was indeed paid to the ladies;

       (iii). in the case of "Parda Nasheen" rustic village ladies, at the time of transaction such ladies were fully made to understand the nature of the transaction and the consequences, emanating therefrom and;

       (iv). that at the time of transaction, the ladies were having access to independent advice of their nearer and dearer, who have no hostile interest to them."

       In the case of Pervaiz Akhtar v. Mst. Farida Bibi and others (PLD 2023 SC 628) it was observed as under:

       "8. In the case of a transaction with Pardanashin woman, a principle of caution is attached to the transaction to protect her rights. It is necessary that a Pardanashin woman is fully cognizant and aware of the transaction and that she has independent advice from a reliable source to understand the nature of the transaction; there must be witnesses to the transaction and to the fact that a Pardanashin woman has received the sale consideration. Most importantly, a Pardanashin woman must know to whom she is selling her property and the transaction must be explained to her in the language she fully understands as is held in the cases reported as Ghulam Farid and another v. Sher Rehman through LRs. (2016 SCMR 862) and Ghulam Muhammad v. Zohran Bibi and others (2021 SCMR 19). In a case where a Pardanashin woman has trusted a relative and executed a general power of attorney for her to sell the property, it is still incumbent upon the power of attorney holder to fulfil the aforementioned conditions of making the Pardanashin woman aware of the sale that is about to be executed under the power of attorney. This is because the underlying principle here is to ensure that at all times where a woman executes a transaction with reference to her property, it is done freely and deliberately … In Muhammad Naeem Khan and another v. Muqadas Khan (deceased) through L.Rs. and another (PLD 2022 SC 99) that the objective of this court has been to protect Pardanashin women from the risk of an unfair deal and to ensure that any transaction related to the sale of their property is effected by free will and with consent. We have also held that wherever there is a transaction with Pardanashin women, it must be established that they were given independent, impartial and objective advice understanding all implications and ramifications of the transaction to ensure that they give their consent to the transaction, because valuable rights are involved and the Pardanashin women should be able to make an informed decision with reference to their property with the help of proper advice and consultation. This Court has also held in the case reported as Mian Allah Ditta through L.Rs. v. Mst. Sakina Bibi and others (2013 SCMR 868) that the burden of proof lies on the person exercising the power of attorney to prove that the transaction was carried out in good faith and with full knowledge and consent and grantor. Hence, the mere fact that Pardanashin women execute a general power of attorney will not absolve the attorney nor the buyer of the obligation to ensure that the Pardanashin women have full knowledge of the sale and have given their consent to the sale…

       9. The concept of protecting the rights of Pardanashin women finds its root in the cultural practice of women staying within the protection of their home, having limited access to affairs outside their home. Consequently, such women have limited interaction with society and do not participate in matters outside their home. This suggests that their knowledge and information about matters outside their home is limited and insufficient to take informed decisions. Accordingly, the courts have protected the rights of such women in order to protect them from betrayal, exploitation and fraud especially where valuable property rights are concerned. The concept of an illiterate woman is similar to that of a Pardanashin woman as both lack education and basic knowledge of worldly affairs and both interact essentially at a limited level with society. This limited participation hampers her ability to take informed decisions. Such women are perceived as being unskilled, uneducated and incompetent so far as the business matters are concerned. They lack experience and are easily susceptible to deceit even by their relatives. The courts endeavour to protect Pardanashin or illiterate women due to their social standing and vulnerability not only from society at large but also from relatives. Women are often the targets of fraud and deceit when it comes to property matters, which is why the courts have invoked the principle of caution in protecting the rights of such women so that they are not wrongfully deprived of their property. The limitations of Pardanashin or illiterate women have been duly considered by the courts against which the courts have held that such women must be given independent advice from a reliable and trustworthy source so as to ensure that they fully understand the transaction and the consequences of that transaction. In Muhammad Naeem Khan's case (supra) we have categorically stated that whenever the authenticity or genuineness of a transaction entered into by a Pardanashin woman is disputed or claimed to have been secured on the basis of fraud or misrepresentation, the burden will lie on the beneficiary of that transaction to prove good faith and more importantly, the Court will consider whether the transaction was entered into with free will or under duress. It goes without saying that the effort to protect rights of Pardanashin and illiterate women is necessary so as to give such women the ability to make independent decisions with reference to their property or belongings so as to ensure that they are not deprived of the ability to take a good decision based on their social standing in society. This is a step towards ensuring that there is an element of financial and economical independence given to women, who have been deprived of education and have limited interaction within the home and the family. While this may be the customary or traditional role of women as seen by society in general, the endeavour of the Court has always been to protect the vulnerability and susceptibility of women".

6.    Learned counsel for the petitioner on being confronted with this has relied on the objection that where connivance of revenue officials in attestation of any mutation is asserted, their impleadment as party is necessary, and not having done so shall be fatal to the case of the respondent. In this regard reliance is placed on Sikandar Hayat and another v. Sughran Bibi and 6 others (2020 SCMR 214) and Sakhi Jan and others v. Shah Nawaz and another (2020 SCMR 832). It is noteworthy that the sale transaction alleged to have been made in the instant case in favour of the petitioner is by a pardanasheen lady who was not only illiterate and dependent upon him emotionally and practically as her maternal grandson living with her but was also an octogenarian which made it pivotal for the transaction to be independently established by the petitioner in which he miserably failed after shifting of onus as its beneficiary. In Ghulam Muhammad v. Zohran Bibi and others (2021 SCMR 19) it was held to the effect that impleading revenue officials in every case was not a rule of the thumb and that this depends upon the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case and that in the event that the concerned court comes to the conclusion that revenue functionaries needed to be impleaded to enable it to arrive at a just conclusion an appropriate order may be passed and that where sufficient evidence was available to establish fraud and dislodge mutation which had clearly been maneuvered on the basis of fraud, impersonation and misrepresentation involving an illiterate an elderly and illiterate pardanasheen lady who had no independent advice the onus had to be discharged by the beneficiaries for the legal survival of such transaction. In the instant case it is evident that the oral sale transaction which is basis of the mutation was non-existent as no evidence to establish the same beyond the shadow of doubt could be adduced by the petitioner. The precedents cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner in the circumstances of the case, evidence on record and peculiarity of circumstances are distinguishable. Both courts below duly scrutinized the evidence carefully and concluded that the petitioner had failed in establishing the sale transaction to put up a valid defence against the respondent to her plea of having been victim of fraud and misrepresentation. No instance of misreading or non-reading of evidence or any illegality in the process of arriving at their judgments by the courts below could be shown to exist and on careful consideration the conclusions drawn are found to be fair, reasonable and legally tenable and no case for interference in concurrently recorded findings of the courts below could be made out in revisional jurisdiction. Resultantly, the revision petition is meritless which is, accordingly, dismissed.

In such circumstances, their probative value stands recognised under the law, and reliance thereon by the Courts below does not amount to any legal error or misreading of evidence.

Prosecutor remained silent and passive when prosecution witnesses gave concessional statements in favour of accused/appellant during cross-examination and Prosecutor neither bothered to get declare the prosecution witnesses hostile nor tried to impeach their (naeem)statements in terms of Articles 151 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. To curb this practice, this Court issued the following directions: -

 1. All Law Officers must remain vigilant, active, and fully engaged during the recording of prosecution evidence, statement(s) of accused under Section 342 Cr.P.C. and defence evidence, especially(naeem03006762054) in narcotics cases where the margin of error could lead to the acquittal of drug traffickers. 

2. Where any prosecution witness, including a police official, deviates from the facts or intentionally makes statements favorable to the accused, the Law Officer must immediately invoke the powers under Articles 150 and 151 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, which permit asking questions to test the veracity, credibility, and conduct of the witness. 

3. Law Officers must not allow any intentional or unintentional concessions granted by police witnesses to go unchallenged. They are required to take appropriate legal (naeem03006762054)steps to protect the prosecution's case. They should recommend departmental legal action against the police officials/witnesses who give concessional statements in favour of accused. 

4. The Prosecutor General Punjab, Lahore is also directed to personally look into this matter, identify the causes leading to weak prosecution, and take necessary steps to ensure accountability and improvement in performance. He shall issue comprehensive instructions to all Law Officers across Punjab to strictly follow the (naeem03006762054)legal procedure and exercise their authority under Articles 150 and 151 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, during trial proceedings. 

5. Failure to comply with these directions must result in disciplinary action, as no negligence on part of the State's legal representatives should be tolerated where the administration of justice is compromised.

No entry of recovered contraband was made in Register No. XIX of the Police Station despite the fact that it was a mandatory requirement under the Police Rules, 1934. Absence of this entry destroys proof of safe custody of allegedly recovered narcotic substance. The Supreme Court of Pakistan also (naeem03006762054)treats this discrepancy as fatal, resulting in acquittal of accused/appellant.

 Chain of safe custody and safe transmutation of allegedly recovered narcotic was not proved by the prosecution, in this way, the prosecution case becomes doubtful.

[12/5/25, 4:19:24 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Second application for submission of list of witnesses under Order XVI, Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ("CPC") is not maintainable when first application of the plaintiff was dismissed and the order of dismissal was not challenged, more so when second application was filed naming different individuals required to be summoned as witnesses. Labelling the second (naeem)application as one under Order XVI Rule 14, CPC and not under Rule 1 thereof is also misconceived argument. It is imperative to observe that Order XVI Rule 14 CPC is not a device for parties to fill gaps in their evidence. It vests a discretionary, suo motu power in the Court, which may be exercised if the Court itself finds a person necessary for effective adjudication even though such person is stranger. It is not intended to compensate for negligence or allow a litigant to expand the record after procedural time limits have expired. In these circumstances, allowing such applications would defeat the statutory discipline of Order XVI, Rule 1; undermine the requirement of timely disclosure, and open the door for parties to repeatedly repair their omissions. The discretion under Order XVI Rule 14 squarely belongs to the Court, which may call any stranger on its own assessment; it cannot be demanded as a matter of right by a party that has failed to comply with Rule 1 of Order XVI, CPC.

[12/5/25, 4:19:25 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: In the criminal law, accused can only be charged and punished for the offence which was on the Statute at the time of occurrence and not for the offence which has been subsequently introduced with harsh/severe magnitude through amendment as it would hit fundamental law known as "prohibition against ex post facto law" as well as Article 12 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.
It is admitted fact that as per case of prosecution, charas weighing 1320-grams was recovered from possession of the appellant on 03.06.2022 {i.e. much prior to the (naeem)promulgation of  “The Control of Narcotic Substances (Amendment) Act, 2022 (Аct No.XX of 2022), which was promulgated in the month of September, 2022}; case was registered as per Column No.3 of the Crime Report  under erstwhile Section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, charge was framed under erstwhile offence i.e. Section: 9(c) of the Act (ibid); therefore, mentioning of conviction of the appellant by the trial court in paragraph No.18 of the impugned judgment under Section 9(1) 3(c) of CNSA is against  Article 12 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as well as settled principles of law on the subject including fundamental principle of law known as “prohibition against ex post facto law”  and we see eye to eye with the contention raised by learned counsel for the appellant in this regard which has also been fairly conceded by learned Deputy Prosecutors General.  

It is relevant to mention here that the appellant has faced the agony of trial since his arrest, basic and prime purpose behind criminal justice system is to enable an offender to reform himself and to rehabilitate for rejoining the mainstream of prosperous life and once again to become a useful member of the society and not to wreak vengeance; since quantity of recovered contraband is not exceeding 10-KG, hence, there was no statutory threshold/limit of minimum quantum of sentence under erstwhile Section: 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997. By now it is well (naeem)settled that on the basis of valid reason, plea for reduction of sentence can be entertained and considered if substantial period of sentence has already been served out by the convict/appellant.

[12/5/25, 4:19:28 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The petitioner's experience certificate was discarded on the ground that his employment was on daily wages/contract/project based and was not in accordance with the advertisement. Held that any exclusion, which deprives a citizen of consideration for public employment must have a clear foundation in law. Where the advertisement stipulates five years' experience?even from private entities registered with SECP or a relevant regulatory body?the later insistence that such experience must be on a regular, rather than contract or daily-wage basis, is wholly untenable when neither the law (statute, the rules, the recruitment policy), nor the advertisement prescribe such a bar. Introducing an impediment in respect of eligibility of a post not expressly provided amounts to reading into the criteria what the law or the advertisement does not contain, thereby infringing the constitutional right of the petitioner to seek employment. Permitting arbitrary exclusion at the discretion of the authority is not sanctioned by the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Further held that the right of appeal is a substantive and valuable right of a litigant. Administrative action that defeat such a right?particularly by implementing adverse orders before expiry of the limitation period?cannot sustain. The respondents were obligated to act fairly, but instead acted precipitously in a manner incompatible with principles of natural justice and the administrative propriety

Rape, kidnapping---Appreciation of evidence---Ocular account supported by medical evidence---Accused was charged for kidnapping the daughter of complainant and committing rape with her---Record showed that the prosecution witness/victim, was cross-examined by the defence but her evidence relating to the fact of her being raped by the appellant had not been shaken at all---Moreover, it had been fully established by the statement of the prosecution witness/victim that the appellant raped her---Report of Forensic Science Agency, according to which the DNA Profile of the appellant was found present on the shalwar of victim, also lent support to the charge of rape against the appellant---Evidence of Medical Officer also fully supported the statement of victim that she was raped by the appellant---Circumstances established that the prosecution had proved its case against the accused to the extent of committing rape with the victim, however due to mitigating circumstances, the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to the appellant under S.376(1), P.P.C. was reduced to that of rigorous imprisonment of ten years---

-Discrepancies and improvements in the statement of witnesses---Scope---In all criminal cases, normal discrepancies are bound to occur in the depositions of witnesses due to normal errors of observation, namely, errors of memory due to lapse of time or due to mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence---Where the omissions amount to a contradiction, creating serious doubt about the truthfulness of the witness and other witnesses also make material improvement while deposing in the court, such evidence cannot be safe to rely upon---However, minor contradictions, inconsistencies, embellishments or improvements on trivial matters which do not affect the core of the prosecution case, should not be made a ground on which the evidence can be rejected in its entirety.

Abduction of the victim not established---Accused was charged for kidnapping the daughter of complainant and committing rape with her---Prosecution witness/victim had successfully evidenced her credibility, therefore the trial Court was quite justified to rely on her while finding the appellant guilty---Intention of the accused was the basis and the gravamen of an offence under S.376, P.P.C.---Consequently, there was no hesitation in holding that the trial Court rightly convicted the appellant for the offence punishable under S.376(1), P.P.C.---With regard to the conviction of the appellant under S.365-B P.P.C., the prosecution could not prove the said charge against the appellant---Trial Court itself rejected the statement of the prosecution witness who had stated that on 23.10.2014 at about 08.00 a.m. he had seen the appellant abducting, the victim---According to the statement of victim, when she was abducted by the appellant, said witness was not present at the said time and place---Furthermore, said witness, though being very closely related to victim, made no effort either to stop the abduction of victim or even to follow the appellant who was taking away the victim---No one from the locality supported the said charge of abduction levelled against the appellant---Trial Court also observed that complainant was not a witness of the said abduction---With regard to the part of the statement of victim that she was abducted by the appellant, the same was doubtful and contradictory to the attending circumstances---Therefore, the appellant could not have been convicted for the offence punishable under S.365-B, P.P.C.---Circumstances established that the prosecution had proved its case against the accused to the extent of committing rape with the victim, however due to mitigating circumstances, the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to the appellant under S.376(1), P.P.C. was reduced to that of rigorous imprisonment of ten years---

Sentence, reduction in---Mitigating circumstances---Accused was charged for kidnapping the daughter of complainant and committing rape with her---Record showed that the appellant suffered the rigours of a protracted trial and it had also been observed that it seemed likely that the appellant would have mended his conduct in those years---Counsel for the appellant on appellant's instructions, had earnestly and humbly prayed that the appellant may be given a chance to rehabilitate---Appellant was the sole earner in his family and his incarceration for an extended period would result in cutting off the lifeline available to his family---No proof was available that the appellant was a man of means---As such, the case of the appellant called for a lenient view in the matter of the quantum of sentence awarded to him under S.376(1), P.P.C.---Consequently, while maintaining the conviction of the appellant under S.376(1), P.P.C., the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to the appellant under S.376(1), P.P.C. was reduced to that of rigorous imprisonment of ten years---

Judgment
.---Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh (convict) was tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kehror Pacca in case FIR No.587 of 2014, dated 24.10.2014, registered at Police Station City Kehror Pacca, District Lodhran in respect of offences under sections 376 and 363 of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860. The learned trial court vide judgment dated 12.01.2017 convicted Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh (convict) and sentenced him as infra:-

       Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh:

       1) Imprisonment for life under section 376(1) of the Pakistan Penal Code,1860 and directed to pay fine of Rs.200,000/-, and in case of default of payment of fine, the convict was directed to undergo, simple Imprisonment of two years further.

       2) Imprisonment for life under section 365-B of the Pakistan Penal Code,1860 and directed to pay fine of Rs.200, 000/-, and in case of default of payment of fine, the convict was directed to undergo simple Imprisonment of two years further.

       The convict was extended benefit available under Section 382-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 1898 by the learned trial court. Both the sentences awarded to the convict were ordered to run concurrently by the learned trial court .

2.    Feeling aggrieved, Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh (convict) lodged the instant Criminal Appeal No.576-J-LD of 2017 assailing his conviction and sentence.

3.    The brief facts of the prosecution case, as stated by Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), the victim of the case, in her statement before the learned trial court, are as under:-

       "On 23.10.2014 at about 8:00 AM I was going to school when I reached near Nagina Cinema accused Allah Wadhaya armed with pistol with an unknown person came and took me forcibly to an unknown place on motorcycle. After some time that unknown person alighted from motorcycle. Accused Allah Wadhaya forcibly committed rape with me. After four days I escaped from that unknown place and came to my home. My parents took me to P.S and then to Hospital. My statement was recorded in P.S. My medical examination was got conducted."

4.    After the formal investigation of the case report under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted before the learned trial court and the accused was sent to face trial. The learned trial court framed the charge against the accused on 04.02.2015 to which the accused pleaded not guilty and the learned trial court proceeded to examine the prosecution witnesses.

5.    The prosecution in order to prove its case got recorded statements of as many as nine witnesses. Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), the prosecutrix narrated the facts of the occurrence. Muhammad Murad (PW-1) stated that on 24.10.2014, he submitted the written application (Exh.PA) for the registration of the case in respect of abduction of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2). Zafar Iqbal (PW-3) stated that on 23.10.2014, he had witnessed the appellant abducting Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2). Abdul Hameed, SI (PW-9) investigated the case from 24.10.2014 till 01.11.2014, arrested the appellant on 29.10.2014 and detailed the facts discovered during the investigation of the case in his statement before the learned trial court.

6.    The prosecution also got Dr. Mumtaz Kamal (PW-4) examined, who on 27.10.2014 was posted as a Woman Medical Officer at THQ hospital Kehror Pacca and on the same day, conducted the medical examination of the victim namely Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2). Dr. Mumtaz Kamal (PW-4), after examining Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), observed as under:-

       "Local examination.

       Locally found blackish flaps of labia admit two fingers loose. minora and vagina

       ..........

       Opinion.

       My opinion is that there was penetration occurred completely. Those swabs do not match with the findings of local examination. After medical examination I issued MLC the carbon copy of which is Ex.PD that is in my hand and bear my signature. I also attested injury statement of Ex.PD/1."

       The prosecution also got Dr. Ihsan Ali (PW-5) examined who stated that he had examined the appellant on 01.11.2014 and found him capable of having sexual intercourse.

7.    On 25.04.2016, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor tendered in evidence the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PJ) and other documents (Exh.PK and Exh.PL).On 26.05.2016, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor closed the prosecution evidence after tendering, in evidence the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PM)

8.    After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined the appellant Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh, under section 342, Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question why this case against you and why the PWs have deposed against you, he stated that he had been falsely involved in the case. The appellant opted to get himself examined under section 340(2), Cr.P.C and did not adduce any evidence in his defence.

9.    On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kehror Pacca, convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to above.

10.  The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant precisely was that with regard to the abduction of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), there was not sufficient evidence, however, with regard to the conviction of the appellant under section 376(1), P.P.C., the learned counsel for the appellant sought a reduction in the quantum of imprisonment awarded to the appellant.

11.  On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General contended that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a shadow of doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General further submitted that it was a heinous offence and exploited the victim's future by the appellant at the expense of his lust: that it could not be expected from the victim to put her future at stake for any reason to falsely implicate the appellant in this case for nothing; that delay in reporting the matter to the police had no adverse effect on the fate of the prosecution case because in the cases where family honour was involved, immediate rushing to the police station for lodging the crime report and putting the honour at stake, was always difficult for anybody; that the medical evidence provided further corroboration to the Ocular account; that the impugned judgment entailing the conviction and sentence of the appellant did not warrant interference by this Court. Lastly, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General prayed for the rejection of the appeal.

12.  I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General and with their assistance perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial carefully. .

13.  Although the learned counsel for the appellant has not opted to assail the conviction recorded by the learned trial Court against the appellant under section 376(1), P.P.C., still I have gone through the evidence on the record. This Court finds that the prosecution has undoubtedly established the charge of rape by producing relevant, admissible and dependable evidence during the course of the trial. The prosecution witness namely Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) was cross-examined by the learned Counsel for the appellant, but her evidence relating to the fact of her being raped by the appellant has not been shaken at all. It is fully established by the statement of the prosecution witness namely Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) that the appellant raped her. The report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PM) according to which the DNA Profile of the appellant was found present on the shalwar of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) also lends support to the charge of rape against the appellant. The evidence of Dr. Mumtaz Kamal (PW-4) also fully supports the statement of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) that she was raped by the appellant. In all criminal cases, normal discrepancies are bound to occur in the depositions of witnesses due to normal errors of observation, namely, errors of memory due to lapse of time or due to mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence. Where the omissions amount to a contradiction, creating serious doubt about the truthfulness of the witness and other witnesses also make material improvement while deposing in the court, such evidence cannot be safe to rely upon. However, minor contradictions, inconsistencies, embellishments or improvements on trivial matters which do not affect the core of the prosecution case, should not be made a ground on which the evidence can be rejected in its entirety. The court has to form its opinion about the credibility of the witness and record a finding as to whether his deposition inspires confidence. Exaggerations per se do not render the evidence brittle. But it can be one of the factors to test the credibility of the prosecution version when the entire evidence is put in a crucible for being tested on the touchstone of credibility. Therefore, mere marginal variations in the statements of a witness cannot be dubbed as improvements as the same may be elaborations of the statement made by the witness earlier. The omissions which amount to contradictions in material particulars i.e. go to the root of the case/materially affect the trial or core of the prosecution's case, render the testimony of the witness liable to be discredited but not otherwise. In the instant case, this Court finds that the prosecution witness namely Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) has successfully evidenced her credibility, therefore, the learned trial court was quite justified to rely on her while finding the appellant guilty. The intention of the accused is the basis and the gravamen of an offence under section 376, P.P.C. Consequently, I have no hesitation in holding that the learned trial court rightly convicted the appellant for the offence punishable under section 376(1), P.P.C.

14.  With regard to the conviction of the appellant under section 365-B, P.P.C., this Court has come to the conclusion that the prosecution could not prove the said charge against the appellant. The learned trial court itself rejected the statement of the prosecution witness namely Zafar Iqbal (PW-3) who had stated that on 23.10.2014 at about 08.00 a.m he had seen the appellant abducting Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2). According to the statement of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), when she was abducted by the appellant, Zafar Iqbal (PW-3) was not present at the said time, at the said place. Furthermore, Zafar lqbal (PW-3), though being very closely related to Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), made no effort either to fail the abduction or Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) or even to follow the appellant who was taking away Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) with him. None from the locality supported the said charge of abduction levelled against the appellant. The learned trial court also observed that Muhammad Murad (PW-1) was not a witness of the said abduction. With regard to the part of the statement of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) that she was abducted by the appellant, the same is doubtful as is contradictory to the attending circumstances. Therefore, this Court has arrived at an irresistible conclusion that the appellant could not have been convicted for the offence made punishable under section 365-B, P.P.C.

15.  For what has been discussed above, this Court has come to an irresistible and clear conclusion the prosecution has proved beyond any shadow of doubt, through inspiring and truthful evidence, that the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh raped Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) . In view of the conclusions drawn by this Court, the instant Criminal Appeal No. 5764-J/LD of 2017 as lodged by the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh is partly allowed and the conviction and sentence of the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh for the offence made punishable under section 365-B, P.P.C. is set-aside, however, the conviction of the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh son of Muhammad Siddique under section 376(1), P.P.C. is upheld and maintained, however, I have observed that the appellant suffered the rigours of a protracted trial. I have also observed that it seems likely that the appellant would have mended, his conduct in these years. Learned counsel for the appellant on appellant's instructions, has earnestly and humbly prayed that the appellant may be given a chance to rehabilitate. The appellant was the sole earner in his Family and his incarceration for an extended period would result in cutting off the lifeline available to his family. There is no proof that the appellant is a man of means. As such, the case of the appellant calls for a lenient view in the matter of the quantum of sentence awarded to him under section 376(1), P.P.C. Reliance is placed on the cases of "Naseem Khan v. The State" (2021 SCMR 1771), "Mst. Sughran v. State (2021 SCMR 109) "Niaz ud Din v. The State" (2007 SCMR 206), "Shaukat Ali alias Billa v. The State" (2015 SCMR 308) and "State through the Deputy Director (Law), Regional Directorate, Anti-Narcotics Force v. Mujahid Naseem Lodhi" (PLD 2017 SC 671). Consequently, while maintaining the conviction of the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh under section 376(1), P.P.C. but taking into consideration the above-mentioned mitigating circumstances, the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh under section 376(1), P.P.C. is reduced to that of rigorous imprisonment of ten years. The punishment of payment of fine of Rs.200,000/-, and in case of default of payment of fine, to undergo simple Imprisonment of two years further awarded to the appellant is upheld and maintained.

Allah Wadhaya Versus The State--
[12/9/25, 7:21:38 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2025 P Cr. L J 589

Ss. 365-B & 376---Abducting or inducing woman to compel for marriage, rape---Appreciation of evidence---Ocular account furnished by victim---Victim sole eyewitness of the occurrence---Sufficient for conviction---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Ocular account was furnished by victim/complainant alone, whereas, statement of father of the victim was about post occurrence events---In her examination-in-chief the victim reiterated the story as had been set out in the complaint/FIR and deposed about step by step events in the same sequence---Complainant was subjected to cross-examination at sufficient length but nothing damaging to the prosecution or favourable to the defence could be elicited from her mouth---By tenor of cross-examination the defence tried to bring on record that at one point of time the victim and the accused/appellant were residing in the same village and parents of the accused/appellant as well as victim had friendly relations, thus they both i.e. accused/appellant and the victim, were known to each other---Instead of lending any support to the defence, the admission of the victim on above aspects went on to strengthen the prosecution's stance as it was the case of prosecution itself that because of such friendly relations the accused/appellant used to visit the house of the victim's parents along with co-accused, with whom the victim also developed relations and out of such linkage she left the house along with co-accused to make some purchases and fell prey to nefarious activity by the accused/appellant---Since the statement of the victim, had been found to be worthy of credence, confidence inspiring, credible and irrefutable, therefore, even if she was a sole witness, her statement could safely be made basis to record conviction---

Nude pictures---Legal requirements for using such pictures as evidence for convicting accused---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Audio/video clip including snaps/ photographs as evidence maintained a dual character in the law of evidence; it is termed as document as well as a material thing (physical evidence), also known as real evidence---Snaps/ photographs do carry information that includes expression, gestures, voice and video, therefore, such clips/snaps are sought to be produced before the Court to prove the 'information' contained in it as evidence of facts recorded therein and oral account of which is to be spoken by a witness and not by the document alone---While as material thing it is to be produced for the inspection of Court---Principles of evidence relating to admissibility of documents are fully applicable on such type of evidence---Permission and sanction of law to bring on record evidence if it is in the form of document is regulated under Art.139 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Said Article in the light of illustration therein authorizes the Court to ask, when any witness is making statement about a fact, to support his contention with any document if such fact is incorporated therein---Room for such discretion of Court is obviously reflective of farsighted wisdom of legislature to cater to the requirement of an emerging need of evidence in a particular situation for the purpose of corroboration to fortify or strengthen the deposition---Documentary evidence runs over or defeats the oral evidence under the maxim "res ipsa loquitor"---Second status of such evidence is of material thing (physical evidence) or oral evidence which is produced for the inspection of Court as ordained in second proviso to Art. 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---In the present case pictures were put to the accused/appellant during his statement under S.342, Cr.P.C., for seeking his explanation but neither he challenged such pictures in any manner during cross-examination nor gave any explanation in his statement under S.342, Cr.P.C.---Silence of the accused/appellant over such an important factor connoted that there was nothing to defend against such nude pictures, thus the requirement of law for using these snaps/pictures was completed and those could safely be used as evidence---

Delay of one and half month in lodging the FIR---Inconsequential---Victim trying to protect her honour and reputation and that of her family---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---In this case, undoubtedly, the FIR was registered after almost one and half month of the crime having been committed---However, such delay in reporting the matter to the police was immaterial in the sense that throughout it had been the stance of the victim that her nude pictures were taken by the accused/appellant, she was blackmailed and she fell victim number of times during her captivity under such pressure and fear, therefore, she kept mum in order to save her and the family honour---When nude pictures of victim were thrown in her house and the matter stood disclosed to family members, she narrated the whole occurrence---Thus, victim being an educated lady with qualification of MA English had definitely been thinking about her family honour as well as her social and practical life before reporting the matter to police---Even otherwise, the fact that the modesty of a virgin girl was violated by sexual assault explained the apprehension of the victim and her family in approaching the police immediately---Delay in reporting the crime to the police in respect of an offence involving a person's honour and reputation which society may view unsympathetically could play on the minds of a victim and her family and deter them to go to the police---

Medical officer not cross-examined---Effect---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Though the medical evidence did not contain any fact that sexual act was committed with the victim by force but it was clear from the statement of victim that she was under the effect of intoxication as well as fear of nude pictures, therefore, in either of the situations, she could not resist the act of rape---Otherwise, of course the said act of intercourse was against the will and consent of victim, which was the requirement of S.375, P.P.C---During medical examination Woman Medical Officer also found hymen of victim as old torn, though she was unmarried but Medical Officer was not even cross-examined by the defence about any fact contained in Medico-Legal Report---Moreover, it was in the evidence that delayed Medico-Legal Examination was due to the reason that victim was terrified---Prosecution had also produced Medical Officer who had examined the accused/appellant and found him potent to perform sexual act; his observations in that respect were recorded in Medico-Legal Report, therefore, such examination was also a relevant fact showing ability of accused/appellant to commit rape with the victim---

Bad character of accused---Scope---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Bad character of accused in criminal cases was not relevant under Art.68 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Perusal of evidence showed that defence itself conceded the involvement of the appellant in offence of dacoity while putting question upon the victim during her cross-examination, which turned attention to Art.27 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 dealing with relevancy of facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body or bodily feeling---In the evidence of that case facts were brought on record that the appellant had affiliation with victim since her childhood and also wanted to marry her, therefore what he had done could not be regarded as innocent mistake rather his state of mind and bodily feeling made him to commit such a heinous offence---Thus, inclination and attraction of accused towards victim was a relevant fact in the case which could safely be read against him for his intention to commit act of rape and preparation of nude pictures---

Judgment
.--- Abdul Basit, hereinafter to be called as "accused/appellant" faced trial before learned Additional Sessions Judge/GBV, Multan in case FIR No.354 dated 24.05.2018 under sections 365-B/376 P.P.C Police Station New Multan and on conclusion of trial vide judgment dated 23.07.2022 he was convicted under section 365-B P.P.C and sentenced to imprisonment for life with fine of Rs.50,000/-, in case of default to further undergo six month's simple imprisonment. He was also convicted under section 376(i) P.P.C and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for fifteen years with fine of Rs.50,000/-, in case of default to further suffer simple imprisonment for six months; both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently and benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended, hence the instant appeal.

2.    According to the prosecution case as reflected from FIR Ex.PA/2 lodged on the complaint of Nadia Shaheen (victim), she was unmarried and living with her parents, the accused/appellant and Mst. Haseena Bibi (since PO) used to visit her parents, thus she developed friendship with Mst. Haseena Bibi. On 09.04.2018 at 5.00 p.m. Mst. Haseena Bibi came to her house and took her along for making some purchases from Gulshan Market. On their way near Chowk Kumharanawala the accused/appellant, already known to the victim came on a car and offered them a drive; the victim refused but Mst. Haseena forced, whereupon she sat in the car. At Vehari Chowk when the car stopped, the victim reminded Mst. Haseena Bibi to go for Gulshan Market, whereupon, Mst. Haseena pretended an urgent work there. After a while, the accused/appellant and Mst. Haseena brought sandwich and after eating it the victim became unconscious; both of them took her to the house of Mst. Haseena where accused/appellant committed rape with her with the help of Mst. Haseena and also prepared her nude pictures. On returning to senses the victim raised the voice, whereupon, both the accused while showing her nude pictures threatened to upload the same on internet. The accused/appellant continued committing rape with her and transferred her pictures to his mobile phone for the purpose of blackmailing. After two days when her health condition got worst, both the accused left her at Nishtar Hospital, Multan, where from her father and brother took her to the house. Because of intensive mental stress she did not tell anything to them, whereas, accused/appellant constantly threatened her to marry with him. She further narrated that as per her knowledge the pictures which the accused/appellant had shared with her, were still available in the mobile phone of the accused/appellant; ultimately the victim disclosed the entire facts to her parents and along with her complaint she also produced the pictures which the accused/appellant had thrown in her house.

3.    After registration of FIR and completion of investigation finally report under section 173 Cr.P.C was submitted against the accused/appellant. When charge sheeted, the accused/appellant denied the charges and claimed to be tried, whereupon, the prosecution examined Mst. Nadia Shaheen (victim) as PW-1; Ghulam Akbar, father of the victim appeared in the dock as PW-2; Shakeela 944/LC (PW-3) who took the victim to hospital for her medical examination; Zafar Iqbal Sub-Inspector (PW-5) and Ghulam Mustafa (PW-7) had investigated the case; Dr. Nasir Javed (PW-6) conducted potency test of the accused/appellant; Waseem Akram Sub-Inspector (PW-9) got issued non-warrants of arrest of the accused following by proclamation and Dr. Nighat Noureen (PW-10) medically examined the victim and rest of the witnesses appeared and made statements about the roles performed by them during the course of investigation. The accused neither opted to appear in the witness box as required by section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in defence and the trial ended in his conviction and sentence, as detailed above.

4.    Learned counsel for the appellant seeks acquittal on the grounds of delay in FIR, delayed medicolegal examination of victim, un-supporting medical evidence without DNA, sole testimony of victim without corroboration with regard to act of rape. Learned District Public Prosecutor assisted by counsel for the complainant supported the impugned judgment due to trust worthy and confidence inspiring statement of victim, supported by res gestae evidence of her father, medicolegal opinion of old torn hymen being unmarried lady and nude pictures of victim prepared by the appellant wherein he is also visible.

5.    Arguments heard. Record perused.

6.    Here in the instant case, the prosecution intended to establish the charge against the accused/appellant through the ocular account, medical evidence and the nude pictures of the victim P-1 to P-5, which were allegedly thrown into the house of victim and those which were produced on behalf of the accused/appellant i.e., P-6 to P-10. The ocular account was furnished by Mst. Nadia Shaheen victim/complainant (PW-1) alone, whereas, statements of Ghulam Akbar (PW-2) father of the victim is about post occurrence events, including recovery of nude pictures P-1 to P5 produced before the police and P-6 to P-10 on the information of accused/appellant from his house. Conscious of the fact that the victim/complainant was the solitary witness of the occurrence, we have thoroughly and carefully gone through her statement to dig out that she may have falsely involved the accused/appellant in this case in order to wreck vengeance or it may have been a motivated attempt on the part of the prosecution to level some score against the accused/appellant, but in her examination-in-chief the victim reiterated the story as had been set out in the complaint/FIR and deposed about step by step events in the same sequence. She was subjected to cross-examination at sufficient length but nothing damaging to the prosecution or favourable to the defence could be elicited from her mouth. By tenor of cross-examination the defence tried to bring on record that at one point of time the victim and the accused/appellant were residing in the same village and parents of the accused/appellant as well as victim had friendly relations, thus they both i.e. accused/appellant and the victim, were known to each other. Instead of lending any support to the defence, the admission of the victim on above aspects goes on to strengthen the prosecution's stance as it was the case of prosecution itself that because of such friendly relations the accused/appellant used to visit the house of the victim's parents along with Mst. Haseena Bibi, with whom the victim also developed relations and out of such linkage she left the house along with Mst. Haseena Bibi to make some purchases and fell prey to nefarious activity by the accused/appellant.

7.    Since the statement of the victim, direct evidence, has been found to be worthy of credence, confidence inspiring, credible and irrefutable, therefore, even if there is a sole witness, her statement can safely be made basis to record conviction. As to the number of witnesses required to establish a charge, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as "Muhammad Mansha v. The State" (2001 SCMR 199) with reference to Article 17(1)(b) of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 held that:-

       "7. A bare perusal would reveal that the language as employed in the 'said Article 17(1) (b) is free from any ambiguity and no scholarly interpretation is required. The provisions as reproduced hereinabove of the said Article would make it abundant clear that particular number of witnesses shall not be required for the proof of any fact meaning thereby that a fact can be proved only by a single witness "it is not seldom that a crime has been committed in the presence of only one witness, leaving aside those cases which are not of uncommon occurrence, where determination of guilt depends entirely on circumstantial evidence. If the Legislature were to insist upon plurality witnesses, case where the testimony of a single witness only could be available in proof of the crime, would go unpunished. It is here that the discretion of the Presiding Judge comes into play. The matter thus must depend upon the circumstances of each case and the quality of the evidence of the single witness whose testimony has to be either accepted or rejected. If such a testimony is found by the Court to be entirely reliable, there is no legal impediment to the conviction of the accused person on such proof. Even as the guilt of an accused person may be proved by the testimony of a single witness, the innocence of an accused person may be established on the testimony of a single witness, even though considerable number of witnesses may be forthcoming to testify to the truth of the case, for the prosecution. The Court is concerned with the quality and not with the quantity of the evidence necessary for proving or disproving a fact". (Principles and Digest of the Law of Evidence by M. Monir, page 1458).

       The Supreme Court further held that:-

       "……..no yardstick can be fixed as to whether statement of a solitary witness must or must not be relied upon for the simple reason that each case has its own peculiar circumstances which shall play a significant role and is motivating factor to determine the reliability of a solitary witness as the said aspect of the matter is to be dilated upon in the light of surrounding circumstances which may be taken into consideration or otherwise. We may mention here that such circumstances also cannot be confined within a limited sphere of any definition because the same may be infinitely diversified by the situation and conduct of the parties concerned. "The only general rule that can be laid down is that the circumstances must be such as would lead the guarded decision of a reasonable and just man to the conclusion".

       Thus, the well-recognized maxim remains that 'evidence has to be weighed and not counted' and here in this case as discussed above the ocular testimony though coming through one witness i.e. victim, yet the same is consistent, unimpeachable and confidence inspiring, therefore, is held to be sufficient to establish the charge. Reference may be made to the case reported as "Muhammad Ehsan v. The State" (2006 SCMR 1857). It has been held by Supreme Court in case reported as "Atif Zareef and others v. The State" (PLD 2021 SC 550) that rape victim stands on a high pedestal than an injured witness, because an injured witness gets the injury on physical form while rape victim suffers psychologically and emotionally, and single testimony is sufficient to uphold the conviction.

8.    Ghulam Akbar PW-2 father of victim deposed res gestae evidence about condition of victim when he and his son Shahbaz met her in Nishtar Hospital, Multan. PW-2 narrated the situation as under;

       "After two days, my daughter Nadia made a call on phone and informed us that she was present in Nishtar Hospital and her condition was bad. I along with my son Shahbaz went to Nishtar Hospital wherefrom, we brought back Mst. Nadia to our home. We kept on asking what had happened with her but she did not tell us anything and used to weep."

       Similarly, during cross-examination he responded as under;

       "When we had been asking our daughter Mst. Nadia where she was for two days but she started to weep and remained silent. My wife had also been asking about the reason of her weeping but she said nothing to her."

       He has also stated the fact of collection of nude pictures from his house allegedly thrown by the appellant, which has a support to prosecution case. He deposed in his examination in chief that we had family relation with accused Abdul Basit and Haseena Bibi co-accused (since PO). He had no axe to grind against the accused/appellant, nor anything was spoken against him by the defence. His support to save her family honour is reflected from the fact that he is pursuing the case and is present before us even in this appeal proceedings.

9.    In addition to the above, five nude pictures allegedly thrown by the accused/appellant in the house of the victim, were also produced before the Investigating Officer at the time of registration of case, however, were taken into possession after three days through recovery memo P-1 to P-5 (Ex.PC) and accused also produced similar pictures before the police P-6 to P-10 (Ex.PD) on call from his house. Though no evidence is available that who had produced such pictures from the accused side, likewise it has been admitted by the victim during cross-examination that no one knew that who had thrown the pictures (P-1 to P-5) in her house, but the pictures produced by the complainant party clearly show that first part of the prosecution story stands proved which was to the effect that accused after making nude pictures of the victim started blackmailing for commission of rape with her.

10.  We have observed that in one of the nude pictures P-1 to P-5 and P-6 to P-10, the accused/appellant is also visible while sitting with the side of the victim who fell unconscious. The information contained in the picture clearly speaks about the story of the victim that in a condition of unconsciousness her nude pictures were prepared by the accused/appellant, therefore, the question before us is as to whether such pictures could be used as evidence in support of prosecution case. It is trite that an audio/video clip including snaps/photographs as evidence maintains a dual character in the law of evidence; it is termed as document as well as a material thing (physical evidence), also known as real evidence. It does carry information that includes expression, gestures, voice and video; therefore, such clips/snaps are sought to be produced before the Court to prove the 'information' contained in it as evidence of facts recorded therein and oral account of which is to be spoken by a witness and not the document alone. While as material thing it is to be produced for the inspection of court. Principles of evidence relating to admissibility of documents are fully applicable on such type of evidence; permission and sanction of law to bring on record evidence if it is in the form of document is regulated under Article 139 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (the Order). This Article in the light of illustration therein authorizes the Court to ask, when any witness is making statement about a fact, to support his contention with any document if such fact is incorporated therein. The room for such discretion of Court is obviously reflective of farsighted wisdom of legislature to cater to the requirement of an emerging need of evidence in a particular situation for the purpose of corroboration to fortify or strengthen the deposition; even otherwise best evidence rule says that documentary evidence runs over or defeats the oral evidence under the maxim "res ipsa liquitor". The second status of such evidence is of material thing (physical evidence) or real evidence which is produced for the inspection of Court as ordained in second proviso to Article 71 of The Order: -

       "Provided further that, if oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of any material thing other than a document, the Court may, if it thinks fit, require the production of such material thing for its inspection"

       Articles 139 and 71 of the Order in detail in this context have been discussed and explained in a case reported as "Numan alias Nomi and others v. The STATE" (2023 P Cr. L J 1394).

11.  In a book "THE MODERN LAW OF EVIDENCE (Third edition) by Adrian Keane published by Butterworths (1994), the author while referring to a verdict of Sir Jocelyn Smith P, passed in a case reported as "The Statue of Liberty" [1968] 1 WLR 739 mentions as under;

       "It is tempting, on the basis of these words of Sir Jocelyn Smith P, to conclude that photographs and films, the relevance of which can be established by the testimony of someone with personal knowledge of the circumstance in which the photographs or films was taken or made, are admissible items of real evidence and can never give rise to problems of a hearsay nature. If the evidence of a witness to certain events is admissible, it may be reasoned, then photographs or films recording those same events should be no less admissible."

       In R v. Cook [1987] 1 All ER 1049 (CA) at page 1054, Watkins LJ has gone so far as to state that photograph, together with the sketch and photofit, are in a class of evidence of their own to which neither the rule against hearsay nor rule against previous consistent or self-serving statements applies.

       In R v. Williams (1984) 79 Cr App Rep 220 (CA), the Court of Appeal entertained no doubt that photographs taken by security cameras installed at a building society office at which an armed robbery was attempted, were admissible in evidence, being relevant to the issue of both whether an offence was committed and, if so, who committed it. It seems that it is not necessary to prove that the photographic material is original or an authentic copy; proof that the material relates to the events in question will suffice. Case reported as "The Road We're Travelling On, v. Treacy" [1989] New Law Journal (NLJ) 1079 is referred. In the attending circumstance and on the strength of above case laws, pictures P-1 to P5 can validly be used against the accused/appellant. In the case reported as "Muhammad Zaman v. The State and others" (2014 SCMR 749), the Supreme Court of Pakistan apart from other evidence relied on the pictures produced in evidence during trial and converted acquittal of the accused into their conviction.

12.  We have noted that such pictures were put to the accused/appellant during his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. for seeking his explanation but neither he challenged such pictures in any manner during cross-examination nor gave any explanation in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. Silence of the accused/appellant over such an important factor connotes that there was nothing to defend against such nude pictures, thus the requirement of law for using these snaps/pictures is complete as highlighted above and these can safely be used as evidence.

13.  Here in this case, undoubtedly, the FIR was registered after almost one and half month of the crime having been committed but such delay in reporting the matter to the police is immaterial in the sense that throughout it has been stance of the victim that her nude pictures were taken by the accused/appellant, she was blackmailed and she fell victim number of times during her captivity under such pressure and fear, therefore, she kept mum in order to save her and the family honour but when her nude pictures were thrown in her house and the matter stood disclosed to family members, she narrated the whole occurrence. Delay in reporting the matter was responded by her during cross examination as under:-

       "It is correct that I remained silent for about one and half month after the occurrence and did not get the case registered against the accused. There were thoughts in my mind for reporting the matter to police but due to intimidation of the accused, I abstained."

       Another reason for delay in registration of FIR was also deposed by PW-2 in following words:-

       "I took my daughter with me to P.S., New Multan and the police of said police station sent us to women police center. For few days, the police had been putting off and ultimately on 21.05.2018, they received application from me which is Exh. P-A."

       Thus, victim being an educated lady with qualification of MA English had definitely been thinking hundred times about her family honour as well as her social and practical life before reporting the matter to police. Even otherwise, the fact that the modesty of a virgin girl was violated by sexual assault makes understandable the apprehension of the victim and her family in approaching the police immediately. Delay in reporting the crime to the police in respect of an offence involving a person's honour and reputation which society may view unsympathetically could prey on the minds of a victim and her family and deter them to go to the police. Reliance in this respect is palced on case reported as "Hamid Khan v. The State" (1981 SCMR 448).

14.  Though the medical evidence does not contain any fact that sexual act was committed with the victim by force but it is clear from the statement of victim that she was under the effect of intoxication as well as fear of nude pictures, therefore, in either of the situation she could not resist the act of rape, but otherwise, of course the said act of intercourse was against her will and consent, which is the requirement of section 375 P.P.C. During medical examination Dr. Nighat Noureen PW-10 also found hymen of victim as old torn, though she was unmarried but doctor was not even cross examined by the defence about any fact contained in MLR. It is in the evidence that delayed medicolegal examination was due to the reason victim was terrified and this fact she has disclosed, while responding to questions during cross examination, as under;

       "My father and my brother had asked me to take me to the doctor but I refused and insisted to take me to home. My parents were insisting me for my medical treatment but I was scared and terrified that I refused and I said that I would not get out of the room."

15.  Prosecution has also produced Dr. Nasir Javed PW-6 who had examined the accused/appellant on 14/10/2020 and found him potent to perform sexual act; his observations in this respect are recorded in MLR, Ex.PP; therefore, such examination is also a relevant fact showing ability of accused/appellant to commit rape with the victim.

16.  Learned counsel for the complainant tried to show the Bench some FIRs registered against the appellant for his involvement in offences of murder and dacoity to assert his bad character. We are afraid such course is not permissible under the law, and even otherwise bad character of accused in criminal cases is not relevant under Article 68 of the Order; but perusal of evidence shows that defence itself conceded the involvement of the appellant in offence of dacoity while putting question upon the victim during her cross examination, which turned our attention to Article 27 of the Order dealing with relevancy of facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body or bodily feeling. In the evidence of this case facts were brought on record that the appellant has affiliation with victim since her childhood and also wanted to marry her, therefore what he has done cannot be regarded as innocent mistake rather his state of mind and bodily feeling roasted her to commit such a heinous offence. Thus, his inclination and attraction towards victim is a relevant fact in this case which can safely be read against him for his intention to commit act of rape and preparation of nude pictures.

17.  For what has been discussed above, it is evident that prosecution has proved the case against the appellant beyond shadow of reasonable doubt, a standard requisite to sustain a criminal charge. There is no legitimate exception to findings arrived at by the learned trial court with respect to conviction and quantum of sentence awarded to the accused/appellant. The instant appeal, therefore, being devoid of merit, is dismissed. The case property, if any, shall be dealt with as ordered by the learned trial court and the record of the learned trial court be sent back immediately.

Criminal Appeal No. 812 of 2022
Abdul Basit Versus The State
[12/9/25, 7:21:39 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2025 Y L R 811

Rape, sharing explicit videos and pictures of a rape victim, defamation, insulting modesty or causing sexual harassment---Appreciation of evidence---Withholding natural witnesses---Adverse presumption against prosecution---Accused was charged for committing rape with the wife of the complainant, taking her pictures and making video in naked condition through mobile and also extending threats to upload the pictures and video---According to prosecution's case against appellant he on gun point forcibly raped wife of complainant but during the physical custody of the appellant with the Investigation Agency, no gun could be recovered at his instance---Inmates of the house who were locked in a room on gun point, as per contents of the FIR, were not produced by the prosecution before the Investigation Officer---Similarly, said inmates did not join the proceedings of trial as witnesses---Meaning thereby, the natural witnesses were withheld by the prosecution---

Safe custody of case property not proved---Accused was charged for committing rape with the wife of the complainant; taking her pictures and making video in naked condition through mobile and also extending threats to upload the pictures and video---According to prosecution's case against appellant, he on gun point, forcibly raped wife of complainant but during the physical custody of the appellant with the Investigation Agency, no gun could be recovered at his instance---Though during physical custody of appellant memory card was taken into possession by the Investigation Officer---Fact remained that during the evidence rendered by the Investigation Officer and the recovery witness, the memory card and the nude pictures were not produced in the Court because of which the same could not be exhibited in evidence---Similarly, though report of Forensic Science Agency regarding the non-editing of contents available in memory card was available in evidence yet prosecution failed to produce 'Moharrer' of police station who per the Investigation Officer was given the sealed parcel containing memory card and naked photographs for safe custody in 'Malkhana' on 14.07.2020 and the 'Moharrer' returned the same to him on 23.07.2020 for its transmission to Forensic Science Agency---Thus, prosecution failed to prove safe custody of the case property that even otherwise could not be produced in evidence---

As per record, the victim never got herself medically examined to substantiate the charge against the fact that appellant---Similarly, though the Investigation Officer, in his statement, stated that he got the appellant examined for potency yet admittedly neither any medico legal examination certificate/report was available on record nor the prosecution produced any Medical Officer in that regard---Consequently, the fact that appellant was then potent and able to perpetrate the offence as alleged could not be established by the prosecution during trial which created serious doubts about the prosecution case---

Judgment
---Through this appeal, Rizwan Sami Khan, appellant has assailed the judgment dated 17.06.2022 passed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge/GBV Court, Sheikhupura in case FIR No.252 dated 10.07.2020 registered for offence under Sections 376, 292, 500 and 509 P.P.C. at Police Station Saddar Farooqabad District Sheikhupura whereby, the appellant was convicted under Section 376 P.P.C. and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for ten years with fine of Rs.1,00,000/- and in default thereof, to further undergo simple imprisonment for six months. He was also convicted under Section 509 P.P.C. and sentenced to one year. He was further convicted under Section 292 P.P.C. and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for three months. He was also directed to pay Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation as provided under Section 544-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 read with Section 17 of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021 which was ordered to be recovered as arrears of land revenue. The appellant was however, extended benefit of Section 382-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898.

2.    Brief facts of the case, as disclosed by Muhammad Shahzad, complainant (PW-2) in his application (Exh-PB) on the basis of which formal crime report (Exh-PC) was registered, are that on 28.06.2020 at about 02.00 p.m, when the complainant was out of city in connection with some urgent work, the appellant while armed with weapon entered into his house, locked his children into a room on gun point and committed rape with his wife Mst. Shumaila Shahzad. He also took pictures and made video of his wife in naked condition through mobile. He also extended threats to upload the pictures and video if the complainant did not effect compromise in the earlier case.

3.    After completion of investigation, report under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted. The learned trial court, after observing pre-trial codal formalities, framed the charge against the appellant to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4.    The prosecution, in order to prove its case, produced as many as five witnesses during the trial. Tariq Mahmood 436/C (PW-1) is the witness of recovery of mobile phone along with memory card which was taken into possession vide recovery memo. Exh-PA. Muhammad Shahzad (PW-2) is the complainant whereas, Mst. Shumaila Shahzad (PW-3) is the victim of the case. Saif Ullah, ASI (PW-4) is the duty officer who, on receipt of complaint (Exh-PB) registered FIR (Exh-PC) without any addition or omission whereas, Muhammad Javed, ASI (PW-5) is the Investigation Officer of the case. Learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor, on the instructions of complainant as well as his learned counsel, gave up Allah Ditta and Rashid PWs being unnecessary and after tendering in evidence Audio Visual Analysis Report (Exh-PH) close the prosecution case.

5.    Thereafter, statement of the appellant under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was recorded wherein, he refuted the allegations levelled against him and professed his innocence. He further deposed that he was innocent and had wrongly been involved in this case. He further deposed that he used to visit house of complainant and the victim being his close relative and that the complainant was his business partner and due to some business dispute between them, the complaint got registered a false FIR against him by introducing his wife as fake victim just to usurp his amount. He also disclosed that there was no evidence and that the investigation was biased as all the proceedings conducted by the police were false and fictitious. He did not opt to appear as his own witness as provided under Section 340(2) of the Code of the Criminal Procedure, 1898 in disproof of the allegation levelled against him however, he did produce his nine snaps (Exh-DA/1-8) with victim of this case in his defence.

6.    Arguments heard. Record perused.

7.    It has straightaway been observed that according to prosecution.s case against Rizwan Sami Khan, appellant, he on gun point, forcibly raped Mst. Shumaila Shahzad (PW-3) wife of Muhammad Shahzad, complainant (PW-2) but during the physical custody of the appellant with the Investigation Agency, no gun could be recovered at his instance. The inmates of the house who were locked in a room on gun point, as per contents of the FIR, were not produced by the prosecution before the Investigation Officer (PW-5) and similarly, they did not join the proceedings of trial as witnesses. Meaning thereby, the natural witnesses were withheld by the prosecution. PW-2, PW-3 and the Investigation officer (PW-5) are also inconsistent qua the age of eldest son of the victim. Though during physical custody of appellant memory card was taken into possession by the Investigation Officer through recovery memo Exh-PA yet the fact also remains that during the evidence rendered by the Investigation Officer (PW-5) and Tariq Mahmood 436/C (PW-1), the recovery witness, the memory card and the nude pictures were not produced in the court because of which the same could not be exhibited in evidence. Similarly, though report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Exh-PH) regarding the non editing of contents available in memory card is available in evidence yet prosecution failed to produce Moharrer of police station who per the Investigation Officer (PW-5) was given the sealed parcel containing memory card and naked photographs for safe custody in 'Malkhana' on 14.07.2020 and the Moharrer returned the same to him on 23.07.2020 for its transmission to Punjab Forensic Science Agency. Thus prosecution remained fail to prove safe custody of the case property that even otherwise could not be produced in evidence. PW-1, the recovery witness also admits, during cross examination that the memory card and the photographs were not available on judicial or police file. Giving Number/description of memory card in his examination in chief, he mentioned "highfast MMA/2AL8-GB 07/2019" which reflects that the content pertains to the year 2019. The Investigation Officer (PW-5) also confirmed this fact in his statement while per prosecution case subject occurrence took place during the year 2020. It is also relevant to mention here that Mst. Shumaila Shahzad, victim (PW-3) never got herself medico legally examined to substantiate the charge against the appellant. Similarly, though the Investigation Officer (PW-5), in his statement, stated that he got the appellant examined for potency yet admittedly neither any medico legal examination certificate/report is available on record nor the prosecution produced any Medical Officer in this regard. Proof of potency of the appellant/accused in a case of sodomy etc. is a requirement to be met with. For this reason the legislature inserted Section 53-A in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 through Criminal Law Amendment Act XLIV of 2016 that for reference and convenience is reproduced hereunder: -

       "[53-A. Examination of person accused of rape, etc. by medical practitioner..(1) When a person is arrested on a charge of committing an offence of rape, unnatural offence or sexual abuse or an attempt to commit rape, unnatural offence or sexual abuse under section 376, section 377 and section 377-B respectively and there are reasonable grounds for believing that an examination of the arrested person will afford evidence as to the commission of such offence, it shall be lawful for a registered medical practitioner employed in a hospital run by the Government or by a local authority to make such an examination of the arrested person and to use such force as is reasonably necessary for that purpose.

       (2) The registered medical practitioner conducting examination under subsection (1) shall, without delay, examine such person and prepare a report of his examination giving the following particulars, namely: --

       (a) name and address of the accused and of the person by whom he was brought;

       (b) age of the accused;

       (c) marks of injury, if any, on person of the accused;

       (d) description of material taken from person of accused for DNA profiling; and

       (e) other material particulars in reasonable detail.

       (3) The report under subsection (2) shall state precisely the reasons for each conclusion arrived at.

       (4) The exact time of commencement and completion of the examination under subsection (1) shall also be noted in the report under subsection (2). The registered medical practitioner shall, without delay, forward the report to the investigating officer who shall forward it to the Magistrate through public prosecutor referred to in section 173 as part of the report referred to in that section]"

       This provision highlights the relevance and significance of potency test of the accused of sexual offences punishable under Sections 376, 377 and 377-B, P.P.C. while in the instant case the prosecution has not bothered to procure and bring such material piece of evidence on record. Consequently, the appellant was then potent and able to perpetrate the offence as alleged is a fact that could not be established by the prosecution during trial that creates serious doubt about the prosecution case.

       All these circumstances lead this Court to hold that the prosecution remained fail to prove its case against the appellant beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt. Even otherwise, both, complainant (PW-2) and the victim (PW-3) present in Court, one by one, stated that they do not have any objection if the appellant is acquitted of the charge hence, Crl. Appeal No.41759 of 2022 filed by Rizwan Sami Khan, appellant is allowed, his convictions and sentences are set aside and he is acquitted of the charge levelled against him by giving him benefit of doubt. He is in custody, be released forthwith if not required to be detained in any other case.

Criminal Appeal No. 41759 of 2022
Rizwan Sami khan Versus The State and others--
[12/9/25, 7:21:40 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2025 P Cr. L J 1354

Rape---Pre-arrest bail, dismissal of---Allegation against the petitioner-accused was that he raped the complainant---Complainant had nominated the petitioner in the FIR, alleging that he exploited their interactions and raped her---Complainant had also accused petitioner of threatening her and taking objectionable pictures to coerce her into silence---Complainant reiterated those allegations in her statement recorded under S.164,Cr.P.C.---Medical and forensic evidence confirmed that sexual intercourse occurred on the relevant day---During the investigation, the police concluded that the case involved fornication rather than rape---Said findings were essentially based on CCTV footage, pictures, and WhatsApp messages exchanged between the parties---While that evidence suggested a close relationship, possibly closer than the complainant acknowledged, it did not definitively establish whether the act was consensual---Such critical determination required thorough scrutiny of all the evidence during the trial---Under S.375,P.P.C, threats, intimidation, or coercion invalidate consent---Therefore, if proven, the allegations of pointing a pistol and threatening to release objectionable content would render any apparent consent irrelevant---Trial Court was the appropriate forum to evaluate the evidence, including the CCTV footage, WhatsApp messages and other material to determine the nature of the offence---Pre-arrest bail is an extraordinary remedy reserved for cases where the accused can demonstrate that the FIR was lodged with mala fide intent, personal animosity, or the like---Petitioner had failed to satisfy that requirement---Claims of inconsistencies in the prosecution's evidence, such as discrepancies between the FIR and the complainant's statement under S.164,Cr.P.C., necessitated detailed scrutiny alongside other evidence---Such an evaluation was beyond the purview of a pre-arrest bail application---Considering the seriousness of the allegations and the absence of any exceptional circumstances justifying pre-arrest bail---

Order
---Through this application, the Petitioner seeks pre-arrest bail in case FIR No.1546/2024 dated 3.7.2024 registered at Police Station Peoples Colony, Faisalabad, for an offence under section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 (P.P.C).

2.    According to the FIR, the prosecution's case is that the Petitioner owns a fabric shop in Tata Bazar near the ice factory in Faisalabad. He became acquainted with the Complainant through her frequent visits to purchase cloth. Over time, they developed a rapport, and the Complainant occasionally shared her domestic issues with him. The Complainant alleged that the Petitioner proposed that she run a boutique from her home. He offered to provide fabric worth Rs. 500,000/- on loan, with the agreement that she would repay Rs. 100,000/- every 15 days. He suggested that the arrangement would mutually benefit both parties.

3.    The Complainant asserted that on 2.7.2024, around 11:00 a.m., the Petitioner invited her to Chen-One Road to visit a cloth warehouse. The Petitioner and an unknown person were already present when she reached there. The Complainant claimed that the Petitioner inappropriately touched her while the co-accused pointed a pistol at her, and then the Petitioner raped her. She further alleged that certain objectionable pictures and videos were taken, and the Petitioner and his co-accused threatened to leak the material if she disclose the incident.

4.    The Complainant told Muhammad Ashfaq and Sarfraz Ali about the occurrence, who supported her in obtaining a medical examination through court orders. Subsequently, FIR No. 1546/2024 was registered.

5.    The Petitioner applied for pre-arrest bail in the Sessions Court which was declined. He has now approached this Court seeking the same relief.

6.    The Petitioner's counsel, Barrister Momin Malik, contended that the Complainant has falsely implicated the Petitioner with ulterior motives. He argued that the prosecution's narrative, particularly the alleged financial arrangement, is inherently implausible. Mr. Malik further contended that the Complainant acted in collusion with her counsel's clerk, Muhammad Ashfaq, who is a key prosecution witness. Additionally, he pointed out discrepancies in the medical examination record and the variance between the Complainant's FIR and her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., arguing these inconsistencies warrant further inquiry. Mr. Malik submitted that the Petitioner is entitled to pre-arrest bail in the given circumstances.

7.    The Deputy Prosecutor General, assisted by the Complainant's counsel, vehemently opposed this application. He contended that the Petitioner was nominated in the FIR with a specific allegation. The Complainant has recorded her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., implicating the Petitioner in the case, and her account is corroborated by medical evidence and a positive forensic report. The Deputy Prosecutor General refuted the claim of any discrepancy between the FIR and the Complainant's statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., adding that even if such a discrepancy existed, it was trivial and inconsequential. He, therefore, prayed for the dismissal of this application.

8.    Hina Imdad/SI investigated this case. She concluded that the incident involved fornication rather than rape. Her findings were primarily based on CCTV footage, photographs, and WhatsApp messages exchanged between the Petitioner and the Complainant.

9.    Encouraged by the Investigating Officer's findings, Mr. Malik raised an alternative plea that the alleged offence falls under section 496-B P.P.C rather than section 376 P.P.C. He pointed out that section 203-C Cr.P.C. prescribes a special procedure for prosecuting an offence under section 496-B P.P.C, and an action can only be initiated through a complaint filed in a court of competent jurisdiction. He argued that the offence under section 496-B P.P.C is non-cognizable so an FIR could not be registered. Furthermore, the said offence is bailable.

       Discussion

10.  Rape is universally recognized as one of the most heinous crimes, representing a profound violation of personal dignity, bodily autonomy, and fundamental human rights. It is not merely a physical assault but an act of violence and domination that strikes at the very core of a person's sense of self. Beyond its immediate physical impact, rape is an extremely traumatic event with lasting emotional, psychological, and social consequences. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, while a rapist degrades their very soul.

11.  Legal systems worldwide criminalize rape, with varying definitions and evidentiary requirements. However, the fundamental principle remains the same: it is a crime of violence, coercion, and domination. It is not merely an offence against an individual but against the entire society.

12.  Article 14 of our Constitution mandates that dignity shall be inviolable. This is an absolute right and is not subject to law. "Dignity means human worth: simply put, every person matters. No life is dispensable, disposable, or demeanable. Every person has a right to live, and the right to live means right to live with dignity." Our courts have consistently held that a woman, regardless of her sexual character or reputation, is entitled to equal protection of the law. No one has the right to invade her person or violate her privacy based on her alleged immoral character. In rape cases, the victim's prior sexual history and character is irrelevant; the critical issue is whether the accused committed the act.

13.  The Pakistan Penal Code criminalizes rape under section 375. It defines the offence comprehensively, encompassing acts beyond traditional notions of penile penetration, such as the insertion of any object or body part (other than the penis) into the vagina, urethra, or anus and oral acts performed on or by the victim. The definition also covers situations where a perpetrator manipulates any part of the victim's body to cause penetration into the vagina, urethra, anus, or any other part of the victim's body or compels the victim to perform such acts with the accused or another person. Section 376 P.P.C prescribes the punishment for rape, while section 375A P.P.C specifically addresses gang rape, imposing severe penalties for such crimes.

14.  Rape must be distinguished from fornication. Rape is a non-consensual act and, as adumbrated, rooted in violence, coercion, and domination, where the perpetrator disregards the victim's autonomy and consent. In contrast, fornication refers to consensual sexual relations between individuals who are not married to each other. The Pakistan Penal Code addresses fornication in section 496-B. It is punishable as a Ta'zir by up to five years' imprisonment and a fine not exceeding ten thousand rupees.

15.  Section 203-C Cr.P.C. prescribes a special procedure for prosecuting the offence of fornication. Most importantly, it mandates that no court shall take cognizance of such an offence except upon a complaint filed in a court of competent jurisdiction.

16.  Since consent is pivotal in determining the offence of rape, we need to examine it in more detail. Section 375 P.P.C outlines seven specific circumstances under which the law deems there is no consent if a perpetrator commits any of the acts specified in clauses (a) to (d) of the section. These include, firstly, when these acts are committed against the victim's will and, secondly, when they are done without the victim's consent.

17.  In Muhammad Ashraf v. The State (1997 PCr.LJ 1351), the Federal Shariat Court, while interpreting section 6 of the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hadood) Ordinance 1979, clarified the distinction between "against the will" and "without consent," holding that both scenarios constitute Zina-bil-Jabar (rape). The Court referred to Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary, and noted that the term "will," refers to the "power or faculty of choosing or determining, act of using this power; volition, choice; determination." In contrast, "consent" signifies "to be of the same mind; to agree to give assent; to yield; to comply." The Court explained that consent necessarily implies agreement as a free agent, with the presence of a free mind and free will. Therefore, when an individual (victim) is subjected to an act that they would not have consented to or permitted had they been free to make a genuine choice, such an act is deemed to have been done against their will. In other words, the key question is whether the individual would have acted in the same manner if they had a real choice to act differently. If the availability of choice was illusory or rendered redundant by the circumstances, the act in question is considered to have been carried out against the individual's will. The Court further stated that the absence of a genuine choice or the ability to exercise free will may arise from various factors, such as the position of dominance or authority held by the perpetrator, fiduciary obligations, supervisory control, or the victim's dependence on the perpetrator. The Court observed that Muslim jurists have discussed the subject of Jabar under the head of Ikrah and referring to the celebrated treatise of Dr. Abdul Karim Zaidan, Professor of Fiqah Islami, University of Baghdad, Iraq, concluded:

       "'Ikrah' may be inferred from the very situation in which a victim may find herself unable to protest or where the faculty to determine her course of action is so affected that she had no control over the action or the event or she would not have acted that way if left to make a choice. The very force of circumstances may constitute Jabr (Ikrah).

18.  The third situation is where the victim's consent is obtained by putting them or any person in whom they are interested in fear of death or hurt. The fourth circumstance pertains to consent obtained through deception. If the perpetrator deceives the victim into believing they are lawfully married when they are not, and the victim consents based on this belief, the law considers such consent invalid. The fifth circumstance is when the victim is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the act due to unsoundness of mind, intoxication, or the administration of stupefying substances. Consent given under these conditions is considered invalid, as the victim lacks the capacity to make an informed decision. The sixth circumstance involves victims under the age of sixteen. The law categorically states that any sexual act involving a minor, whether or not consent is given, constitutes rape. This provision protects minors, recognizing their inability to provide valid consent due to their immaturity. The seventh circumstance arises when the victim is unable to communicate consent. This includes situations where the victim is unconscious, paralyzed, or otherwise physically or mentally incapacitated, leaving them unable to express agreement. The inability to communicate consent negates any presumption of its presence, ensuring that vulnerable individuals are safeguarded under the law.

19.  Section 375 P.P.C includes several explanations that provide further clarity. Explanation 1 expands the definition of the term "vagina" to include the labia majora, ensuring comprehensive anatomical coverage. Explanation 2 elaborates on the concept of consent, emphasizing that it must be an unequivocal voluntary agreement to participate in a specific sexual act. Explanation 3 broadens the scope of the law by defining a "person" to include males, females, and transgender individuals, ensuring inclusivity in its application. Explanation 4 explicitly excludes bona fide medical procedures or interventions from the definition of rape, preventing the misuse of the provision.

20.  The principles underlying section 375 P.P.C are further reinforced by section 90 P.P.C, which provides a general framework for determining the validity of consent in the broader context of criminal law.

21.  The expressions "unequivocal voluntary agreement" and "specific sexual act" in Explanation 2 of section 375 P.P.C are significant. Consent must be an affirmative and conscious decision, clearly communicated through words, gestures, or other verbal or non-verbal forms of expression. It must be given freely, without pressure or coercion. Silence, passivity, or lack of resistance cannot be deemed consent. Moreover, consent is not a blanket authorization but is confined to what is explicitly agreed. If a victim initially consents to a particular act but later withdraws that consent, or if the accused continues the act despite the withdrawal or engages in a different act for which consent was not given, the law unequivocally classifies the act as non-consensual, thereby constituting rape.

22.  The determination of consent in rape cases is often complex and fact-specific. The burden of proving the absence of consent initially lies with the prosecution, which can be discharged by presenting credible evidence, typically including the victim's testimony, medical examination reports, and forensic evidence. Since the offence of rape generally occurs in private, finding independent witnesses is challenging. Consequently, the victim's solitary statement can suffice to secure a conviction in a rape case, provided that it is trustworthy, consistent, and reliable.

23.  In cases where direct evidence is unavailable, circumstantial evidence plays a pivotal role in guiding judicial reasoning and determining the presence of consent. This includes factors such as the victim's physical condition, injuries suggesting resistance, forensic findings like DNA evidence linking the accused to the crime, the timing and sequence of events, or communication records such as messages or calls between the parties. However, it is essential to emphasize that the absence of injuries on the victim's body or signs of physical resistance does not automatically indicate consent. As discussed, Explanation 2 of section 375 P.P.C explicitly provides that physical resistance is not a prerequisite for establishing non-consensual intercourse.

24.  In Muhammad Imran v. The State and another (Criminal Petition No. 725/2023, decided on 26.06.2024), Justice Ayesha A. Malik stated that there is no assumption, either in law or practice, that a woman gave her consent simply because there are no marks of resistance. She observed that the offence of rape deeply affects the victim, both physically and psychologically. According to expert psychiatrists, victims of trauma, particularly sexual violence, may exhibit "fight, flight, or freeze" responses, with the freeze response often rendering them incapable of taking protective action. This reflexive reaction to fear or threat is highly subjective and varies from individual to individual. Moreover, the use of force, intimidation, and the trauma of the act itself can result in responses that are unpredictable and unique to each victim. Consequently, there is no universal or predictable behaviour for victims of rape, nor can their response - or lack thereof - be used as conclusive evidence against them.

25.  Once the prosecution has discharged its initial burden, the burden of proof shifts to the accused to substantiate claims of consent. Under Articles 117 and 119 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, the accused bears the onus to provide credible evidence of consent. This may include evidence of a pre-existing consensual relationship, communications suggesting mutual agreement, or an alternative explanation for the prosecution's evidence. The accused is not required to prove consent beyond a reasonable doubt but must raise a credible and plausible defence sufficient to create reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case. Failure to do so can result in a finding of guilt.

26.  The court's role is critical in balancing these shifting burdens. It must rigorously scrutinize the prosecution's evidence to ensure it meets the high threshold of proving the absence of consent beyond a reasonable doubt. At the same time, the court must evaluate the accused's evidence or defence to assess its plausibility and credibility.

27.  Let's now turn to the case at hand. The Complainant has nominated the Petitioner in the FIR, alleging that he exploited their interactions and raped her. She has also accused him of threatening her and taking objectionable pictures to coerce her into silence. She reiterated these allegations in her statement recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C. Medical and forensic evidence confirm that sexual intercourse occurred on the relevant day.

28.  During the investigation, the police concluded that the case involved fornication rather than rape. These findings are essentially based on CCTV footage, pictures, and WhatsApp messages exchanged between the parties. While this evidence suggests a close relationship, possibly closer than the Complainant acknowledges, it does not definitively establish whether the act was consensual. This critical determination requires thorough scrutiny of all the evidence during the trial.

29.  As previously discussed, under section 375 P.P.C, threats, intimidation, or coercion invalidate consent. Therefore, if proven, the allegations of pointing a pistol and threatening to release objectionable content would render any apparent consent irrelevant. The trial court is the appropriate forum to evaluate the evidence, including the CCTV footage, WhatsApp messages, and other material, to determine the nature of the offence.

30.  Pre-arrest bail is an extraordinary remedy reserved for cases where the accused can demonstrate that the FIR was lodged with mala fide intent, personal animosity, or the like. The Petitioner has failed to satisfy this requirement. Claims of inconsistencies in the prosecution's evidence, such as discrepancies between the FIR and the Complainant's statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., necessitate detailed scrutiny alongside other evidence. Such an evaluation is beyond the purview of a pre-arrest bail application.

31.  Considering the seriousness of the allegations and the absence of any exceptional circumstances justifying pre-arrest bail, this application is dismissed.

Judgment
.---Through this appeal under Section 410 Cr.P.C. appellant Istikhar alias Iftikhar has challenged the vires of judgment dated 17.07.2019 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Nankana Sahib in case FIR No.124/18 dated 27.03.2018, in respect of an offence under Sections 376 P.P.C., registered at Police Station, Faizabad, District Nankana Sahib, whereby he was convicted and sentenced as under:-

       Under Section 376 (3) P.P.C.

       Imprisonment for life with fine of Rs.25,000/- and in default thereof to further undergo SI for two months.

       He was held entitled to the benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C.

2.    The prosecution story unfolded in the crime report (Ex.PA/1) registered on the complaint of Babar Ali (PW-1) was that on 27.03.2018, his daughter namely, Mst. Asma Bibi, aged about 4/5 years, went outside the house for playing and did not turn back after considerable time. He along with witnesses Riaz Ahmad and Muhammad Boota, started searching her and when about 12.40 p.m. they went towards tube-well of Hanif Arain, they heard hue and cry of girl. They went towards the tube-well and saw appellant was committing Zina-bil-Jabr with the victim. On seeing the witnesses, appellant fled away while leaving the victim in a naked condition. Hence, this case was registered.

3.    Sabar Hussain, SI (PW-9)/Investigating Officer, visited the place of occurrence on the same day and recorded the statements of witnesses including the victim under Section 161 Cr.P.C. He arrested the appellant on 30.03.2018, got conducted the DNA test of the victim as well as the appellant. After completion of the investigation, he submitted report under Section 173 Cr.P.C.

4.    Lady doctor Saima Aslam (PW-6) conducted the medico-legal examination of the victim on the same day i.e. 27.03.2018 and observed perianal bruising along with multiple tears of varying sizes at different position. She also observed dried blood around perianal area and on buttocks. Three anal and one vaginal swab were taken and sealed for DNA analysis. According to her opinion, sexual assault was committed with the victim.

5.    At the commencement of the trial, learned trial Court had framed a charge against the appellant to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

6.    The prosecution examined 10-witnesses besides the report of DNA and Serology Analysis (Ex.PJ). The appellant in his statement recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C., had denied and controverted all the allegations of fact levelled against him. He neither opted to make statement under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C., nor produced any evidence in his defence.

7.    Learned trial Court, upon conclusion of the trial, convicted and sentenced the appellant as stated above. Hence, this criminal appeal.

8.    Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant is quite innocent and has falsely been implicated in the alleged occurrence; that infact brother of the appellant who was serving abroad transferred an amount of Rs.5,00,000/- in the account of Maqsoodan Bibi, aunt of the complainant, and when parents of the appellant demanded said amount, she in connivance with the complainant roped him in this criminal case; that according to the opinion of the medical officer vaginal area was intact, as such at the most it is a case of attempt to rape; that the report of DNA has been received with negative result, which negates the prosecution case; that at the time of alleged occurrence the appellant was juvenile; that conviction and sentence handed down by the Trial Court is very harsh and does not commensurate with the act of the appellant. In the end, learned counsel for the appellant has made an alternate prayer for suitable reduction in the sentence.

9.    Conversely, learned Addl. Prosecutor General appearing for the State submits that it was a day light occurrence and in such like cases question of mistaken identity of real culprit is out of question; that the ocular account is fully supported with the medical evidence; that the victim girl furnished a natural and straightforward story without any concoction or consultation; that in case of rape of a female child involving family honour and dignity, there was no occasion for the complainant to falsely implicate the appellant while letting off the real culprit; that the prosecution has successfully proved the charge against the appellant beyond shadow of any reasonable doubt; that the act of the appellant ruined the entire life of the little girl and as such he does not deserve for any leniency. At the end, he prays for dismissal of the appeal in hand.

10.  I have heard learned counsel for the appellant, learned Addl. Prosecutor General appearing for the State and perused the record.

11.  This unfortunate incident had taken place on 27.03.2018 at about 12:40 noon and the crime report was lodged on the same day at 03:45 p.m. i.e. within almost three hours of the occurrence. This promptness in lodging the crime report not only confirms presence of the eye-witnesses at the spot but also excludes every hypothesis of deliberation, consultation and fabrication prior to the registration of the case.

12.  The prosecution case hinges upon the testimony of Babar Ali, (PW-1)/ complainant/father of the victim, Riaz Ahmad, (PW-2), Muhammad Boota, (PW-4)/eye-witnesses of the occurrence and Mst. Asma Bibi, (PW- 3)/victim. The complainant while appearing in the dock in the court room reiterated the contents of the crime report deposing that on 27.03.2018 her daughter namely, Mst. Asma Bibi, aged about 4/5 years, went outside the house for playing and did not turn back after considerable time. He along with Riaz Ahmad (PW-2) and Muhammad Boota (PW-4), started searching her and when about 12.40 p.m. they reached near the tube-well of Hanif Arain, they heard screams of the girl. He saw appellant was forcibly committing Zina-bil-Jabr with the victim. On seeing the witnesses, appellant succeeded to flee away. Riaz Ahmad, (PW-2) and Muhammad Boota (PW-4), unflinchingly supported the complainant while stating that they witness the appellant committing rape with the minor girl. They were subjected to lengthy cross-examination but the defence could not shatter their credibility on material particulars of the incident.

13.  The most crucial and star witness of the occurrence was victim Mst. Asma Bibi (PW-3). This little angel was about five years old at the time of recording of evidence and the Trial Court before recording her testimony put some queries to her in order to determine whether she was competent to understand the questions and after satisfying it on this point, recorded her statement. Victim girl in her statement, in categorical terms raised accusing finger towards the appellant to be a person, who took her towards a tubewell, removed her cloths and committed rape with her. She faced the test of cross-examination with full confidence and gave graphic details of the incident in a quite natural manner. During cross-examination, she not only gave the name of her teacher but also her immediate neighbors and class fellows. From the tenor of the statement of the star witness, I am convinced that what she deposed while appearing in the dock in the Court room was confidence inspiring and no one has tutored her in this regard. The statement of the victim child was quite natural, straightforward, convincing and confidence inspiring leaving no room for the Court to draw any adverse inference.

14.  Lady doctor Saima Aslam (PW-6) conducted medico-legal examination of the victim on 27.03.2018 and observed that "There is bruising of perianal area along with tears of varying sizes and at different positions. Vaginal area seems intact on naked eye examination. There were signs of dried blood around perianal area and on buttocks." According to her opinion sexual assault was committed with the minor girl.

       Learned defence counsel laid much emphasis that according to the opinion of Medical Officer vaginal area was intact, therefore, at the most it could be regarded as an attempt to commit the rape. I am not in agreement with the submission of the learned counsel for more than one reasons. Firstly, Section 375 P.P.C. defined the "rape". Explanation 1 of the said section reads as under:-

       "For the purpose of this section, "vagina" shall also include labia majora" In the instant case Medical Officer has observed bruising upon perianal area along with tears of different sizes at different position, which when read in context with Explanation reproduced supra, fully constitute that the 'rape' was committed with the victim.

Secondly, a Forensic Scientist Mr. C.K. Parikh in " Parikh's Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence, Forensic Medicine and Toxicology at page 5.37 mentions as under:-

       "Soon after the act, the torn margins are sharp and red, and bleed on touch".

       Moreso, H M V Cox "Medical Jurisprudence and toxicology" (Seventh Edition) by Dr. PC Dikshit, Professor and Head of Forensic Sciences, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Dehli, explains the situation in Chapter of Sexual Offences at page 591 as under:-

       "In case of incomplete penetration, the only sign which may be seen are reddening and inflammation of vestibule within the labia or a small tear of the posterior fourchette. There may also be contusion of the hymen."

       The situation when rape is committed with a child has been well explained in the above chapter in the following manner:-

       "In the case of small children, the genital injuries found are either absolutely minimal or of such magnitude that one is unable to perform the examination without general unaesthetic. It must be remembered that it requires a great amount of force, exerted via penis, to effect full penetration into the small under-developed child, because of this many rapists of small children are satisfied to commit what is described as rape without full penetration."

       Further that;

       "Bodily injuries, because of the lack of resistance by the child are usually absent in this type of case."

       Furthermore, extent of penal insertion is highlighted in Simpson Forensic Medicine (Tenth Edition) by Bernard Knight in the following manner:-

       "Sexual intercourse means nothing less than penile insertion, even if this is only just between the labia. Full penetration is not necessary and rupture of the hymen is irrelevant, but unless some degree of penile introduction can be proved, a charge of rape cannot be sustained and anything less is 'indecent assault.' An orgasm or ejaculation of semen is not relevant, only penetration. (emphasis supplied)"

       The nature of injuries endured by the victim and described by the Medical Officer perfectly matched with the observations highlighted above and sufficient to attract the offence of 'rape' on the touchstone of penetration. Reliance is placed on case reported as "Madan Gopal Kakkad v. Naval Dubey and another (1992 SCR (2) 921, 1992 SCC (3) 204" wherein a rape was committed upon a minor girl of aged about eight years and upon examination of the victim after five days of the occurrence, the Medical Officer observed an abrasion on the medial side of labia majora and readness around labia minora with white discharge but the hymen was intact and in view of absence of signs of full penetration the Medical Officer opined that there was an attempt to rape but the Supreme Court observed as under:-

       "Under the basis of medical findings, it can safely be concluded that there was partial penetration within the labia majora or vulva or pudenda which in legal sense is sufficient to contribute to rape and convicted the accused for the offence of rape."

       In view of above, I am of the considered view that it was a case of complete rape and not an attempt to rape as urged by the defence.

       Learned defence counsel also stressed that in the report of DNA analysis, no semen stain was detected, which is fatal for the prosecution. This submission is also not helpful for the defence for more than one reasons. Firstly, according to the Medical Officer, private area of the victim was washed prior to her examination, as such there seems no possibility of availability of semen at the time of examination. Secondly, detection of seminal material in the vaginal swabs of the victim is just a corroboratory piece of evidence and merely due to its non-detection the other overwhelming ocular and medical evidence cannot be discarded. The Apex Court case reported as "Abdul Ghani v. The State through P.G. Balochistan and another" (2022 SCMR 544) has observed as under:-

       "The child being in tender nobility is clinically established to have been violated, a circumstance that required no further corroboration. Negative reports do not reflect upon the veracity of prosecution case for reasons more than one. DNA profile generation though a most meticulous method with unfailing accuracy, nonetheless, requires an elaborate arrangement about storage and transportation of samples, a facility seldom available. Even a slightest interference with the integrity of samples may alter the results of an analysis and thus, the fate of prosecution case cannot be pinned down to the forensic findings alone, otherwise, merely presenting a corroborative support, hardly needed in the face of overwhelming evidence, presented by the prosecution through sources most impeachable."

15.  Having scanned the entire prosecution evidence, this Court is of the view that the prosecution has successfully proved the charge against the appellant as alleged for to the hilt beyond shadow of reasonable doubt through cogent, reliable and confidence inspiring evidence. It was a day light occurrence which was reported to the police with much promptitude. The minor victim herself categorically stated that the appellant forcibly committed Zina-bil-Jabr with her. The statements of the victim, her father and other eye-witnesses, finds full support from the medical evidence. No self-respect girl would falsely come forward in a Court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour as the victim of rape. The appellant in his statement recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C. though had denied the charges yet the story for his false implication put forward by him does not inspire confidence. He neither opted to appear under Section 342 (2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in his defence. Appellant in order to fulfill his sexual lust has molested a little girl of just 4 ½ years old, who has not even developed sexual characteristics. It was a nightmare for a little angel, who endured inhumane act of the appellant and undisputedly, it will haunt her for the rest of her life. Appellant has stigmatized the entire future of a little girl, as such he deserves no leniency from the Court.

16.  The nutshell of above discussion is that I have no legitimate exception to differ with the conclusion arrived at by the trial Court qua the conviction and sentence of the appellant, as such instant appeal being devoid of any force stands dismissed.

-Relevancy and admissibility---Scope---Though by judicial reasoning relevant evidence is usually admissible but there are certain restrictions on admissibility depending upon exclusionary rules of evidence---Such artificial restrictions on the process of judicial reasoning known as rules of evidence are not uniform in the policy they seek to implement--- Rules of evidence are all attributable to policy considerations and have nothing to do with their value or links in rational chain of reasoning which restrict, rather than promote access to potentially useful information---Unlike relevance, admissibility has nothing to do with probative or logical relationship between evidence tendered and effect to be proved---Admissibility involves exclusively a determination of whether law of evidence permits relevant evidence of a particular kind to be received by the court---Some evidence, such as hearsay, is excluded, even though relevant, because of danger of unreliability inherent in repeated statements and because it cannot be cross-examined effectively---Confession of accused though relevant yet if recorded while in police custody is not admissible because of the reason it can be procured due to threat, duress or coercion thus regarded as unreliable---Some evidence such as evidence of previous bad character of accused in a criminal case is excluded, even though relevant, because of considerations of fairness to the accused and danger of prejudice flowing from judge’s becoming aware of his records.

----Classification---Any given item of judicial evidence may attract more than one of the labels by which varieties of evidence have been classified---Principal labels are (i) Testimony, (ii) Hearsay evidence, (iii) Documentary evidence, (iv) Real evidence and (v) Circumstantial evidence---Testimony means direct evidence; hearsay, an indirect evidence; documentary evidence means presentation of facts through documents; real evidence includes material things (like case property)---In addition to material objects, real evidence also includes documents, physical appearance of persons and animals, demeanour of witnesses, intonation of voices on a tape recording, views, inspections out of courts of locus in quo or of some object which it is impossible or highly inconvenient to bring to court, and, possibly, out-of-court demonstrations or re-enactments of acts or events into which Court is inquiring---Circumstantial evidence means evidence of relevant facts like motive, plans and preparatory acts, capacity, opportunity, identity, continuance, failure to give evidence, failure to provide evidence and standards of comparison.

            
Additional evidence---Fact in issue and relevant fact---Criminal charge---Proof---Accused was aggrieved of summoning of two witnesses by Trial Court as additional witnesses---Plea raised by accused was that testimony of both the witnesses was hearsay and not relevant to facts in issue---Validity---Charge in Court has to be proved through evidence as defined in Art. 2(c) of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, which includes “all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under inquiry---Article 18 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, ordains that evidence can only be given of “fact in issue” and “relevant fact” which commands that Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 is an exhaustive statute---Evidence can only be given in the manner as permitted by Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 and no other hypothesis how strong or relevant can be allowed to be brought on record unless Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, permits or accepts it as admissible---What one prosecution witness had observed by her senses could only be deposed by her and none other as required by Art. 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Other prosecution witness was witness of facts touching preparation of offence as mentioned in Art. 21 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 and explanatory to fact in issue as per Art. 22 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, when she had seen accused in naked condition with victim, thus her evidence was also admissible---Permission to bring on record relevant evidence is controlled by exclusionary rules---Court while admitting evidence is to refer gist of evidence or question to be asked, objection if any, reply thereto, and decision thereon before it is made part and parcel of judicial record---Where a judge after attending provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 and precedents on the subject is in doubt as to admissibility of a particular piece of evidence he should declare it in favour of admissibility rather than inadmissibility because its value would later be determined by Court of Appeal as per Art. 162 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---High Court directed Trial Court to proceed to record evidence of two prosecution witnesses summoned as additional witnesses from the stage it was discontinued---

Evidence, recording of---Objection to admissibility---Scope---Any objection on admissibility of evidence by any party is to be attended by Court then and there and decided first so as to proceed further in the matter---Such objection should not be reserved for its decision at fag end of trial.

        Examination-in-chief, recording of--- Techniques---During examination-in-chief, two out of many techniques are most popular which are allowed to be followed by prosecution i.e. (i) signposting, and (ii) piggybacking---Signposting in fact is an indicator to alert witness to a particular part of his testimony e.g. telling the witness that now some questions would be asked about his status/work or questions about his relation with other witnesses and so on---Such bit-by-bit examination helps the witness to recollect facts clearly and it is permissible as per international best practices---Piggybacking is a form of question arranged with the part of answer given by witness while using it as prefix to next question.

       
JUDGMENT
.---This revision petition has been filed against order dated 24.01.2022 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore during the trial in Case FIR No. 1577/2019 dated 07.12.2019 under section 376, P.P.C., Police Station Sundar, Lahore whereby application of the petitioner was dismissed and his prayer was declined for exclusion of hearsay evidence, recording of objections and decision thereon as per law.

2.    Briefly, the proposition tabled before the court carried facts that Nasreen Bibi and Alishba Ramzan, two witnesses of facts relevant to commission of rape, were summoned by the learned trial court under section 540 of Cr.P.C. vide order dated 02.12.2021; such order though was not assailed yet objection was raised by the defence about admissibility of the evidence during recording of their examination-in-chief as being hearsay; refusal to record such objection pushed the petitioner to move an application before the trial court but it was turned down on the same day through impugned order dated 24.01.2022 on the ground that it has been filed to cause delay in conclusion of trial.

3.    Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that Nasreen Bibi who was recorded as PW-3 is not the eye-witness rather after the occurrence she observed fearful expression of her daughter Alishba Ramzan who too was not the victim nor had seen the petitioner (her father) committing rape with Iqra rather carrying an evidence of fact that she saw him sleeping with Iqra in naked condition. Though examination-in-chief of Alishba too was recorded as PW-4, yet what can be brought on record through direct evidence, court is trying to place it through indirect evidence of Nasreen Bibi and has also refused to record and decide the objections raised by defence on the admissibility of such evidence which is against the law and precedents on the subject. She has placed reliance on case reported as “Hayatullah v. The State” (2018 SCMR 2092) in this respect.

4.    On the other hand, learned counsels for the complainant have urged that petitioner has not assailed the summoning order of such witnesses and thereby acquiesced the admissibility of their evidence; this petition has been filed to linger on the criminal process.

5.    Arguments of proponent and opponent were heard; record perused.

6.    Resume of facts collected in the process indicates that one Iqra aged about 11 years whose father had died and with the consent of her mother Parveen Imran, she was brought up by her maternal aunt Nasreen Bibi. Muhammad Ramzan, petitioner was the husband of said Nasreen Bibi who committed rape with Iqra allegedly many times. Last reported rape was formalized through present FIR. Now Nasreen Bibi was summoned by the trial court to depose about the facts she observed when returned home at a point of time, heard about rape with Iqra and facts ensued thereafter including story told by Alishba that she saw her father with Iqra in naked condition.

7.    The main thrust catches two points to elaborate for the assistance of trial court and parties to trial; (i) whether evidence of Nasreen Bibi is admissible under the rules of evidence, (ii) how and when to decide objections with regard to admissibility of any evidence.

 
 
8.    Though by judicial reasoning relevant evidence is usually admissible but there are certain restrictions on admissibility depending upon the exclusionary rules of evidence. These artificial restrictions on the process of judicial reasoning known as the rules of evidence are not uniform in the policy they seek to implement. Note that they are all attributable to policy considerations, and have nothing to do with their value or links in the rational chain of reasoning. They restrict, rather than promote access to potentially useful information. They may be classified according to their underlying policy; they are as under;

 
 
(a)   Structural rules (e.g., rules about the burden and standard of proof, authentication of exhibits), which provides a framework for dealing with evidence at trial.

(b)   Preferential rules (e.g., the best evidence rule), design to avoid accepting evidence of inferior quality when evidence of superior quality is available.

(c)   Analytic rules (e.g., the rules against hearsay), designs to avoid accepting evidence which experience suggests is likely to be unreliable.

(d)   Prophylactic rules (e.g., the rules generally excluding evidence of previous convictions), designed to avoid accepting evidence which judge may be incapable of evaluating objectively, or to which the judge may attach undue weight (‘Prejudicial evidence’).

(e)   Simplificatory rules (e.g., The rule permitting summaries of voluminous documents), designs to aid the court in understanding the issues.

(f)    Quantitative rules (e.g., rules requiring corroboration) designed either positively to insist upon multiple evidential facts to prove certain facts in issue or negatively to prevent the needless presentation of cumulative evidence.

(g)   Policy-based rules (e.g., privileges), which preclude the acceptance (or compelled revelation) of certain evidential facts, based on extrinsic policy considerations such as upholding confidentiality, protecting state secrets, etc.

(h)   Discretionary rules, designed to allow the judge to override the rules of evidence in the interest of justice or expedition.1 (however, judge cannot allow inadmissible evidence to be brought on record).

9.    Depending upon above rules, the evidence by which facts may be proved or disproved in a court is known as judicial evidence. Judicial evidence takes only three forms, namely (i) oral evidence, (ii) documentary evidence and (iii) things. Judicial evidence, however, is open to classification not only in terms of the form in which it may be presented in court but also in terms of its substantive content, the purpose for which it is presented and the rules by which its admissibility is determined. Thus, any given item of judicial evidence may attract more than one of the labels by which the varieties of evidence have been classified. The principal labels are (i) Testimony, (ii) Hearsay Evidence, (iii) Documentary Evidence, (iv) Real Evidence and (v) Circumstantial Evidence. Testimony means direct evidence; hearsay, an indirect evidence; documentary evidence means presentation of facts through documents; real evidence includes material things (like case property); in addition to material objects, including documents, items of real evidence also include the physical appearance of persons and animals, the demeanour of witnesses, the intonation of voices on a tape recording, views, that is inspections out of courts of the locus in quo or of some object which it is impossible or highly inconvenient to bring to court, and, possibly, out-of-court demonstrations or re-enactments of acts or events into which the court is enquiring. Circumstantial evidence means evidence of relevant facts like motive, plans and preparatory acts, capacity, opportunity, identity, continuance, failure to give evidence, failure to provide evidence and standards of comparison.2

 
 

 
 
10.  A charge in the court is proved through evidence as defined in Article 2(c), Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (hereinafter called QSO, 1984) which includes “all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under inquiry; such statements are called oral evidence; and all documents produced for the inspection of the Court are called documentary evidence. Depending upon above definition, only the court is authorized to permit or require any witness to depose before it to state the facts in relation to a matter under inquiry and it is done in two ways, either witness volunteers to depose and court permits, or court calls a witness and requires him to depose. In both situations, witnesses depose through facts; A “fact” is defined in Article 2 (d) of QSO, 1984; according to it, "fact" includes (i) anything, state of things, or relation of things capable of being perceived by the senses and (ii) any mental condition of which any person is conscious. The Facts which are open to proof or disproof in court of law are (i) facts in issue, (ii) relevant facts and (iii) collateral facts. Fact in issue is regarded as “factum probandum” i.e., the principal fact, whereas relevant fact is termed as “factum probans” i.e., the evidentiary fact from which the principal fact follows immediately or by inference, or from which existence or non-existence of a fact in issue may be inferred. Collateral facts, sometime referred as ‘subordinate facts’ are of three kinds: (i) facts affecting the competence of witness (ii) facts affecting the credibility of a witness: and (iii) facts, sometimes called ‘preliminary facts’ which must be proved as a condition precedent to the admissibility of certain items of evidence tendered to prove a fact in issue or a relevant fact. As to the first, an example would be that a potential witness suffers from a mental handicap rendering him incompetent to testify. An example of collateral fact of the second kind would be that a witness, who testifies to the effect that he saw a certain event at a distance of 50 yards, suffers from an eye complaint which prevents him from seeing anything at a distance of greater than 20 yards. Such a witness may be cross-examined about his eye complaint and, if he denies its existence, evidence in rebuttal may be given by an oculist. A collateral fact of the third kind may be illustrated by the reference to an exception to the rule against hearsay: in criminal proceedings a statement made by a participant or an observer of an event is admissible as evidence of the truth of its contents, by way of exception to the rule against hearsay, on proof that it was made at the time of or shortly before or after the event in question in circumstances of such spontaneity or involvement in that event that the possibility of concoction or error can be disregarded.3 Facts in issue and relevant facts in our law of evidence find their space in QSO, 1984. Article 2(2) explains relevant fact, it says, “one fact is said to be relevant to another when the one is connected with the other in any of the ways referred to in the provisions of the Order relating to the relevancy of facts.” All the facts explained in Articles 19 to 69 are regarded as relevant facts. Similarly, Article 2(3) of QSO, 1984 explains facts in issue, it says, “the expression "facts in issue" includes any fact from which, either by itself or in connection with other facts the existence, non-existence, nature or extent of any right, liability or disability, asserted or denied in any suit or proceeding, necessarily follows. Illustration attached to the Article further explains it.

11.  As discussed above alongside the facts in issue, evidence of relevant facts and collateral facts be brought on record to complete the picture. Chapter-III of QSO, 1984 titled “OF THE RELEVANCY OF FACTS”, deals exhaustively with production of relevant evidence. Article 18 ordains as under;

       18. Evidence may be given of facts in issue and relevant facts: Evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are hereinafter declared to be relevant and of no others.

(Bold and underlined for Emphasis)

 
 
This Article ordains that evidence could only be given of “fact in issue” and “relevant fact” which commands that QSO, 1984 is an exhaustive statute, evidence could only be given in the manner as permitted by the Order; no other hypothesis how strong or relevant cannot be allowed to bring on record unless statute ibid permits or accepts it as admissible. Admissibility of evidence is apparently gauged through the words “relevant or irrelevant” used in Articles of QSO, 1984 in the light of specific exclusionary rules which excludes even the relevant evidence. One of the key concepts underpinning the whole of the law of evidence is relevance: irrelevant evidence is not admissible, but this does not mean that evidence will be admissible simply because it is relevant; evidence is frequently excluded notwithstanding its clear and obvious relevance to a fact in issue. The requirement of relevance is thus the first hurdle; only if the evidence is relevant is it then appropriate to consider whether it is excluded by some other rule of admissibility. An oft-quoted definition of relevance is to be found in Stephen’s Digest of the Law of Evidence:

       “The word ‘relevant’ means that any two facts to which it is applied are so related to each other that according to the common course of events one either taken by itself or in connection with other facts proves or renders probable the past, present, or future existence or non-existence of the other.” [12th edn., 1948 (revised), London; Macmillan, art 1]

       In DPP v Kilbourne (1973), Lord Simon said this: -

       “Evidence is relevant if it is logically probative or disprobative of some matters which requires proof. I do not pause to analyze what is involved in ‘logical probativeness’, except to note that the term does not of itself express the element of experience, which is so significant of its operation in law, and possibly elsewhere. It is sufficient to say... that relevant (that is, logically probative or disprobative) evidence is evidence which makes the matters which requires proof more or less probable.”

So, evidence is relevant if it assists in the process of proving or disproving a fact in issue; but where the line is drawn? How does one decide whether the evidence assists in this process or not? There is no fixed answer, except that, as his Lordship indicates, the matter is one of experience. It can be of particular importance in similar fact situations.

12.  For the proof of fact in issue, relevant facts are admissible in evidence which have been counted in QSO, 1984. The Article 19 is first in line to throw light on relevancy of facts which says;

       “Facts, which though not in issue, are so connected with a fact in issue as to form part of the same transaction, are relevant whether they occurred at the same time and place or at different times and places”

The Article requires to give evidence of facts forming part of same transaction occurred at the same time and place or at different times and places. A victim stating fact of occurrence to a third person in the form of ‘res gestae’ is admissible evidence if brought through the testimony of that third person. Reference can be made to case reported as “Faqir Muhammad v. The State” (PLD 1971 Lahore 929). Even a witness of occurrence deposing before his father what he has seen is also an admissible evidence as opposed to hearsay evidence. Reliance is on case reported as “Riasat Ali and another v. The State” (PLD 1991 Supreme Court 397). If a fact is explained by the accused before any person, it becomes a relevant evidence, thus admissible, citation in this respect is “C.N. Peters v. The State” (AIR 1959 483) [Allahabad High Court]; similarly, if an accused admits his guilt before a private person, it also becomes admissible evidence. In our law of evidence, such informal admission is known as extra judicial confession regulated under Article 119(a) of QSO, 1984. To regard a fact as a res gestae evidence, it is essential that it must qualify the characteristics which include (i) Spontaneous exclamation (ii) Contemporaneous physical condition (iii) Present intention (iv) Statement accompanying an act. In this respect case reported as “Rizwan Akhtar alias Razi Bawa and another v. The State” (2021 YLR 2253) is referred. This clearly shows that a victim or a witness if states immediately anything which he has observed before, at or after the occurrence in relation to fact in issue or relevant fact to any person, the testimony of that person becomes admissible into evidence. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case reported as “Raja Khurram Ali Khan and 2 others v. Tayyaba Bibi and another” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 146), acknowledged tender years’ exception to hearsay rules particularly in rape case. That is the reason when anything is deposed before an investigating officer by the witness or victim, the evidence of investigating officer about such facts becomes admissible and the defence in order to shatter the statement of witness confront him with his previous statement.

13.  The evidence of a particular fact is deposed by the very witness as regulated under Article-71 of QSO, 1984; which says;

       “If it refers to a fact, which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he saw it; If it refers to a fact, which could be heard, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he heard it; If it refers to a fact, which could be perceived by any other sense or in any other manner, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he perceived it by that sense or in that manner; If it refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it must be the evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those grounds.”

It shows, any relevant fact perceived by senses could only be deposed by the witness who perceived it and no other. All facts which are incidental to main fact or explanatory to it are regarded as relevant facts or collateral facts which can be deposed even carrying status as “res gestae” evidence. Case reported as “Muhammad Aslam Shah v. The State” (1993 PCr.LJ 704) [Peshawar] is referred. What facts could be incidental or explanatory to main fact have very elaborately been counted in QSO, 1984; but following Articles aptly applied in the case in hand: -

       “Article 21. Motive, preparation and, previous or subsequent conduct: (1) Any fact is relevant which shows or constitutes a motive or preparation for any fact in issue or relevant fact.

       Article 22. Facts necessary to explain or introduce relevant facts: Facts necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which support or rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which establish the identity of anything or person whose identity is relevant, or fix the time or place at which any fact in issue, or relevant fact happened, or Which show the relation of parties by whom any such fact was transacted, are relevant in so far as they are necessary for that purpose.”

(Bold and underlined for emphasis)

A fact which shows preparation of any fact in issue or relevant fact must be allowed to bring on record and similarly if some facts explain further, support or rebut any of the fact in issue or relevant fact could safely be made part of evidence under above permitted provisions.

 
 
14.  In the light of above discussion, it is vividly clear that the witness Alishba PW-4 when appeared before Nasreen Bibi PW-3, she observed her fainted and a link fact Alishba stated of viewing her father while sleeping with Iqra in naked condition clubs both the facts as part of same transaction encompassing observation of Nasreen Bibi and simultaneous deposition of Alishba; therefore, what Nasreen Bibi observed by her senses could only be deposed by Nasreen herself and none other as required by Article 71 of QSO, 1984. Alishba was also witness of facts touching the preparation of offence as mention in the Article 21 of QSO, 1984 and explanatory to fact in issue as per Article 22 of Order ibid when she had seen her father in a naked condition with Iqra/victim, thus her evidence is also admissible.

Determination of admissibility of evidence

15.  How to determine admissibility of evidence and when to decide objections if any, is the questions to be met in this part. The first instruction in this regard is found mentioned in High Court Rules and Orders; relevant part of Chapter-1 is reproduced for reference: -

       PART E -- RECORD OF EVIDENCE IN CRIMINAL CASES

       1. Only relevant evidence should be recorded:---In recording evidence, Magistrates should take care to see that it is relevant and admissible under the provisions of the [Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984]. If any objection is raised as to the admissibility of any evidence, the Magistrate should endeavour to decide it forthwith and the particular piece of evidence objected to, the objection and the decision thereon should be clearly recorded.

       2. Duty of Court to elucidate facts:---Magistrates should endeavour to elucidate the facts and record the evidence in a clear and intelligible manner. As pointed out in 23 P.R. 1917, a Judge in a Criminal trial is not merely a disinterested auditor of the contest between the prosecution and the defence, but it is his duty to elucidate points left in obscurity by either side, intentionally or unintentionally, to come to a clear understanding of the actual events that occurred and to remove obscurities as far as possible. The wide powers given to the court by * [Article 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984] ***[...] should be judiciously utilized for this purpose when necessary.

The statutory provision in this respect is part of QSO, 1984 in the form of Article 131 which is reproduced as under for reference:

       131. Judge to decide as to admissibility of evidence:

       (1) When either party proposes to give evidence of any fact, the Judge may ask the party proposing to give the evidence in what manner the alleged fact, if proved, would be relevant, and the Judge shall admit the evidence if he thinks that the fact, if proved, would be relevant and not otherwise.

       (2) If the fact proposed, to be proved is one of which evidence is admissible only upon proof of some other fact, such last mentioned fact must be proved before evidence is given of the fact first mentioned unless the party undertakes to give proof of such fact, and the Court is satisfied with such undertaking.

       (3) If the relevancy of one alleged fact depends upon another alleged fact being first proved, the Judge may in his discretion, either permit evidence of the first fact to be given before the second fact is proved, or require evidence to be given of the second fact before evidence is given of the first fact.

The above Article when read with attached illustrations finally states three situations for admissibility of evidence; Sub-Article (1) deals with admissibility of relevant evidence; Sub-Article (2) talks about conditional admissibility of a fact with undertaking to prove connected or collateral facts; Sub-Article (3) gives discretion to the court in receiving the evidence of first or second fact, in such an arrangement as deems appropriate. Two forms of admissibility are most common to be used to bring on record the relevant evidence which are as follows:

       Multiple admissibility: where evidence is inadmissible for one purpose, it cannot be excluded if it is admissible for another. For example, an out of court statement may be inadmissible for the purpose of proving the truth of its contents, because of the rule against hearsay, but admissible, as original evidence, for the purpose of proving that this statement was made. This principle has been described, somewhat misleadingly, as one of multiple admissibility.4

       Conditional admissibility: an item of evidence, viewed in isolation, may appear to be irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. Taken together with or seen in the light of some other item of evidence, its relevance may become apparent. Evidence, however, can only be given at a trial in piecemeal fashion, by degrees, and it may be impossible to reduce the second item of evidence before the first. In order to overcome this difficulty, the first item of evidence may be admitted conditionally or de bene esse. If, viewed in the light of evidence subsequently adduced, it becomes relevant, it may be taken into account. If, notwithstanding the evidence subsequently adduced, it remains irrelevant, it must be disregarded.5

 
 
16.  Unlike relevance, admissibility has nothing to do with the probative or logical relationship between the evidence tendered and the effect to be proved. Admissibility involves exclusively a determination of whether the law of evidence permits relevant evidence of a particular kind to be received by the court. Some evidence, such as hearsay, is excluded, even though relevant, because of the danger of unreliability inherent in repeated statements and because it cannot be cross-examined on effectively. Confession of accused though relevant yet if recorded while in police custody is not admissible because of the reason it can be procured due to threat, duress or coercion thus regarded as unreliable. Some evidence such as evidence of the previous bad character of accused in a criminal case, is excluded, even though relevant, because of considerations of fairness to the accused and the danger of prejudice flowing from the judge’s becoming aware of his records. Some evidence, for example privileged materials and materials which may be withheld on the ground of public policy, are excluded, even though relevant, for reasons of policy that override the interest of the courts and the parties in having access to all available evidence. Some witnesses (for example young children) are held to be incompetent to testify at all, and others to be incompetent to testify in certain ways (for example, the rule excluding non-expert opinion testimony in most cases) despite the relevance of the testimony which might otherwise be given. The rules of admissibility are, therefore, unconcerned with the extent to which the tendered evidence might be probative or disprobative of fact in issue. They proceed from consideration other than relevance. It is this that gives to the law of evidence its exclusionary aspect. Inadmissible evidence cannot be received by the court, whatever its relevance and indeed however cogent it might have been. Honourable Supreme Court in a case reported as “Mst. Akhtar Sultana v. Major Retd. Muzaffar Khan MALIK through his legal heirs and others” (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 715) has dealt the relevancy and admissibility in following terms:

 
 
       (i) Relevant and admissible evidence

       10. The Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 ("Qanun-e-Shahadat") governs the law of evidence in our country. The expression "relevancy" and "admissibility" have their own distinct legal implications under the Qanun-e-Shahadat as, more often than not, facts which are relevant may not be admissible. On the one hand, a fact is "relevant" if it is logically probative or dis-probative of the fact-in-issue, which requires proof. On the other hand, a fact is "admissible" if it is relevant and not excluded by any exclusionary provision, express or implied.2 What is to be understood is that unlike "relevance", which is factual and determined solely by reference to the logical relationship between the fact claimed to be relevant and the fact-in-issue, "admissibility" is a matter of law. Thus, a "relevant" fact would be "admissible" unless it is excluded from being admitted, or is required to be proved in a particular mode(s) before it can be admitted as evidence, by the provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat. As far as the latter is concerned, and that too relating to documents, admissibility is of two types: (i) admissible subject to proof,3 and (ii) admissible per se,4 that is, when the document is admitted in evidence without requiring proof.

17.  Though discretionary rules of evidence allow the judge to override the rules of evidence in the interest of justice or expedition but there appears to be no common law discretion to admit inadmissible evidence, either in criminal or civil cases. In Myers v. DPP [1965] AC 1001 at 1024, Lord Reid said:

       “in arguments the Solicitor General maintains that, although the general rule may be against the admission of private records to prove the truth of entries in them, the trial judge has discretion to admit a record in a particular case if satisfied that it is trustworthy, and that justice requires its admission. That appears to me to be contrary to the whole framework of the existing law. It is true that a judge has a discretion to exclude legally admissible evidence if justice so requires, but it is very different thing to say that he has a discretion to admit legally inadmissible evidence… No matter how cogent particular evidence may seem to be, unless it comes within a class which is admissible, it is excluded.”

 
 
18.  It is trite that any objection on admissibility of evidence by any party is to be attended by the court then and there and decide the same first so as to proceed further in the matter. Such objection should not be reserved for its decision at the fag end of trial which usually skipped decision due to not reminding the court at that time and in this way inadmissible evidence is brought on record which prejudices the mind of the court, consequently led to wrong decision. There is plethora of judgments on this dictate of law; some of which are cited as under; “Asim Murtaza Khan v. The State through Chairman NAB, Islamabad” (2021 SCMR 1844); “Hayatullah v. The State” (2018 SCMR 2092); “Muhammad Ameen v. The State” (2019 PCr.LJ 412 [Lahore (Multan Bench)]); “Rani Bibi v. The State” (2018 PCr.LJ 310 [Lahore]); “Naveed-ul-Hassan v. The State” (2006 PCr.LJ 1804 [Karachi]); “Asif Jameel and others v. The State” (2003 MLD 676 [Karachi]); “Province of Punjab through Collector, District Gujrat and 2 others v. Muhammad Bashir and another” (1997 MLD 806 [Lahore]).

       In a case reported as “Hayatullah v. The State” (2018 SCMR 2092) cited above, the five Members’ Bench of Honourable Supreme Court has commanded the trial court as well as prosecution to be alert to deflect the inadmissible evidence, otherwise it will not only expose the ability and knowledge of law of the Judge, prosecutor and defence counsel but also case files would be found filled with inadmissible evidence, it has been directed to the trial court in following terms;

       “It is the duty of the court to stop the witness at the moment he utters inadmissible evidence and should not allow to bring on record such inadmissible evidence”

       The Honourable Court further observed;

       “that although sometime objection was raised by either party regarding the inadmissibility of such piece of evidence but the court while admitting the evidence at that time reserves the question of law as to its admissibility till the end of the trial and while delivering the judgment no such question of admissibility is usually decided. It is the duty of the trial court to decide the objection then and there and not to defer the same till the end of the trial”

Sometime though there is no objection on recording of statement of witness yet party raised objection about a particular question asked during recording of statement considering it as irrelevant or inadmissible, even in that eventuality court is obliged to first record the question, then objection and finally decision thereon. Reliance in this respect is on cases reported as Muhammad Munir v. The State (2001 PCr.LJ 1650 [Karachi]); “Liaquat Ali Channa v. Additional Sessions Judge, Gambat, District Khairpur and another” (2012 PCr.LJ 1979 [Sindh]).

19.  Whether the evidence is relevant and admissible, and is required to be brought on record for the purpose of corroboration, it is necessary to follow the scheme of law as ordained in QSO, 1984 and witness may be also be questioned as to any other circumstance which he observed at or near to the time or place at which such relevant fact occurred if the court so considers would help to complete the panoramic view of moments so going on. For reference Article 152 of QSO, 1984 is reproduced:

       152. Questions lending to corroborate evidence of relevant fact admissible: When a witness whom it is intended to corroborate gives evidence of any relevant fact, he may be questioned as to any other circumstances which he observed at or near to the time or place at which such relevant fact occurred if the Court is of opinion that such circumstances, if proved, would corroborate the testimony of the witness as to the relevant fact which he testifies.

       Illustrations

       A, an accomplice, gives an account of robbery in which he took part. He describes various incidents unconnected with the robbery which occurred on his way to and from the place where it was committed.

       Independent evidence of these facts may be given in order to corroborate his evidence as to the robbery itself.

At first, facts would be deposed in response to questions asked as required under Article 152, then previous statements made about such facts be brought on record as per Article 153 and all requirements should be met as required by Article 154 of QSO, 1984.

 
 
20.  The forms of question for examination-in-chief and cross-examination are relatively dealt under Articles 136 to 141 of QSO, 1984; questions starting with words “when, where, what, why, who and how (describe) are permitted to be asked in examination-in-chief as open-ended questions because it does not amount to a leading question; leading questions are also permitted if not objected to by the adverse party. If objected, even with the permission of the court can be asked as per Article 137 of QSO, 1984. During examination-in-chief, two out of many techniques are most popular to be allowed to follow by the prosecution i.e. (i) signposting, and (ii) piggybacking. Signposting in fact is an indicator to alert the witness to a particular part of his testimony e.g. telling the witness that now some questions would be asked about his status/work or questions about his relation with other witnesses and so on; this bit-by-bit examination helps the witness to recollect the facts clearly and it is permissible as per international best practices. Piggybacking is a form of question arranged with the part of answer given by the witness while using it as prefix to next question, e.g., if a witness replied that accused made a fire shot which hit the deceased; then by using technique of piggybacking, next question can be framed like; “when the fire hit the deceased, how did he react or what happened to him”. This technique also helps to produce a conjunction in or a symmetry to evidence. It is the domain of the court to control question which a party wants to ask as per Article 143 of QSO, 1984; therefore, court should remain vigilant while attending such questions and decide its relevancy or admissibility then and there; if a question is asked without reasonable ground, then court can take proper action as required under Articles 144, 145 and 146 of QSO, 1984.

 
 
21.  For what has been discussed above, it is summarized that permission to bring on record the relevant evidence is controlled by exclusionary rules as discussed above, therefore, court while admitting evidence must refer gist of evidence or question to be asked, objection if any, reply thereto, and decision thereon before it is made part and parcel of judicial record. Where a judge after attending the provisions of QSO, 1984 and precedents on the subject is in doubt as to the admissibility of a particular piece of evidence he should declare it in favour of admissibility rather than inadmissibility because its value would later be determined by court of appeal as per Article 162 of QSO, 1984. Keeping in view the conclusion arrived at as referred in paragraph 14 above, learned trial court shall proceed to record the evidence of PW-3 and PW-4 from the stage it was discontinued. From perusal of application of petitioner, and impugned order, it is not reflected that what was the specific objection which has not been attended by the learned trial court; therefore, this writ petition is dismissed; however, if any objection is raised by any party on the form of a question or admissibility of a fact, it shall be attended by the trial court in accordance with law as highlighted above. Learned trial court shall also proceed to complete the trial as early as possible keeping in view the provisions of section 344-A of Cr.P.C.

Scribe of a document can only be a competent witness if he has fixed his signatures as an attesting witness of document and not otherwise---Signing of document in capacity of writer, does not fulfill and meet mandatory requirement of attestation by scribe separately---Scribe may be examined by concerned party for corroboration of evidence of marginal witness.

Provision in a statute---Whether directory or mandatory---Principle---In order to determine whether a proviso is directory or mandatory, the duty of the court is to try to unravel the real intention of the legislature---The ultimate test is the intent of the legislature and not the language in which the intent is clothed---The object and purpose of enacting the provision provide a strong and clear indicator for ascertaining such intent of the legislature---The intention of the legislature must govern and this is to be ascertained not only from the phraseology of the provision but also by considering its nature, its object, and the consequences which would follow from construing it one way or the other---This exercise entails careful examination of the scheme of the Act in order to discover the real purpose and object of the Act---A provision in a statute is mandatory if the omission to follow it renders the proceedings to which it relates illegal and void, while a provision is directory if its observance is not necessary to the validity of the proceeding---One of the important tests that must always be employed in order to determine whether a provision is mandatory or directory in character is to consider whether the non-compliance of a particular provision causes inconvenience or injustice and, if it does, the court would say that that provision must be complied within and that it is obligatory in its character---There are three fundamental tests, which are often applied with remarkable success in the determination of this question---They are based on considerations of the scope and object, sometimes called the scheme and purpose, of the enactment in question, on considerations of justice and balance of convenience and on a consideration of the nature of the particular provision, namely, whether it affects the performance of a public duty or relates to a right, privilege or power - in the former case the enactment is generally directory, in the latter mandatory.
[12/9/25, 7:21:44 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Words "may" and "shall" used in a section of an Act or an Ordinance---Whether directory or mandatory---Principle---'May' and 'shall' are interchangeable and their interpretation as to whether they are directory or mandatory in nature depends upon the context in which they are used and cannot be interpreted with the rigidity attributed to them in ordinary parlance---If no penal consequences are given in a provision, even if the word "shall" is used therein, the said provision becomes directory (and not mandatory) and the word "shall" will be read as "may".

S. 7---Commission of offence of qazf---Appreciation of evidence---Accused was charged for leveling allegation containing imputation of zina against the complainant while recording his statement in a civil suit---Perusal of the record revealed that the complainant during his cross examination in his criminal petition of Qazf, recorded on 16.05.2023 admitted that some quarrel happened between the appellant/accused and his counsel after recording of that piece of statement containing the disputed allegation of zina, on the basis of that statement subsequently the case of Qazf was filed---Such piece of statement had raised a question that some dispute did happened inside the Court, which had rendered some doubts regarding the recording of statement containing the allegation of zina amounting to Qazf, which apparently the Trial Court had ignored---Any statement which was a part of judicial proceedings containing signatures of the Presiding Officer i.e. the Court in that case, bore a presumption that the statement was recorded by the same Presiding Officer/Court himself, unless proven otherwise, therefore, in that case the Trial Court had failed to appreciate the evidence of the parties available on record to evaluate that whether that statement containing the allegation of zina was recorded by the Court itself or not, or whether the Court was present at that time while the alleged statement was being recorded or not---Said aspects of the case not only were relevant but crucial in Hudood laws because such questions were pivotal to evaluate the authenticity of the evidence for proving the allegation against the accused beyond any shadow of doubt---Perusal of the record revealed that the Trial Court had failed to adopt the procedure mentioned in S.203-B, Cr.P.C, which the Court was bound to follow in the light of S.17 of the Ordinance, 1979---However, the Trial Court failed to understand that a complaint could not be declared as a sacrosanct document and its impact needed to be examined before granting permission---Thus, non-compliance of procedure as noted by the Trial Court had deprived the appellant of his right of having a fair trial, therefore, in such view of the matter, the case was remanded back to the Trial Court for de novo trial. Consequently, the captioned criminal reference filed for confirmation of the punishment awarded to appellant was answered in negative---

Ss. 500 & 502-A---Defamation---Private complaint---Petitioner filed private complaint against the respondent with the contention that he levelled false allegation of zina upon her---Complaint was dismissed by the Trial Court---Validity---Admittedly, the accusation of zina/illicit terms with "RM" against the petitioner was imputed by the respondent in divorce deed dated 07.06.2020, which he repeatedly made in the pleadings of the suits and family matters, which he also reiterated and reaffirmed in presence of the Court and in public, in union council office, and judicial/non-judicial proceedings, even after severing marital bond with the petitioner and no longer remaining her husband---This prima facie fell within the definition of Qazf and there was no question of applicability of the provisions of S.14 of the Offence of Qazf (Enforcement of Hadd) Ordinance, 1979 regarding the li'an in this case---Trial judge very conveniently overlooked such aspects of the case and dismissed the subject complaint, being not maintainable, holding that the respondent, who was the husband of the petitioner, had made the accusation of zina/ illicit relations against the petitioner during subsistence of the marriage, therefore, the provisions of S.14 of the Qazf Ordinance, 1979, were attracted to the case of the petitioner---Petitioner had supported the contents of her complaint by cursory evidence and she had also been supported by the witnesses in their respective cursory statements recorded before the Judicial Magistrate, who after conducting preliminary enquiry under S.202, Cr.P.C, and recording the statements of petitioner's witnesses submitted his enquiry report dated 16.01.2023, in affirmative, which had also been completely ignored by the trial judge while passing the impugned order---Said material brought on the record had to be considered to determine whether a prima facie case was made out or not and no deeper appreciation was required at the initial stage---

[12/9/25, 7:59:56 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Misrepresentation before a Court of law is not a mere lapse; it strikes at the very core of the judicial process. The administration of justice proceeds on the assumption that litigants will make truthful disclosures and will not withhold material facts essential for a fair adjudication. When a party, through commission or omission, presents an incomplete or distorted picture, the Court is misled into proceeding on a premise that does not exist, thereby jeopardizing the accuracy and legitimacy of the outcome. Such conduct does not only affect the immediate lis; it erodes public trust in the judicial system and undermines the confidence with which parties approach this forum for redress. A litigant who deliberately resorts to concealment or deceit must, therefore, bear the consequences of such misconduct, for the integrity of the judicial process is non-negotiable and demands strict adherence to candor and fairness at every stage. 

The combined effect of (i) withdrawing the main suit, (ii) continuing to prosecute this Civil Revision without disclosure, and (iii) filing a fresh C.M. for prohibitory relief even after dismissal of instant Civil Revision for non-prosecution and during pendency of restoration application reveals a pattern of deliberate concealment and misuse of the Court’s process. A litigant who withdraws the very suit giving rise to the Civil Revision cannot be permitted to retain any advantage under interim orders. Once the main suit was withdrawn, this Civil Revision automatically / ipso facto became infructuous, and all interim orders stood extinguished by operation of law. Such conduct has direct consequences, as misrepresentation before the Court strikes at the heart of judicial integrity and undermines the fair administration of justice.

In case a suit under Order XXXVII of CPC is decreed ex-parte, it is not obligatory for the defendant to move an application for leave to contest alongwith application for setting aside ex-parte decree. Such application would only come into play after acceptance of latter application and in case of acceptance of application for setting aside ex-parte decree, the defendant would be obliged to move an application for leave to appear and defend the suit within ten days from the passing of such order or judgment.

📍 پشاور ہائی کورٹ کی جانب سے گواہوں کے بیانات کی ریکارڈنگ کے لیے رہنما اصول جاری

پشاور ہائیکورٹ نے ٹرائل کورٹ، پراسیکوشن اور وکلاء کے لیے گواہوں کے بیانات کی ریکارڈنگ کے دوران اپنانے والے طریقہ کار کے لیے رہنما اصول جاری کیے ہیں۔ عدالتوں کو ہدایت کی گئی ہے کہ بیانات کی آڈیو و ویڈیو (Audio-Visual) ریکارڈنگ یقینی بنائی جائے۔👇

✍️1. آئندہ تمام ٹرائل کارروائیاں، خاص طور پر بیانات کی ریکارڈنگ، عدالت میں موجود audio-video facility کے ذریعے کی جائیں۔ جب تک transcript recorders مقرر یا دستیاب نہ ہوں، موجودہ طریقہ کار کے ساتھ ساتھ audio-video recording بھی لازمی ہوگی۔ تمام ریکارڈنگز کو مستقبل میں استعمال کے لیے محفوظ کیا جائے گا۔ جہاں یہ سہولت موجود نہ ہو، متعلقہ District & Sessions Judge رجسٹرار ہائیکورٹ سے مشورہ کر کے تنصیب یقینی بنائیں۔

✍️2. ہر ٹرائل کورٹ گواہ کی مکمل شناخت یقینی بنائے، جس کے لیے گواہ سے personal questioning کی جائے اور اس کا demeanor نوٹ کیا جائے۔

✍️3. ہر گواہ CNIC پیش کرے اور اگر وہ سرکاری یا محکماتی ملازم ہو تو service card بھی پیش کرے، جس کی جانچ عدالت کرے گی، اور وکلاء بھی اس کی جانچ کر سکتے ہیں۔

✍️4. یہ کہ CNIC اور service card متعلقہ گواہ کے بیان میں ظاہر کیے جائیں۔

✍️5. ہر گواہ کو عدالت میں حلف دلایا جائے۔

✍️6. ہر سرکاری گواہ کے نام، والد کا نام، عہدہ اور محکمانہ تعیناتیاں درست طور پر examination-in-chief کے آغاز میں درج ہوں۔

✍️7. تمام بیانات واضح اور readable ہوں، اور ہر گواہ کے بعد Presiding Officer کے دستخط لازمی ہوں، جب تک digital recording system مکمل طور پر فعال نہ ہو۔

✍️8. اگر گواہ کی شناخت یا کردار مشکوک ہو، تو جانچ پڑتال کے بعد ہی اس کا examination کیا جائے۔ 

✍️9. انصاف کے تقاضے کے لیے عدالت Section 540 Cr.P.C 1898 کے تحت کسی بھی گواہ کو summon یا re-examine کر سکتی ہے، اگر اس کی گواہی عدالتی فیصلے کے لیے ضروری ہو۔

✍️10. یہ کہ False evidence، forged documents، defective investigation، یا deliberate obstruction of justice کے کیسز میں عدالت جہاں ضروری ہو، Section 476 Cr.P.C, Section 32 KP CNSA 2019, اور Sections 166(2) & 186(2) PPC کے تحت کارروائی کرے۔

✍️11. پراسیکوشن یقینی بنائے کہ تمام گواہوں کے درست نام، عہدے اور تفصیلات Section 173 Cr.P.C کے تحت چالان میں درج ہوں۔

✍️12. عدالت میں گواہ پیش کرنے سے پہلے پراسیکیوٹر گواہ کے CNIC اور service card کی تصدیق کرے اور چالان اور پولیس فائل سے مطابقت یقینی بنائے۔

🤔13. پراسیکیوٹر یہ یقینی بنائے کہ کوئی بھی شخص جس کا نام چالان میں نہ ہو، عدالت کی اجازت کے بغیر گواہ کے طور پر پیش نہ کیا جائے۔

✍️14. کسی بھی discrepancy، substitution یا clerical error کی صورت میں فوراً عدالت کو اطلاع دی جائے۔

✍️15. پراسیکیوٹر بیانات کی ریکارڈنگ کے دوران موجود اور چوکس رہے، اور یقینی بنائے کہ ہر گواہ کو قانون کے مطابق examine, cross-examine اور re-examine کیا جائے۔

✍️16. پراسیکیوٹر کو اپنی اخلاقی ذمہ داری برقرار رکھنی ہوگی اور صرف conviction پر نہ بلکہ انصاف کے حصول پر عمل کرے۔

✍️17. وکلاء کو یاد رہے کہ ان کا بنیادی فریضہ عدالت کی مدد اور انصاف کی فراہمی ہے (Rule 163 PLB Rules 1976)۔

✍️18. گواہ کی شناخت، ثبوت یا بیان میں کسی بھی discrepancy، irregularity یا error کو فوراً عدالت کو بتایا جائے۔

✍️19. دفاعی وکلاء facts چھپانے، misstatements یا procedural lapses سے گریز کریں جو صرف client کے فائدے میں ہوں مگر انصاف کی راہ میں رکاوٹ ہوں۔

✍️20. ان ذمہ داریوں کو نہ نبھانا misconduct کے زمرے میں آ سکتا ہے (Rule 175A PLB Rules 1976)۔

✍️21. ہر گواہ اپنی اصل شناخت، والد کا نام، پیشہ اور عہدہ ظاہر کرے۔ اگر کوئی حقیقت چھپائی گئی یا عدالت کو گمراہ کیا گیا، تو عدالت مناسب قانونی کارروائی کرے۔

⚖️ مختصر حقائقِ کیس

اس کیس میں اپیل کنندہ محمد صابر کو ٹرائل کورٹ نے 13 جنوری 2025 کو عمر قید اور Rs. 1,000,000 fine کی سزا سنائی تھی۔ اپیل کنندہ کے وکیل نے پروسیکوشن میں کئی نقائص کو اجاگر کیا، بشمول قیصر خان کی گواہی، جو witness list میں نہیں تھا۔ چالان کے مطابق "Hidayat" نامی کانسٹیبل نے seized narcotics کے سیمپل Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) پہنچائے، لیکن ٹرائل کورٹ میں "قیصر خان" کو گواہ کے طور پر پیش کیا گیا، جبکہ اس کا نام چالان (charge sheet) میں شامل نہیں تھا۔ عدالت نے ہدایت دی کہ Member Inspection Team (MIT) آفس اس کا نوٹس لے اور ٹرائل جج کے خلاف کارروائی شروع کرے۔ اسی طرح، ڈسٹرکٹ اینڈ سیشن جج پشاور، متعلقہ جج اور عملے کی ذمہ داریوں کے حوالے سے نوٹس لیں۔ڈائریکٹر جنرل پراسیکیوشن کو ہدایت دی گئی کہ District Public Prosecutor اور ڈیوٹی پر موجود پبلک پراسیکیوٹر کے حوالے سے نوٹس لیں۔ اسی طرح، Director General Exicise, Taxation and Narcotics Control Department کو ہدایت دی گئی کہ seizing officer اور IO کے خلاف کارروائی کریں۔

⚖️ اپیل کی سماعت اور حکم

عدالت نے اپیل منظور کرتے ہوئے impugned judgment، conviction اور sentence کو ختم کر دیا اور کیس دوبارہ ٹرائل کورٹ بھیج دیا۔ ہدایت کی گئی کہ Hidayat یا Qaiser Khan کو دوبارہ examine کیا جائے، اور دونوں فریقین کو cross-examination کا موقع فراہم کیا جائے۔ اگر کسی نئے حقائق کا انکشاف ہوا، تو accused کا amended statement Section 342 Cr.P.C کے تحت ریکارڈ کیا جائے۔ پھر، دونوں فریقین کو دلائل کے لیے موقع دیا جائے اور کیس کو نیا فیصلہ دیا جائے، بغیر کسی سابقہ مشاہدے سے متاثر ہوئے۔ یہ کارروائی ایک ماہ کے اندر مکمل کی جائے۔ اس دوران اپیل کنندہ کو under trial prisoner کے طور پر رکھا جائے۔

بینچ، جس میں چیف جسٹس پشاور ہائی کورٹ جسٹس ایس ایم عتیق شاہ اور جسٹس محمد اعجاز خان شامل تھے، نے ہدایت دی کہ گواہوں کے بیانات کی transcription اور translation کے لیے certified transcript recorders مقرر کیے جائیں، اور رجسٹرار کے دفتر کو ہدایت دی کہ وہ ان کے فرائض کے لیے واضح Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) تیار کرے۔ بینچ نے اس بات پر بھی زور دیا کہ ترجیحاً یہ افراد قانونی علم رکھتے ہوں، اور عبوری طور پر موجودہ عملہ اس مقصد کے لیے تربیت حاصل کرے، تاہم آخری ذمہ داری ٹرائل جج کی ہوگی، جو بیانات کو مقررہ طریقے کے مطابق ریکارڈ کرنے کا پابند ہے۔ یہ ہدایات 31 صفحات پر مشتمل تفصیلی فیصلے میں جاری کی گئی ہیں، جو ایک narcotics کیس میں اپیل کی سماعت کے دوران دی گئی تھیں، اور رجسٹرار پشاور ہائی کورٹ کو ہدایت کی گئی کہ یہ ہدایات چھ مہینے کے اندر نافذ کی جائیں۔

What is cross-examination; It comes under chapter 10 in articles 133,  134,  135, 136, 137, 138, 140, 141, 150,  161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and 162 Criminal procedure code (Cr.P.C). A statement on oath of a witness before the Court is known as the examination-in-chief. When the adverse party tries to falsify/ controvert the said examination-in-chief, said process is amount to cross-examination. After cross-examination, if any ambiguity come into picture, the party who produce the witness, can get re-examine said witness after seeking permission from the Court. After that the other party can be given opportunity with the permission of the Court to conduct the cross-examination, if so required.

The cross-examination is also done to find out the truth and detection of the lie in the testimony of the witness. It is important to remember that the justice should not be denied by the improper cross-examination. The advocates should clearly go through those points which they wish to ask before initiating cross-examination on the witness. Generally, cross-examination means to test the credibility of a witness and to bring true facts on the record, which the witness has either not brought on record or has deliberately concealed. The cross-examination is the most powerful engine as invented by the human civilization during the experience of centuries. The cross-examination may differ from case to case and person to person. The age, position, status, expression, qualification and expertise etc of the witness can be the useful topics for the cross-examiners. Right to cross-examine flows from the principle of natural justice that evidence may not be read against a party, until the same has been subjected to cross-examination or at least an opportunity is given for the cross-examination.

Right of cross-examination is not mere formality, but is the only way conferred by law to check the truthfulness of case of opponent party. The worth of an advocate is based on the practice and procedure through which he conducts cross-examination. The cross-examination cannot be confined to the facts to which the witness testifies in his examination-in-chief. He can be cross-examined as to the whole of the case, but it confines to the matter which are relevant to the main case. A witness can be questioned about his conduct, integrity, his enmity with the other party and his interest in giving evidence. To shake the creditability of a witness, the questions can be asked about his previous inconsistent statements about any relevant fact. Indecent and scandalous questions can also be asked by the advocate at the time of cross-examination, if they relate to the fact in issue. The questions intended to insult or annoy the witness should be forbidden by the Court, even though the question may seem to be proper. Evidentiary value of any such statement of witness is to be determined by the Court at the time of final judgment. Further in section 363 Cr.P.C a judge can pass remarks about the demeanor of the witness, which is also amount to some sort of cross-examination. The main purpose of the cross- examination is as under:

i.        To check the credibility of the witness.

ii.       To impeach the accuracy of the evidence.

iii.      To expose and bring on record the facts which the witness has not deposed and said facts are useful for the cross-examiner.

iv.      To confront the facts which the witness has improved to fulfill the lacunas of his case.

There is no hard and fast rule for the cross-examination. Different kinds of witnesses require different treatment. Some witnesses are formal in nature and normally, no cross-examination is required on such witnesses. To conduct proper cross-examination, the concerned advocate must know what onus he has to discharge, what issues is to be proved and what defense he has to take. He can cement the base of his defense, while making questions in the cross-examination and then prove the same after the case of his opponent is over. The witness may be questioned to establish his bias, interest, corruption or perjury. He may be questioned to discover his position with reference to the controversy or to shake his credit by drawing his attention to any of his previous inconsistent statement as to relevant fact or to his previous statement containing admission.It is well said that best facts of a criminal case are known to the police and lawyers and the cases are either win or lose in the chamber of the advocates before the trial commence.

Actually, the cross-examination is an art and during my career as judge, I observed that most of the lawyers were struggling in this field and even they are not aware about the basic legal terms like, facts, statements, evidence, testimony, narration, suggestion, improvements dishonest improvement and confrontation etc. They do not know the basic principle of cross-examination that what question is to be asked and what not. Some time they conduct cross-examination without preparation.

Legal terms used in cross-examination:

Statement: A statement means the formal presentation of facts or the act of stating and reciting of facts. In criminal side its kinds are as under:-

•        Statement of the witnesses before the Court with or without oath.

•        Statement of witnesses before police officers u/S. 161 Cr.P.C.

•        Statement of the witnesses before magistrate u/S. 164 Cr.P.C.

•        Statement of accused before the trial Court u/S. 342 and 340(2) Cr.P.C.

•        Voluntary statement.

•        Previous statement.

Fact: Fact means a circumstance, event or occurrence as actually, takes or took place or a physical object or appearance. It also means thing, state of things, or relation of things which can be perceived through senses. There are various kinds of fact like, fact in issue, relevant fact and fact which are not relevant and otherwise become relevant.

•        Evidence can be given qua fact in issue or relevant fact under article 18 of Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984.

•        Evidence can be given about existence or non-existence of every fact in issue or of such other fact like the fact which are the occasion, cause or effect of fact in issue.

•        Motive, preparation, previous or subsequent conduct of the accused can be relevant fact under article 21 of Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984, while it got no concern with the fact in issue.

•        Some fact necessary to explain or introduce the relevant facts also can be relevant to fact in issue. Please see article 22 of Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984. Identification parade is one of the examples of said situation.

•        Probability is a piece of evidence and can be relied upon as an item to prove a fact. Please see 2006 YLR 251

Fact and opinion; As per article 2(d), Qanun-e- Shahadat order, 1984, fact and an opinion are two different terms of law, having different consequences. For example a doctor who used to conduct the post -mortem examination of a dead body, he describes the nature, seat and number of injuries, which he observes during post mortem report, At the same moment, he can also make his opinion as to the manner through which these injuries might have been caused and as to cause of the death. As an expert, he describes the number, position and nature of injuries, as he has actually observed, perceived and noticed, but to depose about the manner and weapon of offence with which these injuries were caused and the cause of the death, is the simple opinion of the doctor drawn from the facts as he observed during examination of the dead body. Please see PLD 1992 Lah. 314.

Evidence; Evidence means to confirm, attest, explain corroborate and demonstrate the disputed facts on oath before the Court, so that the Court can make the conclusion of the matter in issue between the parties. The word evidence is an exhaustive term and includes all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it, by the witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under inquiry or trial. Such statements are called oral evidence, and all documents produced for the perusal of the Court are called documentary evidence.

Testimony; Evidence and testimony are interchangeable words, but in article 3 and 17 of Qanun-e-Shahdat order1984, word testimony has been used to that of evidence. Testimony means the statements of the parties, witnesses and documents which are allowed under Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984, to be produced before the Court to prove fact in issue or relevant fact. In testimony, competency of the witness, Court, oath of the witness and cross-examination would be the basic factors. Without cross-examination the evidence cannot get the status of testimony. So to make the evidence testimony cross-examination is obligatory. But normally, we use the word evidence to that testimony which is wrong practice.

Voluntary statement; In cross-examination, we face the issue of voluntary statement on the part of witness, when he tries to further explain his answer. There is no provision of voluntary statement in Qanun-e-Shahdat order 1984, and it also got no value in the eye of law and judges normally allow such type explanation /answer to continue the process of evidence. It has been explained in case title Mushtaq Ahmed V Mohammed Sarwer and another that voluntary statement by a witness in cross-examination has no evidentiary value. Such voluntary evidence is against the rule of re-examination as contemplated under Art.133 of Qanun-e-Shahadat order 1984.

Obliging concession; It means to give undue favor to defense. Sometime formal witnesses, doctors and IOs give favorable answer in cross-examination to favor the defense and said answers are always against the record and are normally made in league with the defense side to weaken the case of the prosecution. If the Court come to the conclusion that answers of said PW is given to weak the prosecution case and to support the defense version, then Court can ignore it. Said situation as per law is known as obliging concession and the Court of law discourage said steps of the witnesses and no benefit is advanced to the defense. Please see landmark judgments Habib-Ullah case reported in PLD 69 Supreme Court, page 127, Muhammad Shareef case reported in 1976 Supreme Court, 452 and 2005 SCMR, 1431,2009 SCMR 407 and 2009 Pcrlj 894 FSC.

Previous statement; Said statement is very material in criminal trial. It has been explained in article 140 of Qanun-e-Shahadat order 1984, and section 162 Cr.P.C. If a statement recorded in discharge of official duty in the same case or in some different case, having relevancy with the fact in issue, can be brought on record to confront its deponent, when he comes to Court to make evidence. Article 46 and 47 of The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 are also relevant in this respect.

Narration; Narration is the act of telling a story, usually in some kinds of chronological orders. Narration generally, means any kind of explaining or telling of something. As per legal practice narration means the examination-in-chief of the witness and answer of the witness as given against a general question, put in the cross-examination. All the examination-in-chief and most of the cross- examination are normally done in the form of narration, but there is no restriction to do the same in the question and answer shape.

Leading questions; it means a question which promotes or encourages the answer wanted to the maker of the question. It is further explained by the superior Courts that the real meaning of this question is that a question which suggests the answer (yes) is a leading question. A question which suggests only the answer (no) also is leading question, but a question which may be answered either in yes or no, and suggests neither answer as the correct one, is not leading.

Suggestion; it means an idea or plan put forward for the consideration to other person. In our judicial system, it is normally used by defense counsel to put their stance/version to the pw, during cross-examination to rebut him and advance/introduce the case of defense and if the same is wrongly put, it can promote the case of the prosecution. As per law, settled in PLJ 1991 criminal case Lahore 249, 2010 P Cr. L J, 1726 and Muhammad Shah case, reported in 2010 SCMR page 1009, said suggestions never got the status of corroboration or direct evidence. It is the prosecution which has to prove its case independently. On the basis of one favorable answer by the PW to the defense or any suggestion in favor of the prosecution, would not matter, rather whole evidence is to be looked into, while making any conclusion of the case. In 2006 SCMR, 577, otherwise view is taken and it was held that said situation will be addressed in favor of prosecution, but it is a minority view.

Discrepancies; It means when there is a difference between two things that should be alike. In ocular account normally minor discrepancies crop up due to time factor, but if they do not touch the intrinsic value of evidence, then same will not matter. Please see 2003 SCMR 884 Mandoos Khan case, 2013 P.Cr.R 1028, 2013 P.Cr.L.J 688 and PLD 2013 586. It is added that to address said discrepancies, time factor will be kept in mind, because it plays vital role in memory of the witness.

Confrontation; It is a basic right of an accused in a criminal trial to confront the testimony of opponent witness in his trial, while using the opportunity of cross-examination. In our judicial system confrontation means right of the accused through which he can confront the witness with his previous statement recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. or any statement made by him before any even administrative forum which is related to the matter in issue in 162 Cr.P.C. and in article 141 of Qanun-e-Shahdat etc, when the witness avoids to accept/disclose his actual statement recorded before the police u/S. 161 Cr.P.C, or any other forum of law. Normally, this practice is done when the witness try to improve his case to fulfill the lacunas or to disown anything goes against him. Actually, witness makes an effort to deprive the accused qua said valuable right, so that the accused could not confront said situation. Said act of the witness shakes his credibility. It is added that confrontation is allowed with previous statement of the witness and nothing else. Please see relevant case law PLD 1965 Supreme Court 188 and 1995 MLD 1635 Federal Shariat Court and PLD 2013 SC 386.

Note: Prosecution could not be permitted to confront a witness with his previous statement recorded u/S. 161 Cr.P.C. for the purpose of contradicting him even after being declared hostile.

Procedure of confrontation; To confront a witness with his previous statement is somehow complicated process. I just try to simplify it in the light of my experience. The proper way is to ask the witness, whether he has made such and such statement before police or before any other quasi-judicial or administrative forum. We are normally confused, if the witness replies in yes, the previous statements in writing need not to be proved, because he himself admitted the said statement before the Court and Court will see the fate of said statement. If the witness denies his previous statement or states that he does not remember any such statement, then confrontation is needed and said statement be placed on record as ex; DA, B etc, so the Court could see the authenticity of statement.

The defense counsel will read out to the witness the relevant portion of his previous statement and give him a chance to explain or reconcile the same. For example, if PW stated in his previous statement that he reached at the place of occurrence on hearing the hue and cry, when the victim was assaulted, but in his examination-in-chief before the Court, he states that he reached at the place of occurrence, while passing through near the same. There is a contradiction in his two statements and this can be confronted, if so needed by the defense and defense can put his previous statement as DA etc on the record, so that the Court can observe the actual position. If said practice is not done, then the statement given before the Court on oath would be believed as it is, and no benefit of previous statement can be taken by the defense.

During the dictation of cross-examination, when the defense side tries to bring on record anything left by the witness, which is in favor of the defense or anything added by the pw, which is amount to fulfill the lacuna, then after seeing statement of the PW u/S. 161 Cr.P.C. and the examination-in-chief of the PW and if any addition is made then the said situation can be confronted with the previous statement under section 162 Cr.P.C. and article 140 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984 as the case may be, otherwise the same would be used against the defense.In the same way, when anything is omitted which was mentioned in the previous statement and the same is useful for the defense, then the defense can bring the same on record.

FIR is mere first information having no evidentiary value, until its scribe (we normally use the word scriber to that of scribe which wrong practice) proves its contents before the Court. Its maker can be confronted with it, in 140 Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984. Its maker can be corroborated in 153 Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984. It can be proved against its maker in 34 Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984. Except this it got no role in criminal trial. Mere improvements are not fatal until these become dishonest. To declare them dishonest, the criterion is confrontation, by defense and Court itself can’t adopt said role. So, we ourselves can’t compare the contents of the FIR, with its maker evidence, we being procedural Court has to follow the settle rules of evidence. As far as 161 Cr.P.C. statements are concerned, its use is to confront the witnesses in 162 Cr.P.C. and nothing else, we ourselves can’t compare its contents with testimony of the witness.

Contradiction; It means the opposition of two ideas which are the subject of one and the same proposition. When two witnesses or other persons, state things directly opposed to each other, it amount to contradiction in their evidence. In our judicial system contradiction and confrontation are two different things. Contradiction means a conflict in the evidence of pws, if said contradictions are minor in nature and are not touching and disturbing the roots of the charge, then same are normally ignored, otherwise said situation is addressed in favor of defense. Confrontation is the move of the defense through which the testimony of the witness is checked qua his previous statement. For further clarification please see PLJ 2013 Cr.P.C 319 and 2014 Pcrlj 885. Discrepancies in the detail of the facts do not amount to contradiction. Please see PLD 2005 Peshawar 166. If discrepancies are minor in nature, then carry no weight. Please see 1995 SCMR 1793. It is added that minor contradiction are quite natural, because with the passage of time the witness cannot recollect the actual/minute detail of the occurrence and due to this minor contradiction are normally ignored.

Dishonest improvement/embellishment; Dishonest improvement means to add something in the previous statement recorded u/S. 161 Cr.P.C, to strengthen the case after seeking some legal assistance, but when the same are duly confronted and once the same found to be deliberate and dishonest, it costs serious doubts on the veracity of such witness. Please see 1993 SCMR 550. When a witness makes improvements or omissions in his deposition, he agrees to own dishonesty, which alone is sufficient to discard evidence of such dishonest witness. Please see 2019 MLD 1821. If these improvements are minor in nature. it was held in 2008 SCMR, 8, 2010 SCMR, 385, 2003 SCMR, 884, 2013 SCMR 480, and 2012 SCMR, 1869 that same would not matter.

First version, confession & defense version; These are two different terms having different consequences. First version means the statement/ version of the accused recorded by the I.O, when first time the accused appears before the I.O and the I.O records it under the head of “berderiaft”. Normally, it is based on reality. As per article 27 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 the same is admissible in evidence. As a general rule evidence not forming part of the transaction is not admissible, whereas articles 27&28 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 are exceptions to the said general principle and the facts which are relevant facts to prove the status/mind of the accused are admissible in evidence like the guilt, intent, knowledge, negligence, malice etc of the accused. Law is settled that the accused can take the copy of his first version and during cross-examination, he can bring the same on record under Article 27 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984, by putting question to the I.O. In the same way, any confession made by the accused before the police can also be brought on record under the said article,but this facility is no more available to the prosecution side and whatever the first version or confession of the accused recorded by the I.O, the prosecution cannot bring the same on record while putting the same to the I.O. Further see Section 162 and 172 Cr.P.C under which the accused cannot be restricted to cross-examine the I.O, or the Magistrate who recorded his confession and he place it on record and can use the same in his favour. Please see Liaqat Ali case reported in 1998 P.Cr.L.J 216, PLD 1974 Karachi 91 and Aslam case reported in PLD 1995 Lahore 632 and PLD 1971 SC, 751.

The statement recorded u/S. 161 Cr.PC or in the body of the police file is a relevant fact under Article 49 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984. Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984 is an independent law to other procedural laws i.e. Cr.P.C and under Article 15 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984 Court can compel the I.O, to see the police file and give correct answer and the privilege of the I.O, u/S. 172 Cr.P.C is of no avail to him due to article 15 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984.

As per settled view of the superior Courts, accused is the favorite child of law and he can take a number of pleas in his defense and is not bound to prove the same. This situation has been explained in Azhar Iqbal case, reported in 2013 SCMR 383, whereby it has been clearly opined that in case the accused admits the murder due to Ghayret or due to other general or special exceptions, then too, he cannot be convicted until, unless the prosecution proves its case independently.

Accused is so favorite child of the law that if he has not taken the plea of self-defense and the Court comes to the conclusion that the accused committed the occurrence due to self-defense, then while believing the same, benefit can be given to the accused about the said plea. Please see, 2008 YLR 1315 Umer Draz case, 2005 PCr.LJ 1689, PLD 2004 SC 244 and 2011 SCMR 45.After 18th Amendment under Article 10 (A) privilege in the shape of due process and fair trial is also given to the accused. So, in said situation Courts are bound to give full-fledged opportunity of hearing and defense to the accused except scandalous questions. If the accused put scandalous questions then he loses his status as favourite child of the Court and benefit of 382 B Cr.P.C can also be withheld.

Sometime we face the issue when any accused come under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C as his own witness and deposes on oath before the Court, then all the procedure for confrontation of previous statement provided for the prosecution /defense witnesses would be the same. Here if the prosecution side wants to confront the first version of the accused as got recorded by him before the I.O, then the Court will allow the same.

Defense version means the version taken by the defense counsel during the cross-examination at the eye-witnesses, and at the I.Os. Further the defense version is also taken in the statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C. and if the accused himself appeares as his own witness u/S. 340 Cr.P.C. then, he also takes his defence version on oath. It may be in the light of the first version as discussed above and it may be independent to that of said first version of the accused. The consequences of both the same are different to each other as discussed above.

Un-rebutted evidence; Please see the Article 113,133 and 134 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984, whereby it was explained that if the evidence is un-rebutted, then it would be admissible in evidence. Please see 2007 SCMR 1700, whereby it was held that facts asserted by one party remain un-challenged would amount to admission, so to confront and controvert the incriminating evidence is obligatory, otherwise it would be used against the opponent. Evidence of the eye-witness in the shape of examination-in-chief without cross-examination is admissible in evidence, but it remains only evidence and after cross-examination said evidence got the status of testimony which is more authentic and reliable. So un-challenged evidence can be legally taken into consideration, if it is fully corroborated/ supported by other pieces of evidence like medical evidence and recoveries etc, To believe it against the defense extra care and caution is required, because without cross-examination, it remain evidence and cannot get the status of testimony, because for that purpose cross-examination is necessary.

Evidence of an eye-witness in the form of his examination-in-chief could not be rejected on the simple proposition that he was not subjected to cross-examination, if the accused had himself avoided in a deliberate and calculated manner to avail such an opportunity. Distinction had to be drawn between these two situations, one where opportunity to cross-examination was not given or denied to a party, and second, where it was given, but deliberately not availed of by the accused. In the latter position the accused can badly suffer. If the right to cross, was reserved as per request of defense and the witness is died or not available for cross-examination, then the defense will suffer. Please see PLD 2010 SC 642 Arbab Tsleem case, PLJ 2011 SC 117 and PLJ 2018 SC453 Sadiq case.

In PLD 2001 Lahore 463 otherwise view is taken but after the views of apex Court said view will not matter.

In civil case, said situation effect otherwise. The principle that a statement or any part of statement, which remain un-rebutted amount to admission does not attract in criminal cases, because in criminal side prosecution has to prove its case on its own, beyond any shadow of doubt, but in civil cases preponderance of probabilities of the evidence of the parties matter. So question of un-rebuttal in civil matter is important, but this is not so material in criminal trial. Please see 2018 SCMR 149.

During cross-examination defense must controvert the evidence of witnesses and put his defense in the shape of suggestions to all type of witnesses like eye/recovery witness etc that you are inimical towards the accused etc and due to this you made false evidence. Only plea taken by the accused in his examination recorded under Section 342, Cr.P.C, that the case is false and has been registered under the political influence etc, is not sufficient to create doubt in the prosecution case. Please see 2008 SCMR 387.Defence counsel has to build its defense during cross-examination, because as per section 342 Cr.P.C., there is no room for the defense lawyer to make answers on behalf of the accused, if so asked by the Court under said section.

Probability and benefit of doubt; These are two different terms of law and both said terms have not been explained in any code, however these have been taken up in various judgment of superior Court. A probability is a state of things that reflects the chance or likelihood that a particular event can occur. Probabilities can be expressed in proportion like its range from 0 to 1, and these can also be expressed in percentages ranging from 0% to 100 %. While word benefit means advantage, gain or interest and doubt mean misgiving, suspicion and uncertainty etc. The accused is entitled to have, the benefit of doubt as a matter of right. Accused being a favorite child of law is to be treated as innocent unless he is proved on the basis of best possible evidence that he was connected with the commission of crime.

Blood Stained earth;It got importance in murder trial when the place of occurrence is disputed or the dead body is not verifiable due to certain reason. Police normally collect report without comparison report whether said blood was of the deceased or not. Simple report that it is human blood is not sufficient. To make sure that the deceased was murdered at the place of occurrence, the collection of comparison report of the deceased blood is necessary. In the said situation no need to cross-examine the said aspect of the case.

Scale site plan ;Scale-site plan is not necessary in all the cases, it is the discretion of the IO, to get prepare it if needed. It is not substantive piece of residence. It can be helpful to cross-examine the eye witnesses qua their location and other evidence about mode of occurance.Now in the present era when everybody has video cameras in his mobile, the I.O should prepare the video of the crime scene, but police avoid to do so and take the control of everything to prepare the police report as per their need. It is a basic evidence and if Court see, the said video, then most of the things become clear about the occurrence.

Inquest report Inquest-report/Naqsha Sorat-e-Hal/ Report Marg; These three terms are one and the same and come under section 174 Cr.P.C and police rules 25, 31-35.Inquest report means to observe the cause of death of a person and not the person who had caused the death. It is the duty of police to observe whether it was natural death or by violence or by poisoning, when police visits the place of occurrence and dead body is lying there. Police is bound to mention the cause of death. If said report does not disclose the name of the accused, then it will not matter because its basic requirement is to disclose the cause of death and not the killer. Please see PLD 2006 Peshawer 5 and NLR 1982, Cr.L.J, 452.Said report states the apparent cause of death, provide description of any mark or marks of violence which may be found on the body and describe the manner in which and the weapon or instrument with which such marks appear to have been inflicted.

Said report is signed by the police officer conducting the investigation. The plan of the scene of death and the detail of clothing, etc and a list of the articles lying with the body are mentioned in said report. In cases of death by hanging, the report shall give particulars as to the height and sufficiency of the support and the nature of the thing used to bear the weight of the body. In drowning cases the depth of the water shall be stated

Police file / Zimni /case diary and its use.Case dairy/ zimni is different to the station / general diary(roznamch). Case diaries are recorded by the I.O during the investigation of the case,on the printed pages as provided to the I.O by his department. Every page on which police diary is written got its number, so that the check on the police investigation be maintained, but police badly violates it and almost in the criminal case, the sequence of the page number is disturbed. I.O is bound to send the one carbon copy of his case diary to the DPO office,but this rules is also badly violated by the police. These are some reasons due to which the opinion of the police is always doubted.

Defence cannot claim the copies of the case diaries under Section 265 C/241, Cr.P.C. In the same way, during investigation process the accused cannot claim access to said diaries. The reason behind it is that the plan of investigation of the I.O, should not be in the knowledge of the accused. If the accused will be aware about the line of action of the I.O, then the accused can manage to disappear the incriminating evidence as the I.O wants to procure against the accused. However the statement recorded in boiled from of PWs can be given to the accused.

When police report under Section 173 Cr.P.C is placed before trial Court and trial Court take the cognizance of the case, then the concerned I.O, hand over the police file to the Naib Court of the trial Court. When 173 Cr.P.C, report submitted before trial Court and trial Court take the cognizance , then said report got the status of judicial file and it is the record of trial Court and trial judge can issue the attested copies of said report as per law.

But as far as police file is concerned, the same is not judicial or Court record. We cannot issue the copies of the same to the accused. It can only be used by the I.Os to refresh their memories and defence counsel can get use it to confront the I.O and to put the first version of the accused on Court record. Defence also can get bring on record the material which is favourable to the accused, as collected by the I.O during investigation process, but so such facility is available to the prosecution. Actually police file is the record of the public prosecutor attached with the Court.

Some time we face the issue of using the case diary in the criminal trial on the part of the defense side and if the Court deem it proper to reach at the just conclusion of the case then the Court can direct the investigation officer to look into the case diary and make the answer and the investigation officer would be bound to do so because it is the right of the defense. As per wisdom laid in section 265, Cr.P.C and further explained in 1976 SCMR 506 it is held that police diary cannot be corelated with the statements of all the witnesses recorded by the police. Further case relevant law on this point has been explained in PLD 1992 Lahore 336.It is added that the prosecution side cannot use the case diries in their favour against the defence.

Roznamcha/Station Diary General Dairy;

A diary maintained by the police to enter any significant event, incident, offence or crime etc, on day to day basis is known as police diary and It can be produced in the evidence. Reports about non-cognizable offence are also entered in said register. In addition to that all the proceedings of the I.O are given in that register. Accused cannot claim the copy of said register under Section 265-C /241 Cr.P.C. However, to confront the I.O, the said register can be summoned by the Court at short notice to the concerned police station. In criminal trial normally, we use it to check the investigation process of the I.O, because every I.O is bound to enter his departure and arrival with detail of constables accompanying him. If any thing collected by the I.O, he will enter it in the said register. I.O will also mention the arrest of the every accused in the said register. If the investigation proceeding of the I.O got no support in the said register about his departure / arrival etc with reference to the case, then prosecution will suffer. To reach at just conclusion of the case the Court under Article 140 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 can bring the entry in said register on record and it would amount to statement.

Use of modern evidence like audio or video and its legal value;

The House of Lords in case titled, Regina (Quintavalle) v. Secretary of State for Health held that the laws have to be made in the light of development in scientific knowledge and utilize it in judicial system. Our Courts of law in criminal and civil side can take judicial notice of the credible scientific development under Article 112, Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984. In the present era, we cannot ignore the relevant scientific research and development, which has already been recognized and acknowledged by the Courts in various other judicial systems. Scientific research can help and assist the Court in understanding and appreciating evidence properly and the object of natural and substantial justice can be ensured while using latest technology to collect/ appreciate the evidence. In this regard article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 is there, but to utilize modern devices properly further legislation is required because our scheme of law consider it just as expert opinion and we still prefer the direct or circumstantial evidence etc. It is held in PLD 2019 SC 196 that I.O can get record the statement of the complainant and the PW under Section 161 Cr.P.C through audio or video or any other mode of electronic media.

No audio or video tape straightaway can be relied upon by a Court until the same is proved to be genuine and not tampered with. A forensic report of audio or video tape prepared Punjab Forensic Science Agency is per se admissible in evidence under section 9(3) of said agency. Under Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 a Court can allow such type evidence to be produced in evidence in accordance with the law of evidence. Accuracy of the recording must be proved. An audio or video tape sought to be produced in evidence must be the actual record of the conversation as and when it was made or of the event as and when it took place. The person recorded the conversation or event is to be produced as witness. The audio or video tape must be played in the Court and it must be clearly audible or viewable.

The person recording the conversation or event must identify the voice of the person speaking or the person seen or the voice or person seen may be identified by any other person who recognizes such voice or person. Any other person present at the time of making of the conversation or taking place of the event may also testify in support of the conversation heard in the audio tape or the event shown in the video. Such type evidence must be relevant to the controversy and otherwise admissible. Safe custody of the audio tape or video after its preparation till production before the Court must be proved. The transcript of the audio tape or video must have been prepared under independent supervision and control. An audio tape or video produced at a late stage of a judicial proceeding may be looked at with suspicion. A formal application has to be filed before the Court by the person desiring an audio tape or video to be brought on the record of the case as evidence. Please see PLD 2019 SC 675.In PLD 2019 Supreme Court of Pakistan page 196, it is held that in the present era keeping in view the need of latest technology, the audio and video are accepted as solid evidence.

Note: When an advocate will clear qua above said terms of law, he would be in better position to cross-examine the witnesses.

Cross-examination by defense: It is added that normal concept is that the cross-examination is done only by the defense counsel, but reality is otherwise, even prosecution counsel and even trial judge can also do said job, if so required. Concept of joint cross-examination is not recognized by the law. In case where there are more than one accused, the judge while recording the cross-examination of a witness should mention the name of the accused and/or his lawyer who is cross-examining the witness. Sometime the accused engaged more than one counsel, only one lawyer is allowed to cross the witness on behalf of the accused. Cross-examination by accused himself is no substitute for cross-examination by the counsel. Please see 1993 SCMR 550. Further to conduct relevant and legal cross-examination, one should be clear about the legal terms like, facts, statements, evidence, narration, suggestion, improvements dishonest improvement, and confrontation etc. Even some lawyers are not aware about the difference amongst said terms which are quite necessary for proper cross-examination. The defense counsel normally can ask only three types of questions in cross-examination, in the form of narration, suggestions, and leading questions.

Normally, the defense counsel ask question in the form of narration and the witnesses also answers it, in the form of narration. Most of the cross-examination is in the form of narration, But some time, when the witness is telling lie, or he wants to conceal or confuse the real facts, then the defense lawyer can suggest the witnesses the actual situation. Actually, narration is the stance of the witnesses, while suggestion is the stance of the opponent party, who conduct cross-examination and during this through suggestion said party put its defense to the witnesses. So, any question which was asked in the form of narration is not so dangerous, but any suggestion made by the counsel which either answered in positive or negative can be used against the party making it to the witnesses.

Further after going through the report u/S. 173 Cr.P.C, police file, visiting of the place of occurrence, discussion of the case with the party , proper knowledge of medical jurisprudence and forensic science are also helpful in cross-examination. In murder, injury and rape cases, the knowledge of the doctors is normally very poor and during cross-examination, they can easily be knocked out by the competent defense counsel. In our judicial system normally defense lawyers conduct a lengthy cross-examination, not to assist the Court to arrive at just conclusion, but they do so for the manipulation of mistakes and sometime said practice is done just to pay the gallery.

No proper formula or procedure can be prescribed to conduct proper cross-examination, but after going through the cross-examination as conducted by some competent defense lawyers, some hints can be taken and said right is to be exercised within framework provided under articles 141 and 151 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. It is not necessary that witness should only reply the question as per wishes of the defense side, he can explain his answer as he wishes. No restriction can be imposed upon said explanation. It is the basic duty of the trial judge to ensure the prestige and dignity of the witnesses during the cross-examination and witness should not be harassed by the defense counsel. Actually, a witness comes forward in aid of justice before the Court of law. Even a man with most brilliant qualities would collapse, if he will be subjected to filthy, lengthy and irrelevant cross-examination, so Court should check such type practice.

I just refer my own judgment dated 20.09.2017 passed in case titled the state v Mohammed Arshed, sessions case No.67/S.C. of 2017 and sessions trial No.12/S.C of 2017, FIR No. 448/2017 dated 12.08.2017 u/S. 302 PPC police station Sadar Lodhran, wherein following factors were explained and these factors can be material in cros-examining to observe the availability of the eyewitnesses at the time/scene of occurrence:-

(I)      Residence, age and profession of the witness.

(II)     Routine of daily life of the witness.

(III)    Relationship of the witness with the deceased.

(IV)    Distance between the places of residence of the pws.

(V)     Distance of the place of occurrence from the residednce of the pws.

(VI)    The location of place of occurrence.

(VII)   Approaches/passages towards place of occurrence.

(i)       The distance amongst the pws, the deceased and the accused at the time of occurrence.

(ii)      Seat of the injuries and kind of weapon used by the accused.

(iii)     Position/location of the accused, the pws and the deceased, prior to the occurrence and the same during the occurrence.

(iv)     Arrival of the accused, the pws and the deceased at the place of occurrence and the ways used by them.

Sequence of cross-examination: For convenience, in criminal trial, defense counsel can divide cross-examination in certain paragraphs on the eye witness with the following sequence;

·        In first paragraph the relation of the witnesses can be asked.

•        In second paragraph delay in lodging FIR can be checked.

•        In third paragraph mode of occurrence and the credibility of the witnesses at the time/place can be crossed in a few mini paragraphs.

•        In fourth paragraph ocular account can be confronted with medical evidence.

•        In fifth paragraph motive can be checked.

•        In sixth paragraph recovery witnesses can be crossed, if the eye witnesses are also the recovery witnesses.

•        In seventh paragraph defense version can be put at eye witness

•        Sometime defense lawyers put their case in the beginning and it makes the thing complicated. So, the better option is to put the case of the defense at the end of the cross-examination at the complainant and the eyewitness, so that any development come into cross-examination can easily be covered up / used in defense version.

Settled principle of cross-examination.

If one aspect of the case is admitted by one eye witness, then no need to seek further clarification from other pws, because it’s the prosecution which has to prove and clarify its case. The job of the defense is just to create doubt. Further, if a witness gives some favorable answers, then never seek further clarification of said issue from the said pw, because normally, PW recollects his memory and clarifies the situation as already stated in favor of defense. Some time prosecution counsel makes undue interferes and tries to complicate/explain the situation and during this the witness clarifies the situation. So after seeking favorable answer change the topic and ask other question and if further clarification is needed in the favorable answer, then change the form of the question and then ask at reasonable occasion. Some time it happens that due to the wrong suggestions and questions of defense counsel the defense suffer a lot. Defense cannot get away with his suggestion and questions. So, the defense counsel is clear in mind to put questions and specially suggestions during cross-examination. The better option is that always put questions in the shape of narrations and at the end the defense version can be put in the shape of suggestions to the eye witness.

I have seen a number of times that lengthy cross-examination not only damages the defense, but some time, it becomes helpful to clarify the facts of the case which was inadvertently left by pws. It is not necessary to rebut each and every aspect of the evidence, because some evidence is produced without any relevancy. So, it is the duty of the defense to cross-examine and controvert the evidence which can be used against the defense. It is obligatory for the defense lawyers to prepare their line of cross-examination in the light of their defense, if defense is going to admit the killing while taking self-defense, like grave and sudden provocation etc, then most of the prosecution case like place/time of occurrence, identity of the accused, deceased and cause of death etc, are not required to be cross-examined in detail and in such type of situation, the stress of cross-examination should be on the mode of occurrence and the other aspects which can prove the defense version. In such type situation normally motive, medical evidence and mode of occurrence can be explained in the light of the defense. In most of the cases the comparison report of crime empties is not procured rather some time crime empties are not taken into possession by the I.O. In such a situation said recovery is totally inconsequential and cannot be used as an incriminating piece of evidence against the accused, but some time even senior defense lawyers make lengthy cross-examination on that issue. In my humble, it is totally useless practice.

Sometime place of occurrence is not disputed, but in spite of this, defense counsel cross-examine draftsman up to a number of pages. Sometime irrelevant question are asked from formal witnesses. Said witnesses are not bound to answer such type irrelevant questions. Some questions are normally asked from the pws who identify the dead body. Mostly, they are close relatives of the deceased and they give evidence only to the identification of the dead body. Their examination-in-chief is pertaining to a few lines and defense Court asks from them the time of occurrence, name of the accused and detail of mode of occurrence. If said Pw gives some answers which can favor to defense qua remaining facts o

[12/14/25, 8:25:52 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: For the protection of witnesses and other persons connected with the investigation of criminal case, “The Punjab Witnesses Protection Act, 2018” (Act, 2018) was promulgated, which has established a frame work for witness protection including measures like physical protection, video links and restricted court room entry and protection for witnesses from being cross examined by the accused directly, particularly for serious and sexual offences. 

 Under Section 10 of Act, 2018 empowers the court to examine a witness through video link at a location outside the court and if it is not possible to have a video link in the court room, the court may move to the place, where such facility is available Moreover, article 164 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Ordinance, 1984 gives authority to the court to admit any evidence that may have become available, because of technological advancement.
Accumulative effect of said provisions was that by invoking both the said provisions, the learned trial court may record a witness through video link, if the circumstances of the case so required.

[12/14/25, 8:25:55 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: (i) Under section 7(3) of the MFLO, a Talaq does not become 
legally effective until the expiry of 90 days from the date on 
which notice under section 7(1) is received by the Chairman 
of the Union Council, unless it is revoked earlier. Section 7(3) 
precludes the Talaq from taking effect for a specified period, 
during which the parties continue to be the husband and wife 
in law.

(ii) During this 90-day period, the husband retains the right to 
revoke the Talaq either expressly or by any unequivocal 
conduct indicating such intent. Intimation to the Chairman is 
not a statutory precondition for revocation.

(iii) Where the Talaq is revoked within the aforementioned
period, the marriage continues to subsist in law, regardless of 
the form in which the divorce was originally pronounced 
(including Talaq-ul-bidaat).

(iv) Failure to send notice to the Chairman may attract penal 
consequences under section 7(2), but does not by itself 
amount to revocation of Talaq. It renders the pronouncement 
ineffective, not invalid, in law.

(v) The legal effect of divorce under Islamic law without 
compliance with section 7 has limited recognition only in 
prosecutions for Zina, where the Shariat Appellate Bench has 
held that such divorces, though unnotified, may still be valid 
under Shariah. This exception does not apply to the offence 
of rape under section 376 PPC

(vi) The Chairman of the Union Council is required, upon 
receiving notice under section 7(1), to constitute an 
Arbitration Council and facilitate reconciliation between the 
parties. However, failure of either party to appear or of the 
Council to conduct proceedings does not prevent the 
operation of section 7(3). The Chairman is not empowered to 
adjudicate on the validity or effect of Talaq, and the issuance 
or non-issuance of a certificate has no legal bearing on its 
effectiveness.

(vii) A divorce by Mubara’at, once duly executed and 
communicated to the Chairman, is irrevocable, and the 
husband has no authority to withdraw from it unilaterally. 
The requirement of notice under section 7(1) of the MFLO 
applies mutatis mutandis. However, it only ensures 
procedural regularity and does not affect the validity or 
finality of the dissolution.

Law distinguishes between sin, crime, and offence. A “sin” is a moral or religious transgression, an act considered wrong according to divine command or ethical principles, judged by one’s faith or conscience. Its consequences are spiritual or moral, such as guilt or divine punishment. In contrast, under the statutory framework of Pakistan, a “crime” is an act or omission that is made punishable by law. It is a public wrong that affects society at large, and the offender may be punished by death, imprisonment, fine or other legal penalties. Courts established under the Constitution adjudicate only statutory offences and do not concern themselves with moral or religious conduct. The term “offence” is a technical expression that refers to any act (or omission) that violates the law. It encompasses both regulatory violations, such as traffic infractions, and serious penal acts like murder. “Offence” is a broader concept than “crime”, the latter being generally reserved for serious offences involving public wrongs. Thus, every crime is an offence, but not every offence amounts to a crime in this sense. Under Shariah, however, a crime is an act prohibited by divine injunction and punishable with Hadd or Ta’zir penalties. 

In the present case, the marital bond between the Petitioner and Respondent No.5 existed in law at the time of the alleged occurrence. The Petitioner’s conduct may be considered immoral or inappropriate under religious or social norms, but he cannot be prosecuted under section 376 PPC because, on the facts pleaded in the FIR, the essential ingredients of the offence are not disclosed.

*"دفعہ 7 مسلم فیملی لاز آرڈیننس کے تحت طلاق کے نفاذ، رجوع اور قانونی اثرات کا جامع تجزیاتی جائزہ—ریپ کے الزام (دفعہ 376 تعزیراتِ پاکستان) کے تناظر میں عدالتی اصول"*

(i) مسلم فیملی لاز آرڈیننس (MFLO) کی دفعہ 7(3) کے تحت طلاق اُس وقت تک مؤثرِ قانونی نہیں ہوتی جب تک نوٹس (دفعہ 7(1)) چیئرمین یونین کونسل کو موصول ہونے کے 90 دن مکمل نہ ہو جائیں، الاّ یہ کہ اس مدت کے اندر اس کو واپس لے لیا جائے۔ دفعہ 7(3) طلاق کے نافذ العمل ہونے کو ایک مقررہ عرصہ کے لیے مؤخر کرتی ہے اور اس عرصے میں میاں بیوی کا رشتہ قانوناً برقرار رہتا ہے۔

(ii) ان 90 دنوں کے دوران شوہر کو حق حاصل رہتا ہے کہ وہ طلاق کو واضح الفاظ یا ایسے غیر مبہم طرزِ عمل سے واپس لے لے، جو رجوع کی نیت کو ظاہر کرے۔ رجوع کے لیے چیئرمین کو اطلاع دینا قانوناً لازمی شرط نہیں۔

(iii) اگر بیان کردہ مدت کے اندر طلاق کو واپس لے لیا جائے تو نکاح قانونی طور پر برقرار رہتا ہے، خواہ طلاق کی کوئی بھی قسم استعمال کی گئی ہو (مثلاً طلاقِ بدعت سمیت)۔

(iv) چیئرمین یونین کونسل کو نوٹس نہ بھیجا جائے تو اگرچہ شوہر کو دفعہ 7(2) کے تحت سزائی کارروائی کا سامنا ہوسکتا ہے، تاہم یہ خود بخود طلاق کے رجوع کے مترادف نہیں۔ نوٹس نہ دینا طلاق کو ’’غیر مؤثر‘‘ بناتا ہے، ’’باطل‘‘ نہیں۔

(v) اسلامی قانون کے تحت دی گئی غیر مطلع شدہ (Unnotified) طلاق کو صرف مقدماتِ زنا میں محدود حد تک تسلیم کیا گیا ہے، جیسا کہ شریعت اپیلیٹ بینچ نے قرار دیا۔ تاہم یہ اصول 376 تعزیراتِ پاکستان (ریپ) پر ہرگز لاگو نہیں ہوتا۔

(vi) چیئرمین یونین کونسل پر لازم ہے کہ دفعہ 7(1) کے تحت نوٹس ملنے کے بعد مصالحاتی کونسل (Arbitration Council) تشکیل دے اور صلح کی کوشش کرے۔ فریقین کے پیش نہ ہونے یا کونسل کے فعال نہ ہونے سے دفعہ 7(3) کے خودکار نفاذ پر کوئی اثر نہیں پڑتا۔
چیئرمین کو طلاق کی درستگی یا اثر پذیری پر کوئی عدالتی اختیار حاصل نہیں اور اُس کا ’’سرٹیفکیٹ‘‘ جاری ہو یا نہ ہو، طلاق کے مؤثر ہونے پر قانونی اثر نہیں ڈالتی۔

(vii) مبارات کے ذریعے طلاق ایک بار درست طور پر طے ہو جائے اور چیئرمین تک پہنچا دی جائے تو ناقابلِ رجوع ہوتی ہے اور شوہر کو یہ ہرگز اختیار نہیں رہتا کہ وہ اسے یکطرفہ طور پر واپس لے لے۔ دفعہ 7(1) کے تحت نوٹس کی شرط یہاں بھی بطور طریقہ کار لاگو ہوتی ہے، مگر یہ فقط طریقہ کار کی تکمیل کے لیے ہے—اس کا مبارات کی درستگی یا قطعیت پر کوئی اثر نہیں۔

گناہ، جرم اور خلاف ورزی (Offence) کا قانونی فرق
قانون گناہ، جرم اور ’’اوفس‘‘ میں واضح فرق رکھتا ہے:

گناہ ایک اخلاقی یا مذہبی خطا ہے، جس کا تعلق انسان کے ضمیر، مذہب اور خدا کے احکام سے ہے۔ اس کے نتائج روحانی یا اخلاقی ہوتے ہیں۔

جرم (Crime) پاکستانی قانون کے مطابق ایسا فعل یا ترکِ فعل ہے جسے سزا کے قابل قرار دیا گیا ہو۔ یہ ایک سماجی غلط (public wrong) ہے اور سزائیں عدالتیں دیتی ہیں۔

Offence (خلافِ قانون فعل) ایک تکنیکی اصطلاح ہے جو ہر اُس عمل پر محیط ہے جو قانون کی خلاف ورزی کرے— خواہ وہ چھوٹی خلاف ورزی ہو (جیسے ٹریفک خالف ورزی) یا سنگین جرم ہو (جیسے قتل)۔
اس لیے ہر جرم ایک Offence تو ہے، مگر ہر Offence ’’جرم‘‘ کے درجے کا نہیں ہوتا۔

شریعت میں جرم وہ فعل ہے جو شرعی حکم کے خلاف ہو اور جس پر حد یا تعزیری سزا مقرر ہو۔

موجودہ مقدمہ
موجودہ معاملے میں درخواست گزار اور مدعا علیہہ نمبر 5 کے درمیان نکاح بوقتِ وقوعہ قانوناً برقرار تھا۔
اگرچہ درخواست گزار کا رویہ مذہبی یا سماجی معیار کے مطابق نامناسب ہوسکتا ہے، لیکن FIR میں بیان کردہ واقعات کے مطابق دفعہ 376 تعزیراتِ پاکستان (ریپ) کا بنیادی ڈھانچہ (ingredients) پورا نہیں ہوتا، لہذا اس کے تحت کارروائی نہیں کی جا سکتی۔

[12/14/25, 8:26:01 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The conversion of land devoted to a public or religious purpose into commercial use amounts to an infringement of the petitioners’ proprietary and possessory rights and a breach of the public interest in preserving land dedicated for communal use. Such conversion is contrary to the express terms of the allotment and is therefore unlawful. The superior Courts have consistently held that lands allotted for a specified public purpose must not be diverted to other uses absent clear lawful authority, and that any action which effects such diversion must be closely scrutinized and, if unlawful, set aside. 

Needless to say, where land dedicated for a religious or public purpose carries with it the character of a “purpose trust” in the constitutional and equitable sense, wherein the beneficiary is not an individual but the community at large. Such dedication imposes inherent limitations on user, flowing from the doctrine that property impressed with a public purpose cannot be treated as private dominion nor subjected to commodification inconsistent with the original dedication. Any deviation, unless expressly permitted by competent authority and supported by cogent legal sanction, is ultra vires the trust purpose and void. Hence, the inquiry in such cases is not merely proprietary but structurally fiduciary, requiring heightened scrutiny to prevent erosion of community interests and to preserve the normative continuity of the public trust.  

A mosque, once established or dedicated and its appurtenant land acquires a perpetual and inalienable character. The Courts, therefore, must apply a stricter standard of review when allegations are made of commercial exploitation or deviation from its sacred purpose. The Constitution itself, through Articles 23 and 24, protects lawful ownership while simultaneously recognizing the State’s duty to safeguard public and religious institutions from encroachment and misuse. Consequently, any attempt to convert mosque-dedicated land into commercial premises, particularly without statutory sanction,constitutes not only a breach of allotment but an impairment of the religious trust and a violation of the fiduciary obligations attached to such property. Such acts cannot be regularized through equitable pleas, financial necessity, or administrative convenience.

From a public-policy perspective, allowing commercial structures to stand on land expressly reserved for a mosque would set a dangerous precedent, effectively inviting encroachment upon publicpurpose lands across the province. The law does not countenance a situation where administrative silence, lapse of time, or private initiative is used to justify a use that is fundamentally ultra vires the original grant. Any such tolerance would undermine the integrity of governmental allotments and compromise the orderly management of public assets. The Courts are, therefore, mandated to intervene where public-purpose property is subjected to unauthorized transformation, for failure to do so would erode the rule of law and encourage private individuals to unilaterally redefine the contours of public property.

The validity of a pre-emption decree is not affected by any sale made during litigation and is binding on the purchaser. The only exception to the doctrine of lis pendens applicable to pre‑emption claims is in one situation, where the sale by the vendee is to one who has a superior right of pre‑emption provided that the sale is within the period of limitation when such right can be exercised.

[12/14/25, 8:26:08 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: It is well-settled that in cases involving private enmity or individual disputes, the possibility of exaggerated charges or false implication of more family members of accused cannot be ruled out and, in such circumstances, the principle of caution applies with full force. However, the present case does not fall within said category. It is a case of robbery, wherein both the petitioners operated in preconcert with a premeditated plan, each playing a distinct and purposeful role in furtherance of the common design and intention. In offences of this nature, where a gang operates collectively, the law does not require that each participant must personally inflict a fatal injury to be held accountable. It is sufficient that the act was committed in furtherance of a common intention and that the accused participated with knowledge and shared purpose. The doctrine of constructive or vicarious liability, as encapsulated under Section 34 PPG, clearly stipulates that when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of them is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.

[12/14/25, 8:26:10 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Article 91 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (‘Order of 1984’) provides that whenever any document is produced before any court, inter alia, given by a witness in a judicial proceedings or before any officer authorized by law to take such evidence or to be a statement of confession by any person or an accused person, taken in accordance with law, and purporting to be signed by any Judge or Magistrate, the court shall presume that the document is genuine and that any such statement as to the circumstances under which it was taken purporting to be made by the person signing it are true and that such evidence, statement or confession was duly taken. This presumption is essentially qualified by the expression 'taken in accordance with law'. It is noted that under Article 38 of the Order of 1984 no statement which is made to or before a police officer is admissible even if it is made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate. Likewise, a confession of an accused while in custody is also inadmissible except when it is made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate or if there is a disclosure of fact as contemplated under Article 40 of the Order of 1984. Section 164 of the Cr. P.C. sets out the mandatory conditions relating to recording a judicial confession in the course of investigation conducted under chapter XIV ibid. Section 364 prescribes the manner in which the judicial confession is to be recorded under section 164 ibid. The safeguards are provided under Chapter 13 of the High Court Rules and Orders (Vol.III) (‘Rules and Orders’). A statement will be considered as having taken in accordance with law when the mandatory conditions and manner of recording prescribed under the law have been met and the minimum safeguards required to be observed have been ensured. It is noted that the safeguards set out under the Rules and Orders are not exhaustive and it would be an onerous task of a court to satisfy itself having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, that the confession is genuinely voluntary and true. The conditions, manner of recording of a confession and the safeguards are, therefore, discussed as follows; 

The mandatory conditions have been prescribed under section 164 of Cr.P.C;  

 (i) The conditions under section 164 of Cr.P.C have been prescribed in relation to a 'statement' as well as a 'confession'. 

(ii) The timing for recording a judicial confession under section 164 has been specified therein as in the course of an investigation which is being conducted under chapter XIV of the Cr. P.C. or at any time afterwards before the commencement of the inquiry or trial.  

(iii) The statement or confession can be recorded under section 164 only by a competent authority i.e any Magistrate of the 1st Class and any Magistrate of the 2nd Class specially empowered in this behalf by the provincial government to record statements or confessions as the case may be but a police officer is not competent to record any statement or confession even if the latter is empowered to exercise the powers of a Magistrate.  

(iv) A statement, other than a confession may be recorded by a competent Magistrate in the presence of the accused and that the latter shall be given an opportunity of cross-examination of the witnesses who are making the statement. A statement shall be recorded in such manner as in the opinion of the Magistrate is best fitted for the circumstances of the case while the confessions have to be recorded and signed in the manner provided under section 364 of the Cr. P.C. After recording of a confession, it has to be forwarded to the Magistrate by whom the case is to be inquired into or tried.  

(v) A Magistrate before recording any confession shall explain to the person making it that he is not bound to make a confession and that if he does so it may be used as evidence against him. 

(vi)  No Magistrate shall record any confession unless upon questioning the person making it. The latter has reason to believe that it was made voluntarily. 

(vii) When a Magistrate has reasons to believe that the statement was made voluntarily then he or she is required to make a memorandum at the foot of such record to the effect as has explicitly been given in sub section 3 of section 164 of the Cr.P.C.  

(viii) It is not necessary that the Magistrate recording a confession under section 164 should be a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case. 

The manner of recording a judicial confession under section164 has been prescribed under section 364 of the Cr. P.C. as follows:

(i) After the accused has been examined by any Magistrate or by any court other than a High Court then the whole of such examination including every question put to the accused and every answer given by him shall be recorded in full. 

 (ii) The examination including every question and every answer given by an accused must be recorded in the language in which the latter has been examined or if that is not practicable in the language of the court or in English.

 (iii) The record i.e. the whole of examination and every question put to him as well as every answer given by the accused shall be shown to have been read over to him or her or if the latter does not understand the language in which it is written then it shall be interpreted to the accused in a language which he understands and he shall be at liberty to explain or add to his answer. When the whole is made conformable to what an accused has declared to be true then the record shall be signed by the accused and the Magistrate or the Judge of such court and such Magistrate or Judge shall certify under his or her own hand that the examination was taken in his/her presence and that the record contains a full and true account of the statement made by the accused.

 (iv) Cases in which the examination of the accused is not recorded by the Magistrate or Judge himself, then such a Magistrate or Judge shall be bound as the examination proceeds to make a memorandum thereof in the language of the court or in English, if acquainted with such language and such memorandum shall be written and signed by the Magistrate or Judge with his own hand and shall be annexed with the record. 

 (v) If the Magistrate or Judge is unable to make the abovementioned memorandum then the latter shall record the reasons of such inability. 


The safeguards required to be observed while recording a confession have been set out in Rules and Orders as follows: 

(i) Unless there are exceptional reasons to the contrary, confessions are required to be made in open court and during the court hours in the absence of police officers investigating the case.  

(ii) An accused person who has made a confession under section 164 before a Magistrate can only be sent to the judicial lockup and cannot be handed over to the police after the confession has been recorded.

(iii)  If the police requires an accused person for investigation at some subsequent stage after confession has been recorded, a written application should be made giving reasons in detail why the accused is required. 

(iv)  If an accused has declined to make a confession or has made a statement which is unsatisfactory from the point of view of the prosecution then he shall not be remanded to police custody.

 (v) When an accused after recording his confessional statement is remanded to the lockup then the Magistrate shall record an order for him to be kept separate from other prisoners as far as may be practicable. 

(vi) Before recording the confession, the Magistrate must arrange, so far as is compatible with the safety and that of the staff and with the safe custody of accused, that the latter is left for some time i.e. for half an hour, out of the hearing of police officers or other persons likely to influence him/her.

 (vii) The Magistrate who records the confession under section 164 of Cr.P.C., should not hand over the document after completion to the police officer In charge of the accused, but should forward it direct to the Magistrate by whom the case is to be enquired into or tried.  

(viii) However, there is no prohibition for a Magistrate who has recorded a statement to allow the concerned police officials from obtaining a copy before the recorded confession has been forwarded to the trial Magistrate. When permission is granted the police officer, may be given the copy in the manner set out in clause (c) of rule 13 of the Rules and Orders.  
 
The safeguards set out in the Rules and Orders are not exhaustive. We have been informed that the High Court of Sindh has not prescribed safeguards and that it follows the principles and law developed in the precedents of this Court in the light of the Rules and Orders. However, it is noted that the object of the safeguards is to enable and facilitate a court to ensure that enabling conditions and circumstances are created so that an accused may exercise the option to genuinely confess voluntarily and out of free will. As already noted, these safeguards are not exhaustive and the competent Magistrate may also adopt such other safeguards so as to ensure that the circumstances are conducive and appropriate for an accused to genuinely confess voluntarily and out of free will. The precedent law has also enunciated the principles and safeguards required to be observed relating to a confession.  

It has been the consistent view of this Court that a judicial confession can be made the basis for a conviction when it is found to be true, convincing and made voluntarily without any duress, coercion, inducement or any other influence of whatever nature. Even a retracted confession recorded in accordance with law would be presumed to be genuine as has been contemplated under Article 91 of the Order of 19846. Retraction of a judicial confession is not a sufficient ground for discarding it if it is otherwise found to be reliable. Mere retraction would not diminish its evidentiary value if it has been corroborated by other evidence. There is no absolute rule that retracted judicial confessions cannot be acted upon unless the same are corroborated. However, the rule of prudence requires that, by way of caution, corroboration must be sought. It is not essential that each and every circumstance mentioned in the confessional statement regarding complicity must be separately and independently corroborated nor that the corroboration must come from facts and circumstances discovered after the confession was made.  The judicial confession, even when retracted, does not lose its evidentiary value if it is independently corroborated and the court is satisfied that the narration is true and has been made voluntarily. The fundamental principle is that the evidentiary value of the statement rests on the voluntariness of the confession. There must not be any sign of fear inculcated by the investigating agency in the mind of the accused and any such fear or apprehension must have been removed by assuring the accused that, even if he confesses his guilt, he shall not be handed over to the police authorities. It is the court’s responsibility to take all precautionary measures to ensure that the confession is made voluntarily and without any influence of any kind. In case the confession is a result of inducement, threat or promise or influence of any other kind, whether direct or indirect, given by a person in authority, then it shall not be treated as having been given voluntarily. A confession recorded may be true but it would not be admissible if it has not been given voluntarily. Whether or not a statement is true and has been made voluntarily is a question of fact and it is to be determined keeping in view the attending circumstances of each case. Delay in recording of a judicial confessional statement may also have an adverse effect on the mind of an accused and it could be one of the factors which a court may take into consideration while assessing whether it was a voluntary confession or made under some influence. However, delay in recording the judicial confession by itself is not fatal. The longer an accused remains in the custody of the police before making a judicial confession the more care and scrutiny is required to be exercised by a court, because such delay in facts and circumstances of a case may prejudice its evidentiary value. Recording of a judicial confession with promptitude reflects the probability of its voluntariness though it may be retracted. Though delay in recording a judicial confession by itself is not sufficient to affect its validity but no hard and fast rule can be laid down regarding its timing. A voluntary and true recorded confession, though, does no require corroboration and it may also be sufficient for conviction but, as a rule of procedure and prudence, the court requires to seek corroboration in material particulars. A court has to exercise extra caution while recording a confessional statement in case of vulnerable classes such as juveniles. It is desirable, in their case, to provide them counseling/consultation, inter alia, of a natural guardian. A confessional statement has to be read as a whole and its inculpatory parts cannot be relied upon while discarding the exculpatory portions. The confessional statement must be accepted and rejected as a whole. The handcuffs must have been removed before an accused has been brought before a Magistrate for recording his confessional statement. The failure to mention this fact by a Magistrate in his report or his deposition would raise doubts regarding the reliability of a confessional statement because its having been made voluntarily would become questionable. A lapse on the part of a Magistrate in recording the confessional statement may not always be treated as fatal to the evidentiary value of a confession, provided the court is satisfied that the lapse had in no way adversely affected the voluntariness and truthfulness of the confession. The prosecution has to prove its case against an accused beyond a reasonable doubt irrespective of any plea raised by an accused in his defense and the prosecution cannot fall back on the plea of an accused to prove his or her case. If the prosecution fails in proving its case the accused has to be acquitted. The stage to consider the plea of the accused precedes proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. When the prosecution’s story has been rejected by the court and the confessional statement is the only material on which an accused has to be convicted then the same has to be either accepted as a whole or rejected as a whole. It is not open for a court to accept only part of it and reject the rest. Article 37 of the Order of 1984 explicitly provides that the confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding if the making of the confession appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise, having reference to the charge against the accused person and which proceeds from a person in authority and is sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he/she would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him. The confession, therefore, whether judicial or extra judicial, must be demonstrably voluntary, made out of absolute free will and without influence of any kind, whether a threat, inducement, promise or even hope etc. The fundamental principle regarding the admissibility and assessment of a confession, judicial or extra judicial, is that it ought to be genuinely voluntary and must have been made out of one's free will. It must have been given freely and without any coercion or influence in any form. The court must be mindful of the fact that, ordinarily, no person would confess to the commission of a crime because of its consequences and the possibility that the profound effects of being in custody and exposed to the physical and psychological distress and trauma associated with investigation and custody a person's rational thinking generally gets impaired. It cannot be ruled out that an innocent person may confess so as to free himself from the extremely distressful conditions. However, in exceptional and rare cases, it cannot be ruled out that an accused may voluntarily confess his or guilt because of genuine remorse or regret. It becomes an even more onerous task of the court when the circumstances are such that there is a likelihood of the accused being exposed to the influence of a person in authority, such as being in the custody of a police officer and confined in the lock up of a police station.

[12/14/25, 8:26:11 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Before we close this judgment, we feel constrained to record our observations regarding the widespread phenomenon of refusal or considerable delay in the registration of FIRs i.e entry of the substance of information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence in the prescribed register as mandated under section 154 of the Cr.P.C. This phenomenon has been observed invariably in most of the cases which emanate from the Province of Sindh. This case is only a tip of the iceberg and it reflects adversely on the status of the criminal justice system. Registration of FIRs and the ensuing investigations till filing of the respective reports under section 173 of the Cr. P.C is exclusively an executive function and one of the most crucial and fundamental components of the criminal justice system. As we have already held that it is a statutory duty of an officer of a police station to register a case i.e FIR as soon as the information has been received. The officer in charge of a police station has no authority to refuse or delay its registration as mandated under section 154 of the Cr.P.C. Delay without a convincing reason gravely affects the rights of the parties, the victim and the accused as well. It gives an opportunity to manage and manipulate the evidence and to falsely implicate innocent persons. The police force and the police stations have been established to serve the people, who are the real stakeholders. The officer in charge of a police station has an onerous duty to protect the citizens and their rights and to prevent crimes within his or her area of jurisdiction. We had put the Inspector General of Police, Province of Sindh and the Prosecutor General, Sindh to notice so as to explain why the mandatory provisions of the Cr.P.C and other enabling laws are being flagrantly violated. The Inspector General of Police along with the Acting Prosecutor General had appeared and they had explained in detail the reasons for existence of such a phenomenon and the measures taken to put a stop to it. A written report dated 02.06.2025 was also received while the reasons were being recorded. It appears from the reasons stated by the Inspector General of Police, Government of Sindh that this phenomenon is widespread. We record our appreciation for the candid acknowledgement and the explanation of the Inspector General of Police regarding the measures being taken to put an end to this illegal conduct. However, the reasons explained for the existence of such widespread violation of the statutory duty of an officer in charge of a police station are neither tenable nor expected from a uniformed police force entrusted with the responsibility of upholding the law, maintaining public order, prevention and control of crime, protecting the citizens from harm and, above all, safe guarding their rights and freedoms. The reasons stated, such as deep-rooted cultural practices, preference of the complainants, attempts of reconciliation and dispute resolution prior to the registration of FIRs, religious beliefs or medical priorities are alien to the mandate of the Cr.P.C and inconceivable in a society governed under a Constitution which guarantees to every citizen their rights, liberty and freedoms. These reasons may be justified in a society governed under tribal and archaic traditions but not when the governance is under a Constitution which assures and guarantees to every citizen protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law as an inalienable right. Acknowledgement of such reasons would be perceived as capture of the police force and the criminal justice system by those who wield power and influence, rather the system being subservient to the rule of law.  Every officer in charge of a police station is bound to strictly perform functions and duties mandated under the provisions of the Cr.P.C. He or she has no authority to disobey or ignore the law. The foundation of the edifice of the criminal justice system is built on the prevention and investigation of a crime whether reported to or whether the information is otherwise received by an officer in charge of a police station. The latter has no excuse nor authority to refuse or delay the registration of a case, i.e FIR under section 154 of the Cr.P.C if it relates to the commission of a cognizable offence. The officer in charge of a police station cannot sit back and wait for a complainant to file a formal complaint. This would be a serious dereliction of a statutory duty and negation of the statutory authority vested under the Cr.P.C. The phenomenon of refusal to or delay in registration of a criminal case under section 154 has been invariably observed in cases affecting the rights of the most vulnerable, marginalized or underprivileged classes of the society. The phenomenon is seen to be an abuse of powers to the advantage or in favor of the powerful and privileged. The inadvertent or deliberate refusal on part of an officer in charge of a police station to fulfill the statutory duty mandated under section 154 of the Cr.P.C erodes the confidence of the people in the criminal justice system. They would be justified in perceiving the police force to be serving the interests of the powerful and privileged rather than the actual stakeholders; the people. These are characteristics of a police state and not a State meant to be governed under the Constitution. When the police authorities disregard their duties and functions mandated under the provisions of the Cr.P.C they are then perceived as being used by the powerful and privileged to maintain a repressive social and political control over the people. This perception manifests that the Constitution is being gravely violated. We therefore, expect that the Inspector Generals of Police of all the provinces will take effective steps in order to ensure that there is no refusal or delay in the registration of cases under section 154 of the Cr.P.C if the information relates to the commission of a cognizable offence. We also expect the Prosecutor Generals of the respective Governments to advise the police authorities and frame standard operating procedures in accordance with the mandate of the Cr.P.C. The onus is on the respective Governments to demonstrably establish, through the conduct of each officer in charge of a police station within their jurisdiction, that the statutory duties and obligations mandated under the provisions of the Cr.P.C are being strictly followed and respected. It is an onerous duty of each government to ensure that the police force established under its control exists solely to serve the people, rather than to maintain a repressive social and political control over them. The trust of the people in the impartiality, fairness and independence of the criminal justice system, particularly in the police force established to serve them, is the sole test to determine whether they are being governed in accordance with the Constitution or the norms that characterize a police state.  

The office of this Court is directed to send copies of this judgment to the Inspector Generals and Prosecutor Generals of the Provinces and the Federal Islamabad Capital Territory for consideration of the above observations.

The dissection of the PEEDA, particularly its section 13, let out that the legislation does not promote a culture of despotic use of authority within disciplinary proceedings. Rather in its preference, it seeks to strike a balance between the imperative of safeguarding employee rights and the necessity of maintaining an efficient disciplinary framework within the service. This objective has been sought to be achieved by instituting a system of accountability rooted in the principles of fairness, sound reasoning, and justifiable decision-making. In the pursuit of this objective, in the first instance, the recommendations put forth by the inquiry officer or the inquiry committee, as delineated in section 10 of the PEEDA, are not made binding on the Competent Authority so as to allow it the discretion to arrive at its own conclusions regarding the charges presented. It is not in the nature of an appeal from the Inquiry Officer to the Competent Authority. It is one and the same proceeding and stands concluded with the decision of the Competent Authority. Nevertheless, taking into account the principle of natural justice and fundamental right of fair trial, it is significant to emphasise that the Competent Authority is not bestowed with unbridled discretion to arrive at decisions that contradict the conclusions drawn by the Inquiry Officer. Instead, promoting a culture of justification and reasoning, the Competent Authority, upon receiving the inquiry report, is mandated to first examine the report along with all pertinent case materials meticulously and then render a decision supported by valid and justifiable reasons, specifically addressing two critical questions: First, has the inquiry been conducted in compliance with the stipulations framed in the PEEDA? Second, if the first question is affirmed, have the charges against the accused been proved? We think it unnecessary to refer by name or to quote from any of the often-cited authorities in which the courts have explained why it is essential to furnish reasons for a decision to be intuitive. They are far too well-known. From them, we derive that: Firstly, furnishing reasons allows the employee to find out whether any reviewable errors have occurred during the proceedings. Secondly, it enables the employee to gauge the extent to which his arguments presented to the Inquiry Officer and included in the inquiry report were comprehended and considered. Thirdly, the possibility of judicial review serves as a deterrent against arbitrary decision-making by the Competent Authority. Fourthly, the discipline of rendering reasoned decisions encourages the Competent Authority to be more meticulous and rational in its conclusions. Finally, providing reasons enhances guidance for analogous future cases and promotes consistency in decision-making. Apart from that,to further enhance fairness in the disciplinary proceedings, in a situation where the Competent Authority is poised to differ with the inquiry report, it is also compulsory for the Competent Authority to communicate to the accused, under section 13(4)(a) of the PEEDA, the rationale behind its disagreement with the inquiry officer’s findings of “not guilty”, and that a charge has been proved against him, and then require him to offer his response or additional defence thereon in writing. This obligation empowers the delinquent employee to contest the reasons offered by the Competent Authority, ensures that his rights are preserved and that final decisions are not made without due consideration. This leads us to conclude that the law envisages that every step undertaken in disciplinary proceedings must align with the foundational principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, and any deviation from these principles risks undermining the validity of the final order, thereby calling into question the integrity and legitimacy of the entire disciplinary process.

The question arises as to whether the delayed registration of the crime report entailed any consequences. Also, what was the status of the investigation carried out prior to registration of the case under section 154 of the Cr.P.C? 

We will, therefore, examine the scheme of the Cr.P.C to answer these questions. 

 'First Information Report' is not an expression used or defined in the Cr.P.C. It refers to information received by an officer In charge of police station under section 154 or section 155 of the Cr.P.C, as the case may be. The legislature, in both these provisions, has used the expression 'shall' in the context of the obligation to enter the substance of the information in the relevant book(naeem) to be kept by an officer In charge of a police station in the prescribed form. The former provision relates to a cognizable offence while the latter to a non-cognizable one. The expressions 'cognizable' and 'non cognizable' are defined under sections 2(f) and 2(n) respectively. In case of a cognizable offence, section 156 empowers any police officer In charge of a police station to investigate without the order of a Magistrate while section 155 places a clog on the power of the police officer, who cannot investigate without a specific order of a Magistrate competent in this regard and as has been mandated under section 155(2). However, the legislature has used the expression 'shall' in both these sections, making it a mandatory statutory obligation of the In charge of a Police Station to enter the information in the relevant prescribed book or, in other words, to register the FIR. If the information relates to the commission of a cognizable offence given orally or in writing then the In charge of the police station has no option except to enter it in the book prescribed for this purpose. In case of a non-cognizable offence, it is a statutory duty to enter the information in the relevant prescribed book but investigation cannot be commenced or carried out without obtaining a specific order from a Magistrate competent in this regard. In case of a cognizable offence the powers of an In charge of a police station to investigate are also not unfettered, rather they have been circumscribed under section 157 (naeem)of the Cr.P.C. Before embarking on the course of investigation, the In charge of a police station must, on the basis of the information received or otherwise, have 'reason to suspect' the commission of an offence which he is empowered under section 156 to investigate. In such an eventuality it is a statutory duty of the latter to forthwith report to the competent Magistrate and then proceed. Proviso (b) of sub-section 1 of section 157 provides that if it appears to the officer In charge of a police station that there is no sufficient ground for embarking on an investigation then he may decide not to investigate the case. In such an event the officer in charge of the police station shall state in his report to the Magistrate the reasons for his decision and forthwith notify the informant that he will not investigate the case or cause it to be investigated. This Court, in Sughran Bibi’s case (PLD 2018 SC 595), while interpreting section 154 of the Cr.P.C, has eloquently explained that the section refers to 'cognizable cases' meaning, thereby, that after entering the first information relating to a cognizable offence in the prescribed book i.e after registration of the FIR, the matter becomes a 'case'. The FIR is no more than an incident report which merely informs the police for the first time about the occurrence regarding a cognizable offence. After registration of the FIR the occurrence is treated as a case and it enables the police officer to initiate the process of investigation under sections 156,157, and 159 of Cr.P.C. This Court has held that the investigating officer is not to be guided nor is he or she controlled in this regard by the contents of the FIR. The contents of an information under section 154 are not sacrosanct. The investigation, after registration of the case, cannot be embarked upon in a mechanical manner and the investigating officer is bound to observe the provisions of the Cr.P.C. It was in this background that this Court has held that it was misconceived that arresting an accused was necessary or sine qua non for investigating a crime merely because of registration of a case. It was held in Sughran Bibi’s case (supra) that, ordinarily, no person is to be arrested straightaway only because he or she has been nominated as an accused person in the FIR or in any other version of the incident brought to the notice of the investigation officer. The investigating officer can exercise the power to arrest a person if satisfied that sufficient justification exists for the arrest and for such justification the investigation officer must be guided by the provisions of the Cr.P.C. A suspect is not to be arrested straightway or as a matter of course unless sufficient material or evidence becomes available on the record which, prima facie, satisfies the investigating officer regarding the correctness of the allegations. The purpose of the above discussion was to highlight that registration of the FIR is a mandatory statutory duty of an officer in charge of a police station and it cannot adversely affect the rights of the parties involved in the criminal proceedings, provided the ensuing investigation is carried out in accordance with the mandate and procedures contemplated under the Cr,P.C. The safeguards provided under the Cr.P.C are meant to ensure that the right to liberty, even of an accused, is not (naeem)prejudiced unjustifiably. The edifice of the criminal justice system rests on the fairness of the investigation and, obviously, the integrity and professionalism of the investigating officer. The registration of an FIR as soon as the information has been received relating to the commission of a cognizable offence is necessary for preserving the evidence and to rule out the possibility of making up a story after deliberations and consultations. This Court has consistently held that an officer In charge of a police station has no authority, nor does such authority vest with any other person, to refuse to register an information under section 154 when it discloses the commission of a cognizable offence. Moreover, the officer In charge of a police station nor any other     person is vested with the authority to embark upon an inquiry regarding the correctness or otherwise of the information which has been given for the purposes of registration of a case under section 154 of the Cr.P.C. It has been further held that any investigation or inquiry in the nature of finding the correctness or otherwise of the information prior to registration of the FIR will be hit by the provisions of section 162 of the Cr. P.C.. The expression 'investigation' has been defined under section 2(l) of the Cr.P.C and it includes all the proceedings under the Code for collection of evidence conducted by a police officer, or by any person other than a Magistrate, who is authorized by a Magistrate in this behalf. Likewise, 'inquiry' is defined under section (naeem)2(k) and it includes every inquiry conducted under the Code by a Magistrate or a court. This distinction is important so as to appreciate that under the scheme of the Cr.P.C conducting an inquiry falls within the domain of a Magistrate or a court while investigation of a crime is the exclusive duty and obligation of an authorized officer. The registration of an FIR is the first step for setting in motion the criminal proceedings. It is not the concern of the officer in charge of a police station whether the information is true or false. The latter cannot assume the role of an adjudicator or assume the role of a Magistrate or a court to embark upon an inquiry in order to ascertain the falsity, truth or credibility of the information before it is entered in the prescribed book kept under section 154 of the Cr.P.C. Though there are some exceptions explicitly mentioned in the Cr.P.C when steps which are part of the process of investigation could be taken before a case is registered under section 154 of the Cr.P.C e.g under sections 54, 55, 57 or 151 ibid. It is noted that, even in such an eventuality, sections 60 and 61 make it a mandatory duty of the concerned police officer to take the arrested person before or to inform the Magistrate. These provisions or exceptions have been placed by the legislature before section 154. The registration of a case under section 154 relating to information of the commission of a cognizable offence is a statutory duty of an officer In Charge of a police station and it cannot be delayed for any reason if the information discloses commission of a cognizable offence. Registration of a case under section 154 is an executive function and the officer In Charge of a police station has no authority or jurisdiction to delay the registration of the case by embarking upon an inquiry to first ascertain its truth, falsity or credibility nor is such information sacrosanct and binding to be followed by the investigating officer. The latter has a statutory duty to carry out an (naeem)investigation after a case has been registered under section 154 of the Cr.P.C, except in those eventualities which have been explicitly provided ibid. In case the information is ultimately established to be false then it would attract the offence and its prescribed punishment under section 182 of the PPC. It is noted, however, that if the information does not disclose a cognizable offence or is so vague or indefinite that the officer in charge of a police station requires to satisfy himself or herself whether it relates to the commission of a cognizable offence then the delay, if any, also has to be justified by the officer In Charge of a police station. Nonetheless, the onus will always be on the officer In Charge of the police station to justify the delay, if any. 

It is obvious from the above discussed provisions of the Cr.P.C that the registration of a case under section 154 of the Cr.P.C cannot be refused nor delayed when the information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence has been given to or received by the officer In Charge of a police station. The registration of the case is the first step to put the criminal proceedings in motion and to enable the officer In Charge of a police station to embark upon the course of investigation strictly in accordance with the mandate set out in the Cr.P.C. The(naeem) registration of the case, i.e the FIR itself, is not a substantive piece of evidence unless its contents are affirmed on oath by its maker while entering the witness box and being subjected to cross examination. In terms of Articles 140 and 153 of the Order of 1984 it is no more than a previous statement which may be used for confronting its maker unless the same has been proved by the prosecution. Since it is not a substantive piece of evidence, therefore, it cannot be used to corroborate the evidence of a witness. The non mentioning of the name of a witness in the FIR is not a fatal omission and it would not be a sufficient reason to discard the testimony in every case. The evidentiary value of a testimony depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. The registration of a case, i.e the FIR without delay has significance for both the complainant as well as an accused. A bona fide and truthful complainant would definitely want the process of investigation to commence at the earliest. The delay in registration of a case raises the probability of false implication of an accused or an opportunity to manipulate and manage the evidence by bringing it in line with the prosecution's story e.g with the findings of the autopsy etc. The delay gives an opportunity of prior consultation and deliberations and, therefore, the possibility of false implication and manipulation cannot be ruled out. The promptness eliminates the chances of such prior consultation and deliberations and raises a presumption of credibility and bona fides. It is further noted that entry of an information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence other than in the manner provided under section 154 of the Cr.P.C e.g in a daily diary, is not contemplated under the scheme of the Code. The scheme of the Cr.P.C contemplates an external check on abuse of powers by the police authorities. The external check has been ensured by way of requiring the officer In Charge of police station (naeem)to keep the competent Magistrate informed regarding each step taken from registration of the FIR till filing of the report under section 173. Every case registered under section 154 and the ensuing investigation ends up with filing a report under section 173 of the Cr.P.C. There is no doubt that a Magistrate or a court has no authority to interfere in the process of investigation nor to guide and direct the investigation officer how or in what manner to investigate a case. The supervision of a Magistrate at each stage, from registration of a case till filing of the report under section 173 is to ensure that powers vested in an officer of the police station or any other authorized person are not abused for mala fide and extraneous reasons nor that the liberty, freedoms and rights of an accused are violated in disregard to the scheme contemplated under the Cr.P.C. The entry of a cognizable offence in a Daily Diary, for instance, rather than the prescribed book kept for the purposes of section 154 of the Cr.P.C enables an officer In Charge of a police station to circumvent and disregard the mandatory provisions of the Cr.P.C by avoiding the external supervisory check of a competent Magistrate contemplated there under. It gives an opportunity to an officer In Charge of a police station to abuse the powers without any external Magisterial check expressly provided under the scheme of the Cr.P.C.

Indisputably the revisional court has limited jurisdiction under section 115 CPC which includes, (a) when trial court found to have exercised jurisdiction not vested in it by law, (b) failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or (c) to have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity. Nothing of such exercise (a to c) has been expressed by the revisional court. It is to be kept in mind that revisional court cannot be substituted as appellate court to replace its own findings when findings of Trial Court are neither arbitrary or perverse to enable the revisional court to exercise jurisdiction with the frame described above. All it found, in terms of paragraph 8 was that the restoration application was barred by time. A perusal of the paper-book reveals that the application for condonation of delay under section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 was available which escaped the attention of the revisional court. We are not in agreement with the reasoning assigned by the learned Additional District Judge, Kasur which was appreciated by the learned High Court through the impugned order that such grounds as disclosed in the restoration application could have been considered had it been filed within thirty days of order. Had the application been filed within thirty days, the condonation application was not required. Condonation application is filed when statutory period is lapsed. Such delay is then required to be explained in the condonation application which the petitioner did and the Trial Court was in consonance with the grounds mentioned therein when it accepted the applications both for restoration and condonation. Additionally, when a lawful jurisdiction was exercised by the Trial Court then the revisional court followed by High Court in writ jurisdiction cannot reverse it by expressing their own views over and above the lawful discretion exercised by the Trial Court unless found within frame of section 115 of the CPC.

Mere pendency of a petition before this Court does not, by itself, operate as a stay of proceedings, which may only be lawfully restrained by an express injunctive order of the Court. Thus, administrative inaction premised on the mere pendency of further proceedings, without any lawful restraint, is both unjustified and impermissible.

 It is particularly regrettable that despite the clear pronouncement of this Court in Rashid Baig’s case (supra)expressing disapproval of such misuse of procedural pendency, the same practice continues unabated. This reflects not merely individual lapses, but a persistent pattern of administrative disregard for binding remand orders, which in itself constitutes systemic failure requiring urgent redress. 

To address this matter, the Court required the personal attendance of the Senior Member, Board of Revenue, Punjab. He assured the Court that clear and comprehensive policy guidelines would be issued at the provincial level, directing all relevant authorities to implement remand orders promptly and without delay, unless expressly restrained by an injunctive order of a competent Court. He further undertook to ensure monitoring of compliance and to submit a report on the current status of all such pending remanded cases under his jurisdiction. Such measures are essential to uphold the foundations of lawful governance, and it must be reiterated that failure by the relevant authorities to observe established principles requiring prompt compliance with remand orders would frustrate the administration of justice and violate their constitutional duty.

[12/17/25, 11:37:04 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: By now, the law relating to the competence of the child witness to depose in a criminal case and its evidentiary value is well settled. It would, therefore, be relevant to discuss the precedent law in this regard. Article 3 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 contemplates that all persons are competent to testify unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them or from giving rational answers to those questions, by tender or extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind or any other cause of the same nature. For a child witness, normally the courts conduct "vior dire test" under which the court before examination puts certain preliminary questions to the child, which bear no connection with the case so as to judge the child's competency and understanding.  If the child is capable of answering those questions properly and deposes in a smart manner, then the child is considered as a competent witness. A child is fully competent to depose before a court of law subject to his/her capacity and intellect to understand what he/she deposes about. Whether a child is a competent witness or not and whether he/she passes the 'rationality test' is something which is to be decided by the court in accordance with Article 3 read with Article 17 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 after carrying out the “voir dire test”.

The term “Voir Dire” has been defined in various lexicons as under: According to Black's Law dictionary, voir dire connotes: 
"A preliminary examination to test the competence of a witness or evidence" 

According to Webster's Unabridged Dictionary: 
"An oath administered to a proposed witness or juror by which he or she is sworn to speak the truth in an examination to ascertain his or her competence." 

According to Advance Law Lexicon A rule requiring that a party must call the best evidence that the nature of case will allow.

According to Advance Law Lexicon A special form of oath administered to a witness whose competency to give evidence in the particular matter before the Court is in question, or who is to be examined as to some other collateral matter. 

Voir dire is an inquiry within a trial to decide relevant ancillary issues which are material for the just decision of that trial. 

A child witness is not barred from entering the witness box. It is the satisfaction of the trial Court, which is of crucial importance. A child who also happens to be a victim of an offence is competent to testify as a witness, and the deposition would be worthy of reliance provided the Court is satisfied that he or she, as the case may be, is intelligent and understands the significance of entering the witness box. A conviction can also be handed down placing reliance on the sole testimony of a child witness. 
Rape is crime which often occurs without witnesses, making direct evidence scarce. Courts can rely on the victim's testimony alone for conviction if it's credible and consistent with the facts of the case. A victim of rape  endures psychological and emotional trauma, placing her in a unique position compared to other witnesses as the incident and the preparator of crime remain etched in her memory, never to be forgotten.

In all criminal cases, normal discrepancies are bound to occur in the depositions of witnesses due to normal errors of observation, namely, errors of memory due to lapse of time or due to mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence. Where the omissions amount to a contradiction, creating serious doubt about the truthfulness of the witness and other witnesses also make material improvement while deposing in the court, such evidence cannot be safe to rely upon. However, minor contradictions, inconsistencies, embellishments or improvements on trivial matters which do not affect the core of the prosecution case, should not be made a ground on which the evidence can be rejected in its entirety. The court has to form its opinion about the credibility of the witness and record a finding as to whether his deposition inspires confidence. Exaggerations per se do not render the evidence brittle. But it can be one of the factors to test the credibility of the prosecution version when the entire evidence is put in a crucible for being tested on the touchstone of credibility. Therefore, mere marginal variations in the statements of a witness cannot be dubbed as improvements as the same may be elaborations of the statement made by the witness earlier. The omissions which amount to contradictions in material particulars i.e. go to the root of the case/materially affect the trial or core of the prosecution's case, render the testimony of the witness liable to be discredited but not otherwise. In the instant case, we find that the prosecution witness namely Mst. Amina Bibi (PW-2) has successfully evidenced her credibility, therefore, the learned trial court was quite justified to rely on her while finding the appellant guilty.

[12/17/25, 11:37:07 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: We have also noted that the alleged eye witnesses made no effort either to save the deceased or to apprehend the accused when they were three in number and could have easily restrained the accused. It is unnatural and unbelievable that the alleged eye witnesses namely did not even move a limb to protect their near and dear one. No person having ordinary prudence would believe that such closely related witnesses would remain watching the proceedings as mere spectators for as long as the occurrence continued without doing anything to rescue the deceased or to apprehend the assailant. It only proves that the deceased was at the mercy of the assailant and no one was there to save him. Such behaviour, on the part of the witnesses, runs counter to natural human conduct and behaviour. We thus trust the existence of this fact, by virtue of the Article 129 of the Qanun-eShahadat, 1984, that the conduct of the witnesses, as deposed by them, was opposed to the common course of natural events, human conduct and that the prosecution witnesses  were not present at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence and their presence was procured subsequently.

The failure of the prosecution to produce, the children of the deceased, who were admittedly the residents of the place of occurrence and the most natural witnesses, before the learned trial court, has convinced us that had they been produced before the learned trial court they would not have supported the prosecution's case.

A well-known dictum has been laid down by the apex Court of our country that a man may lie but a document will never lie.These documents also prove not only that the assailants were not identified at the time of the occurrence but also that the prosecution witnesses had not witnessed the incident at all.  
On a conceptual plain, Article 117 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 enshrines the foundational principle of our criminal justice system, whereby the accused is presumed to be innocent unless proved otherwise. Accordingly, the burden is placed on the prosecution to prove beyond doubt the guilt of the accused, which burden can never be shifted to the accused, unless the legislature by express terms commands otherwise. It is only when the prosecution is able to discharge the burden of proof by establishing the elements of the offence, which are sufficient to bring home the guilt of the accused then the burden is shifted upon the accused, inter alia, under Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, to produce evidence of facts, which are especially in his exclusive knowledge, and practically impossible for the prosecution to prove, to avoid conviction.

It has to be kept in mind that Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 comes into play only when the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused by producing sufficient evidence, except the facts referred to in Article 122 Qanun-eShahadat, 1984, leading to the inescapable conclusion that the offence was committed by the accused. Then, the burden is on the accused not to prove his innocence, but only to produce evidence enough to create doubts in the prosecution’s case. 

In a criminal case, the burden of proof is on the prosecution and article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 is certainly not intended to relieve it of that duty. On the contrary, it is designed to meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, for the prosecution to establish facts which are “especially” within the knowledge of the accused and which he could prove without difficulty or inconvenience. If the article were to be interpreted otherwise, it would lead to the very startling conclusion that in a murder case, the burden lies on the accused to prove that he did not commit the murder because who could know better than he whether he did or did not. Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 cannot be used to undermine the wellestablished rule of law that, save in a very exceptional class of cases, the burden is on the prosecution and never shifts. Throughout the web of the Law, one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the accused’s guilt subject to any statutory exception. No matter what the charge, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the accused is the law and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained. As discussed above, the prosecution witnesses  failed miserably to prove their presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence. In a case of this nature, the appellant namely Mst. Misbah Bibi daughter of Muhammad Mehboob (the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 384-J of 2023) could not have been convicted for the alleged murder merely because she happened to be the resident of the place of occurrence. 

An accused person cannot be convicted merely because she did not explain the circumstances in which the deceased had lost his life.

[12/17/25, 11:37:10 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The law makes it mandatory upon the learned trial court that whenever a charge is altered or added to by the Court after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed to recall or re summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness who may have been examined, and also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material. In this case no opportunity was provided by the learned trial court  to the appellant to recall or re summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness who had  been examined, and also to call any further witness.

The question of whether a trial is vitiated or not due to defects and errors made by the learned trial court while charging the accused depends upon the degree of the error and the accused must show that the alteration of the charge by the learned trial court has materially prejudiced him in his defence . When prejudice to the accused is alleged, it has to be shown that the accused had suffered some disability or detriment in relation to the safeguard given to him under the law. Such prejudice should also demonstrate that it has occasioned a failure of justice . The burden is upon the accused to prove that prejudice has been caused to him and such prejudice be implicit. From the above discussion, it follows that the appellate court has to examine all the incriminating material produced by the prosecution and see what  is the impact of the re-framing of the charge on the fate of the case.If it comes to the conclusion that the reframing of the charge has prejudiced the accused, it may remit the matter to the trial Court for retrial from the point where the irregularity occurred, that is, from the stage of reframing of the charge. Section 232 Cr.P.C. itself provides for such a situation and makes it mandatory for the Appellate Court to  direct a new trial to be had upon a charge framed . 

The noted maxim which connotes "an act of the court shall prejudice no man" is founded upon justice and good sense; and affords a safe and certain guide for the administration of law and justice. It is meant to promote and ensure that the ends of justice are met; it prescribes that no harm and injury to the rights and the interest of the litigants before the court shall be caused by the act or omission of the court. This rule of administration of justice is meant for the benefit of both sides of litigants before the court and it would be illogical to conceive that the rule would or should be applied for the advantage of one litigant to the prejudice and disadvantage of the other. It is the duty of the court to act as a neutral arbiter between the parties and to provide justice to them through strict adherence to the law and keeping in mind the facts of each case.

[12/17/25, 11:37:12 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Section 18 of The National Database and Registration Authority Ordinance, 2000, specifically provides reasons for cancelling impounding or confiscating the Computerized National Identity Cards (CNIC) .

A reading of the above provisions of law not only makes it clear that the word “blocking” has not been used with regard to the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) but also that the learned trial court had no authority under the law to direct such cancellation, impounding or confiscation of the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) of the petitioner. In this manner, the impugned order passed by the learned trial court suffers from a lack of jurisdiction. Furthermore, with regard to the part of the order whereby the learned trial court directed that the passport of the petitioner be also “blocked”, it is observed that again the word “block” has not been used in the Passports Act, 1974 as such and the words with regard to the passport which have been used are cancelling, impounding and confiscation. Furthermore, the conditions in which, the cancelling, impounding or confiscation of a passport can be ordered have been detailed in section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974, and the said provisions do not allow the learned trial court to order such cancellation, impounding or confiscation of a passport. 

The above provisions of the Passports Act, 1974 further make it clear that the impugned order was passed by the learned trial court without having jurisdiction in the matter. With regard to the blocking of the accounts of the petitioner established with various banking institutions, the learned trial court directed the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) to do the same however, National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) have made it clear that they are not invested with the said jurisdiction to direct the banking authorities to block any account established with them by any of their customers.

[12/17/25, 11:37:14 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: It is trite that man can tell a lie but documents do not. The report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore  is in direct contradiction to  the statements PW and PW-2 ,who both stated that the 150 sealed parcels said to contain samples drawn and separated from the recovered  “Charas”  were deposited in the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore on 22.02.2021. It has not been explained that in whose custody the 150 sealed parcels said to contain samples drawn and separated from the recovered  “Charas”  remained from 22.02.2021 to 22.08.2021. It has also not been explained that which prosecution witness deposited the 150 sealed parcels said to contain samples drawn and separated from the recovered  “Charas”  in the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore on 22.08.2021.This portion of the prosecution evidence proves that there are missing links in the chain relating to the taking into possession the case property from the place of occurrence and its submission to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, collection Centre Multan. We have queried the learned Special Prosecutor for A.N.F.  to clarify that what was the evidence available on the record to confirm that the sealed parcels of the samples separated and drawn of the recovered narcotic substance had indeed been transmitted and  kept in safe  custody at the police station and  then deposited in the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore  but, after going through the record of this case from cover to cover, he has remained unable to refute that there is no consistent evidence whatsoever available on the record in this respect that how the recovered narcotic substance was transmitted from the police station to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. The learned Special Prosecutor for A.N.F. is unable to deny that the prosecution evidence was contradictory and mutually destructive in this regard. In such a state of contradictory evidence available on the record, safe custody of the recovered substance or its samples is not discernable from the record of this case and, thus, we have found it to be extremely unsafe to uphold and maintain the appellant's conviction and sentence recorded by the learned trial Court. In the absence of such evidence, the prosecution, which must establish that the chain of custody was unbroken, unsuspicious, indubitable, safe and secure, has failed to do so. The break in the chain of custody and lapse in the control of possession of the recovered narcotic substance casts doubts on the safe custody and safe transmission of the article and impairs and vitiates the conclusiveness and reliability of the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, thus, rendering it incapable of sustaining conviction. To prove the safe custody of the recovered narcotic substance was pivotal for the prosecution, as the entire construct of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 and the Control of Narcotic Substances (Government Analysts) Rules, 2001 rested on the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore which in turn rested on the process of sampling and its safe and secure custody. It is impossible for us to determine safe and secure custody of the recovered narcotic substance. In the absence of this certainty, we cannot believe the case of the prosecution as it is. After perusal of the evidence on record, we find that the prosecution, in this case, has failed to establish the safe custody of the recovered narcotic substance. Irreconcilable obscurities have crept into the case of the prosecution which can be given the benefit of to the appellant only

[12/17/25, 11:37:16 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The stamp of injuries on the person of a witness may be proof of his presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence, however the same can never guarantee a truthful deposition. Injuries received by a witness during an incident do not warrant acceptance of his evidence without scrutiny. At the most, such traumas can be taken as an indication of his presence on the spot, but still his evidence is to be scrutinized on the benchmark of principles laid down for the appraisal of evidence. It is not a given that a witness who suffered injuries during the occurrence will depose nothing but the truth. Even otherwise, it is not the simple presence of a witness at the crime scene but his credibility, which makes him a reliable witness. It has been held by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan repeatedly that the facts that an injured witness narrates are not to be implicitly accepted rather, they are to be attested and appraised on the principles applied for the appreciation of evidence of any prosecution witness, regardless of him being injured or not.
The proposition of law in Criminal Administration of Justice, that a common set of witnesses can be used for recording acquittal and conviction against the accused persons who were charged for the commission of same offence, is now a settled proposition. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has repeatedly held that partial truth cannot be allowed and perjury is a serious crime. This view stems from the notion that once a witness is found to have lied about a material aspect of a case, it cannot then be safely assumed that the said witness will declare the truth about any other aspect of the case. I have noted that the view should be that "the testimony of one detected in a lie was wholly worthless and must of necessity be rejected." If a witness is not coming out with the whole truth, then his evidence is liable to be discarded as a whole, meaning thereby that his evidence cannot be used either for convicting accused or acquitting some of them facing trial in the same case. This proposition is enshrined in the maxim falsus in unofalsus in omnibus.

The absence of any light source has put the whole prosecution case in the dark. It was admitted by the witnesses themselves that it was a dark night and as the prosecution witnesses failed to prove the availability of any light source, their statements with regard to them identifying the assailants, including the appellant, cannot be relied upon. The failure of the prosecution witnesses to prove the presence of any light source at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence, has repercussions, entailing the failure of the prosecution's case.  

The law is quite settled by now that if the prosecution fails to prove its case against an accused person, then the accused person is to be acquitted, even if he had taken a plea and had thereby admitted killing the deceased.

[12/17/25, 11:37:22 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The complainant’s mobile device, on which the blasphemous material was allegedly observed, was neither forensically examined nor presented before the trial Court. The testimony of the inquiry officer confirms that the device was temporarily in custody but returned to the complainant without proper forensic analysis.

 The complainant had also supplied the alleged content in hardcopy form. In the absence of independent verification, this electronic evidence lacks probative value. 

The complainant’s prolonged silence for nearly three years, despite being a member of the relevant WhatsApp groups, coupled with his failure to produce the mobile device for forensic examination, constitutes a grave procedural lapse, directly attracting the mandate of Article 73-A of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. The statutory framework governing electronic evidence further reinforces this deficiency. Article 46-A requires proof that the relevant automated information system was functioning properly at the material time. Under Article 73 and its Explanation, screenshots or printouts can attain the status of primary evidence only when generated, transmitted, and preserved through verified security procedures. Article 78-A imposes the additional burden that where authorship or reliability of an electronic document is denied as in the present case the party relying on such material must affirmatively prove that requisite security protocols were applied. The prosecution has failed to satisfy any of these indispensable evidentiary conditions. 

The Court has considered procedural compliance under Sections 196 and 156-A Cr.P.C. No prior permission was obtained under Section 196 Cr.P.C. for taking cognizance under Section 295-A PPC and the defence objection in this regard is legally sustainable. However, investigation under Section 295-C PPC, which must be conducted by an officer not below the rank of Superintendent of Police (Section 156-A Cr.P.C.), was carried out under supervision of Deputy Directors of FIA Cyber Crime Reporting Centre, Rawalpindi, instead of officers of the rank statutorily mandated. An offence under Section 295-C PPC attracts a mandatory statutory protocol regarding investigation. 

This provision, couched in negative and prohibitory language, leaves no room for discretion or derogation. Its purpose is to ensure that allegations carrying capital consequences are investigated with the requisite seniority, independence, and responsibility envisaged by the Legislature.

 Compliance with Section 156-A Cr.P.C. is also a constitutional imperative. Article 4(1) of the Constitution mandates that every person shall be dealt with in accordance with law, which includes procedural safeguards expressly provided by the Code. Article 4(2)(a) further stipulates that no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation, or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law. In the present matter, investigation was admittedly conducted by officials below the rank contemplated under Section 156-A Cr.P.C., including Sub-Inspectors and Deputy Directors of FIA, thereby constituting a material illegality striking at the root of the investigative process. 

Regarding admissibility and authenticity of electronic evidence, Articles 164, 46-A, and 78-A of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and the Electronic Transactions Ordinance, 2002, provide that evidence derived from modern devices or automated information systems is admissible provided the integrity and security of such systems are demonstrated. The prosecution failed to prove the electronic documents through verified security procedures, nor was any forensic validation of the complainant’s or accused’s devices undertaken. Reliance on printouts or screenshots alone does not satisfy the standard required for primary evidence.

[12/17/25, 11:37:24 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The law itself provides the procedure for compelling the appearance of the witnesses before the Court and procedure to be followed in case of their failure to appear. However, that procedure also does not allow the learned trial court to close any such right of a complainant to produce his witnesses for the purpose of cross-examination. The error with the order dated 12.07.2025 passed by the learned Additional Sessions is that the learned Additional Sessions Judge has ordered the closure of the right of the petitioner to produce his witnesses despite the fact that he already had recorded the examination-in-chief of the said three witnesses and subsequent to that, there was no need for passing of an order that the petitioner cannot produce his witnesses for the simple reason that already the said witnesses had been produced and  their examinationin-chief had been recorded, therefore, the only course which could have been adopted by the learned trial court was the procedure provided under the law  for compelling the presence of a witness therefore, the order dated 12.07.2025 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge is untenable.

Moreover, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has also held that the accused as having been declared by the Investigating Officer of the case not to be involved in the case, should not be made a consideration while adjudicating upon the application under section 204 Cr.P.C. for the simple reason that the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has already held that the opinion of the Investigating Officer of the case is not only irrelevant but also not admissible in evidence.

[12/17/25, 11:37:26 AM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The relevant provisions of the law related to the power of a Judge of the learned trial court with respect to the production of any document are contained in Article 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Under the said Article 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, it has been provided that a Judge may, in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the parties about any fact relevant or irrelevant; and may order the production of any document or thing. Under the provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, the word document has also been defined under Article 2(1)(b), wherein it has been provided that document means any matter expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures or marks, or by more than one of those means, intended to be used, or which may be used, for the purpose of recording that matter. 

In this manner, the certified copy of the judgment and decree passed in the suit as filed by the petitioner seeking dissolution of marriage dated 11.09.2018, the certified copy of the Nikahnama, reflecting the Nikah of the petitioner with Muhammad Ameer and the certified copy of the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) can validly be considered as documents. Now the only question which needs to be decided is the question as to whether the production of these documents at this stage of proceedings was necessary to prove a fact in issue or any relevant fact or otherwise. Article 161 of the Qanun-eShahadat Order, 1984, is also clear that no stage for production of any document has been set and it has not been directed that a document cannot be produced before the learned trial court after a certain stage rather the use of the words “at any time” in the Article makes it abundantly clear that the judge may order the production of a document he considers necessary at any stage.

Now, as mentioned above, the only fact which needs to be considered is whether the production of the documents sought to be produced by the petitioner is necessary in order to discover and obtain proof of facts in issue and relevant facts or otherwise. Under the Qanun-eShahadat Order, 1984, the term “fact” has also been defined under Article 2 of the said order. 

As is plentifully clear from the above quoted provisions of the Qanune-Shahadat Order, 1984, a fact is said to be relevant to another when the one is connected with the other in any of the ways referred to in the provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 relating to the relevancy of facts. The provisions related to the relevancy of the facts are provided under Chapter III of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. It has been provided that evidence may be provided on facts in issue and relevant facts and furthermore, under Article 22 of the Qanun-eShahadat Order, 1984, it has been provided that facts necessary to explain facts in issue may also be given evidence of. In the present case, it is the stance of respondent No.3 that he was validly married to the petitioner and the fact in issue in the case is that whether the petitioner was raped by the respondent No.3. The relevant fact, which is necessary to prove the fact in issue in this case, is that whether the respondent No.3 was validly married to the petitioner. To prove the said fact, the respondent No.3 has already questioned the prosecution witnesses; however, the petitioner, by way of production of documents, now also wants to produce before the learned Judge the documents in order to prove the relevant facts. As mentioned above, Article 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, itself allows the learned Judge to obtain proof of relevant facts by ordering the production of any document, however, it has been provided that the ultimate judgment of the case must be based on a fact duly proved and not otherwise. In this manner, the documents sought to be proved by the petitioner may be received in evidence but the question about their relevancy and proof shall be decided by the learned trial court and it will only be after the declaration of the learned trial court that the said documents were not only relevant but also duly proved that the same would be considered in any manner. Therefore, by merely allowing the petitioner to produce the said documents, no prejudice will be caused to the respondent No.3 in his defence. The ultimate judgment to be passed by the learned trial court, shall be based upon the facts duly proved as provided under the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, and not otherwise.

It needs no scholarly discussion that timely registration of an FIR eliminates the potential for the manipulation of facts and indicates the likely presence of eyewitnesses at the crime scene.  

There are multiple factors providing strength to the acclaimed presence of eye-witness at the spot and receipt of injuries during incident is one of them.  The presence of a witness, injured during the occurrence is always considered well beyond doubt, because it has stamp of injuries on his person. 

Pistol was recovered upon the appellant's disclosure and thus was relevant under Article 40 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.

 It is cardinal principal of law that prosecution has to prove the guilt of accused by standing upon its own leg without any shadow of doubt, however Article 121 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984, is an exception to the general rule.

The prosecution in this case has successfully brought home the guilt of the appellant who has failed to justify his presence at the spot being owner of land as alleged by him and his plea of self defence was also found to be false. The recovery of crime empties from the spot fully matched with the pistol got recovered from the possession of the accused. The cogent, convincing, reliable and confidence inspiring ocular account fully in line with medical evidence has left no scope for us to come to irresistible conclusion that accused took life of deceased on the basis of motive fully established from the prosecution evidence that in fact he was after the land of Riaz Bibi and intended to illegally occupy the same.

ہبہ کو ثابت کرنے کے لیے آٹھ لازمی شرائط
ہائی کورٹ

عدالتِ عالیہ کے سامنے ایک ایسا مقدمہ آیا جس میں ایک بھائی نے اپنے والد کی جائیداد سے بہن کو اس کے شرعی حق سے محروم کرنے کے لیے ہبہ (Gift) کا جعلی دعویٰ کیا۔ ابتدائی عدالت اور اپیلٹ کورٹ نے بھائی کے مؤقف کو تسلیم کرتے ہوئے فیصلہ اس کے حق میں دے دیا، تاہم ہائی کورٹ نے دونوں فیصلوں کو کالعدم قرار دیتے ہوئے بہن کے حق میں فیصلہ صادر کیا۔

عدالتِ عالیہ نے واضح کیا کہ جو فریق کسی معاملے سے فائدہ اٹھانا چاہتا ہو، اسی پر اس معاملے کو ثابت کرنے کی ذمہ داری عائد ہوتی ہے۔ چونکہ بھائی ہبہ کا بینیفشری تھا، اس لیے اس پر لازم تھا کہ وہ ہبہ کو قانونی اور قابلِ اعتماد شہادت سے ثابت کرے۔

عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ کسی بھی ہبہ کو قانونی طور پر ثابت کرنے کے لیے درج ذیل آٹھ بنیادی شرائط کا پورا ہونا ناگزیر ہے:

1. ایجاب (Offer): ہبہ کرنے والے کی جانب سے واضح اور غیر مبہم اعلان۔

2. قبول (Acceptance): ہبہ لینے والے کی جانب سے صریح قبولیت۔

3. قبضہ (Delivery of Possession): جائیداد کا حقیقی قبضہ ہبہ لینے والے کے سپرد ہونا۔

4. ہبہ کنندہ کی نیت (Donor’s Intention): ہبہ خلوصِ نیت پر مبنی ہو، فراڈ یا فریب پر نہیں۔

5. آزادیٔ ارادہ (Free Consent): ہبہ کسی دباؤ، جبر یا دھوکے کے بغیر کیا گیا ہو۔

6. گواہان کی موجودگی (Witnesses): ایجاب و قبول معتبر گواہوں کے روبرو ہوا ہو۔

7. محکمہ مال میں درست اندراج (Mutation in Revenue Record): لینڈ ریونیو ایکٹ کے مطابق انتقال کا اندراج کیا گیا ہو۔

8. شہادت میں مطابقت (Consistency in Evidence): گواہان کے بیانات اور سرکاری ریکارڈ میں کوئی تضاد موجود نہ ہو۔

عدالت کے مشاہدات کے مطابق بھائی کے پیش کردہ گواہوں کے بیانات آپس میں متضاد تھے۔ روزنامچہ واقعاتی (Roznamcha Waqiati) اور ایجاب و قبول کے وقت کے بارے میں بھی واضح تضاد پایا گیا۔ مزید یہ کہ بیٹے کی بطور گواہ شہادت ناقابلِ قبول قرار دی گئی کیونکہ وہ ایجاب و قبول کے وقت موجود ہی نہیں تھا۔

عدالت نے یہ بھی قرار دیا کہ لینڈ ریونیو ایکٹ، 1967 کی دفعہ 42 کے تحت انتقال کا عوامی اعلان (Public Attestation) ثابت نہیں کیا جا سکا، جو ہبہ کے قانونی ثبوت کے لیے ایک لازمی تقاضا ہے۔

Eight Essential Ingredients Required to Prove a Valid Gift
High Court

The High Court dealt with a case in which a brother, in order to deprive his sister of her lawful Islamic share in their father’s property, put forward a false and fabricated claim of gift (Hiba). The trial court as well as the appellate court had decided the matter in favour of the brother. However, the High Court set aside both judgments and decreed the suit in favour of the sister.

The Court observed that the burden of proof lies upon the party who seeks to derive benefit from a particular fact. Since the brother was the beneficiary of the alleged gift, it was incumbent upon him to establish the gift through credible and lawful evidence.

The High Court held that for a gift to be legally proved, the following eight essential ingredients must be strictly fulfilled:

1. Offer: A clear and unequivocal declaration by the donor.

2. Acceptance: An explicit acceptance by the donee.

3. Delivery of Possession: Actual transfer of possession of the property to the donee.

4. Donor’s Intention: The gift must be genuine and bona fide, free from fraud or deception.

5. Free Consent: The gift must be made voluntarily, without coercion, undue influence, or misrepresentation.

6. Witnesses: The offer and acceptance must take place in the presence of credible witnesses.

7. Mutation in Revenue Record: Proper mutation must be sanctioned in accordance with the Land Revenue Act.

8. Consistency in Evidence: There must be no contradiction between the statements of witnesses and the official revenue record.

While evaluating the evidence, the Court found that the statements of the witnesses produced by the brother were mutually contradictory. Clear inconsistencies were also noticed regarding the Roznamcha Waqiati and the timing of offer and acceptance. Furthermore, the testimony of the son was held to be unreliable and inadmissible, as he was not present at the time of the alleged offer and acceptance.

The Court further held that the mandatory requirement of public attestation of mutation under Section 42 of the Land Revenue Act, 1967, was not proved, rendering the alleged gift legally unsustainable.

Registration of FIR or initiation of criminal proceedings through attorney are permissible under the law.

An attorney of a person can lodge an FIR with the police and can also initiate criminal proceedings before a Court for the interest of his Principal. If the proceedings before the court were initiated by the principal, and he becomes unavailable or incapacitated, the attorney can also continue it on his behalf with the permission of the Court. Court should also encourage such practice keeping in view the hardships involved in the case to reduce delays in(naeem) the criminal process which would restore the confidence of public on the courts of law for acquisition or regulation of their rights. There is no doubt that Court shall decide the matter on production of relevant evidence only that can also be recorded by using modern techniques like through online applications. Misuse of process by attorney, through registration of false FIR or filing of private complaint, can well be met through sound remedial measures including action pursuant to sections 181, 182, 211, 213 and 250 of the Pakistan Penal Code(naeem) 1860. Thus, contention of learned counsel for the petitioners that FIR cannot be registered through attorney is nothing but farce.

ریکوری میمو
ضبط کیس نمبر: 503/2025
تاریخ: 10.12.2025
1. وقوعہ کی اطلاع

10.12.2025 کو صبح ایک معتبر خفیہ اطلاع موصول ہوئی جو ڈپٹی کلیکٹر کسٹمز، ڈی آئی خان ڈویژن اور انٹیلیجنس بیورا زونل آفس ڈی آئی خان نے مشترکہ طور پر فراہم کی تھی۔
اطلاع کے مطابق بیرونِ ملک سے اسمگل شدہ سگریٹ ایک مزدا ٹرک رجسٹریشن نمبر P-6371 میں مقامی نمکو/پاپس کے لفافوں میں چھپائے جا رہے تھے، جو بلوچستان سے تونسہ کے راستے کم استعمال ہونے والے راستوں سے ڈی آئی خان لائے جا رہے تھے۔
2. کارروائی
اسی اطلاع پر آئی پی-جے سی پی ڈی ڈی کے پل چیک پوسٹ کے اسٹاف کو ہدایت کی گئی کہ مجوزہ اسمگلنگ ناکام بنائی جائے۔
10.12.2025 کو صبح 05:00 بجے مذکورہ ٹرک کو آتے ہوئے دیکھا گیا اور اسے رکنے کا اشارہ کیا گیا۔
جانچ پر پتا چلا کہ مقامی نمکو کے لفافوں کے نیچے بیرونِ ملک سے اسمگل شدہ سگریٹ چھپائے گئے تھے۔
ٹرک کو ضبط کرکے اسٹیٹ ویئر ہاؤس (SWH) ڈی آئی خان منتقل کیا گیا جہاں مکمل جانچ پر درج ذیل اسمگل شدہ غیر ملکی سگریٹس برآمد ہوئیں۔
3. ڈرائیور/مالک سے تحقیقات
ڈرائیور/مالک نے اپنا نام محمد ندیم ولد اللہ دتہ وغیرہ بتایا (اصل نام، ولدیت اور شناختی نمبر جیسا اصل دستاویز میں ہے)۔
ان سے جب قانونی دستاویزات مانگی گئیں تو وہ کوئی کسٹم ڈیوٹی یا جائز درآمد کے کاغذات پیش نہ کر سکے۔
یوں ان کی تحویل میں پائے جانے والے سامان کو غیر ملکی اسمگل شدہ ثابت پایا گیا۔
4. قانونی پہلو
تحقیقات سے واضح ہوا کہ:
سگریٹ غیر قانونی طور پر ملک میں لائی گئیں
اسمگلر نے مقامی پاپس/سنیکس کے تھیلوں میں چھپا کر کسٹم چیک پوسٹ سے بچنے کی کوشش کی
یہ جرم کسٹمز ایکٹ 1969 کی دفعہ 2(s)، دفعہ 16، اور امپورٹ ایکسپورٹ کنٹرول ایکٹ 1950 کی دفعات کے تحت قابلِ سزا ہے
لہٰذا یہ تمام سگریٹ اور کورنگ میٹریل قانون کے مطابق ضبط کیے جا رہے ہیں۔
5. گاڑی کی ضبطگی
مزید یہ کہ یہ ثابت ہوا کہ ٹرک Hino (06-wheeler) Reg No P-6371 صرف اور صرف انہی اسمگل شدہ سگریٹس کی نقل و حمل کے لیے استعمال ہوا، اس لیے گاڑی کو بھی کسٹمز ایکٹ کی دفعہ 157(2) کے تحت ضبط کیا جا رہا ہے۔
ضبط شدہ سامان کی تفصیل
1. غیر ملکی Ghookta سگریٹس  650 پیکٹ × 220 گرام = 143 کلوگرام
2. غیر ملکی Nashville سگریٹس  1300 سلیوز

2۔ مدعیہ کے مطابق وہ صبح ساڑھے 5 بجے کھیتوں میں گئی تو وہاں ملزم پہلے سے چھپا ہوا تھا۔ اس نے ریپ کر دیا۔ جہاں کا وقوعہ ہے وہاں ساتھ ہی آبادی بھی ہے۔ مدعیہ نے کسی قسم کا شور نہیں کیا۔ اس کے جسم پر مزاحمت کے کوئی نشان نہ تھے۔ کوئی زخم یا خراش کا نشان نہ تھا۔ متاثرہ خاتون نے اپنے کپڑے جمع نہیں کروائے کہ اس سے پتہ چلتا کہ وہ پھٹے ہوئے تھے یا نہیں۔ ان پر کوئی سیمن تھا یا نہیں۔ خاتون 7 ماہ تک خاموش رہی۔ مبینہ وقوعہ کے بعد جس وقت وہ گھر آئی اس کے مطابق اس کے بھائی اور باقی گھر والے گھر پر موجود تھے۔ اس نے 7 ماہ تک اس بات کا کسی سے ذکر نہیں کیا۔ ملزم کو کیسے پتہ تھا کہ وہ اس وقت وہاں اکیلی آئے گی۔
3۔ اگرچہ پیدا ہونے والے بچے کا ڈی این اے ملزم سے میچ کر گیا ہے لیکن یہ ریپ نہیں بلکہ زنا بالرضا کا واقعہ ہے۔ ریپ ہوتا تو مزاحمت، شور، زخم، خراش کچھ نہ کچھ تو ہوتا۔
4۔ میڈیکل رپورٹ میں ڈاکٹر نے یہ ضرور بتایا کہ ٹو فنگر ٹیسٹ مثبت آیا ہے لیکن اسے بھی کسی زخم وغیرہ کا کوئی پرانا نشان نہیں ملا۔
قانون کے طالبعلموں کیلئے: اگرچہ اس کیس میں 376 (ریپ) کی ایف آئی آر ہوئی تھی اور چارج بھی اسی دفعہ کے تحت فریم ہوا تھا لیکن سزا 496 بی (زنا بالرضا) میں تبدیل کر دی گئی۔ جو کہ اس جنرل اصول کی خلاف ورزی ہے کہ جس جرم کا چارج فریم ہو سزا بھی اسی میں ہو۔ اس اصول کی استثنی کیلئے آپ ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 238(2) اور سپریم کورٹ کی ایک ججمنٹ 2006SCMR 1170 پڑھ لیں۔



نوٹ: شیئر کردہ کیس کا فیصلہ سپریم کورٹ کے 3 رکنی لارجر بینچ جسٹس شہزاد احمد خان، جسٹس عقیل احمد عباسی، جسٹس صلاح الدین پنہور نے دیا ہے۔ جسٹس صلاح الدین نے اس فیصلے سے اتفاق نہیں کیا اور اپنا اختلافی نوٹ جاری کیا جس کی تفصیل ذیل میں ہے۔

سپریم کورٹ کے حالیہ فیصلے میں جہاں اکثریتی معزز جج صاحبان نے ایک ریپ کے مقدمے میں سزا کم کرتے ہوئے جرم کی نوعیت میں تبدیلی کی، وہیں محترم جناب جسٹس صلاح الدین پنھور صاحب کا اختلافی نوٹ قانون، انصاف اور سماجی حقیقتوں کی ایک مضبوط اور باوقار ترجمانی کرتا ہے۔ یہ اختلاف محض قانونی نکات تک محدود نہیں بلکہ انسانی وقار، سماجی دباؤ اور فوجداری قانون کے بنیادی اصولوں پر ایک گہری اور بصیرت افروز دستک ہے۔

یہ مقدمہ ایک تقریباً 24 سالہ غیر شادی شدہ خاتون سے متعلق ہے، جس کے نتیجے میں ایک بچہ پیدا ہوا۔ پنجاب فارنزک سائنس ایجنسی کی ڈی این اے رپورٹ کے مطابق ملزم اور متاثرہ خاتون اس بچے کے حیاتیاتی والدین ثابت ہوئے۔ اکثریتی فیصلے میں سات ماہ کی تاخیر سے درج ایف آئی آر اور جسم پر تشدد کے نشانات کی عدم موجودگی کو بنیاد بنا کر ریپ کے الزام کو کمزور قرار دیا گیا، تاہم محترم جناب جسٹس صلاح الدین پنھور صاحب نے نہایت مدلل، قانونی اور انسانی بنیادوں پر اس سوچ سے اختلاف کیا۔

محترم جناب جسٹس صلاح الدین پنھور صاحب واضح کرتے ہیں کہ ہمارے معاشرے میں ریپ اور جنسی ہراسانی کے واقعات اکثر رپورٹ ہی نہیں ہوتے۔ اس کی وجہ جرم کی عدم موجودگی نہیں بلکہ خوف، بدنامی، کردار کشی اور خاندانی دباؤ ہوتا ہے۔ ایک متاثرہ خاتون کو عدالت سے پہلے اپنے ہی گھر میں اپنے کردار کا دفاع کرنا پڑتا ہے۔ ایسے حالات میں تاخیر کو بدنیتی یا رضامندی سے تعبیر کرنا انصاف کے تقاضوں کے منافی ہے۔

خصوصاً اس مقدمے میں متاثرہ خاتون کم عمر، غیر شادی شدہ، والدین سے محروم اور اپنے بڑے بھائی پر انحصار کرنے والی تھی۔ ریکارڈ پر دھمکیوں کے شواہد بھی موجود تھے۔ محترم جناب جسٹس صلاح الدین پنھور صاحب کے مطابق ایسے حالات میں خاموشی ایک فطری انسانی ردعمل ہے، نہ کہ جرم سے انکار۔ ان کے بقول یہ خاموشی اس وقت تک برقرار رہنا بالکل فطری تھا جب تک متاثرہ خاتون کو اپنے حمل کا علم نہ ہو سکا۔

جسم پر تشدد کے نشانات نہ ہونے کے نکتے پر بھی محترم جناب جسٹس صلاح الدین پنھور صاحب نے ایک اہم قانونی اصول اجاگر کیا۔ اگر ملزم مسلح ہو تو مزاحمت نہ کرنا انسانی فطرت کے عین مطابق ہے۔ مزید یہ کہ سات ماہ بعد ہونے والا طبی معائنہ کسی جسمانی مزاحمت کے آثار محفوظ نہیں رکھ سکتا، جیسا کہ عدالتی نظائر میں بھی تسلیم کیا جا چکا ہے۔

ڈی این اے رپورٹ کے حوالے سے محترم جناب جسٹس صلاح الدین پنھور صاحب نے سائنسی بنیادوں پر اکثریتی فیصلے کی کمزوری واضح کی۔ انہوں نے بتایا کہ پنجاب فارنزک سائنس ایجنسی میں ڈی این اے کو بروقت extract کر کے محفوظ کیا جاتا ہے، جو برسوں تک قابلِ اعتماد رہتا ہے۔ محض buccal swab کے مبینہ طور پر ضائع ہونے کے امکان کو بنیاد بنا کر ڈی این اے رپورٹ کو مشکوک قرار دینا نہ سائنسی ہے اور نہ ہی قانونی طور پر درست۔

اختلافی نوٹ کا سب سے اہم اور حساس پہلو وہ ہے جہاں اکثریتی فیصلے میں ریپ (دفعہ 376 PPC) کو رضامندی پر مبنی فعل (دفعہ 496-B PPC) میں تبدیل کیا گیا۔ محترم جناب جسٹس صلاح الدین پنھور صاحب نے دوٹوک انداز میں واضح کیا کہ یہ دونوں الگ الگ جرائم ہیں جن کے اجزاء مختلف ہیں۔ اگر رضامندی ثابت نہیں تو محض سزا کم کرنے کے لیے جرم کی نوعیت بدلنا قانون کے بنیادی اصولوں کی کھلی خلاف ورزی ہے۔ ریپ ثابت نہ ہونے کا مطلب ہرگز یہ نہیں کہ رضامندی خودبخود ثابت ہو گئی۔

انہوں نے نہایت اہم سوال اٹھایا کہ اگر ڈی این اے رپورٹ ریپ کے الزام کے لیے ناقابلِ اعتبار سمجھی جا رہی ہے تو اسی رپورٹ کو رضامندی پر مبنی جرم کے لیے کیسے قابلِ قبول مانا جا سکتا ہے؟ قانون مفروضوں پر نہیں بلکہ ناقابلِ تردید ثبوت پر عمل کرتا ہے۔

محترم جناب جسٹس صلاح الدین پنھور صاحب نے اپنے اختلافی نوٹ کا اختتام انسانی وقار کے قرآنی تصور پر کیا، جو اس حقیقت کی یاد دہانی ہے کہ انسان کی عزت اور حرمت ہر قانونی بحث سے بالاتر ہے۔ یہ اختلافی نوٹ دراصل صرف ایک فیصلے سے اختلاف نہیں بلکہ اس سوچ کے خلاف ایک مضبوط اعلان ہے جو مظلوم کی خاموشی کو اس کے خلاف ثبوت بنا دیتی ہے۔

یہ اختلافی رائے مستقبل کے لیے ایک واضح رہنما اصول ہے کہ انصاف صرف شکوک و شبہات کی بنیاد پر نہیں بلکہ سماجی حقیقتوں، انسانی نفسیات اور قانون کے مسلمہ اصولوں کے ساتھ ہم آہنگ ہو کر دیا جانا چاہیے۔ اگر خاموشی کو جرم اور کمزوری کو رضامندی سمجھا جائے تو یہ انصاف نہیں بلکہ خوف کی توثیق ہو گی۔

اختلافی رائے والے پیرا گرافس کاپی کیے ہیں۔

[12/19/25, 1:46:42 PM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: فوجداری مقدمے کے مراحل 
(ایف آئی آر سے فیصلہ مقدمہ تک)

ایف آئی آر 𝐅𝐈𝐑: 
جب بھی کوئی جرم ہوتا ہے تو سب سے پہلے پولیس کو اطلاع دی جاتی ہے اگر وہ جرم قابلِ دست اندازی ہو تو پولیس ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 𝟏𝟓𝟒 کے تحت 𝐅𝐈𝐑 درج کرتی ہے(قابل دست اندازی جرم وہ ہوتے ہیں ہیں جن میں پولیس کسی بھی ملزم کو بغیر وارنٹ کے گرفتار کر سکتی ہے) ایف آئی آر کا مقصد فوجداری قانون کو حرکت میں لانا ہوتا ہے اگر پولیس ایف آئی آر درج نہ کرے تو پولیس کے اس عمل کے خلاف آپ 𝐃𝐒𝐏 یا 𝐒𝐏 کو درخواست دے سکتے ہیں۔ اگر پھر بھی ایف آئی آر درج نہیں کی جاتی تو جسٹس آف پیس (𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐞) کے پاس پٹیشن (𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧) دائر کی جاتی ہے۔ یہ پٹیشن ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 𝟐𝟐𝐀 اور 𝟐𝟐𝐁 کے تحت دائر کی جاتی ہے۔ جسٹس آف پیس کے اختیارات سیشن ججز کے پاس ہی ہوتے ہیں۔ مطلب کہ یہ درخواست سیشن جج (𝐬𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐣𝐮𝐝𝐠𝐞) کے پاس درج کی جائے گی اور وہ پولیس کو 𝐝𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐭 کرے گا کہ اس وقوعہ کی ایف آئی آر درج کرے۔ اس کے علاوہ آپ کے پاس استغاثہ (𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭) کا راستہ ہر وقت موجود رہتا ہے۔ کسی بھی جرم (چاہے وہ قابل دست اندازی پولیس ہو یا نہ ہو) کے متعلق علاقہ مجسٹریٹ کو درخواست دی جا سکتی ہے۔

ضمانت قبل از گرفتاری:
ایف آئی آر درج ہو جانے کے بعد اگر شخص سمجھتا ہے کہ اسے جان بوجھ کر ایف آئی آر میں نامزد کیا گیا ہے اور وہ بے گناہ ہے تو وہ ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 𝟒𝟗𝟖 کے تحت سیشن کورٹ میں ضمانت قبل از گرفتاری کے لیے درخواست دائر کر سکتا اور گرفتار ہونے سے بچ سکتا ہے۔

تفتیش:
 ایف آئی آر درج ہو جانے کے بعد پولیس دفعہ 𝟏𝟓𝟔 کے تحت اس کے متعلق تفتیش شروع کرتی ہے۔ جائے وقوعہ پر جا کر کر ثبوت اکٹھے کرتی ہے۔ دفعہ 𝟏𝟔𝟏 کے تحت گواہوں کے بیان ریکارڈ کیے جاتے ہیں۔ 

ملزمان کی گرفتاری:
پولیس کے پاس اختیار ہے کہ وہ دوران تفتیش قابلِ ضمانت یا ناقابلِ ضمانت کیس میں ملزمان کو گرفتار کرے۔ اس کے علاوہ دفعہ 𝟏𝟔𝟗 کے تحت پولیس کے پاس اختیار ہے کہ وہ کسی بھی ملزم کو بے گناہ پا کر چھوڑ بھی سکتی ہے۔
مجسٹریٹ کے سامنے پیشی:
تفتیش کے دوران پولیس 𝟐𝟒 گھنٹوں کے اندر اندر گرفتار شدہ ملزمان کو علاقہ مجسٹریٹ کے روبرو پیش کرنے کی پابند ہے۔
جب پولیس گرفتار ملزمان کو مجسٹریٹ کے سامنے پیش کرتی ہے تو اس وقت تک کی گئی تفتیش بھی مجسٹریٹ کے سامنے پیش کرنی ہوتی ہے اور اگر 𝟐𝟒 گھنٹوں میں تفتیش مکمل نہ کی گئی ہو تو ملزم کے جسمانی یا جوڈیشل ریمانڈ کی درخواست دی جاتی ہے اور دوسری جانب مجسٹریٹ کے سامنے پیشی پر ملزم ضمانت بعد از گرفتاری کے لیے درخواست دیتا ہے۔

ریمانڈ:
ریمانڈ دو طرح کا ہوتا ہے۔ جب پولیس نے ملزم سے کوئی برآمدگی کرنی ہو تو وہ دفعہ 𝟏𝟔𝟕 کے تحت جسمانی ریمانڈ کی درخواست کرتی ہے کہ ملزم کو واپس پولیس کے حوالے کیا جائے۔ اگر پولیس کو ملزم کی حراست کی ضرورت نہ ہو تو وہ دفعہ دفعہ 𝟑𝟒𝟒 کے تحت ریمانڈ جوڈیشل کی درخواست کرتی ہے۔
ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 𝟏𝟔𝟕 کے تحت جسمانی ریمانڈ کی زیادہ سے زیادہ میعاد 𝟏𝟓 دن ہے لیکن مجسٹریٹ کبھی بھی 𝟏𝟓 دن کا ریمانڈ ایک ساتھ نہیں دیتا بلکہ دو دو یا چار چار دن کا ریمانڈ جسمانی دیا جاتا ہے۔ مثال کے طور پر اب اگر دو دن کا ریمانڈ دیا گیا ہو تو پولیس اس شخص کو دو دن کے بعد دوبارہ مجسٹریٹ کے سامنے پیش کرے گی۔ اس دوران جو بھی تفتیش کی ہوتی ہے وہ مجسٹریٹ کے سامنے رکھے گی اور دوبارہ سے ریمانڈ کے لیے درخواست دے گی۔ اس طرح وقفے وقفے سے مجسٹریٹ ٹوٹل 𝟏𝟓 دن کا جسمانی ریمانڈ پر ملزم کو پولیس کے حوالے کر سکتا ہے لیکن اگر ریمانڈ کی درخواست دیتے وقت مجسٹریٹ کو لگے کہ کہ پولیس نے کوئی خاص تفتیش نہیں کی تو مجسٹریٹ جسمانی ریمانڈ نہیں دیتا بلکہ ملزم کو جوڈیشل ریمانڈ پر جیل بھیج دیتا ہے۔

ضمانت بعد از گرفتاری:
اب ہم دیکھتے ہیں کہ کہ ایف آئی آر درج ہوگئی ملزم گرفتار ہوا اور ہم نے چوبیس گھنٹے کے اندر اندر اس کو مجسٹریٹ کے سامنے پیش کیا۔ ملزم اب بعد از گرفتاری ضمانت کیلئے درخواست دائر کرسکتا ہے اور اگر عائد کردہ جرم قابل ضمانت ہو تو ضمانت ملزم کا حق ہے۔ ناقابلِ ضمانت جرم میں اگر ملزم بے گناہ ہو اور اس کے خلاف کوئی ٹھوس ثبوت موجود نہ ہو اور مزید تفتیش کی ضرورت ہو تو بھی ملزم کو ضمانت مل سکتی ہے۔

چالان (𝐏𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭):
 اب اگلا مرحلہ چالان جمع کروانے کا ہوتا ہے۔ ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 𝟏𝟕𝟑 ایف آئی آر درج ہونے کے بعد  𝟏𝟒 دن کے اندر اندر  مجسٹریٹ کے پاس چالان جمع کروانا ہوتا ہے اگر 𝟏𝟒 دنوں میں پولیس نے چالان جمع نہیں کرایا تو تین دن کے اندر عبوری چالان جمع کرائے گی۔ مطلب کہ پولیس کے پاس چالان جمع کرانے کے لیے 𝟏𝟒+𝟑 دن کا وقت ہوتا ہے اس دورانیہ میں پولیس نے ہر حال میں مکمل یا نامکمل چالان جمع کرانا ہوتا ہے ( نامکمل چالان اس صورت میں جمع ہوتا ہے جب 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 تیار نہیں ہوتی اور اس کے آنے میں ابھی وقت ہوتا ہے) تاکہ جتنے بھی ثبوت اکٹھے ہوئے ہیں جتنی بھی تفتیش ہوئی ہے اس کی بنیاد پر عدالت ٹرائل چلا سکے لیکن عدالت کا اختیار ہے کہ وہ مکمل چالان کے بعد بھی ٹرائل شروع کر سکتی ہے۔ 

چالان کے کالم:
چالان کے 𝟕  کالمز ہوتے ہیں۔ پولیس نے ابھی تک جتنی بھی کارروائی کی ہوتی ہے اس چالان فارم پر  لکھتی ہے۔
 پہلے کالم میں نام و پتہ مستغیث درج ہوتا ہے 
دوسرا کالم اشتہاری ملزمان کا ہوتا ہے
تیسرے کالم میں زیر حراست ملزمان کے کوائف درج ہوتے ہیں چوتھا کالم ان ملزمان کے متعلق ہوتا ہے جو ضمانت پر رہا ہوتے ہیں
پانچویں کالم میں مال مقدمہ کی تفصیل درج ہوتی ہے مثلاً ملزمان سے کوئی ہتھیار یا چرس برآمد ہوئی ہو تو اس کا ذکر ہوتا ہے
چھٹے کالم میں استغاثہ کے گواہان کی تفصیل درج ہوتی ہے۔ ساتویں کالم میں پوری تفتیش کا خلاصہ لکھا ہوتا ہے۔
چالان کے ساتھ مختلف ڈاکومنٹ بھی لف ہوتے ہیں جن میں ایف آئی آر کی کاپی، میڈیکل رپورٹ، فرد مقبوضگی اور نقشہ موقع شامل ہوتا ہے۔ اس کے علاوہ مستغیث اور گواہان کے بیانات جو کہ پولیس نے 𝟏𝟔𝟏 کے تحت ریکارڈ کیے ہوں شامل ہوتے ہیں۔ 

مجسٹریٹ کے پاس چالان جمع ہونے پر اگر مجسٹریٹ کو لگے کہ وہ ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 𝟏𝟗𝟎 کے مطابق اس کیس کے ٹرائل کا اختیار رکھتا ہے تو ٹرائل شروع کرتا ہے اور اگر اسے لگے اس کیس میں ٹرائل شروع کرنے کا اختیار سیشن کورٹ کے پاس ہے تو وہ اس کیس کو سیشن جج کے پاس بھیج دیتا ہے۔ ضابطہ فوجداری میں دونوں عدالتوں کے ٹرائل کی الگ الگ وضاحت کی گئی ہے۔ لیکن یہاں ہم ٹرائل کو عام نقظہ نظر سے دیکھیں گے۔

ملزم کو دستاویزات کی فراہمی:
اگر تو ملزمان ضمانت پر رہا ہیں تو پولیس کے ذریعے انہیں بلایا جائے گا اگر تو وہ جیل میں ہیں تو بذریعہ جیل سپرانٹنڈنٹ انہیں بلایا جائے گا۔ جب ملزمان حاضر ہو جاتے ہیں تو چالان، گواہوں کے بیان اور جو بھی متعلقہ ڈاکومنٹ چالان کے ساتھ لف ہوتا ہے ان سب کی کاپیاں بغیر معاوضہ کے انھیں فراہم کی جاتی ہیں۔ یہ ڈاکومنٹس فرد جرم عائد ہونے سے کم از کم 𝟕 دن پہلے دینا لازم ہے تاکہ ملزم کو پتہ چل سکے کہ اس کے خلاف کیا کیس ہے اور کیا کیا ثبوت اکٹھے ہو چکے ہیں۔ 

ٹرائل کا آغاز:
اب ٹرائل کا مرحلہ آتا ہے۔ ٹرائل کا آغاز ملزم پر فرد جرم عائد کرنے سے ہوتا ہے۔ عدالت ملزم کو بتاتی ہے تمہارے اوپر یہ الزام ہے۔ اس سے پوچھا جاتا ہے کہ آیا وہ اقبال جرم کرتا ہے یا جوابدہی کرے گا۔ ٹرائل کے دوران اگر تو ملزم اقبال جرم کر لے تو عدالت کے پاس اختیار ہے کہ وہ اس کو سزا سنا دے۔ لیکن اگر عدالت کو لگے کہ وہ جھوٹا اعترافی بیان دے رہا ہے تو عدالت اس کے بیان کو رد بھی کر سکتی ہے۔
اگر ملزم اعترافی بیان نہیں دیتا تو پھر باقاعدہ ٹرائل کا آغاز ہوتا ہے اس کے بعد پرازیکیوشن(𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧) کے گواہوں کے بیان ریکارڈ ہوتے ہیں اور ملزم کا وکیل ان پر جرح کرتا ہے۔ پرازیکیوشن کے پاس دو طرح کے گواہ ہوتے ہیں ایک تو پرائیویٹ گواہ ہوتے ہیں جو کہ مستغیث کے گواہ ہوتے ہیں مثلاً کہ چشم دید گواہ وغیرہ۔ دوسرے پولیس کے گواہ ہوتے ہیں جیسا کہ ایف آئی آر درج کرنے والا پولیس افسر۔ 
جب پرازیکیوشن کے گواہان کے بیانات ریکارڈ ہو جاتے ہیں اس کے بعد ملزم کا 𝟑𝟒𝟐 کا بیان ریکارڈ کیا جاتا ہے۔ جو کہ ہر حال میں لازم ہے۔ ملزم سے مختلف سوال پوچھے جاتے ہیں مثلاً اس سے پوچھا جاتا ہے کہ آپ کے خلاف یہ کیس کیوں بنایا گیا ہے یہ گواہ آپ کے خلاف گواہی کیوں دے رہے ہیں۔ ملزم ان سوالوں کا عموماً یہ ہی جواب دیتا ہے کہ میرے خلاف جھوٹا مقدمہ بنایا گیا اور میں بے گناہ ہوں۔ اس کے علاوہ ملزم سے پوچھا جاتا ہے کہ کیا وہ اپنی صفائی میں کوئی ڈاکومنٹ یا کوئی گواہ پیش کرنا چاہتا ہے۔ان سوالوں میں ایک سوال یہ بھی شامل ہوتا ہے کہ کیا وہ اپنے حق میں گواہی دینا چاہتا ہے اگر وہ کہے کہ میں اپنا گواہ بنتا ہوں تو 𝟑𝟒𝟎 کے تحت وہ حلف اٹھا کر اپنے ہی گواہ کے طور پر پیش ہوتا ہے اور بیان دیتا ہے اور پرازیکیوشن اس پر جرح کرتی ہے۔ لیکن عام طور پر ملزمان 𝟑𝟒𝟎 کے تحت اپنا ہی گواہ نہیں بنتے اور نہ ہی اپنے حق میں کوئی گواہ پیش کرتے ہیں کیونکہ اگر وہ اپنا ہی گواہ خود بنے یا اپنے حق میں کوئی اور گواہ پیش کرے تو مخالف وکیل کو اس پر اور اس کے گواہ پر جرح کا حق ہوگا اور اس جرح میں ملزم پھنس سکتا ہے۔

بحث:
اب اگلا مرحلہ آرگومنٹ کا آتا ہے دونوں اطراف سے دونوں پارٹیز کے وکیل بحث کرتے ہیں۔

فیصلہ:
عدالت کیس کے متعلق فیصلہ سناتی ہے۔ فیصلہ کے لیے ضروری ہے کہ جج پہلے اسے لکھے اور پھر اس فیصلے کو عدالت میں سنائے۔ فیصلہ میں مجرم کو بری کر دیا جاتا ہے یا سزا سنائی جاتی ہے۔

گھوڑی پال سکیم 
(Horse Breeding) 
کی الاٹ شدہ ٹیننسی اگرچہ قابلِ وراثت نہیں ہوتی، تاہم قانون کے مطابق مرحوم ٹیننٹ کے قانونی وارثوں کے حق پر منصفانہ اور سنجیدہ غور کرنا لازم ہے۔
کسی بھی قسم کی مکمل اور باقاعدہ حقائق پر مبنی انکوائری کے بغیر ٹیننسی کی بحالی (Resumption) کرنا اصولِ قدرتی انصاف 
(Principles of Natural Justice)
 کی کھلی خلاف ورزی ہے۔

ٹیننسی کی شرائط کی مبینہ خلاف ورزی اس وقت تک ثابت نہیں سمجھی جا سکتی جب تک متعلقہ جگہ پر موقع پر جا کر، متاثرہ قانونی وارثوں کی موجودگی میں، باقاعدہ معائنہ اور تصدیق نہ کی جائے۔

مرحوم ٹیننٹ کے قانونی وارث اس اسکیم کے تحت ترجیحی بنیادوں پر غور کے حق دار ہیں، بشرطیکہ وہ گھوڑی پال اسکیم کے لیے موزوں (Suitable) ہوں۔

محض رسمی اور خودکار انداز میں تاوان (Tawan) عائد کرنا، بغیر یہ جانچے کہ آیا گھوڑی پالنے کی ذمہ داریاں واقعی پوری کی جا رہی تھیں یا نہیں، غیر قانونی اور ناجائز ہے۔

 قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 
Legal analyses..,

گھوڑے پالنے کی ٹیننسی غیر وراثتی 
(Non-Heritable) ہے، مگر قانون کے مطابق مرحوم ٹیننٹ کے وارثوں کے حقوق پر منصفانہ غور ضروری ہے۔ درخواست گزار نے عدالت میں اس بات کی نشاندہی کی کہ ٹیننسی کی بحالی یا تواں (Tawan) کی وصولی صرف رسمی طور پر کی گئی اور قانونی وارثوں کے ساتھ موقع پر کوئی معائنہ نہیں ہوا۔

 عدالت کے قانونی نکات 
(Legal Points)
Non-Heritable Tenancy vs. Legal Heirs Consideration

گھوڑی پال ٹیننسی قابلِ وراثت نہیں ہے۔

مگر قانون کے مطابق مرحوم ٹیننٹ کے وارثوں کو ترجیحی غور کا حق حاصل ہے۔

عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ بغیر مناسب اور منصفانہ تحقیق کے ٹیننسی کی بحالی یا اس کی مخالفت کرنا اصولِ قدرتی انصاف (Natural Justice) کی خلاف ورزی ہے۔

حقائق کی انکوائری (Factual Inquiry)

کسی بھی دعوے یا خلاف ورزی کی بنیاد پر فوری فیصلہ کرنا ناقابل قبول ہے۔

عدالت نے کہا کہ موقع پر جانچ پڑتال 
(On-Site Verification) 
ضروری ہے، جس میں متاثرہ وارثوں کی موجودگی لازمی ہے۔

مرحوم ٹیننٹ کے وارثین کا حق
 (Rights of Legal Heirs)

وارثین کو ترجیح دی جائے گی بشرطیکہ وہ اسکیم کے مطابق موزوں ہوں۔

“موزونیت” کا مطلب ہے کہ وارث گھوڑی پالنے کی شرائط اور ذمہ داریوں کو پورا کرنے کے قابل ہوں۔

Tawan (ضمانت/فیس) کی وصولی

عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ محض رسمی یا خودکار انداز میں Tawan عائد کرنا غیر قانونی ہے۔

تواں اس وقت ہی عائد کیا جا سکتا ہے جب یہ تصدیق ہو کہ ٹیننسی کی شرائط واقعی پوری نہیں کی گئیں۔

Cross-examination on civil side.

What is cross-examination; It comes under chapter 10 in articles 133,  134,  135, 136, 137, 138, 140, 141, 150,  161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and 162 Criminal procedure code (Cr.P.C). A statement on oath of a witness before the Court is known as the examination-in-chief. When the adverse party tries to falsify/ controvert the said examination-in-chief, said process is amount to cross-examination. After cross-examination, if any ambiguity come into picture, the party who produce the witness, can get re-examine said witness after seeking permission from the Court. After that the other party can be given opportunity with the permission of the Court to conduct the cross-examination, if so required.

The cross-examination is also done to find out the truth and detection of the lie in the testimony of the witness. It is important to remember that the justice should not be denied by the improper cross-examination. The advocates should clearly go through those points which they wish to ask before initiating cross-examination on the witness. Generally, cross-examination means to test the credibility of a witness and to bring true facts on the record, which the witness has either not brought on record or has deliberately concealed. The cross-examination is the most powerful engine as invented by the human civilization during the experience of centuries. The cross-examination may differ from case to case and person to person. The age, position, status, expression, qualification and expertise etc of the witness can be the useful topics for the cross-examiners. Right to cross-examine flows from the principle of natural justice that evidence may not be read against a party, until the same has been subjected to cross-examination or at least an opportunity is given for the cross-examination.

Right of cross-examination is not mere formality, but is the only way conferred by law to check the truthfulness of case of opponent party. The worth of an advocate is based on the practice and procedure through which he conducts cross-examination. The cross-examination cannot be confined to the facts to which the witness testifies in his examination-in-chief. He can be cross-examined as to the whole of the case, but it confines to the matter which are relevant to the main case. A witness can be questioned about his conduct, integrity, his enmity with the other party and his interest in giving evidence. To shake the creditability of a witness, the questions can be asked about his previous inconsistent statements about any relevant fact. Indecent and scandalous questions can also be asked by the advocate at the time of cross-examination, if they relate to the fact in issue. The questions intended to insult or annoy the witness should be forbidden by the Court, even though the question may seem to be proper. Evidentiary value of any such statement of witness is to be determined by the Court at the time of final judgment. Further in section 363 Cr.P.C a judge can pass remarks about the demeanor of the witness, which is also amount to some sort of cross-examination. The main purpose of the cross- examination is as under:

i.        To check the credibility of the witness.

ii.       To impeach the accuracy of the evidence.

iii.      To expose and bring on record the facts which the witness has not deposed and said facts are useful for the cross-examiner.

iv.      To confront the facts which the witness has improved to fulfill the lacunas of his case.

There is no hard and fast rule for the cross-examination. Different kinds of witnesses require different treatment. Some witnesses are formal in nature and normally, no cross-examination is required on such witnesses. To conduct proper cross-examination, the concerned advocate must know what onus he has to discharge, what issues is to be proved and what defense he has to take. He can cement the base of his defense, while making questions in the cross-examination and then prove the same after the case of his opponent is over. The witness may be questioned to establish his bias, interest, corruption or perjury. He may be questioned to discover his position with reference to the controversy or to shake his credit by drawing his attention to any of his previous inconsistent statement as to relevant fact or to his previous statement containing admission.It is well said that best facts of a criminal case are known to the police and lawyers and the cases are either win or lose in the chamber of the advocates before the trial commence.

Actually, the cross-examination is an art and during my career as judge, I observed that most of the lawyers were struggling in this field and even they are not aware about the basic legal terms like, facts, statements, evidence, testimony, narration, suggestion, improvements dishonest improvement and confrontation etc. They do not know the basic principle of cross-examination that what question is to be asked and what not. Some time they conduct cross-examination without preparation.

Legal terms used in cross-examination:

Statement: A statement means the formal presentation of facts or the act of stating and reciting of facts. In criminal side its kinds are as under:-

•        Statement of the witnesses before the Court with or without oath.

•        Statement of witnesses before police officers u/S. 161 Cr.P.C.

•        Statement of the witnesses before magistrate u/S. 164 Cr.P.C.

•        Statement of accused before the trial Court u/S. 342 and 340(2) Cr.P.C.

•        Voluntary statement.

•        Previous statement.

Fact: Fact means a circumstance, event or occurrence as actually, takes or took place or a physical object or appearance. It also means thing, state of things, or relation of things which can be perceived through senses. There are various kinds of fact like, fact in issue, relevant fact and fact which are not relevant and otherwise become relevant.

•        Evidence can be given qua fact in issue or relevant fact under article 18 of Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984.

•        Evidence can be given about existence or non-existence of every fact in issue or of such other fact like the fact which are the occasion, cause or effect of fact in issue.

•        Motive, preparation, previous or subsequent conduct of the accused can be relevant fact under article 21 of Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984, while it got no concern with the fact in issue.

•        Some fact necessary to explain or introduce the relevant facts also can be relevant to fact in issue. Please see article 22 of Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984. Identification parade is one of the examples of said situation.

•        Probability is a piece of evidence and can be relied upon as an item to prove a fact. Please see 2006 YLR 251

Fact and opinion; As per article 2(d), Qanun-e- Shahadat order, 1984, fact and an opinion are two different terms of law, having different consequences. For example a doctor who used to conduct the post -mortem examination of a dead body, he describes the nature, seat and number of injuries, which he observes during post mortem report, At the same moment, he can also make his opinion as to the manner through which these injuries might have been caused and as to cause of the death. As an expert, he describes the number, position and nature of injuries, as he has actually observed, perceived and noticed, but to depose about the manner and weapon of offence with which these injuries were caused and the cause of the death, is the simple opinion of the doctor drawn from the facts as he observed during examination of the dead body. Please see PLD 1992 Lah. 314.

Evidence; Evidence means to confirm, attest, explain corroborate and demonstrate the disputed facts on oath before the Court, so that the Court can make the conclusion of the matter in issue between the parties. The word evidence is an exhaustive term and includes all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it, by the witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under inquiry or trial. Such statements are called oral evidence, and all documents produced for the perusal of the Court are called documentary evidence.

Testimony; Evidence and testimony are interchangeable words, but in article 3 and 17 of Qanun-e-Shahdat order1984, word testimony has been used to that of evidence. Testimony means the statements of the parties, witnesses and documents which are allowed under Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984, to be produced before the Court to prove fact in issue or relevant fact. In testimony, competency of the witness, Court, oath of the witness and cross-examination would be the basic factors. Without cross-examination the evidence cannot get the status of testimony. So to make the evidence testimony cross-examination is obligatory. But normally, we use the word evidence to that testimony which is wrong practice.

Voluntary statement; In cross-examination, we face the issue of voluntary statement on the part of witness, when he tries to further explain his answer. There is no provision of voluntary statement in Qanun-e-Shahdat order 1984, and it also got no value in the eye of law and judges normally allow such type explanation /answer to continue the process of evidence. It has been explained in case title Mushtaq Ahmed V Mohammed Sarwer and another that voluntary statement by a witness in cross-examination has no evidentiary value. Such voluntary evidence is against the rule of re-examination as contemplated under Art.133 of Qanun-e-Shahadat order 1984.

Obliging concession; It means to give undue favor to defense. Sometime formal witnesses, doctors and IOs give favorable answer in cross-examination to favor the defense and said answers are always against the record and are normally made in league with the defense side to weaken the case of the prosecution. If the Court come to the conclusion that answers of said PW is given to weak the prosecution case and to support the defense version, then Court can ignore it. Said situation as per law is known as obliging concession and the Court of law discourage said steps of the witnesses and no benefit is advanced to the defense. Please see landmark judgments Habib-Ullah case reported in PLD 69 Supreme Court, page 127, Muhammad Shareef case reported in 1976 Supreme Court, 452 and 2005 SCMR, 1431,2009 SCMR 407 and 2009 Pcrlj 894 FSC.

Previous statement; Said statement is very material in criminal trial. It has been explained in article 140 of Qanun-e-Shahadat order 1984, and section 162 Cr.P.C. If a statement recorded in discharge of official duty in the same case or in some different case, having relevancy with the fact in issue, can be brought on record to confront its deponent, when he comes to Court to make evidence. Article 46 and 47 of The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 are also relevant in this respect.

Narration; Narration is the act of telling a story, usually in some kinds of chronological orders. Narration generally, means any kind of explaining or telling of something. As per legal practice narration means the examination-in-chief of the witness and answer of the witness as given against a general question, put in the cross-examination. All the examination-in-chief and most of the cross- examination are normally done in the form of narration, but there is no restriction to do the same in the question and answer shape.

Leading questions; it means a question which promotes or encourages the answer wanted to the maker of the question. It is further explained by the superior Courts that the real meaning of this question is that a question which suggests the answer (yes) is a leading question. A question which suggests only the answer (no) also is leading question, but a question which may be answered either in yes or no, and suggests neither answer as the correct one, is not leading.

Suggestion; it means an idea or plan put forward for the consideration to other person. In our judicial system, it is normally used by defense counsel to put their stance/version to the pw, during cross-examination to rebut him and advance/introduce the case of defense and if the same is wrongly put, it can promote the case of the prosecution. As per law, settled in PLJ 1991 criminal case Lahore 249, 2010 P Cr. L J, 1726 and Muhammad Shah case, reported in 2010 SCMR page 1009, said suggestions never got the status of corroboration or direct evidence. It is the prosecution which has to prove its case independently. On the basis of one favorable answer by the PW to the defense or any suggestion in favor of the prosecution, would not matter, rather whole evidence is to be looked into, while making any conclusion of the case. In 2006 SCMR, 577, otherwise view is taken and it was held that said situation will be addressed in favor of prosecution, but it is a minority view.

Discrepancies; It means when there is a difference between two things that should be alike. In ocular account normally minor discrepancies crop up due to time factor, but if they do not touch the intrinsic value of evidence, then same will not matter. Please see 2003 SCMR 884 Mandoos Khan case, 2013 P.Cr.R 1028, 2013 P.Cr.L.J 688 and PLD 2013 586. It is added that to address said discrepancies, time factor will be kept in mind, because it plays vital role in memory of the witness.

Confrontation; It is a basic right of an accused in a criminal trial to confront the testimony of opponent witness in his trial, while using the opportunity of cross-examination. In our judicial system confrontation means right of the accused through which he can confront the witness with his previous statement recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. or any statement made by him before any even administrative forum which is related to the matter in issue in 162 Cr.P.C. and in article 141 of Qanun-e-Shahdat etc, when the witness avoids to accept/disclose his actual statement recorded before the police u/S. 161 Cr.P.C, or any other forum of law. Normally, this practice is done when the witness try to improve his case to fulfill the lacunas or to disown anything goes against him. Actually, witness makes an effort to deprive the accused qua said valuable right, so that the accused could not confront said situation. Said act of the witness shakes his credibility. It is added that confrontation is allowed with previous statement of the witness and nothing else. Please see relevant case law PLD 1965 Supreme Court 188 and 1995 MLD 1635 Federal Shariat Court and PLD 2013 SC 386.

Note: Prosecution could not be permitted to confront a witness with his previous statement recorded u/S. 161 Cr.P.C. for the purpose of contradicting him even after being declared hostile.

Procedure of confrontation; To confront a witness with his previous statement is somehow complicated process. I just try to simplify it in the light of my experience. The proper way is to ask the witness, whether he has made such and such statement before police or before any other quasi-judicial or administrative forum. We are normally confused, if the witness replies in yes, the previous statements in writing need not to be proved, because he himself admitted the said statement before the Court and Court will see the fate of said statement. If the witness denies his previous statement or states that he does not remember any such statement, then confrontation is needed and said statement be placed on record as ex; DA, B etc, so the Court could see the authenticity of statement.

The defense counsel will read out to the witness the relevant portion of his previous statement and give him a chance to explain or reconcile the same. For example, if PW stated in his previous statement that he reached at the place of occurrence on hearing the hue and cry, when the victim was assaulted, but in his examination-in-chief before the Court, he states that he reached at the place of occurrence, while passing through near the same. There is a contradiction in his two statements and this can be confronted, if so needed by the defense and defense can put his previous statement as DA etc on the record, so that the Court can observe the actual position. If said practice is not done, then the statement given before the Court on oath would be believed as it is, and no benefit of previous statement can be taken by the defense.

During the dictation of cross-examination, when the defense side tries to bring on record anything left by the witness, which is in favor of the defense or anything added by the pw, which is amount to fulfill the lacuna, then after seeing statement of the PW u/S. 161 Cr.P.C. and the examination-in-chief of the PW and if any addition is made then the said situation can be confronted with the previous statement under section 162 Cr.P.C. and article 140 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984 as the case may be, otherwise the same would be used against the defense.In the same way, when anything is omitted which was mentioned in the previous statement and the same is useful for the defense, then the defense can bring the same on record.

FIR is mere first information having no evidentiary value, until its scribe (we normally use the word scriber to that of scribe which wrong practice) proves its contents before the Court. Its maker can be confronted with it, in 140 Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984. Its maker can be corroborated in 153 Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984. It can be proved against its maker in 34 Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984. Except this it got no role in criminal trial. Mere improvements are not fatal until these become dishonest. To declare them dishonest, the criterion is confrontation, by defense and Court itself can’t adopt said role. So, we ourselves can’t compare the contents of the FIR, with its maker evidence, we being procedural Court has to follow the settle rules of evidence. As far as 161 Cr.P.C. statements are concerned, its use is to confront the witnesses in 162 Cr.P.C. and nothing else, we ourselves can’t compare its contents with testimony of the witness.

Contradiction; It means the opposition of two ideas which are the subject of one and the same proposition. When two witnesses or other persons, state things directly opposed to each other, it amount to contradiction in their evidence. In our judicial system contradiction and confrontation are two different things. Contradiction means a conflict in the evidence of pws, if said contradictions are minor in nature and are not touching and disturbing the roots of the charge, then same are normally ignored, otherwise said situation is addressed in favor of defense. Confrontation is the move of the defense through which the testimony of the witness is checked qua his previous statement. For further clarification please see PLJ 2013 Cr.P.C 319 and 2014 Pcrlj 885. Discrepancies in the detail of the facts do not amount to contradiction. Please see PLD 2005 Peshawar 166. If discrepancies are minor in nature, then carry no weight. Please see 1995 SCMR 1793. It is added that minor contradiction are quite natural, because with the passage of time the witness cannot recollect the actual/minute detail of the occurrence and due to this minor contradiction are normally ignored.

Dishonest improvement/embellishment; Dishonest improvement means to add something in the previous statement recorded u/S. 161 Cr.P.C, to strengthen the case after seeking some legal assistance, but when the same are duly confronted and once the same found to be deliberate and dishonest, it costs serious doubts on the veracity of such witness. Please see 1993 SCMR 550. When a witness makes improvements or omissions in his deposition, he agrees to own dishonesty, which alone is sufficient to discard evidence of such dishonest witness. Please see 2019 MLD 1821. If these improvements are minor in nature. it was held in 2008 SCMR, 8, 2010 SCMR, 385, 2003 SCMR, 884, 2013 SCMR 480, and 2012 SCMR, 1869 that same would not matter.

First version, confession & defense version; These are two different terms having different consequences. First version means the statement/ version of the accused recorded by the I.O, when first time the accused appears before the I.O and the I.O records it under the head of “berderiaft”. Normally, it is based on reality. As per article 27 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 the same is admissible in evidence. As a general rule evidence not forming part of the transaction is not admissible, whereas articles 27&28 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 are exceptions to the said general principle and the facts which are relevant facts to prove the status/mind of the accused are admissible in evidence like the guilt, intent, knowledge, negligence, malice etc of the accused. Law is settled that the accused can take the copy of his first version and during cross-examination, he can bring the same on record under Article 27 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984, by putting question to the I.O. In the same way, any confession made by the accused before the police can also be brought on record under the said article,but this facility is no more available to the prosecution side and whatever the first version or confession of the accused recorded by the I.O, the prosecution cannot bring the same on record while putting the same to the I.O. Further see Section 162 and 172 Cr.P.C under which the accused cannot be restricted to cross-examine the I.O, or the Magistrate who recorded his confession and he place it on record and can use the same in his favour. Please see Liaqat Ali case reported in 1998 P.Cr.L.J 216, PLD 1974 Karachi 91 and Aslam case reported in PLD 1995 Lahore 632 and PLD 1971 SC, 751.

The statement recorded u/S. 161 Cr.PC or in the body of the police file is a relevant fact under Article 49 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984. Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984 is an independent law to other procedural laws i.e. Cr.P.C and under Article 15 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984 Court can compel the I.O, to see the police file and give correct answer and the privilege of the I.O, u/S. 172 Cr.P.C is of no avail to him due to article 15 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984.

As per settled view of the superior Courts, accused is the favorite child of law and he can take a number of pleas in his defense and is not bound to prove the same. This situation has been explained in Azhar Iqbal case, reported in 2013 SCMR 383, whereby it has been clearly opined that in case the accused admits the murder due to Ghayret or due to other general or special exceptions, then too, he cannot be convicted until, unless the prosecution proves its case independently.

Accused is so favorite child of the law that if he has not taken the plea of self-defense and the Court comes to the conclusion that the accused committed the occurrence due to self-defense, then while believing the same, benefit can be given to the accused about the said plea. Please see, 2008 YLR 1315 Umer Draz case, 2005 PCr.LJ 1689, PLD 2004 SC 244 and 2011 SCMR 45.After 18th Amendment under Article 10 (A) privilege in the shape of due process and fair trial is also given to the accused. So, in said situation Courts are bound to give full-fledged opportunity of hearing and defense to the accused except scandalous questions. If the accused put scandalous questions then he loses his status as favourite child of the Court and benefit of 382 B Cr.P.C can also be withheld.

Sometime we face the issue when any accused come under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C as his own witness and deposes on oath before the Court, then all the procedure for confrontation of previous statement provided for the prosecution /defense witnesses would be the same. Here if the prosecution side wants to confront the first version of the accused as got recorded by him before the I.O, then the Court will allow the same.

Defense version means the version taken by the defense counsel during the cross-examination at the eye-witnesses, and at the I.Os. Further the defense version is also taken in the statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C. and if the accused himself appeares as his own witness u/S. 340 Cr.P.C. then, he also takes his defence version on oath. It may be in the light of the first version as discussed above and it may be independent to that of said first version of the accused. The consequences of both the same are different to each other as discussed above.

Un-rebutted evidence; Please see the Article 113,133 and 134 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984, whereby it was explained that if the evidence is un-rebutted, then it would be admissible in evidence. Please see 2007 SCMR 1700, whereby it was held that facts asserted by one party remain un-challenged would amount to admission, so to confront and controvert the incriminating evidence is obligatory, otherwise it would be used against the opponent. Evidence of the eye-witness in the shape of examination-in-chief without cross-examination is admissible in evidence, but it remains only evidence and after cross-examination said evidence got the status of testimony which is more authentic and reliable. So un-challenged evidence can be legally taken into consideration, if it is fully corroborated/ supported by other pieces of evidence like medical evidence and recoveries etc, To believe it against the defense extra care and caution is required, because without cross-examination, it remain evidence and cannot get the status of testimony, because for that purpose cross-examination is necessary.

Evidence of an eye-witness in the form of his examination-in-chief could not be rejected on the simple proposition that he was not subjected to cross-examination, if the accused had himself avoided in a deliberate and calculated manner to avail such an opportunity. Distinction had to be drawn between these two situations, one where opportunity to cross-examination was not given or denied to a party, and second, where it was given, but deliberately not availed of by the accused. In the latter position the accused can badly suffer. If the right to cross, was reserved as per request of defense and the witness is died or not available for cross-examination, then the defense will suffer. Please see PLD 2010 SC 642 Arbab Tsleem case, PLJ 2011 SC 117 and PLJ 2018 SC453 Sadiq case.

In PLD 2001 Lahore 463 otherwise view is taken but after the views of apex Court said view will not matter.

In civil case, said situation effect otherwise. The principle that a statement or any part of statement, which remain un-rebutted amount to admission does not attract in criminal cases, because in criminal side prosecution has to prove its case on its own, beyond any shadow of doubt, but in civil cases preponderance of probabilities of the evidence of the parties matter. So question of un-rebuttal in civil matter is important, but this is not so material in criminal trial. Please see 2018 SCMR 149.

During cross-examination defense must controvert the evidence of witnesses and put his defense in the shape of suggestions to all type of witnesses like eye/recovery witness etc that you are inimical towards the accused etc and due to this you made false evidence. Only plea taken by the accused in his examination recorded under Section 342, Cr.P.C, that the case is false and has been registered under the political influence etc, is not sufficient to create doubt in the prosecution case. Please see 2008 SCMR 387.Defence counsel has to build its defense during cross-examination, because as per section 342 Cr.P.C., there is no room for the defense lawyer to make answers on behalf of the accused, if so asked by the Court under said section.

Probability and benefit of doubt; These are two different terms of law and both said terms have not been explained in any code, however these have been taken up in various judgment of superior Court. A probability is a state of things that reflects the chance or likelihood that a particular event can occur. Probabilities can be expressed in proportion like its range from 0 to 1, and these can also be expressed in percentages ranging from 0% to 100 %. While word benefit means advantage, gain or interest and doubt mean misgiving, suspicion and uncertainty etc. The accused is entitled to have, the benefit of doubt as a matter of right. Accused being a favorite child of law is to be treated as innocent unless he is proved on the basis of best possible evidence that he was connected with the commission of crime.

Blood Stained earth;It got importance in murder trial when the place of occurrence is disputed or the dead body is not verifiable due to certain reason. Police normally collect report without comparison report whether said blood was of the deceased or not. Simple report that it is human blood is not sufficient. To make sure that the deceased was murdered at the place of occurrence, the collection of comparison report of the deceased blood is necessary. In the said situation no need to cross-examine the said aspect of the case.

Scale site plan ;Scale-site plan is not necessary in all the cases, it is the discretion of the IO, to get prepare it if needed. It is not substantive piece of residence. It can be helpful to cross-examine the eye witnesses qua their location and other evidence about mode of occurance.Now in the present era when everybody has video cameras in his mobile, the I.O should prepare the video of the crime scene, but police avoid to do so and take the control of everything to prepare the police report as per their need. It is a basic evidence and if Court see, the said video, then most of the things become clear about the occurrence.

Inquest report Inquest-report/Naqsha Sorat-e-Hal/ Report Marg; These three terms are one and the same and come under section 174 Cr.P.C and police rules 25, 31-35.Inquest report means to observe the cause of death of a person and not the person who had caused the death. It is the duty of police to observe whether it was natural death or by violence or by poisoning, when police visits the place of occurrence and dead body is lying there. Police is bound to mention the cause of death. If said report does not disclose the name of the accused, then it will not matter because its basic requirement is to disclose the cause of death and not the killer. Please see PLD 2006 Peshawer 5 and NLR 1982, Cr.L.J, 452.Said report states the apparent cause of death, provide description of any mark or marks of violence which may be found on the body and describe the manner in which and the weapon or instrument with which such marks appear to have been inflicted.

Said report is signed by the police officer conducting the investigation. The plan of the scene of death and the detail of clothing, etc and a list of the articles lying with the body are mentioned in said report. In cases of death by hanging, the report shall give particulars as to the height and sufficiency of the support and the nature of the thing used to bear the weight of the body. In drowning cases the depth of the water shall be stated

Police file / Zimni /case diary and its use.Case dairy/ zimni is different to the station / general diary(roznamch). Case diaries are recorded by the I.O during the investigation of the case,on the printed pages as provided to the I.O by his department. Every page on which police diary is written got its number, so that the check on the police investigation be maintained, but police badly violates it and almost in the criminal case, the sequence of the page number is disturbed. I.O is bound to send the one carbon copy of his case diary to the DPO office,but this rules is also badly violated by the police. These are some reasons due to which the opinion of the police is always doubted.

Defence cannot claim the copies of the case diaries under Section 265 C/241, Cr.P.C. In the same way, during investigation process the accused cannot claim access to said diaries. The reason behind it is that the plan of investigation of the I.O, should not be in the knowledge of the accused. If the accused will be aware about the line of action of the I.O, then the accused can manage to disappear the incriminating evidence as the I.O wants to procure against the accused. However the statement recorded in boiled from of PWs can be given to the accused.

When police report under Section 173 Cr.P.C is placed before trial Court and trial Court take the cognizance of the case, then the concerned I.O, hand over the police file to the Naib Court of the trial Court. When 173 Cr.P.C, report submitted before trial Court and trial Court take the cognizance , then said report got the status of judicial file and it is the record of trial Court and trial judge can issue the attested copies of said report as per law.

But as far as police file is concerned, the same is not judicial or Court record. We cannot issue the copies of the same to the accused. It can only be used by the I.Os to refresh their memories and defence counsel can get use it to confront the I.O and to put the first version of the accused on Court record. Defence also can get bring on record the material which is favourable to the accused, as collected by the I.O during investigation process, but so such facility is available to the prosecution. Actually police file is the record of the public prosecutor attached with the Court.

Some time we face the issue of using the case diary in the criminal trial on the part of the defense side and if the Court deem it proper to reach at the just conclusion of the case then the Court can direct the investigation officer to look into the case diary and make the answer and the investigation officer would be bound to do so because it is the right of the defense. As per wisdom laid in section 265, Cr.P.C and further explained in 1976 SCMR 506 it is held that police diary cannot be corelated with the statements of all the witnesses recorded by the police. Further case relevant law on this point has been explained in PLD 1992 Lahore 336.It is added that the prosecution side cannot use the case diries in their favour against the defence.

Roznamcha/Station Diary General Dairy;

A diary maintained by the police to enter any significant event, incident, offence or crime etc, on day to day basis is known as police diary and It can be produced in the evidence. Reports about non-cognizable offence are also entered in said register. In addition to that all the proceedings of the I.O are given in that register. Accused cannot claim the copy of said register under Section 265-C /241 Cr.P.C. However, to confront the I.O, the said register can be summoned by the Court at short notice to the concerned police station. In criminal trial normally, we use it to check the investigation process of the I.O, because every I.O is bound to enter his departure and arrival with detail of constables accompanying him. If any thing collected by the I.O, he will enter it in the said register. I.O will also mention the arrest of the every accused in the said register. If the investigation proceeding of the I.O got no support in the said register about his departure / arrival etc with reference to the case, then prosecution will suffer. To reach at just conclusion of the case the Court under Article 140 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 can bring the entry in said register on record and it would amount to statement.

Use of modern evidence like audio or video and its legal value;

The House of Lords in case titled, Regina (Quintavalle) v. Secretary of State for Health held that the laws have to be made in the light of development in scientific knowledge and utilize it in judicial system. Our Courts of law in criminal and civil side can take judicial notice of the credible scientific development under Article 112, Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984. In the present era, we cannot ignore the relevant scientific research and development, which has already been recognized and acknowledged by the Courts in various other judicial systems. Scientific research can help and assist the Court in understanding and appreciating evidence properly and the object of natural and substantial justice can be ensured while using latest technology to collect/ appreciate the evidence. In this regard article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 is there, but to utilize modern devices properly further legislation is required because our scheme of law consider it just as expert opinion and we still prefer the direct or circumstantial evidence etc. It is held in PLD 2019 SC 196 that I.O can get record the statement of the complainant and the PW under Section 161 Cr.P.C through audio or video or any other mode of electronic media.

No audio or video tape straightaway can be relied upon by a Court until the same is proved to be genuine and not tampered with. A forensic report of audio or video tape prepared Punjab Forensic Science Agency is per se admissible in evidence under section 9(3) of said agency. Under Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 a Court can allow such type evidence to be produced in evidence in accordance with the law of evidence. Accuracy of the recording must be proved. An audio or video tape sought to be produced in evidence must be the actual record of the conversation as and when it was made or of the event as and when it took place. The person recorded the conversation or event is to be produced as witness. The audio or video tape must be played in the Court and it must be clearly audible or viewable.

The person recording the conversation or event must identify the voice of the person speaking or the person seen or the voice or person seen may be identified by any other person who recognizes such voice or person. Any other person present at the time of making of the conversation or taking place of the event may also testify in support of the conversation heard in the audio tape or the event shown in the video. Such type evidence must be relevant to the controversy and otherwise admissible. Safe custody of the audio tape or video after its preparation till production before the Court must be proved. The transcript of the audio tape or video must have been prepared under independent supervision and control. An audio tape or video produced at a late stage of a judicial proceeding may be looked at with suspicion. A formal application has to be filed before the Court by the person desiring an audio tape or video to be brought on the record of the case as evidence. Please see PLD 2019 SC 675.In PLD 2019 Supreme Court of Pakistan page 196, it is held that in the present era keeping in view the need of latest technology, the audio and video are accepted as solid evidence.

Note: When an advocate will clear qua above said terms of law, he would be in better position to cross-examine the witnesses.

Cross-examination by defense: It is added that normal concept is that the cross-examination is done only by the defense counsel, but reality is otherwise, even prosecution counsel and even trial judge can also do said job, if so required. Concept of joint cross-examination is not recognized by the law. In case where there are more than one accused, the judge while recording the cross-examination of a witness should mention the name of the accused and/or his lawyer who is cross-examining the witness. Sometime the accused engaged more than one counsel, only one lawyer is allowed to cross the witness on behalf of the accused. Cross-examination by accused himself is no substitute for cross-examination by the counsel. Please see 1993 SCMR 550. Further to conduct relevant and legal cross-examination, one should be clear about the legal terms like, facts, statements, evidence, narration, suggestion, improvements dishonest improvement, and confrontation etc. Even some lawyers are not aware about the difference amongst said terms which are quite necessary for proper cross-examination. The defense counsel normally can ask only three types of questions in cross-examination, in the form of narration, suggestions, and leading questions.

Normally, the defense counsel ask question in the form of narration and the witnesses also answers it, in the form of narration. Most of the cross-examination is in the form of narration, But some time, when the witness is telling lie, or he wants to conceal or confuse the real facts, then the defense lawyer can suggest the witnesses the actual situation. Actually, narration is the stance of the witnesses, while suggestion is the stance of the opponent party, who conduct cross-examination and during this through suggestion said party put its defense to the witnesses. So, any question which was asked in the form of narration is not so dangerous, but any suggestion made by the counsel which either answered in positive or negative can be used against the party making it to the witnesses.

Further after going through the report u/S. 173 Cr.P.C, police file, visiting of the place of occurrence, discussion of the case with the party , proper knowledge of medical jurisprudence and forensic science are also helpful in cross-examination. In murder, injury and rape cases, the knowledge of the doctors is normally very poor and during cross-examination, they can easily be knocked out by the competent defense counsel. In our judicial system normally defense lawyers conduct a lengthy cross-examination, not to assist the Court to arrive at just conclusion, but they do so for the manipulation of mistakes and sometime said practice is done just to pay the gallery.

No proper formula or procedure can be prescribed to conduct proper cross-examination, but after going through the cross-examination as conducted by some competent defense lawyers, some hints can be taken and said right is to be exercised within framework provided under articles 141 and 151 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. It is not necessary that witness should only reply the question as per wishes of the defense side, he can explain his answer as he wishes. No restriction can be imposed upon said explanation. It is the basic duty of the trial judge to ensure the prestige and dignity of the witnesses during the cross-examination and witness should not be harassed by the defense counsel. Actually, a witness comes forward in aid of justice before the Court of law. Even a man with most brilliant qualities would collapse, if he will be subjected to filthy, lengthy and irrelevant cross-examination, so Court should check such type practice.

I just refer my own judgment dated 20.09.2017 passed in case titled the state v Mohammed Arshed, sessions case No.67/S.C. of 2017 and sessions trial No.12/S.C of 2017, FIR No. 448/2017 dated 12.08.2017 u/S. 302 PPC police station Sadar Lodhran, wherein following factors were explained and these factors can be material in cros-examining to observe the availability of the eyewitnesses at the time/scene of occurrence:-

(I)      Residence, age and profession of the witness.

(II)     Routine of daily life of the witness.

(III)    Relationship of the witness with the deceased.

(IV)    Distance between the places of residence of the pws.

(V)     Distance of the place of occurrence from the residednce of the pws.

(VI)    The location of place of occurrence.

(VII)   Approaches/passages towards place of occurrence.

(i)       The distance amongst the pws, the deceased and the accused at the time of occurrence.

(ii)      Seat of the injuries and kind of weapon used by the accused.

(iii)     Position/location of the accused, the pws and the deceased, prior to the occurrence and the same during the occurrence.

(iv)     Arrival of the accused, the pws and the deceased at the place of occurrence and the ways used by them.

Sequence of cross-examination: For convenience, in criminal trial, defense counsel can divide cross-examination in certain paragraphs on the eye witness with the following sequence;

·        In first paragraph the relation of the witnesses can be asked.

•        In second paragraph delay in lodging FIR can be checked.

•        In third paragraph mode of occurrence and the credibility of the witnesses at the time/place can be crossed in a few mini paragraphs.

•        In fourth paragraph ocular account can be confronted with medical evidence.

•        In fifth paragraph motive can be checked.

•        In sixth paragraph recovery witnesses can be crossed, if the eye witnesses are also the recovery witnesses.

•        In seventh paragraph defense version can be put at eye witness

•        Sometime defense lawyers put their case in the beginning and it makes the thing complicated. So, the better option is to put the case of the defense at the end of the cross-examination at the complainant and the eyewitness, so that any development come into cross-examination can easily be covered up / used in defense version.

Settled principle of cross-examination.

If one aspect of the case is admitted by one eye witness, then no need to seek further clarification from other pws, because it’s the prosecution which has to prove and clarify its case. The job of the defense is just to create doubt. Further, if a witness gives some favorable answers, then never seek further clarification of said issue from the said pw, because normally, PW recollects his memory and clarifies the situation as already stated in favor of defense. Some time prosecution counsel makes undue interferes and tries to complicate/explain the situation and during this the witness clarifies the situation. So after seeking favorable answer change the topic and ask other question and if further clarification is needed in the favorable answer, then change the form of the question and then ask at reasonable occasion. Some time it happens that due to the wrong suggestions and questions of defense counsel the defense suffer a lot. Defense cannot get away with his suggestion and questions. So, the defense counsel is clear in mind to put questions and specially suggestions during cross-examination. The better option is that always put questions in the shape of narrations and at the end the defense version can be put in the shape of suggestions to the eye witness.

I have seen a number of times that lengthy cross-examination not only damages the defense, but some time, it becomes helpful to clarify the facts of the case which was inadvertently left by pws. It is not necessary to rebut each and every aspect of the evidence, because some evidence is produced without any relevancy. So, it is the duty of the defense to cross-examine and controvert the evidence which can be used against the defense. It is obligatory for the defense lawyers to prepare their line of cross-examination in the light of their defense, if defense is going to admit the killing while taking self-defense, like grave and sudden provocation etc, then most of the prosecution case like place/time of occurrence, identity of the accused, deceased and cause of death etc, are not required to be cross-examined in detail and in such type of situation, the stress of cross-examination should be on the mode of occurrence and the other aspects which can prove the defense version. In such type situation normally motive, medical evidence and mode of occurrence can be explained in the light of the defense. In most of the cases the comparison report of crime empties is not procured rather some time crime empties are not taken into possession by the I.O. In such a situation said recovery is totally inconsequential and cannot be used as an incriminating piece of evidence against the accused, but some time even senior defense lawyers make lengthy cross-examination on that issue. In my humble, it is totally useless practice.

Sometime place of occurrence is not disputed, but in spite of this, defense counsel cross-examine draftsman up to a number of pages. Sometime irrelevant question are asked from formal witnesses. Said witnesses are not bound to answer such type irrelevant questions. Some questions are normally asked from the pws who identify the dead body. Mostly, they are close relatives of the deceased and they give evidence only to the identification of the dead body. Their examination-in-chief is pertaining to a few lines and defense Court asks from them the time of occurrence, name of the accused and detail of mode of occurrence. If said Pw gives some answers which can favor the defense qua remaining facts.

Nos.2147-B, 2149-B, 2150-B, 2151-B, 2153-B, 2155-B, 2152B and 2148-B of 2025, whereby post-arrest bail was refused to him in case FIR Nos. 852, 768, 1570, 103, 109, 1271, 108 and 96 registered at different Police Stations Race Course, Shadman, Mughalpura, Sarwar Road and Gulberg of District Lahore on 10.05.2023, 11.05.2023, 12.05.2023 and 13.05.2023 (‘FIRs’) in respect of offences under sections 302, 324, 395, 436, 452, 440, 427, 353, 354, 391, 186, 290, 291, 153, 152, 148, 149, 147, 109, 505, 506-B, 120, 120-B, 225-B, 337-F(i), 337-L(ii), 337-A(i), 337F(v), 337-A(iii), 336, 449, 153-A, 153-B, 146, 131, 121-A, 121, 188, 201 and 34 PPC read with section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, section 16 of the Punjab Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960 and section 11-B of Arms Ordinance, 1965.

 2. We have heard the learned counsel for both the parties. 

3. The main thrust of the prosecution revolves around the allegation that the petitioner hatched a conspiracy for the commission of the offences mentioned in the FIRs. To this end, the learned Special Prosecutor drew the attention of the Court to the ocular statements of three witnesses, as well as electronic media, and argued that these clearly implicate the petitioner and connect him with the commission of the alleged offences.

  4. When confronted with the grant of bail rendered by this Court to Mr. Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, Mr. Imtiaz Mehmood, and Mr. Hafiz Farhat Abbas, who were linked to the same occurrence and charged similarly to the present petitioner, the learned Special Prosecutor responded that the case of the present petitioner was clearly distinguishable and, therefore, the principle of consistency would not apply in the instant bail matters. 

5. Further, when the learned Special Prosecutor was confronted with the definite findings regarding the merits of the case recorded in the impugned order refusing bail to the present petitioner, he explained that it is by now settled that the findings so recorded in a bail granting order are tentative in nature, to be restricted only to the proceedings of bail and are not considered during the trial of an accused.

 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner, in rebuttal, vehemently opposed the contentions raised by the learned Special Prosecutor. In particular, he emphasized that the principle of consistency had to be applied in favour of the petitioner, as all three accused, namely, Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, Imtiaz Mahmood, and Hafiz Farhat Abbas, were charged with alleged criminal conspiracy, and thus the case of the petitioner would surely fall within the domain of parity, which had to be positively considered in favour of the present petitioner. He further explained that the cases of the present petitioner were on a better footing, in particular, than that of Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, who had been granted bail by this Court. He pointed out that in the case of Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhry, the investigation had been completed and the trial had commenced, whereas in the case of the present petitioner those stages had not yet been reached, and thus, his entitlement to bail is comparatively stronger.

   7.  This Court has noted that the definite findings recorded by the learned High Court in the impugned order, which go to the very root of the contested claims of the parties. However, without passing any findings on the legality and veracity of the said findings, our concern at this stage is confined only to the fact that such findings have been recorded at the stage of bail. 

8. Lest this Court pass any findings on the merits of the case which may prejudice either party at trial, it is sufficient to state that the material brought on record regarding the alleged criminal conspiracy attributed to the petitioner requires scrutiny, and the same would be best adjudged after recording pro and contra evidence during the trial. In addition thereto, the case of the petitioner has to be positively considered in view of the principle of consistency, as others similarly placed have been granted bail by this Court. 

 9. In view of the above, these petitions are converted into appeals and allowed. The petitioner is granted post-arrest bail in the above mentioned cases, subject to his furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs.100,000/- with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court in each case.

ملک شہزاد احمد خان، جج۔ سپریم کورٹ 
فیصلہ ۔۔۔۔
 درخواست گزار کے خلاف ایڈیشنل سیشن جج، کلور کوٹ کے روبرو مقدمہ چلایا گیا، جو ایف آئی آر نمبر 293 مؤرخہ 06.10.2015 کے تحت دفعہ 376 تعزیراتِ پاکستان (PPC) پولیس اسٹیشن جندان والا، ضلع بھکر میں درج ہوئی۔ ٹرائل کورٹ نے اپنے فیصلہ مؤرخہ 20.07.2017 کے ذریعے درخواست گزار کو دفعہ 376 PPC کے تحت مجرم قرار دیتے ہوئے 20 سال قیدِ بامشقت کی سزا سنائی۔ مزید برآں، اسے مدعیہ مسماۃ فرحت بی بی کو بطور معاوضہ 5,00,000 روپے ادا کرنے کا حکم دیا گیا، بصورتِ عدم ادائیگی مزید چھ ماہ قیدِ سادہ بھگتنا ہوگی۔ درخواست گزار کو دفعہ 382-B ضابطہ فوجداری کا فائدہ بھی دیا گیا۔ ہائی کورٹ نے درخواست گزار کی اپیل خارج کرتے ہوئے ٹرائل کورٹ کے فیصلے کو برقرار رکھا۔

2۔ دلائل سنے گئے۔ ریکارڈ کا جائزہ لیا گیا۔

3۔ ایف آئی آر کے مطابق، مدعیہ مسماۃ فرحت بی بی نے الزام لگایا کہ ایف آئی آر کے اندراج سے تقریباً سات ماہ قبل صبح 5:30 بجے وہ قضائے حاجت کے لیے اپنے گھر کے قریب واقع جنگل کی طرف گئی۔ درخواست گزار پہلے سے مذکورہ جنگل میں چھپا ہوا تھا، جس نے اسے زبردستی قابو میں لے کر پستول کے زور پر اس کے ساتھ زیادتی کی، جس پر یہ مقدمہ درج ہوا۔

4۔ درخواست گزار کے وکیل اور سرکاری وکیل کے تفصیلی دلائل سننے کے بعد یہ بات سامنے آئی کہ ڈی این اے ٹیسٹ کے مطابق درخواست گزار کو بچے کا حیاتیاتی باپ ہونے سے خارج نہیں کیا جا سکتا، جو مبینہ طور پر درخواست گزار کے فعل کے نتیجے میں پیدا ہوا۔ تاہم، اس عدالت کے سامنے بنیادی سوال یہ ہے کہ آیا یہ دفعہ 376 PPC کے تحت قابلِ سزا زیادتی (ریپ) کا مقدمہ ہے یا رضامندی کے ساتھ زنا (فورنیکیشن) کا، جو دفعہ 496-B PPC کے تحت قابلِ سزا ہے۔

5۔ یہ بات قابلِ ذکر ہے کہ وقوعہ ایف آئی آر کے اندراج سے سات ماہ قبل پیش آیا۔ مدعیہ نے دعویٰ کیا کہ وقوعہ کے دن صبح 5:30 بجے وہ اپنے گھر کے قریب واقع جنگل میں قضائے حاجت کے لیے گئی، جہاں درخواست گزار پہلے سے چھپا ہوا تھا اور اس نے پستول کے زور پر زبردستی زیادتی کی۔ یہ بات سمجھ سے بالاتر ہے کہ درخواست گزار کو کیسے معلوم تھا کہ مدعیہ اسی دن اور اسی وقت جنگل آئے گی۔ اس حوالے سے استغاثہ کا مؤقف خاموش ہے۔ مزید یہ کہ وقوعہ کے وقت مدعیہ کی جانب سے کوئی مزاحمت ظاہر نہیں کی گئی۔ میڈیکل آفیسر نے مبینہ متاثرہ کے پورے جسم پر تشدد کے کسی بھرے ہوئے نشان کا ذکر نہیں کیا۔ حتیٰ کہ مبینہ متاثرہ کے کپڑے بھی پولیس یا ٹرائل کورٹ کے سامنے پیش نہیں کیے گئے کہ یہ ثابت ہو سکے کہ وہ وقوعہ کے وقت پھٹے ہوئے تھے۔ اس سے ظاہر ہوتا ہے کہ مبینہ متاثرہ نے کوئی مزاحمت نہیں کی۔ استغاثہ کے شواہد کے مطابق وقوعہ مدعیہ کے گھر کے قریب، یعنی رہائشی علاقے میں پیش آیا، مگر مدعیہ نے کسی قسم کی چیخ و پکار نہیں کی تاکہ علاقے کے لوگ مدد کو آتے۔ یہ بھی قابلِ ذکر ہے کہ وقوعہ کے بعد مبینہ متاثرہ اپنے گھر واپس آئی جہاں اس کا بھائی اور دیگر اہلِ خانہ موجود تھے، مگر وہ تقریباً سات ماہ تک خاموش رہی۔ مدعیہ کی سات ماہ کی طویل خاموشی اس کے طرزِ عمل کے خلاف بہت کچھ بیان کرتی ہے، لہٰذا سات ماہ کی تاخیر سے زبردستی زیادتی کی کہانی پر اندھا اعتماد نہیں کیا جا سکتا۔ یہ درست ہے کہ درخواست گزار کی نشاندہی پر ایک پستول برآمد ہوا، مگر وہ پستول وقوعہ کے دوران استعمال نہیں ہوا۔ پستول ایک رہائشی گھر سے برآمد کیا گیا اور برآمدگی کے وقت علاقے کے کسی گواہ کو شامل نہیں کیا گیا، جو دفعہ 103 ضابطہ فوجداری کی خلاف ورزی ہے؛ لہٰذا اس برآمدگی پر انحصار نہیں کیا جا سکتا۔

درخواست گزار کے وکیل نے زور دے کر دلیل دی کہ اس مقدمہ کی ڈی این اے رپورٹ قابلِ اعتماد نہیں۔ ان کا مؤقف ہے کہ وقوعہ مبینہ طور پر ایف آئی آر کے اندراج سے سات ماہ قبل پیش آیا، اور درخواست گزار اور نابالغ بچے کے بکل سوابز بالترتیب 30.11.2015 اور 22.12.2015 کو لیے گئے، مگر ڈی این اے رپورٹ کے مطابق ان سوابز کا فرانزک سائنس لیبارٹری میں تجزیہ 19.05.2017 کو کیا گیا، یعنی سوابز لینے کے تقریباً ڈیڑھ سال بعد۔ انہوں نے انٹرنیشنل جرنل آف فارماسیوٹیکل سائنسز میں شائع شدہ ایک تحقیقی مقالے کا حوالہ دیا، جس کے مطابق بکل سوابز دو ہفتوں کے اندر تحلیل ہو جاتے ہیں، لہٰذا مذکورہ ڈی این اے رپورٹ کی صحت پر سنجیدہ سوال اٹھتا ہے۔ تاہم، ہم اس مرحلے پر ان دلائل کے حسن و قبح اور ڈی این اے رپورٹ کی صحت پر تبصرہ نہیں کریں گے، کیونکہ یہ مسئلہ کسی اور مقدمہ میں طے کیا جائے گا۔

ہم اس نتیجے پر پہنچے ہیں کہ بہرکیف، مدعیہ کے بیان اور ڈاکٹر رقیہ عاصم (PW-6) کی میڈیکل شہادت سے جنسی تعلق کا الزام ثابت ہوتا ہے۔ تاہم، مذکورہ تمام حقائق سے ظاہر ہوتا ہے کہ یہ زبردستی زیادتی کا مقدمہ نہیں تھا۔ جیسا کہ پہلے بیان کیا گیا، مدعیہ کی گواہی اس حد تک کہ درخواست گزار نے اس کے ساتھ ناجائز جنسی تعلق قائم کیا، ثابت ہو چکی ہے۔ جرح کے دوران اس حد تک اس کی گواہی متزلزل نہیں ہوئی اور قابلِ اعتماد ہے۔ استغاثہ کا یہ پہلو ڈاکٹر رقیہ عاصم (PW-6) کی میڈیکل شہادت سے بھی تقویت پاتا ہے، جنہوں نے بیان کیا کہ مدعیہ کی اندام نہانی میں بآسانی دو انگلیاں داخل ہو سکتی تھیں۔ لہٰذا ہم اس نتیجے پر پہنچتے ہیں کہ استغاثہ نے درخواست گزار کے خلاف رضامندی کے ساتھ زنا (فورنیکیشن) کا جرم، جو دفعہ 496-B PPC کے تحت قابلِ سزا ہے، شک و شبہ سے بالاتر ثابت کر دیا ہے۔ تمام شواہد کے جائزے کے بعد ہم اس ناقابلِ تردید نتیجے پر پہنچے ہیں کہ یہ دفعہ 376 PPC کے تحت زیادتی کا مقدمہ نہیں، بلکہ رضامندی کے ساتھ زنا، یعنی دفعہ 496-B PPC کے تحت قابلِ سزا جرم ہے۔

ہم اس حقیقت سے آگاہ ہیں کہ اگر اسے دفعہ 496-B PPC کے تحت رضامندی کے ساتھ زنا کا مقدمہ قرار دیا جائے تو مدعیہ مسماۃ فرحت بی بی بھی اسی جرم میں قابلِ گرفت ہوتی ہے، مگر چونکہ پولیس نے اسے چالان نہیں کیا اور ٹرائل کورٹ نے اس کے خلاف دفعہ 496-B PPC کے تحت کوئی فردِ جرم عائد نہیں کی، اس لیے اسے اپنے دفاع کا موقع نہیں ملا۔ لہٰذا اس مرحلے پر اسے دفاع کا موقع دیے بغیر سزا دینا مناسب نہیں ہوگا۔

یہ درست ہے کہ درخواست گزار پر دفعہ 496-B PPC کے تحت فردِ جرم عائد نہیں کی گئی تھی، مگر یہ اصول مسلمہ ہے کہ اگر کسی بڑے جرم کی فردِ جرم عائد کی گئی ہو اور شواہد سے کوئی کم تر جرم ثابت ہو جائے تو ملزم کو اس کم تر جرم میں سزا دی جا سکتی ہے، جیسا کہ دفعہ 238(2) ضابطہ فوجداری میں درج ہے۔ اس ضمن میں مقدمہ محمد شریف بنام ریاست (2006 SCMR 1170) کا حوالہ دیا جا سکتا ہے، جہاں دفعہ 10(3) حدود آرڈیننس 1979 کے تحت فردِ جرم تھی، مگر شواہد سے رضامندی کے ساتھ زنا (دفعہ 10(2)) ثابت ہوا اور اسی کے تحت سزا دی گئی۔ یہ بھی قابلِ ذکر ہے کہ حدود آرڈیننس 1979 کی دفعہ 10(2) کو خواتین کے تحفظ کے قانون (ترمیم) ایکٹ 2006 کے تحت ختم کر کے اس کی جگہ دفعہ 496-B PPC متعارف کرائی گئی۔ اسی طرح اعجاز احمد بنام ریاست (2010 SCMR 141)، امیر محمد بنام ریاست (2007 SCMR 452) اور محمد شبیر بنام ریاست (1992 SCMR 2063) میں بھی ملزمان کو زیادتی کے بجائے رضامندی کے ساتھ زنا کے جرم میں سزا دی گئی۔

6۔ مذکورہ بالا وجوہات کی بنا پر، دو کے مقابلے میں ایک کی اکثریت سے (جسٹس صلاح الدین پنہور کی اختلافی رائے کے ساتھ) اس درخواست کو اپیل میں تبدیل کیا جاتا ہے اور جزوی طور پر منظور کیا جاتا ہے۔ متنازعہ فیصلہ اس حد تک ترمیم کیا جاتا ہے کہ درخواست گزار/اپیل کنندہ کی دفعہ 376 PPC کے تحت سزا اور سزا کالعدم قرار دے کر اسے اس الزام سے بری کیا جاتا ہے، اور اس کے بجائے اسے دفعہ 496-B PPC کے تحت مجرم قرار دیتے ہوئے 5 سال قیدِ بامشقت اور 10,000 روپے جرمانہ، بصورتِ عدم ادائیگی مزید 2 ماہ قیدِ سادہ کی سزا سنائی جاتی ہے۔

7۔ جسٹس صلاح الدین پنہور کی رائے (اختلافی) — وجوہات کے ساتھ۔
قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 
Criminal Petition No. 90-L/2019
(Rape converted into Fornication)

 مقدمہ کا مرکزی قانونی سوال (Core Legal Issue)
اس فیصلے میں سپریم کورٹ کے سامنے بنیادی سوال یہ تھا:

کیا ثابت شدہ جنسی تعلق "زبردستی زیادتی 
(Rape)" ہے یا "رضامندی کے ساتھ زنا 
(Fornication)"؟

یہی وہ نکتہ ہے جس پر پورا فیصلہ گھومتا ہے۔

 دفعہ 376 PPC 
زیادتی (Rape)
 Bare Act 
Section 376 PPC
Whoever commits rape shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term not less than ten years and not more than twenty-five years…

جو کوئی زبردستی عورت کے ساتھ جنسی فعل کرے گا، وہ سزائے موت، عمر قید یا کم از کم دس سال سے پچیس سال تک قیدِ بامشقت کا مستوجب ہوگا۔

 قانونی تقاضے 
(Essential Ingredients)
ریپ ثابت کرنے کے لیے لازم ہے

عدم رضامندی (Without consent)

زبردستی / جبر / خوف

مزاحمت یا اس کے آثار

فوری ردِعمل (Prompt reporting)

 عدالت نے دفعہ 376 کیوں لاگو نہیں کی؟
عدالت نے مندرجہ ذیل اہم قانونی کمزوریاں نوٹ کیں
 (الف) 7 ماہ کی غیر معمولی تاخیر
ایف آئی آر 7 ماہ بعد درج ہوئی

نہ کوئی معقول وضاحت

سپریم کورٹ کے مطابق:

Unexplained delay corrodes the credibility of prosecution.

 (ب) مزاحمت کا فقدان
کوئی جسمانی زخم نہیں

کپڑے پیش نہیں کیے گئے

چیخ و پکار نہیں

رہائشی علاقے میں وقوعہ، مگر کوئی گواہ نہیں

 (ج) وقوعہ کا غیر فطری بیانیہ
ملزم کو پہلے سے کیسے علم تھا کہ خاتون 5:30 صبح جنگل آئے گی؟

استغاثہ خاموش

 قانونی نتیجہ
یہ عوامل زبردستی ریپ کے تصور کو کمزور کرتے ہیں۔

 دفعہ 496-B PPC 
 رضامندی کے ساتھ زنا 
(Fornication)
Bare act
Section 496-B PPC
Whoever commits fornication shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to five years and fine.

جو کوئی رضامندی کے ساتھ ناجائز جنسی تعلق قائم کرے گا، وہ پانچ سال تک قید اور جرمانے کا مستوجب ہوگا۔

 عدالت کا استدلال
جنسی تعلق ثابت

مگر زبردستی ثابت نہیں

لہٰذا جرم کی نوعیت بدل گئی

 یہ
 Criminal Law
 کا بنیادی اصول ہے

Nature of offence depends on evidence, not on allegation.

 میڈیکل شہادت کا کردار
 ڈاکٹر رقیہ عاصم (PW-6)
Two fingers test

زخموں کی عدم موجودگی

 عدالت نے واضح کیا

میڈیکل شہادت ریپ ثابت کرنے کے لیے تنہا کافی نہیں اگر دیگر شواہد متضاد ہوں۔

 DNA Evidence 
 کیوں فیصلہ کن نہیں؟
عدالت نے دانستہ طور پر DNA رپورٹ پر فیصلہ بنیاد نہیں بنایا کیونکہ:

Swabs 1.5 سال بعد examine ہوئے

سائنسی سوالات موجود

عدالت نے کہا

This issue shall be decided in some other case.

 مگر عدالت نے یہ بھی کہا

جنسی تعلق DNA کے بغیر بھی ثابت ہو چکا ہے۔

 دفعہ 238(2) Cr.P.C 
Lesser Offence
 Bare Act 
Section 238(2) Cr.P.C.
When a person is charged with an offence and facts are proved which reduce it to a minor offence, he may be convicted of the minor offence…

اگر کسی بڑے جرم کی فردِ جرم عائد ہو اور شواہد سے کم تر جرم ثابت ہو جائے تو ملزم کو اس کم تر جرم میں سزا دی جا سکتی ہے۔

 اسی بنیاد پر

376 PPC → 496-B PPC

 حوالہ شدہ سپریم کورٹ نظائر
 (Case Law)
 Muhammad Sharif v. State (2006 SCMR 1170)
ریپ کا الزام

شواہد سے رضامندی ثابت

سزا کم تر جرم میں

 اصول
Charge irrelevant if evidence proves lesser offence.

Ijaz Ahmed v. State (2010 SCMR 141)
 Amir Muhammad v. State (2007 SCMR 452)
 Muhammad Shabbir v. State (1992 SCMR 2063)
ان تمام فیصلوں میں

ریپ کے الزامات

مگر عدالت نے consent ثابت ہونے پر

سزا کو zina with consent میں تبدیل کیا

 متاثرہ عورت کو سزا کیوں نہیں دی گئی؟
عدالت نے واضح کیا:

خاتون challaned نہیں

فردِ جرم عائد نہیں ہوئی

دفاع کا حق نہیں ملا

 اصول

No punishment without charge and opportunity of defence.

 ا
ختلافی نوٹ (Dissenting Opinion)
جسٹس صلاح الدین پنہور نے اختلاف کیا
(وجوہات الگ بیان کی گئیں)

 یہ ظاہر کرتا ہے کہ معاملہ قانونی طور پر متنازع تھا، محض جذباتی نہیں۔

 تعلیمی خلاصہ براۓ طالب علم 
(For Law Students)
 اس فیصلے سے سیکھنے کے بنیادی نکات
Delay + Conduct = Credibility

Consent changes the entire offence

Charge ≠ Conviction

Lesser offence doctrine (238(2))

Medical & DNA evidence are corroborative, not conclusive

Criminal law punishes act proved, not allegation made

 نتیجاً ،مختصراً ۔۔۔۔
(Conclusion)
یہ فیصلہ

ریپ کے تصور کو قانونی معیار پر پرکھتا ہے

اخلاقی یا جذباتی بنیاد پر نہیں

Evidence-based criminal justice کی مثال ہے

“Every immoral act is not rape;
but every rape must be proved beyond doubt.”

فیصلہ 
پنجاب تحفظِ ملکیتِ غیر منقولہ جائیداد آرڈیننس، 2025 کے تحت
ڈسپیوٹ ریزولوشن کمیٹی (DRC) کو قبضہ واپس کرانے، بے دخلی کرنے یا کسی کو زبردستی بے دخل کرنے کا کوئی قانونی اختیار حاصل نہیں ہے۔

ڈسپیوٹ ریزولوشن کمیٹی ایک ابتدائی (pre-adjudicatory)، حقائق معلوم کرنے اور سہولت فراہم کرنے والا ادارہ ہے، جسے نہ تو بے دخلی کا حکم دینے کا اختیار ہے، نہ کسی کو جائیداد سے بے دخل کرنے کا، اور نہ ہی قبضہ بحال کرانے کا۔

قبضے سے متعلق جبر یا نفاذی (coercive/executory) اقدامات صرف اور صرف ٹربیونل ہی آرڈیننس کی دفعہ 16 اور 17 کے تحت کر سکتا ہے۔

دفعہ 9 کے تحت دیے گئے احتیاطی (preventive) اختیارات محدود اور عارضی نوعیت کے ہیں، اور ان کا استعمال بھی فریقین کو سننے کے بعد تحریری اور معقول وجوہات پر مبنی حکم کے ذریعے ہی کیا جا سکتا ہے۔

دفعہ 9 کے تحت اختیارات استعمال کرتے ہوئے، ڈی آر سی پر لازم ہے کہ وہ کسی مجاز عدالت کے جاری کردہ اسٹیٹس کو (status quo) حکم کی مکمل پابندی کرے، اور اس کے منافی کوئی احتیاطی حکم صادر نہ کرے۔

ڈی آر سی یا اس کے کسی رکن کی طرف سے دیا گیا کوئی زبانی، جبر پر مبنی یا نفاذی حکم قانونی اختیار سے عاری ہے اور اصولِ انصاف (due process of law) کی صریح خلاف ورزی کے مترادف ہے۔

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
“ڈسپیوٹ ریزولوشن کمیٹی کے اختیارات کی حدود، قبضہ سے متعلق نفاذی اختیار صرف ٹربیونل کا دائرہ کار
 آرڈیننس 2025 کی آئینی و قانونی تشریح”

1. مقدمے کا پس منظر
 (Factual Matrix)
اس آئینی درخواست میں بنیادی سوال یہ تھا کہ آیا ڈسپیوٹ ریزولوشن کمیٹی (DRC) کو پنجاب تحفظِ ملکیتِ غیر منقولہ جائیداد آرڈیننس، 2025 کے تحت

قبضہ واپس کرانے،

کسی شخص کو بے دخل کرنے، یا

کسی فریق کے حق میں قبضہ بحال کرنے

کا اختیار حاصل ہے یا نہیں۔

عدالت کے سامنے یہ معاملہ بھی آیا کہ 
DRC
 کی جانب سے زبانی اور جبر پر مبنی ہدایات دی گئیں جو عملاً نفاذی نوعیت کی تھیں۔

2. بنیادی قانونی سوالات 
(Key Legal Questions)
کیا
 DRC
 کو قبضہ سے متعلق نفاذی
 (executory/coercive)
 احکامات جاری کرنے کا اختیار ہے؟

دفعہ 9 کے تحت 
DRC 
کے احتیاطی اختیارات کی نوعیت اور حدود کیا ہیں؟

کیا 
DRC
 عدالت کے جاری کردہ status quo حکم کے برخلاف کوئی حکم دے سکتی ہے؟

زبانی احکامات اور انتظامی دباؤ کی آئینی حیثیت کیا ہے؟

3. DRC
 کی قانونی حیثیت
 (Nature & Status of DRC)
عدالت نے واضح طور پر قرار دیا کہ:

DRC 
ایک 
pre-adjudicatory
 اور
 fact-finding
 فورم ہے۔

اس کا مطلب
یہ عدالت نہیں

یہ ٹربیونل نہیں

یہ حتمی فیصلے کرنے والا ادارہ نہیں

بلکہ اس کا کردار:

ابتدائی حقائق معلوم کرنا

فریقین کے درمیان سہولت کاری

شکایات کو منظم انداز میں آگے بڑھانا

4. قبضہ سے متعلق اختیارات 
صرف ٹربیونل کا دائرہ
دفعہ 16 اور 17 کی تشریح
عدالت نے دوٹوک انداز میں کہا کہ:

قبضہ کی بحالی

بے دخلی

جبر یا نفاذی کارروائی

صرف اور صرف ٹربیونل کر سکتا ہے، جو کہ:

شواہد ریکارڈ کرتا ہے

فریقین کو سنا جاتا ہے

باقاعدہ عدالتی طریقہ کار اپناتا ہے

DRC
 کا اس مرحلے میں کوئی کردار نہیں۔

5.
 دفعہ 9 
 احتیاطی اختیارات کی حدود
عدالت نے دفعہ 9 کی نہایت اہم تشریح کی

(a) اختیارات کی نوعیت
احتیاطی

عارضی

محدود

(b) لازمی شرائط
تحریری حکم

وجوہات درج ہونا

فریقین کو سننا

(c) اہم پابندی
کوئی بھی احتیاطی حکم قبضہ کی تبدیلی یا نفاذی اثر نہیں رکھ سکتا۔

6. Status Quo کے احکامات کی پابندی
عدالت نے آئینی اصول دہرایا کہ

جب کسی مجاز عدالت کا
 status quo 
حکم موجود ہو

تو کوئی انتظامی یا نیم عدالتی فورم

اس کے منافی حکم نہیں دے سکتا

DRC 
کو اس معاملے میں سختی سے پابند قرار دیا گیا۔

7. زبانی اور جبر پر مبنی احکامات 
 
قانونی حیثیت
عدالت کا نہایت سخت مؤقف

کوئی بھی oral direction،
کوئی بھی coercive pressure،
کوئی بھی executory ہدایت
اگر تحریری، وجہ دار اور قانونی اختیار کے بغیر ہو
تو وہ قانونی اختیار سے عاری (without lawful authority) ہے۔

یہ عمل

آرٹیکل 4 (due process)

آرٹیکل 10-A (fair trial)

کی صریح خلاف ورزی ہے۔

8. آئینی اور قانونی اصول 
(Principles of Law)
(i) Due Process of Law
کوئی بھی شخص:

بغیر سنے

بغیر تحریری حکم

بغیر مجاز فورم

قبضہ سے محروم نہیں کیا جا سکتا۔

(ii) Separation of Powers
انتظامی ادارہ عدالتی اختیارات استعمال نہیں کر سکتا۔

(iii) Jurisdictional Excess
جب کوئی فورم اپنے دائرہ اختیار سے تجاوز کرے تو اس کا حکم void ab initio ہوتا ہے۔

9. عملی قانونی رہنمائی
 (For Practicing Lawyers)
اگر DRC قبضہ واپس کرانے کا حکم دے
فوراً آئینی درخواست دائر کریں

دفعہ 9، 16، 17 کی غلط تشریح کو چیلنج کریں

WP.15267-25 (2025 LHC 7739) بطور binding precedent 
پیش کریں

اگر زبانی دباؤ ہو
تحریری کارروائی کا مطالبہ کریں

عدالتی تحفظ حاصل کریں

10. نتیجاً مختصراً ۔۔۔۔
عدالت عالیہ لاہور نے اس فیصلے کے ذریعے:

 DRC کے اختیارات کی واضح حد بندی کر دی
 قبضہ سے متعلق نفاذی اختیارات صرف ٹربیونل تک محدود کر دیے
 انتظامی تجاوزات کا دروازہ بند کر دیا
 شہریوں کے آئینی حقِ ملکیت اور

[12/23/25, 4:14:12 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The failure of the prosecution to produce the relevant Daily Diary entry showing the departure of the police party to the alleged place of occurrence gives rise to a legitimate inference that the police party did not, in fact, proceed to the spot and that the entire proceedings may have been conducted within the premises of the police station. Moreover, no documentary evidence has been brought on record by the Seizing Officer or any other prosecution witness to establish the ownership of the motorcycle allegedly used in the commission of the offence, nor has any credible proof been presented to demonstrate that the premises from which the subsequent recovery was made belonged to or was in the exclusive possess10n and control of the petitioner-convict. Moreover, none of the prosecution witnesses have offered any explanation, much less plausible one, as to why the proceedings, mandatorily required to be conducted at the place of recovery, were not carried out at the initial spot where the petitioner was allegedly apprehended. This glaring omission renders the prosecution's case from its very inception highly doubtful. It is a wellestablished principle of criminal jurisprudence that where the law prescribes a specific procedure, the same must be strictly adhered to. Any deviation therefrom renders the subsequent proceedings legally questionable. This principle assumes even greater significance m cases arising under special enactments such as the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, which not only provide for stringent procedural safeguards but also prescribe severe penal consequences. In such matters, the burden upon the prosecution is heightened, and the requirement of producing unimpeachable, credible, and legally admissible evidence becomes all the more stringent to bring home the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. 

Prior to the exhibition of the allegedly recovered crushed poppy straw/ opium, the same was destroyed on 19.06.2008 without issuance of any notice to the petitioner-convict., Such omission constitutes a grave violation of the cardinal principle of natural justice, namely, audi alteram partem, that no person shall be condemned unheard. The issuance of notice prior to the destruction of case property is not a mere formality but an essential requirement of law. 
 The petitioner-convict was thus deprived of his valuable right to inspect and examine the case property at the time of trial, and to raise objections pertaining to, inter alia, the weight of the narcotic substance, the number and nature parcels, the seals affixed thereon, the question of lawful possession, or to make a request for sending the entire recovered substance for chemical analysis. All such objections could have been raised had the property been produced before the learned Trial Court, or had notice been issued prior to its destruction. It is a settled principle of law that where the Court, of its own motion or otherwise, deems it necessary to destroy case property, it must, before passing such an order, ensure issuance of notice to both the accused and the prosecution. Only after hearing their respective contentions and objections, if any, may a just and legal order for destruction be passed. The requirement to hear the parties before passing an adverse order is a fundamental tenet of natural justice, which, unless expressly excluded by statutory language, must be read into every statute.

[12/23/25, 4:14:13 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: *VVip informative latest judgment of Supreme Court*

*False FIR under Section 182 PPC — Scope of Sections 173, 190 & 195 CrPC اور سپریم کورٹ آف پاکستان کا تجزیاتی فیصلہ"*



PRESENT: Mr. Justice Irfan Saadat Khan Mr. Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi Cr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 (Against order dated 29.5.2025, in Criminal Misc. Application.No.655/2024, passed by Single Judge High Court of Sindh, Karachi)

فیصلہ کا خلاصہ یہ ہے کہ دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان کے تحت کسی عدالت کو اس وقت تک کسی جرم کا نوٹس لینے کا اختیار نہیں ہے جب تک کہ متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم یا اس کا اعلیٰ افسر تحریری شکایت درج نہ کرے۔ اس سلسلے میں عدالتِ عالیہ کے مقدمہ عبدالرحمٰن بنام ریاست (1968 P Cr. L J 215) پر انحصار کیا جا سکتا ہے۔ مزید براں، بھارتی عدالتِ عظمیٰ کے مقدمات سلونی اروڑہ بنام ریاست دہلی (AIR 2017 SC 391) اور دولت رام بنام ریاست پنجاب (1962 AIR 28) بھی حوالہ کے طور پر دیے جا سکتے ہیں۔ دی گئی صورتحال میں صرف متعلقہ پولیس افسر کی تحریری شکایت پر مجسٹریٹ کارروائی کر سکتا تھا، جبکہ مجسٹریٹ یا ایکس آفیسیو جسٹس آف پیس کے پاس اس ضمن میں شکایت درج کرنے یا ہدایت جاری کرنے کا کوئی اختیار نہیں تھا۔

زیر نظر کیس میں یہ بات سامنے آئی کہ نہ تو تفتیشی افسر (I.O) نے یہ رائے دی کہ شکایت کنندہ کی اطلاع جھوٹی تھی اور نہ ہی دفعہ 173 ض فوجداری کے تحت مقدمہ ’’بی کلاس‘‘ میں خارج کرنے کے لیے مجسٹریٹ کے سامنے رپورٹ پیش کی، بلکہ ’’سی کلاس‘‘ میں خارج کرنے کی سفارش کی گئی۔ اس کے باوجود مجسٹریٹ نے معاملے کا نوٹس لیا اور ملزمان کو عدالتی کارروائی کے ذریعے سزا دی۔ اس فیصلے کو اپیل میں چیلنج کیا گیا جہاں اپیلٹ فورم نے ٹرائل کورٹ کے تضادات کی بنیاد پر ملزمان کو بری کر دیا۔ تاہم، اپیلٹ کورٹ نے یہ قرار نہیں دیا کہ شکایت کنندہ کی طرف سے پولیس کو دی گئی اطلاع جھوٹی تھی۔

چونکہ نہ تو تفتیشی افسر کی رائے اور نہ ہی کسی عدالتی فورم کی یہ قرار داد موجود ہے کہ شکایت کنندہ کی اطلاع جھوٹی تھی، لہٰذا دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان اس کیس پر لاگو نہیں ہوتی۔ بصورتِ دیگر، قانون کی اس تشریح سے ایک ہی فوجداری کارروائی سے متعدد مقدمات جنم لیں گے اور ہر اس کیس میں جہاں شکایت کنندہ ناکام ہو جائے، خواہ وہ دائرہ اختیار کی کمی، مدت کی پابندی، ناکافی شواہد یا فائدہ بہ شک کے سبب ہو، جھوٹا مقدمہ قرار دے کر بے بنیاد فوجداری کارروائیوں کا سیلاب شروع ہو جائے 


قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ تیار کر دیتا ہوں جس میں:

دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان (PPC) کی Bare Act Wording (اصل عبارت + اردو ترجمہ)

دفعہ 195 ض فوجداری (CrPC) کی Bare Act Wording (اصل عبارت + اردو ترجمہ)

دونوں دفعات کا قانونی تجزیہ اور تقابل

عدالتی نظائر (پاکستانی اور بھارتی)

اس فیصلے سے اخذ کردہ قانونی اصول

دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان (PPC)

Bare Act Wording:
"False information, with intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person.
Whoever gives to any public servant any information which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant—
(a) to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, or
(b) to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to three thousand rupees, or with both."

جو شخص کسی سرکاری ملازم کو ایسی اطلاع دے جس کے متعلق وہ جانتا یا یقین رکھتا ہو کہ وہ جھوٹی ہے، اور اس نیت سے کہ وہ سرکاری ملازم:
(a) ایسا کوئی فعل کرے یا نہ کرے جو صحیح حقائق معلوم ہونے کی صورت میں وہ نہ کرتا، یا
(b) اپنے قانونی اختیارات کو کسی شخص کے نقصان یا ایذا کے لیے استعمال کرے،
تو اسے چھ ماہ تک قید یا تین ہزار روپے تک جرمانہ یا دونوں سزائیں دی جا سکتی ہیں۔

دفعہ 195 ض فوجداری (CrPC)

Bare Act Wording (relevant portion):
"No Court shall take cognizance—
(a) of any offence punishable under Sections 172 to 188 (both inclusive) of the Pakistan Penal Code, except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned, or of some other public servant to whom he is administratively subordinate;"

کوئی عدالت ان جرائم کا نوٹس نہیں لے گی جو تعزیراتِ پاکستان کی دفعات 172 سے 188 تک میں قابلِ سزا ہیں، سوائے اس صورت کے کہ متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم یا اس کا کوئی بالا افسر تحریری شکایت کرے۔

قانونی تجزیہ

دفعہ 182، PPC صرف اس وقت لاگو ہو سکتی ہے جب:

اطلاع جھوٹی ثابت ہو عدالتی کارروائی کے ذریعے؛

اطلاع دینے والے کا علم یا یقین جھوٹ پر مبنی ہو؛

اطلاع کا مقصد یا امکان یہ ہو کہ سرکاری ملازم اپنے اختیارات کا غلط استعمال کرے۔

دفعہ 195، CrPC اس بات کی شرط لگاتی ہے کہ عدالت ازخود اس جرم کا نوٹس نہیں لے سکتی۔ شکایت صرف وہی سرکاری ملازم کر سکتا ہے جس کے سامنے جھوٹی اطلاع دی گئی تھی، یا اس کا بالا افسر۔
اس لیے اگر محض شکایت کنندہ اپنے الزامات ثابت نہ کر سکے تو اسے جھوٹا قرار نہیں دیا جا سکتا۔ اسے صرف ’’Not proved‘‘ کہا جائے گا، ’’False‘‘ نہیں۔

عدالت کا اختیار (Cognizance) محدود ہے: بغیر متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم کی تحریری شکایت کے مجسٹریٹ یا جسٹس آف پیس کارروائی شروع نہیں کر سکتا۔

۔ عدالتی نظائر (Case Law)

عبدالرحمٰن بنام ریاست (1968 P Cr. L J 215):
عدالت نے قرار دیا کہ دفعہ 182، PPC کے تحت کارروائی صرف متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم کی تحریری شکایت پر ہو سکتی ہے

Supreme Court of India – Saloni Arora Vs. State of NCT Delhi (AIR 2017 SC 391):
محض ناکافی ثبوت یا benefit of doubt جھوٹی اطلاع کے مترادف نہیں۔

Daulat Ram Vs. State of Punjab (1962 AIR 28):
یہ واضح کیا گیا کہ مجسٹریٹ ازخود دفعہ 182 کے مقدمہ کا اختیار نہیں رکھتا۔

اخذ کردہ اصول

دفعہ 182 PPC کا اطلاق صرف اس وقت ہوگا جب:

جھوٹ عدالتی فیصلے سے ثابت ہو۔

اطلاع دانستہ اور بدنیتی پر مبنی دی گئی ہو۔

دفعہ 195 CrPC عدالت کو اس جرم کا نوٹس لینے سے روکتی ہے، جب تک متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم تحریری شکایت نہ کرے۔

محض یہ کہ شکایت کنندہ اپنے الزامات ثابت نہ کر سکا، اسے جھوٹا نہیں کہا جا سکتا۔

اگر اس اصول پر عمل نہ کیا جائے تو ہر ناکام فوجداری مقدمہ کے بعد شکایت کنندہ پر دفعہ 182 PPC لگا کر فالتو اور انتقامی مقدمات کا سیلاب آ جائے گا۔

قانونی پوزیشن (Summary Note for Court):

مجسٹریٹ یا جسٹس آف پیس دفعہ 182 PPC کے مقدمے کا نوٹس ازخود نہیں لے سکتا۔

شرط یہ ہے کہ متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم تحریری شکایت کرے (سیکشن 195 CrPC)۔

جب تک عدالتی فیصلے میں شکایت کو ’’جھوٹی‘‘ قرار نہ دیا جائے، دفعہ 182 PPC لاگو نہیں ہو سکتی۔

ناکافی شواہد، دائرہ اختیار کی کمی، مدت کی پابندی یا benefit of doubt کو جھوٹی اطلاع نہیں کہا جا سکتا۔

دفعہ 173 ض فوجداری – پولیس افسر کی رپورٹ

اس باب کے تحت ہر تفتیش غیر ضروری تاخیر کے بغیر مکمل کی جائے گی اور جوں ہی مکمل ہو، تھانہ انچارج افسر کو چاہیے کہ [سرکاری وکیل کے ذریعے] درج ذیل رپورٹ مجسٹریٹ کو پیش کرے جو پولیس رپورٹ پر مقدمہ سننے کا اختیار رکھتا ہے:

(الف) ایسی رپورٹ جو صوبائی حکومت کی مقرر کردہ صورت میں ہو، جس میں فریقین کے نام، معلومات کی نوعیت، ان افراد کے نام جو واقعات سے واقف معلوم ہوتے ہیں، اور یہ وضاحت ہو کہ ملزم (اگر گرفتار ہے) تو اسے حراست میں بھیجا گیا ہے یا ضمانت پر رہا کیا گیا ہے، اور اگر رہا کیا گیا ہے تو ضامن کے ساتھ یا بغیر۔

دفعہ 190 ض فوجداری – مجسٹریٹ کی طرف سے جرائم پر کارروائی

تمام فرسٹ کلاس مجسٹریٹ یا کوئی بھی دوسرا مجسٹریٹ جسے صوبائی حکومت ہائی کورٹ کی سفارش پر خصوصی اختیار دے، کسی بھی جرم پر کارروائی کر سکتا ہے:

(الف) ایسے حقائق کی شکایت موصول ہونے پر جو کسی جرم کا ارتکاب ظاہر کرتے ہوں؛
(ب) کسی پولیس افسر کی جانب سے ایسے حقائق کی تحریری رپورٹ پر؛
(ج) کسی شخص (پولیس افسر کے علاوہ) سے موصولہ اطلاع، یا اپنی معلومات یا شبہ کی بنیاد پر کہ کوئی جرم ہوا ہے، جسے وہ خود سن سکتا ہے یا سیشن کورٹ کو بھیج سکتا ہے۔

اگر ایسا جرم جس پر کارروائی ہو صرف سیشن کورٹ کے دائرہ اختیار میں ہے، تو مجسٹریٹ صرف مقدمہ سیشن کورٹ کو بھیجے گا، بغیر شواہد ریکارڈ کیے۔

دفعہ 195 ض فوجداری – سرکاری ملازمین کے قانونی اختیارات کی توہین پر کارروائی وغیرہ

کوئی عدالت درج ذیل صورت میں کارروائی نہیں کر سکتی:

(الف) تعزیرات پاکستان کی دفعات 172 سے [187] تک کے تحت قابل سزا کسی بھی جرم پر، سوائے اس کے کہ متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم خود تحریری شکایت کرے یا کوئی دوسرا سرکاری ملازم جو اس کا ماتحت ہو، شکایت کرے۔

اہم قانونی نکتہ:

دفعہ 173 کے تحت پولیس رپورٹ (چالان، یا بی/سی/ای کلاس رپورٹ) مجسٹریٹ کو بھیجتی ہے۔

دفعہ 190 کے تحت مجسٹریٹ فیصلہ کرتا ہے کہ وہ مقدمہ سن سکتا ہے یا آگے بھیج سکتا ہے۔
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
دفعہ 195 ایک بار (bar of cognizance) لگاتی ہے کہ مخصوص جرائم (مثلاً دفعہ 182 پی پی سی) پر کارروائی صرف سرکاری ملازم کی شکایت پر ہی ممکن ہے، کسی نجی فرد یا عدالتی حکم پر نہیں۔

دفعہ 182 پی پی سی جھوٹی اطلاع دینے کو جرم بناتی ہے، لیکن اس پر براہِ راست کارروائی عدالت نہیں کر سکتی جب تک کہ متعلقہ سرکاری افسر خود شکایت نہ کرے۔

تفتیشی افسر (I.O) تفتیش مکمل کرنے کے بعد پولیس رولز 1934 کے رول 24.7 کے تحت کسی ایف آئی آر کے اخراج کی سفارش درج ذیل انداز میں کر سکتا ہے:

کلاس "A": اگر مقدمہ سچا ہے لیکن ملزم ناقابلِ سراغ (Untraceable) ہے۔

کلاس "B": اگر پولیس کو دی گئی اطلاع بدنیتی پر مبنی جھوٹی ثابت ہو۔

کلاس "C": اگر معاملہ ناقابلِ دست اندازی پولیس (Non-cognizable) ہو، یا محض دیوانی دعویٰ ہو، یا حقائق کی غلطی کی بنیاد پر مقدمہ درج ہوا ہو۔

اس حوالے سے مقدمہ سید قمبر علی شاہ بنام صوبہ سندھ و دیگر (2024 SCMR 1123) پر انحصار کیا جا سکتا ہے۔

جب ایسی رپورٹ متعلقہ مجسٹریٹ اول (First Class) یا کسی اور مجسٹریٹ کے سامنے پیش کی جاتی ہے جسے صوبائی حکومت نے ہائی کورٹ کی سفارش پر خصوصی طور پر بااختیار بنایا ہو، تو ایسے مجسٹریٹ کے پاس یہ اختیار ہوتا ہے کہ وہ:

رپورٹ کو قبول کرے، یا

رپورٹ کردہ جرم پر نوٹس (Cognizance) لے، یا

تفتیشی افسر کو مزید تفتیش (Reinvestigation) کی ہدایت دے اور مقررہ مدت میں نئی رپورٹ طلب کرے۔

تاہم، مجسٹریٹ کے پاس یہ اختیار نہیں ہوتا کہ وہ تفتیشی افسر کو حکم دے کہ ایف آئی آر کو کلاس "A"، "B" یا "C" میں خارج کرے۔

I.O کا اختیار: A / B / C کلاس (Rule 24.7 — Police Rules, 1934)

تفتیش مکمل ہونے پر تفتیشی افسر Police Rules, 1934 (Rule 24.7) وغیرہ کے تحت ایف آئی آر کی disposal کے لیے سفارش کر سکتا ہے:

Class A — کیس سچا مگر ملزم ناقابلِ سراغ؛

Class B — اطلاع بدنیتی پر مبنی/maliciously false (=> ممکنہ 182 کے لیے بنیاد)؛

Class C — غیر قابلِ دست اندازی/دیوانی نوعیت/غلط فہمی وغیرہ۔ 

جب I.O نے C-class سفارش کی ہو تو اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ معلومات کو جھوٹا ثابت کرنے کی بنیاد موجود نہیں — صرف ثبوت ناکافی/غلط فہمی کا امکان۔ ایسی صورت میں عدالتی حکم سے براہِ راست 182 کی کارروائی کا حکم دینا غلط استعمالِ عملِ عدل ہوگا

موجودہ کیس پر تفصیلی تجزیہ (Issue-wise)

کیا مجسٹریٹ/Ex-Officio JP 182 کی کارروائی کا حکم دے سکتا تھا؟
— قانوناً نہیں (قابلِ اعتراض) کیونکہ دفعہ 195 نے express bar رکھی ہے اور 182 کی شروعات عمومی طور پر اُس public servant یا superior police officer کی شِکایت/رائے سے ممکن ہے جو اصل اطلاع پر عمل کیا۔ عدالتی ہدایت بذاتِ خود اس بار کو عبور نہیں کر سکتی

کیا I.O کی C-class سفارش کے باوجود مجسٹریٹ نے اطلاقِ اختیار کر لیا؟
— اگر مجسٹریٹ نے IO-کی C-class رپورٹ کو نظر انداز کر کے ازخود B-class یا 182 کارروائی کا حکم دیا تو وہ اختیار سے تجاوز سمجھا جائے گا۔ مجسٹریٹ کو I.O کی رائے پر سمجھی ہوئی کارروائی کی توضیح کرنی چاہیے اور صرف جائز/قابلِ عمل شواہد کی بنیاد پر ہی cognizance لینا چاہیے۔ 

دیر سے رابطہ (≈15 سال) اور civil remedy پہلے سے اختیار کرنے کا اثر؟
— عدالت نے اس کو weight دیا: دیر سے رجوع اور civil remedies پہلے اپنانے کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ مدعی نے مقدماتی چارہ جوئی/نزاع کو عدالتی/دیوانی راہ سے حل کرنے کی کوشش کی اور پھر بعد ازاں اسی فعل کو فوجداری شکل دینے کی کوشش کی — یہ motives کو مشکوک بناتا ہے اور Ex-Officio JP کو محتاط رکھنے کی وجہ بنتا ہے۔
(Case law میں اسی طرزِ عمل کو ملازمِ سنگینی سے دیکھا گیا)۔

کیا 182 کے لیے show-cause یا IO-opinion ضروری ہے؟
— ججوں کی رخ صحیح روایات میں یہ پایا گیا کہ 182 کی کارروائی عام طور پر صرف اس وقت قابلِ اقدام ہوتی ہے جب: (a) FIR واقعی رجسٹر، تفتیش اور عدالتی عمل کے نتیجے میں false ثابت ہو؛ یا (b) I.O واضح طور پر maliciously false ہونے کی رائے دے اور پھر relevant public servant شکایت کرے۔ اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ مجسٹریٹ کی جانب سے ازخود 182 کی شروعات عموماً غیر مناسب سمجھی گئی ہے۔

بی کلاس (B-Class) رپورٹ

مفہوم:
ایسی رپورٹ جس میں پولیس یہ نتیجہ اخذ کرے کہ مقدمہ جھوٹا یا بے بنیاد ہے، اور شکایت کنندہ نے دانستہ طور پر جھوٹا مقدمہ بنایا۔

قانونی اثر:

اگر مجسٹریٹ اس رپورٹ کو منظور کر لے تو مقدمہ جھوٹا قرار پاتا ہے۔

ایسی صورت میں شکایت کنندہ پر دفعہ 182 PPC یا دیگر قانونی کارروائی کا دروازہ کھل سکتا ہے، لیکن صرف اسی صورت میں جب متعلقہ سرکاری ملازم تحریری شکایت کرے (سیکشن 195
 CrPC)۔

سی کلاس (C-Class) رپورٹ

مفہوم:
ایسی رپورٹ جس میں پولیس یہ نتیجہ اخذ کرے کہ مقدمہ بلا ارادہ، بے دلیلی یا غلط فہمی پر مبنی تھا، لیکن اسے جھوٹا نہیں کہا جا سکتا۔

قانونی اثر:

مقدمہ خارج ہو جاتا ہے، لیکن شکایت کنندہ پر جھوٹے مقدمے (False case) کا الزام نہیں لگتا۔

شکایت کو ’’Not Proved‘‘ سمجھا جاتا ہے، ’’False‘‘ نہیں۔

شکایت کنندہ کے خلاف دفعہ 182 PPC یا دیگر فوجداری کارروائی نہیں ہو سکتی کیونکہ اطلاع بدنیتی سے جھوٹی ثابت نہیں ہوئی۔

قانونی نکتہ (Court Argument Style):

’’معزز عدالت، تفتیشی افسر نے دفعہ 173 ض فوجداری کے تحت مقدمہ بی کلاس میں جھوٹا قرار دینے کی بجائے سی کلاس میں خارج کرنے کی سفارش کی، جو اس امر کا واضح ثبوت ہے کہ شکایت کنندہ کی طرف سے دی گئی اطلاع جھوٹی نہیں بلکہ ناقابلِ ثبوت تھی۔ چونکہ بی کلاس رپورٹ موجود نہیں ہے اور کسی عدالتی فورم نے بھی اطلاع کو جھوٹا قرار نہیں دیا، اس لیے دفعہ 182 تعزیراتِ پاکستان بالکل لاگو نہیں ہوتی۔ کسی اور تعبیر کو تسلیم کرنا قانون کے خلاف اور فالتو فوجداری مقدمات کے دروازے کھولنے کے مترادف ہوگا۔‘‘

[12/25/25, 5:02:53 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Whether a wife pursuing claims for dower, dowry articles and maintenance, who appears before the Court without counsel of her choice or any independent advice and withdraws her suit, can later seek to recall that statement on the ground of fraud, undue influence keeping in view the fact that sanctity is attached to the judicial proceedings?

 Held: Statements recorded by the litigants are generally given full weight because same are presumed to reflect the free and voluntary will of the party making them before the Courts. However, this principle is not an unbending rule of thumb. The Court must examine the attending circumstances to determine whether the act was truly voluntary and free from undue influence or fraud. Further held that in a dispute whenever a statement is to be recorded by a vulnerable litigant, like females in a family matter, the Court must take all necessary steps to ensure that the statement is fully understood by the maker; the statement should be recorded in a language which the party comprehends; particularly, if the maker is illiterate, the Presiding Officer must ensure that she is accompanied by her kin, who is literate, having no adverse interest, and understands the statement she makes and it should be read over to her by the Presiding Officer of the Court, who should specifically question such vulnerable party to ascertain that she understands the contents and implications of the statement, and that it is being made voluntarily, without any inducement, undue influence, or coercion, and that she has the independent advice from counsel of her choice. Such procedural safeguards are essential to uphold the principles of natural justice and to ensure that the sanctity of the judicial proceedings is preserved while protecting the substantive rights of vulnerable parties as required under the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.

[12/25/25, 5:02:54 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Civil courts have inherent jurisdiction to entertain and try all civil suits unless a specific statutory bar either express or implied has been enacted to oust such jurisdiction. The phrase "civil nature" has been interpreted broadly by the courts to include all matters that involve the determination of civil rights and obligations. Accordingly, in the absence of any express or implied statutory bar, and in view of the fact that the Rent Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over disputes arising after the termination of the tenancy, the appropriate forum for seeking redressal in such matters remains the civil court. Thus, the remedy for the aggrieved party lies before the civil court, which is empowered under Section 9 CPC to adjudicate upon the matter.

[12/25/25, 5:02:58 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: This Court is of the opinion that an order of remand is not to be passed as a matter of course. An Appellate Court is duty-bound to examine whether such a course would meaningfully advance the cause of justice or merely prolong the litigation. In the present case, findings on merits already stand recorded against the respondents after a full trial. A remand, in such circumstances, would only subject the parties to another round of avoidable proceedings. Even if the issue of limitation was to be decided in favour of the respondents, their suit would nonetheless require adjudication on merits on the basis of evidence an exercise already undertaken by the Trial Court. The appropriate course, therefore, was reappraisal of the evidence by the Appellate Court below itself rather than a remand. The Appellate Court below failed to appreciate that the remand ordered by it would serve no useful purpose and would, instead, defeat the objective of expeditious justice.

The senior lady herself is also in attendance who appears to be alert and in good health who is expected to do her duty by the neglected child, spend time with her and guide her to enter into adulthood with a repaired spirit that at the moment appears to carry the melancholy of her father’s neglect which he shall make every effort to rectify by paying regular maintenance allowance while the court concerned where the matter on visitation is statedly pending according to the parties shall ensure that a working visitation schedule is immediately enforced on receipt of this Order and is duly finalized keeping the welfare of the minor at the heart of such structure.  
Entrusting custody with the maternal grandmother of minor daughters who are in such sensitive years of their development when they need the presence of sincere maternal care in certain situations is not alien to the policy of law and a number of precedents exist in this regard.

Order XVI C.P.C. mandates that the party shall not be permitted  to call witnesses other than those contained in the said list, except with the permission of the Court and after showing good cause for the omission of the said witnesses from the list; and if the Court grants such permission, it shall record reasons for so doing. Perusal  of the application shows that no good reasons have been given to explain the omission to mention the names in the list of witnesses of the persons for whom the application was filed. The only ground taken by the petitioner was that the document being part of acquisition record, the petitioner was entitled to summon the documents which were not provided.   In point of fact oral evidence of any document will not be admissible. If the petitioner was interested to produce  any document, the appropriate course for him was to obtain certified copy of documents, if any, he wanted to produce in the evidence and submit the same in evidence. The learned Civil Judge, therefore, rightly dismissed the application under Order XVI, Rule 1, C.P.C. which order being fair, just, reasonable, does not call for any interference.

Under Order XLI, Rule 27, C.P.C. if the appellate court on hearing the case reached the conclusion that recording of additional evidence was necessary to reach the correct decision it could order for production of additional evidence and record the same itself or kept the appeal pending and remitted the file to the trial court for recording the statement and on return of the file with the compliance report to have decided the appeal itself by considering the additional evidence or any rebuttal thereto along with the evidence already available.  
In view of the provisions of Order XLI, Rule 27, C.P.C. it is manifest that order of appellate court in so far as it relates to setting aside the whole judgment without reversing the findings on merits is violative of law and cannot sustain to the extent of remand of the case. For doing such exercise the appellate court itself was under obligation to undertake the same in view of the provision of Rule 28 of Order XLI, C.P.C.

[12/25/25, 5:03:05 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Entry of Road Certificate regarding dispatch of case property in a criminal case can only be negated by some other document of superior legal value and not by the oral evidence as person can tell lie but document cannot.

After hearing learned counsel for the appellant, learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor and going through the record, it has been noticed that Zafar Hussain, Sub-Inspector (Investigating Officer of the case) while appearing before the Court as PW-2 during trial of the case stated that he received parcel of sample from the Moharrar on 18.10.2022 and deposited the same in the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore on the same day, intact.

WHEREAS, Hasnat Ahmad, 290/MHC (Moharrar of the police station) while appearing before the Court as PW-5 admitted during his cross-examination that the relevant road certificate through which the sample was sent to Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore is bearing Sr. No.785 and the same is available with the police file as Ex.DA; he further stated that the road certificate was chalked out on 17.10.2022 and sample was delivered on 18.10.2022.

Perusal of aforementioned road certificate (Ex.DA) clearly reveals that Hasnat Ahmad 290/MHC (Moharrar/PW-5) sent parcel of sample in the case to PFSA through Zafar Hussain, Sub-Inspector (PW-2) and as per its Column No.2, “date & time of departure” of said police official from the police station is 17.10.2022 at 09:08 a.m. and said road certificate was chalked out                   on 17.10.2022. Though Hasnat Ahmad 290/MHC (Moharrar/PW-5) has stated during his cross-examination that road certificate (Ex.DA) was chalked out on 17.10.2022 and sample was delivered on 18.10.2022                 (as mentioned above) yet it is relevant to mention here that said portion of his statement i.e. regarding delivery of sample on 18.10.2022 is against the contents of road certificate bearing No.785 (Ex.DA) because it has been clearly mentioned therein that date & time of departure from the police station was 17.10.2022 at 09:08 a.m. It is trite law that oral evidence cannot be given preference over documentary evidence.

It is also relevant to mention here that entries in Columns No.2 and 4 of the road certificate (Ex.DA) regarding date & time of departure of the police official i.e. 17.10.2022 at 09:08 a.m. from the police station with aforementioned parcel of sample and mentioning of “PFSA” in Column No.7 as well as in the caption of Ex.DA, could not be negated through any other document having better legal sanctity/superior legal value by the prosecution.  

Chain of safe custody of the “parcel of sample” has been compromised in this case i.e. the same has not been established/proved in this case. Now law is well settled on the point that chain of safe custody of “parcel of sample as well as of allegedly recovered case property” is to be proved otherwise, conviction is not possible and it straightaway leads to the acquittal of the accused because recovery of narcotics is not a mere corroboratory piece of evidence rather it constitutes the offence itself and entails punishment. 

By now it is also well settled that if safe custody of allegedly recovered substance or parcel of sample/case property has not been proved then, there is no need to discuss other merits of the case and it straightaway leads to the acquittal of the accused.

Office is directed to immediately send copy of this judgment to the Inspector General of Police, Punjab, Lahore for his perusal and with the proposal to consider the suitability of preparing “Road Certificate” in appropriate “Form” while mentioning required details in the same in express manner/words for sending the case property from police station to the Court, Laboratory or at any other relevant office.

[12/25/25, 5:03:09 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: When a person commits an offence under Section 228 of PPC in the view or presence of the court, the court has three options. The court may either proceed under Section 480 of Cr.P.C., or under Section 476 of Cr.P.C., or forward the case to learned Magistrate under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure, having jurisdiction to try the same. If the court intends to proceed against the offender and complete the proceedings same day, the court shall proceed under Section 480 of Cr.P.C. and shall cause the offender to be detained in custody and at any time before rising of the court on the same day may take the cognizance of the offence and sentence the offender to a fine not exceeding two hundred rupees and in default of the payment to simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month. Language used in Section 480 of Cr.P.C. indicates that sentence of the fine of two hundred rupees is substantive sentence, whereas sentence of the imprisonment extending upto one month is of secondary nature, which has to be resorted to only if the offender fails to pay the fine. If the court desires to impose the sentence exceeding the above sentence, the court may have a resort to Section 476 of Cr.P.C. and try the offender in accordance with the procedure prescribed for summary trial in Chapter XXII (Sec.260 to 265 Cr.P.C.). Section 482 of Cr.P.C. deals with the situation, where court considers not to involve itself in the matter, the court may have a resort to Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and may forward the case to a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the same. All the said provisions have always to be read in conjunction with each other.

Combined effect and critical analysis of the above said provisions is that when court proceeds under Section 480 of Cr.P.C., the said provision places a limitation on the power of the court regarding the quantum of punishment. In such case, the court may impose the sentence of fine of Rs.200/- only, or may impose the sentence of imprisonment extending upto one month, only if the fine has not been paid. If the court is of the opinion that said sentence is not appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case, the court may initiate the proceedings against the offender under Section 476 of Cr.P.C. and shall observe entire process of summary trial prescribed under Sections 260 to 265 of Cr.P.C. Under Section 476 of Cr.P.C. a Magistrate or Civil Court may impose the sentence of imprisonment extending upto three months or fine not exceeding one thousand rupees, or both.

[12/25/25, 5:03:12 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: For a proper resolution of the controversy, it is necessary to refer to the statutory framework. Licence No.11/D/95 was issued under Rule 253 of the Motor Vehicles Rules, 1969 (hereinafter, “the Rules, 1969”). The proviso to Rule 253(2) ibid is of particular significance: “no place which is privately owned shall be notified as a Stand unless the application is made by the owner of that place.” This inextricably links the entitlement to hold a recognized stand to the ownership or lawful control of the land in question. 

 The legal character of the licence must also be underscored. A licence is merely a permission to do something which would otherwise be unlawful. It is a privilege1, not a property right. Licence in question, therefore, never created a vested, indefeasible or permanent right in favour of the petitioners. Consequently, upon the death of one of the original licensees, Khawaja Muhammad Yousaf, the licence did not automatically devolve upon his legal heirs as a heritable right. 

 Rule 266 of the Rules, 1969 is also relevant to the case in hand. The plain language of Rule 266(1) ibid confers upon the Regional Transport Authority a broad regulatory power to revoke an order permitting establishment of a stand where conditions of the order have been breached, management is unsatisfactory or its continuance would not be in the public interest. These are regulatory, not proprietary, powers; their exercise is concerned with the proper administration and management of public vehicle stands in the interest of the travelling public and public order. It is evident that the licence in question was issued and periodically renewed in circumstances where (a) one of the original licensees had passed away; (b) the underlying land which formed the basis for the stand remains joint and unpartitioned among legal heirs; and (c) at least one co-owner (respondent No.5) expressly objected to renewal. When the proviso to Rule 253  of the Rules, 1969 is read together with Rule 266, a clear picture emerges that a privately owned place must be the subject of an application by the owner (or by those lawfully entitled) and, if that foundational condition is disputed, the competent authority is entitled to take regulatory steps (including revocation) to prevent the continuance of a concession that may aggravate disputes, endanger public order or amount to administrative impropriety. 

  In the above legal and factual backdrop, the impugned order of revocation falls within the Authority’s regulatory power. The Transport Authority correctly identified the defect of the licence continuing in a deceased person’s name and the untenability of the arrangement due to the ownership dispute. It surely is not the province of the licensing authority to adjudicate the proprietary rights among the heirs. Such disputes are for the civil court to resolve. The petitioners’ remedy, therefore, lies in seeking a determination of their respective shares before the civil court. Upon obtaining a decree or settlement that establishes a clear and undisputed entitlement, they may apply afresh for a licence in accordance with law.

i) Failure of prosecution to prove the safe custody of sample parcels and remaining case property from the place of recovery to the police station, the secure transmission of the sample parcels to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore and the proper deposit of the remaining case property in the Saddar Malkhana is fatal to the prosecution. 

ii) The statements of key witnesses of the case were not recorded by the Investigating officer under section 161 Cr.P.C. despite the fact that doing so was a mandatory requirement of law. In numerious judgments of the apex court of the country it was held that when statement of material witness under section 161 Cr.P.C. is not recorded during investigation, his testimony is to be evaluated with extreme caution, as the possibility of improvements, afterthoughts or deliberate additions cannot be ruled out. 

iii) More so, the statement of one witness under section 161 Cr.P.C. was recorded with considerable and unexplained delay, makes the prosecution case doubtful. Such a lapse in investigation constitutes a substantial flaw, generating reasonable doubt in the prsoecution's case and it is a settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that the benefit of every such doubt must go to the accused.

[12/25/25, 5:03:25 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Rule 10-A of Order V, C.P.C. provides that simultaneously with the issuance of summons under Rule 9 of Order V, C.P.C. there shall be sent a notice through registered post A. D. and that the acknowledgement of summons purported to be signed by defendant on the receipt of registered communication or endorsement by postal employee that the defendant refused to take delivery of the same shall be deemed by the court to be prima facie proof of service of summons. Rule 17 of Order V, C.P.C. mandates that if the defendant or his agent refused to sign the acknowledgment or where the serving officer, after using of due and reasonable diligence, cannot find the defendant and there is no agent empowered to accept such service the serving officer shall affix a copy of summons at the outer door or some other conspicuous part of the house in which the defendant ordinarily resides and shall return the original  to the court from which it was issued with a report enclosed  stating that he has so affixed the copy, the circumstances under which he did so and name and address of persons by whom the house was identified and in whose presence the copy was affixed. Rule 18 of Order V, C.P.C. requires that serving officer shall, in all cases in which summons were served under Rule 16 of Order V, C.P.C., endorse or annex a return stating the time and manner in which the summons was served and the name and address of person identifying the person served and witnessing the delivery or tender of summons. Rule 19 of Order V, C.P.C. provides that where summons is returned under Rule 17 of Order V, C.P.C. the court shall, if the return under the rule had not been verified by the affidavit of serving officer or if it had so been verified, examine the serving officer on oath or cause him to be so examined by another court touching his proceedings and may make such further inquiry in the matter as thought fit and shall either declare that the summons was duly served or order of such service thought fit.

[12/25/25, 5:03:26 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: It has been consistently ruled that where exclusion of legal heirs is claimed by way of gift there should be evidence to justify the disinheritance of other legal heirs from the gift.  

 In the instant case neither in the pleadings nor in the evidence the petitioner who was under heavy onus to not only establish the actual oral gift by propositus in his favour not only could not discharge it effectively but also was unable to establish any special reasons for discriminating the daughter or causing her disinheritance who neither asserted nor proved any special reasons. Curiously the learned Civil Judge did not consider the matter in its proper legal perspective and also the consistent rule on the subject and proceeded to assume that the mere attestation of mutation was good enough to assume the declaration and acceptance of gift and transfer of possession little appreciating that mutation is not document of title and that where transaction itself was in issue the beneficiary was legally obligated to discharge the onus by alleging and proving through credible evidence the prerequisites  of a valid oral gift which in this case was missing and, therefore, the learned Addl. District Judge rightly set aside the judgment and decree of learned Civil Judge and allowed the appeal.

[12/25/25, 5:03:28 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The pivotal question that arises for consideration is whether the evidence recorded in the earlier suit for jactitation of marriage could legally be pressed into service against the present petitioner, who was neither a party to those proceedings nor afforded any opportunity of cross-examination. In this regard, relevant is Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. A plain reading of the aforesaid provision makes it manifest that the relevancy and admissibility of evidence recorded in an earlier judicial proceeding is conditional and circumscribed, and not absolute. Such evidence can be relied upon in a subsequent proceeding for proving the truth of the facts stated therein only if the following conditions prescribed therein are satisfied: (That the earlier proceeding was between the same parties or their representatives-in-interest), (That the adverse party had the right and opportunity of cross-examination), (That the questions in issue in both proceedings were substantially identical.) In the present case, none of these mandatory pre-conditions stands fulfilled.

Moreover, ocular account is not synchronized with the medical evidence. As per narration of the FIR the complainant emphatically alleged that she had repeatedly been subjected to carnal intercourse by her husband, the petitioner, but her medico-legal report badly negated her version. The allegation of committing unnatural offence by the accused/petitioner could only be corroborated by the medical evidence, which is in direct conflict thereto and reduces veracity thereof almost to a nonentity. Moreover, DNA report in this respect is also negative. It is settled law that the benefit of doubt can be extended to the accused even while deciding pre-arrest bail application.

There is settled law that in view of Section 17 of the West Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964, the provisions of Qanun-eShahadat Order, 1984 and Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 shall not apply to the proceedings before a Family Court except Sections 10 & 11 CPC and Section 13(3) of the West Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964 empowers the Family Court to execute its own decree but for argument sake, (naeem)even Section 64 of Code of Civil Procedure prohibits a private transfer or delivery of the attached property by the judgment-debtor after attachment has been made and all such transactions are void. 

There is no cavil to the proposition that disputed gifts will deprive all the daughters from inheritance and the courts are not divested of the powers (naeem)to scrutinize the reasons and justification of such like gifts so that no injustice could be done.

[12/30/25, 3:48:09 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Even the rule of hearsay is not absolute, for, it is subject to certain exceptions. One of these is that statements accompanying and explaining facts are not hit by the hearsay rule. Thus, even in the case of hearsay as observed in Halsbury's Laws of England (3rd Edn., Vol 15, at page 320) in estimating the weight to be attached to a statement "regard must be had to all circumstances from which any inference as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement can reasonably be drawn, and in particular to the questions whether the statement was contemporaneous with the facts stated and whether the maker had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts". Explanatory facts are regarded as relevant facts as per Article 22 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 which says that facts necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which support or rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue or relevant fact……………………, are relevant in so far as they are necessary for that purpose. In such situation, of course press clipping could be considered as explanatory evidence, that shall be read in conjunction with other evidence on the record, because press clipping as sole evidence cannot prove a fact beyond reasonable doubt.

The above highlights on the subject of press clippings show that if author or reporter of press clipping appears in the dock, it could become admissible evidence; however, cogency whereof rests upon the intrinsic value of information, its reliability and source authentication which of course would be determined after recording of all the evidence in the case.

Suffice it to say that such Article says that “Facts of which Court must take judicial notice” the word “must” make it obligatory for the Court to take judicial notice of all such facts listed in Article 112 ibid without asking for a formal proof. Whereas Article 111 ibid gives a discretion to the Court to take judicial notice of any fact not listed in Article 112 ibid, depending upon the circumstances of the case. Thus, Court can take judicial notice of a news clipping subject to the considerations that its admissibility depends on several factors, including the relevance to the case, the authenticity of the clipping, and whether the court deems it reliable.

فیصلہ 
یہ مستقل طور پر فیصلہ کیا گیا ہے کہ جہاں قانونی وارثوں کو تحفہ (گفٹ) کے ذریعے خارج کرنے کا دعویٰ کیا جائے، وہاں دیگر قانونی وارثوں کو تحفہ سے محروم کرنے کی وجوہات ثابت کرنے کے لیے شواہد موجود ہونے چاہئیں۔

موجودہ مقدمے میں، نہ تو دعوے میں اور نہ ہی شواہد میں، درخواست گزار، جو بھاری ذمہ داری کے تحت تھا کہ وہ ثابت کرے کہ متوفی نے زبانی طور پر واقعی اسے تحفہ دیا، نہ صرف یہ کہ وہ اس کو مؤثر طریقے سے ثابت کر سکا بلکہ یہ بھی نہیں دکھا سکا کہ بیٹی کو امتیازی سلوک یا محرومی کی کوئی خاص وجہ تھی، جس نے نہ تو کوئی خاص وجہ بتائی اور نہ ہی ثابت کی۔

دلچسپ بات یہ ہے کہ معزز سول جج نے اس معاملے کو قانونی نقطہ نظر سے درست انداز میں نہیں دیکھا اور اس مستقل قاعدے کو نظرانداز کرتے ہوئے یہ فرض کر لیا کہ محض میوٹیشن (رجسٹریشن) کی تصدیق تحفے کے اعلان اور قبولیت اور قبضے کی منتقلی کے لیے کافی ہے، یہ سمجھنے میں ناکام کہ میوٹیشن ملکیت کا دستاویز نہیں ہے اور جب خود لین دین ہی زیرِ بحث ہو، تو مستفید ہونے والا قانونی طور پر ذمہ دار ہے کہ وہ قابل اعتماد شواہد کے ذریعے ایک درست زبانی تحفے کے تمام اجزاء کو ثابت کرے، جو کہ اس مقدمے میں موجود نہیں تھے۔

لہٰذا، معزز ایڈیشنل ڈسٹرکٹ جج نے درست طور پر معزز سول جج کے فیصلے اور حکم کو کالعدم قرار دیا اور اپیل کو منظور کیا۔

قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 

1. مقدمے کی نوعیت
 (Nature of Dispute)
یہ مقدمہ دراصل

دعویٰ بر مبنی بر زبانی تحفہ 
(Oral Gift/Hiba)

جس کے ذریعے دیگر قانونی وارثوں (خصوصاً بیٹی) کو جائیداد سے محروم کیا گیا

اور اس کی بنیاد صرف میوٹیشن پر رکھی گئی

2. بنیادی قانونی سوالات
 (Core Legal Questions)
کیا محض میوٹیشن زبانی تحفہ ثابت کرنے کے لیے کافی ہے؟

کیا قانونی وارث کو محروم کرنے کے لیے خاص وجوہات ثابت کرنا لازم ہے؟

زبانی تحفہ ثابت کرنے کا بارِ ثبوت (Burden of Proof) کس پر ہے؟

کیا سول جج نے قانون کو درست طور پر اپلائی کیا؟

ایڈیشنل ڈسٹرکٹ جج کا فیصلہ کیوں درست قرار پایا؟

3. زبانی تحفہ (Hiba)
 کا قانونی فریم ورک
(Muslim Personal Law)
قانونِ اسلام اور عدالتی نظائر کے مطابق زبانی تحفہ کے تین لازمی اجزاء ہیں

اعلانِ تحفہ (Declaration)

قبولیت (Acceptance)

قبضے کی منتقلی (Delivery of Possession)

 اگر ان تین میں سے کوئی ایک بھی ثابت نہ ہو تو تحفہ قانوناً غیر مؤثر ہے۔

4. بارِ ثبوت
 (Burden of Proof)
قانونِ شہادت، 1984
دفعہ 117 – Burden of Proof
جو شخص کسی حقیقت کا دعویٰ کرے، اس پر اس کا ثبوت لانا لازم ہے۔

 اس مقدمے میں

مدعی/تحفہ لینے والا دعویٰ کر رہا تھا

لہٰذا بھاری بارِ ثبوت اسی پر تھا

دفعہ 122 
Particular Facts
جب خاص حقیقت (oral gift) دعویٰ کی جائے تو خاص ثبوت ضروری ہوتا ہے

 یہاں

نہ اعلان ثابت

نہ قبولیت

نہ قبضے کی منتقلی

5. قانونی وارثوں کی محرومی
 (Disinheritance of Legal Heirs)
عدالتی اصول (Settled Law)

جب تحفہ کے ذریعے قدرتی وارثوں کو محروم کیا جائے تو:

خاص وجوہات
 (Special Reasons)

اور ان کا ثبوت ضروری ہے

متعلقہ اصول
بیٹی یا دیگر وارثوں کو محض ناپسندیدگی یا خاموشی کی بنیاد پر محروم نہیں کیا جا سکتا

عدمِ ذکر = عدمِ ثبوت

 اس مقدمے میں

نہ کسی وجہ کا ذکر

نہ کسی وجہ کا ثبوت

6. میوٹیشن کی قانونی حیثیت
مستقل عدالتی اصول
Mutation is not a document of title

یعنی

میوٹیشن صرف ریونیو ریکارڈ کے لیے ہوتی ہے

یہ

ملکیت منتقل نہیں کرتی

تحفہ ثابت نہیں کرتی

متعلقہ قانونی اصول:
میوٹیشن کا اندراج اعلان، قبولیت یا قبضہ کا متبادل نہیں

 سول جج نے میوٹیشن کو

اعلان

قبولیت

قبضہ
تینوں کا نعم البدل مان لیا
جو سنگین قانونی غلطی تھی

7. CPC 
کے تحت قانونی نقائص
Order XIV Rule 1  Issues
تحفہ کے لازمی اجزاء پر درست Issues فریم نہیں کیے گئے

Order XX Rule 5  Judgment
فیصلہ قانونی نکات پر بحث کے بغیر دیا گیا

Section 3 CPC 
 Adjudication of Civil Rights
سول حقوق کا فیصلہ قانون کے مطابق ہونا لازم ہے، مفروضات پر نہیں

8. اپیلیٹ کورٹ 
(Addl. District Judge)
 کا درست کردار
ایڈیشنل ڈسٹرکٹ جج نے

بارِ ثبوت کو درست طور پر مدعی پر رکھا
 زبانی تحفہ کے اجزاء کی عدم موجودگی کو نوٹ کیا
میوٹیشن کی محدود حیثیت کو تسلیم کیا
 وارثوں کی بلاجواز محرومی کو غلط قرار دیا

اسی لیے

سول جج کا فیصلہ کالعدم
اپیل منظور

9. ہائی کورٹ کی توثیق (LHC)
ہائی کورٹ نے

Settled Principles
 کو دہرایا

سول جج کے فیصلے کو 
misreading & non-reading of evidence 
قرار دیا

اپیلیٹ کورٹ کے فیصلے کو قانون کے مطابق مانا

10. نتیجاً مختصراً 
قانونی طور پر ثابت ہوا کہ
 محض میوٹیشن زبانی تحفہ ثابت نہیں کرتی
 بغیر وجہ وارث کو محروم نہیں کیا جا سکتا
 تحفہ لینے والا ثبوت دینے میں ناکام رہا
 اپیلیٹ کورٹ کا فیصلہ درست
 ریویژن خارج ہونا قانونی تقاضا تھا

Election petition-Affidavit of service-Mandatory requirements, non-compliance of-Effect-Claim of the respondent (returned candidate) was that only few documents were sent along-with the election petition and even the election petition sent to him was dissimilar to the one which had been instituted before the Election Tribunal-Validity--Section 144(2)(e) of the Elections Act, 2017 provides that affidavit of service has to be to the effect that a copy of the petition along with copies of all annexures, including the list of witnesses, affidavits and documentary evidence, has to be sent to all the respondents by registered post or courier service--The affidavit of service relied upon to maintain the present election did not disclose if the affidavits of witnesses had been enclosed or sent to the respondents/ candidates-A rubber stamp affixed by the oath commissioner on said affidavit revealed significant discrepancies, person or if the election-petitioner was personally known to him-Election petition was rejected, in circumstances. 

-S. 144-Mandatory requirements qua affidavit etc., non-compliance of--Election petition, rejection of-Stance of the election-petitioner was that the scheme of the Elections Act, 2017 was such that instead of going into the technicalities or straightaway rejection of the election petition the issues were required to be framed permitting the parties to lead their evidence-Validity-Stance of the election-petitioner was misconceived as jurisdiction exercised in matters of election disputes was both unique and restricted, necessitating strict adherence to the statutory guidelines that established it-As such, when examiningthe trial of election disputes, the Tribunal operates within a defined framework that restricts its flexibility, as it must comply with the explicit dictates of the Elections Act, 2017.

---Ss. 9(2), Sr. No.(6) & 48---Limitation Act (IX of 1908), First Sched., Arts. 155 & 157---Appeal filing of---Limitation---Possession of narcotic substances---Acquittal of accused person by Special Court---Appeal against acquittal filed before the High Court---Appeal under S. 48 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, is required to be filed within 60 days from the date of judgment in terms of Art. 155 of limitation Act, 1908---Prosecution case was that 02-kilograms ICE was recovered from the possession of accused-appellant---In this case, the impugned judgment was announced on 11.09.2024---Certified copy submitted with the appeal indicated that it was requested on 11.09.2024; was prepared on 18.09.2024; and was delivered on the same day---Appeal was filed on 19.11.2024, whereas it should have been submitted on or before 18.11.2024; thus, appeal was admittedly not within time---Legal position was that an appeal under S.48 of the Act, 1997, against the findings of the Special Court before the High Court was required to be filed within sixty (60) days from the date of judgment in terms of Art. 155 of the Limitation Act, 1908---Lapse of time is sufficient, in criminal matters, to protect a person who has been acquitted against further judicial process---Therefore, the appeal also merits dismissal on the ground of limitation---Criminal acquittal appeal was dismissed in limine.

فیصلہ ۔۔۔۔
دیوانی اور فوجداری کارروائیاں بیک وقت—دائرہ اختیار—
کوئی ایسا آفاقی اصول موجود نہیں کہ جب بھی کسی دیوانی دعویٰ اور فوجداری مقدمہ کا موضوع ایک جیسا یا ملتا جلتا ہو تو لازماً فوجداری عدالت میں جاری کارروائی کو روک دیا جائے۔

فوجداری کارروائی کو روکنے یا نہ روکنے کا فیصلہ سراسر عدالتی صوابدید (Discretion) کا معاملہ ہے۔
البتہ رہنما اصول یہ ہے کہ آیا کارروائی جاری رہنے کی صورت میں ملزم کے ساتھ ناانصافی یا تعصب (Prejudice) کا اندیشہ ہے یا نہیں۔
اگر ملزم کی فوجداری ذمہ داری دیوانی مقدمے کے نتیجے پر منحصر ہو، یا دونوں اس قدر باہم مربوط ہوں کہ فیصلوں کے ٹکراؤ کی صورت میں سنگین ناانصافی کا خطرہ ہو، تو فوجداری کارروائی کو مؤخر (Held in abeyance) رکھا جانا چاہیے۔

1۔ بنیادی قانونی سوال 
(Core Legal Question)
کیا جب ایک ہی معاملہ یا اسی سے متعلق حقائق پر دیوانی دعویٰ اور فوجداری مقدمہ بیک وقت زیرِ سماعت ہوں تو فوجداری کارروائی کو لازماً معطل (Stay) کیا جائے؟

2
۔
طے شدہ قانونی اصول 
(Settled Legal Position)
لاہور ہائی کورٹ نے واضح کیا کہ

کوئی ایسا آفاقی یا لازمی اصول موجود نہیں کہ دیوانی اور فوجداری مقدمات کے ایک جیسے موضوع کی بنیاد پر فوجداری کارروائی کو خود بخود روک دیا جائے۔

یہ اصول سپریم کورٹ کے مسلسل فیصلوں سے ماخوذ ہے۔

3
۔ عدالتی صوابدید
 (Judicial Discretion)
اہم نکتہ
فوجداری کارروائی کو روکنے یا جاری رکھنے کا فیصلہ عدالتی صوابدید پر منحصر ہے، جو مندرجہ ذیل بنیادوں پر استعمال کی جائے گی:

ہر کیس کے حقائق و حالات

الزامات کی نوعیت

فوجداری ذمہ داری کا دیوانی حق سے تعلق

فیصلوں کے ٹکراؤ (Conflict) کا امکان

4
۔ رہنما اصول 
(Guiding Test)
عدالت نے مندرجہ ذیل Test وضع کیا:

 Prejudice Test
کیا فوجداری کارروائی جاری رہنے سے ملزم کو ناقابلِ تلافی نقصان (Prejudice) پہنچنے کا حقیقی خدشہ ہے؟

5۔ فوجداری کارروائی کب روکی جائے؟
عدالت کے مطابق فوجداری کارروائی اس صورت میں روکی جائے گی جب:

(i) فوجداری ذمہ داری مکمل طور پر دیوانی مقدمے کے فیصلے پر منحصر ہو
مثلاً:

ملکیت (Title)

معاہدے کی درستگی

حقِ ملکیت یا قبضہ

(ii) دیوانی و فوجداری معاملات اس قدر باہم مربوط ہوں
کہ مختلف عدالتوں سے متضاد فیصلوں کا خطرہ ہو، جس سے:

سنگین ناانصافی

عدالتی تضاد

انصاف کے بنیادی اصول مجروح ہوں

6
۔ فوجداری کارروائی کب نہیں روکی جائے گی؟
عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ محض یہ وجوہات کافی نہیں:
ایک ہی واقعہ سے دونوں کارروائیاں پیدا ہوئیں

ایک ہی فریقین ملوث ہیں

دیوانی مقدمہ پہلے دائر ہو چکا ہے

فوجداری مقدمہ دباؤ ڈالنے کے لیے دائر ہونے کا الزام

اگر جرم کے اجزاء (Ingredients of offence) بظاہر پورے ہو رہے ہوں تو فوجداری کارروائی جاری رہے گی۔

7
۔ متعلقہ قانونی دفعات
فوجداری ضابطہ (Cr.P.C)
دفعہ 561-A (ہائی کورٹ کے اختیارات)

دفعہ 249-A (مجسٹریٹ کے اختیارات)

دفعہ 265-K (ٹرائل کورٹ کا اختیار)

دیوانی ضابطہ (CPC)
دفعہ 10 CPC (Sub Judice)

یہ دفعہ فوجداری کارروائی پر لاگو نہیں ہوتی — عدالت نے بالواسطہ طور پر اس اصول کی توثیق کی۔

8
۔ سپریم کورٹ کے رہنما نظائر
عدالت نے جن اہم فیصلوں پر انحصار کیا، ان کا خلاصہ:

PLD 1968 SC 281 (Muhammad Akbar case)
دیوانی و فوجداری کارروائیاں بیک وقت چل سکتی ہیں۔

PLD 1984 SC 95
فوجداری کارروائی صرف اسی وقت روکی جائے گی جب ناانصافی کا حقیقی خدشہ ہو۔

PLD 1992 SC 353
دیوانی تنازعہ فوجداری جرم کو ختم نہیں کرتا۔

PLD 2006 SC 771
عدالتی صوابدید کا محتاط استعمال لازم ہے۔

PLD 2011 SC 509
انصاف کا تقاضا مقدمات کو میکانکی انداز میں روکنا نہیں۔

9
۔ عملی وکالتی اہمیت
 (Practical Advocacy Value)
 دفاع (Defence) کے لیے:
اگر الزام کا دارومدار ملکیت/معاہدہ پر ہے → فوجداری کارروائی روکنے کی درخواست قابلِ سماعت

اگر صرف فوجداری نیت 
(Mens rea) 
متنازع ہو
کارروائی جاری رہے گی

 استغاثہ (Prosecution) کے لیے:
دیوانی دعویٰ کا زیرِ سماعت ہونا جرم کو غیر مؤثر نہیں بناتا

ہر جرم کو اس کے قانونی اجزاء پر پرکھا جائے گا

10

 نتیجاً مختصراً ۔۔۔۔۔۔
PLD 2022 Lahore 773 
نے ایک بار پھر یہ اصول مستحکم کیا کہ

دیوانی اور فوجداری کارروائیاں بیک وقت چل سکتی ہیں؛
فوجداری کارروائی کا التواء استثناء (Exception) ہے، اصول نہیں۔

اور یہ استثناء صرف اسی صورت میں دیا جائے گا جب:

سنگین ناانصافی کا حقیقی خطرہ ہو

فیصلوں کے تصادم کا امکان ہو

ملزم کے بنیادی حقوق متاثر ہوں

--Relevancy and admissibility---Scope---Though by judicial reasoning relevant evidence is usually admissible but there are certain restrictions on admissibility depending upon exclusionary rules of evidence---Such artificial restrictions on the process of judicial reasoning known as rules of evidence are not uniform in the policy they seek to implement--- Rules of evidence are all attributable to policy considerations and have nothing to do with their value or links in rational chain of reasoning which restrict, rather than promote access to potentially useful information---Unlike relevance, admissibility has nothing to do with probative or logical relationship between evidence tendered and effect to be proved---Admissibility involves exclusively a determination of whether law of evidence permits relevant evidence of a particular kind to be received by the court---Some evidence, such as hearsay, is excluded, even though relevant, because of danger of unreliability inherent in repeated statements and because it cannot be cross-examined effectively---Confession of accused though relevant yet if recorded while in police custody is not admissible because of the reason it can be procured due to threat, duress or coercion thus regarded as unreliable---Some evidence such as evidence of previous bad character of accused in a criminal case is excluded, even though relevant, because of considerations of fairness to the accused and danger of prejudice flowing from judge’s becoming aware of his records.
---

----Classification of Evidence---Any given item of judicial evidence may attract more than one of the labels by which varieties of evidence have been classified---Principal labels are (i) Testimony, (ii) Hearsay evidence, (iii) Documentary evidence, (iv) Real evidence and (v) Circumstantial evidence---Testimony means direct evidence; hearsay, an indirect evidence; documentary evidence means presentation of facts through documents; real evidence includes material things (like case property)---In addition to material objects, real evidence also includes documents, physical appearance of persons and animals, demeanour of witnesses, intonation of voices on a tape recording, views, inspections out of courts of locus in quo or of some object which it is impossible or highly inconvenient to bring to court, and, possibly, out-of-court demonstrations or re-enactments of acts or events into which Court is inquiring---Circumstantial evidence means evidence of relevant facts like motive, plans and preparatory acts, capacity, opportunity, identity, continuance, failure to give evidence, failure to provide evidence and standards of comparison.

 Additional evidence---Fact in issue and relevant fact---Criminal charge---Proof---Accused was aggrieved of summoning of two witnesses by Trial Court as additional witnesses---Plea raised by accused was that testimony of both the witnesses was hearsay and not relevant to facts in issue---Validity---Charge in Court has to be proved through evidence as defined in Art. 2(c) of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, which includes “all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under inquiry---Article 18 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, ordains that evidence can only be given of “fact in issue” and “relevant fact” which commands that Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 is an exhaustive statute---Evidence can only be given in the manner as permitted by Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 and no other hypothesis how strong or relevant can be allowed to be brought on record unless Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, permits or accepts it as admissible---What one prosecution witness had observed by her senses could only be deposed by her and none other as required by Art. 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Other prosecution witness was witness of facts touching preparation of offence as mentioned in Art. 21 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 and explanatory to fact in issue as per Art. 22 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, when she had seen accused in naked condition with victim, thus her evidence was also admissible---Permission to bring on record relevant evidence is controlled by exclusionary rules---Court while admitting evidence is to refer gist of evidence or question to be asked, objection if any, reply thereto, and decision thereon before it is made part and parcel of judicial record---Where a judge after attending provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 and precedents on the subject is in doubt as to admissibility of a particular piece of evidence he should declare it in favour of admissibility rather than inadmissibility because its value would later be determined by Court of Appeal as per Art. 162 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---High Court directed Trial Court to proceed to record evidence of two prosecution witnesses summoned as additional witnesses from the stage it was discontinued---

----Art. 131 Qanun-e-Shahadat---Evidence, recording of---Objection to admissibility---Scope---Any objection on admissibility of evidence by any party is to be attended by Court then and there and decided first so as to proceed further in the matter---Such objection should not be reserved for its decision at fag end of trial.

 Examination-in-chief, recording of--- Techniques---During examination-in-chief, two out of many techniques are most popular which are allowed to be followed by prosecution i.e. (i) signposting, and (ii) piggybacking---Signposting in fact is an indicator to alert witness to a particular part of his testimony e.g. telling the witness that now some questions would be asked about his status/work or questions about his relation with other witnesses and so on---Such bit-by-bit examination helps the witness to recollect facts clearly and it is permissible as per international best practices---Piggybacking is a form of question arranged with the part of answer given by witness while using it as prefix to next question.

JUDGMENT
---This revision petition has been filed against order dated 24.01.2022 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore during the trial in Case FIR No. 1577/2019 dated 07.12.2019 under section 376, P.P.C., Police Station Sundar, Lahore whereby application of the petitioner was dismissed and his prayer was declined for exclusion of hearsay evidence, recording of objections and decision thereon as per law.

2.    Briefly, the proposition tabled before the court carried facts that Nasreen Bibi and Alishba Ramzan, two witnesses of facts relevant to commission of rape, were summoned by the learned trial court under section 540 of Cr.P.C. vide order dated 02.12.2021; such order though was not assailed yet objection was raised by the defence about admissibility of the evidence during recording of their examination-in-chief as being hearsay; refusal to record such objection pushed the petitioner to move an application before the trial court but it was turned down on the same day through impugned order dated 24.01.2022 on the ground that it has been filed to cause delay in conclusion of trial.

3.    Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that Nasreen Bibi who was recorded as PW-3 is not the eye-witness rather after the occurrence she observed fearful expression of her daughter Alishba Ramzan who too was not the victim nor had seen the petitioner (her father) committing rape with Iqra rather carrying an evidence of fact that she saw him sleeping with Iqra in naked condition. Though examination-in-chief of Alishba too was recorded as PW-4, yet what can be brought on record through direct evidence, court is trying to place it through indirect evidence of Nasreen Bibi and has also refused to record and decide the objections raised by defence on the admissibility of such evidence which is against the law and precedents on the subject. She has placed reliance on case reported as “Hayatullah v. The State” (2018 SCMR 2092) in this respect.

4.    On the other hand, learned counsels for the complainant have urged that petitioner has not assailed the summoning order of such witnesses and thereby acquiesced the admissibility of their evidence; this petition has been filed to linger on the criminal process.

5.    Arguments of proponent and opponent were heard; record perused.

6.    Resume of facts collected in the process indicates that one Iqra aged about 11 years whose father had died and with the consent of her mother Parveen Imran, she was brought up by her maternal aunt Nasreen Bibi. Muhammad Ramzan, petitioner was the husband of said Nasreen Bibi who committed rape with Iqra allegedly many times. Last reported rape was formalized through present FIR. Now Nasreen Bibi was summoned by the trial court to depose about the facts she observed when returned home at a point of time, heard about rape with Iqra and facts ensued thereafter including story told by Alishba that she saw her father with Iqra in naked condition.

7.    The main thrust catches two points to elaborate for the assistance of trial court and parties to trial; (i) whether evidence of Nasreen Bibi is admissible under the rules of evidence, (ii) how and when to decide objections with regard to admissibility of any evidence.

 
 
8.    Though by judicial reasoning relevant evidence is usually admissible but there are certain restrictions on admissibility depending upon the exclusionary rules of evidence. These artificial restrictions on the process of judicial reasoning known as the rules of evidence are not uniform in the policy they seek to implement. Note that they are all attributable to policy considerations, and have nothing to do with their value or links in the rational chain of reasoning. They restrict, rather than promote access to potentially useful information. They may be classified according to their underlying policy; they are as under;

 
 
(a)   Structural rules (e.g., rules about the burden and standard of proof, authentication of exhibits), which provides a framework for dealing with evidence at trial.

(b)   Preferential rules (e.g., the best evidence rule), design to avoid accepting evidence of inferior quality when evidence of superior quality is available.

(c)   Analytic rules (e.g., the rules against hearsay), designs to avoid accepting evidence which experience suggests is likely to be unreliable.

(d)   Prophylactic rules (e.g., the rules generally excluding evidence of previous convictions), designed to avoid accepting evidence which judge may be incapable of evaluating objectively, or to which the judge may attach undue weight (‘Prejudicial evidence’).

(e)   Simplificatory rules (e.g., The rule permitting summaries of voluminous documents), designs to aid the court in understanding the issues.

(f)    Quantitative rules (e.g., rules requiring corroboration) designed either positively to insist upon multiple evidential facts to prove certain facts in issue or negatively to prevent the needless presentation of cumulative evidence.

(g)   Policy-based rules (e.g., privileges), which preclude the acceptance (or compelled revelation) of certain evidential facts, based on extrinsic policy considerations such as upholding confidentiality, protecting state secrets, etc.

(h)   Discretionary rules, designed to allow the judge to override the rules of evidence in the interest of justice or expedition.1 (however, judge cannot allow inadmissible evidence to be brought on record).

9.    Depending upon above rules, the evidence by which facts may be proved or disproved in a court is known as judicial evidence. Judicial evidence takes only three forms, namely (i) oral evidence, (ii) documentary evidence and (iii) things. Judicial evidence, however, is open to classification not only in terms of the form in which it may be presented in court but also in terms of its substantive content, the purpose for which it is presented and the rules by which its admissibility is determined. Thus, any given item of judicial evidence may attract more than one of the labels by which the varieties of evidence have been classified. The principal labels are (i) Testimony, (ii) Hearsay Evidence, (iii) Documentary Evidence, (iv) Real Evidence and (v) Circumstantial Evidence. Testimony means direct evidence; hearsay, an indirect evidence; documentary evidence means presentation of facts through documents; real evidence includes material things (like case property); in addition to material objects, including documents, items of real evidence also include the physical appearance of persons and animals, the demeanour of witnesses, the intonation of voices on a tape recording, views, that is inspections out of courts of the locus in quo or of some object which it is impossible or highly inconvenient to bring to court, and, possibly, out-of-court demonstrations or re-enactments of acts or events into which the court is enquiring. Circumstantial evidence means evidence of relevant facts like motive, plans and preparatory acts, capacity, opportunity, identity, continuance, failure to give evidence, failure to provide evidence and standards of comparison.2

 
 

 
 
10.  A charge in the court is proved through evidence as defined in Article 2(c), Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (hereinafter called QSO, 1984) which includes “all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under inquiry; such statements are called oral evidence; and all documents produced for the inspection of the Court are called documentary evidence. Depending upon above definition, only the court is authorized to permit or require any witness to depose before it to state the facts in relation to a matter under inquiry and it is done in two ways, either witness volunteers to depose and court permits, or court calls a witness and requires him to depose. In both situations, witnesses depose through facts; A “fact” is defined in Article 2 (d) of QSO, 1984; according to it, "fact" includes (i) anything, state of things, or relation of things capable of being perceived by the senses and (ii) any mental condition of which any person is conscious. The Facts which are open to proof or disproof in court of law are (i) facts in issue, (ii) relevant facts and (iii) collateral facts. Fact in issue is regarded as “factum probandum” i.e., the principal fact, whereas relevant fact is termed as “factum probans” i.e., the evidentiary fact from which the principal fact follows immediately or by inference, or from which existence or non-existence of a fact in issue may be inferred. Collateral facts, sometime referred as ‘subordinate facts’ are of three kinds: (i) facts affecting the competence of witness (ii) facts affecting the credibility of a witness: and (iii) facts, sometimes called ‘preliminary facts’ which must be proved as a condition precedent to the admissibility of certain items of evidence tendered to prove a fact in issue or a relevant fact. As to the first, an example would be that a potential witness suffers from a mental handicap rendering him incompetent to testify. An example of collateral fact of the second kind would be that a witness, who testifies to the effect that he saw a certain event at a distance of 50 yards, suffers from an eye complaint which prevents him from seeing anything at a distance of greater than 20 yards. Such a witness may be cross-examined about his eye complaint and, if he denies its existence, evidence in rebuttal may be given by an oculist. A collateral fact of the third kind may be illustrated by the reference to an exception to the rule against hearsay: in criminal proceedings a statement made by a participant or an observer of an event is admissible as evidence of the truth of its contents, by way of exception to the rule against hearsay, on proof that it was made at the time of or shortly before or after the event in question in circumstances of such spontaneity or involvement in that event that the possibility of concoction or error can be disregarded.3 Facts in issue and relevant facts in our law of evidence find their space in QSO, 1984. Article 2(2) explains relevant fact, it says, “one fact is said to be relevant to another when the one is connected with the other in any of the ways referred to in the provisions of the Order relating to the relevancy of facts.” All the facts explained in Articles 19 to 69 are regarded as relevant facts. Similarly, Article 2(3) of QSO, 1984 explains facts in issue, it says, “the expression "facts in issue" includes any fact from which, either by itself or in connection with other facts the existence, non-existence, nature or extent of any right, liability or disability, asserted or denied in any suit or proceeding, necessarily follows. Illustration attached to the Article further explains it.

11.  As discussed above alongside the facts in issue, evidence of relevant facts and collateral facts be brought on record to complete the picture. Chapter-III of QSO, 1984 titled “OF THE RELEVANCY OF FACTS”, deals exhaustively with production of relevant evidence. Article 18 ordains as under;

       18. Evidence may be given of facts in issue and relevant facts: Evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are hereinafter declared to be relevant and of no others.

(Bold and underlined for Emphasis)

 
 
This Article ordains that evidence could only be given of “fact in issue” and “relevant fact” which commands that QSO, 1984 is an exhaustive statute, evidence could only be given in the manner as permitted by the Order; no other hypothesis how strong or relevant cannot be allowed to bring on record unless statute ibid permits or accepts it as admissible. Admissibility of evidence is apparently gauged through the words “relevant or irrelevant” used in Articles of QSO, 1984 in the light of specific exclusionary rules which excludes even the relevant evidence. One of the key concepts underpinning the whole of the law of evidence is relevance: irrelevant evidence is not admissible, but this does not mean that evidence will be admissible simply because it is relevant; evidence is frequently excluded notwithstanding its clear and obvious relevance to a fact in issue. The requirement of relevance is thus the first hurdle; only if the evidence is relevant is it then appropriate to consider whether it is excluded by some other rule of admissibility. An oft-quoted definition of relevance is to be found in Stephen’s Digest of the Law of Evidence:

       “The word ‘relevant’ means that any two facts to which it is applied are so related to each other that according to the common course of events one either taken by itself or in connection with other facts proves or renders probable the past, present, or future existence or non-existence of the other.” [12th edn., 1948 (revised), London; Macmillan, art 1]

       In DPP v Kilbourne (1973), Lord Simon said this: -

       “Evidence is relevant if it is logically probative or disprobative of some matters which requires proof. I do not pause to analyze what is involved in ‘logical probativeness’, except to note that the term does not of itself express the element of experience, which is so significant of its operation in law, and possibly elsewhere. It is sufficient to say... that relevant (that is, logically probative or disprobative) evidence is evidence which makes the matters which requires proof more or less probable.”

So, evidence is relevant if it assists in the process of proving or disproving a fact in issue; but where the line is drawn? How does one decide whether the evidence assists in this process or not? There is no fixed answer, except that, as his Lordship indicates, the matter is one of experience. It can be of particular importance in similar fact situations.

12.  For the proof of fact in issue, relevant facts are admissible in evidence which have been counted in QSO, 1984. The Article 19 is first in line to throw light on relevancy of facts which says;

       “Facts, which though not in issue, are so connected with a fact in issue as to form part of the same transaction, are relevant whether they occurred at the same time and place or at different times and places”

The Article requires to give evidence of facts forming part of same transaction occurred at the same time and place or at different times and places. A victim stating fact of occurrence to a third person in the form of ‘res gestae’ is admissible evidence if brought through the testimony of that third person. Reference can be made to case reported as “Faqir Muhammad v. The State” (PLD 1971 Lahore 929). Even a witness of occurrence deposing before his father what he has seen is also an admissible evidence as opposed to hearsay evidence. Reliance is on case reported as “Riasat Ali and another v. The State” (PLD 1991 Supreme Court 397). If a fact is explained by the accused before any person, it becomes a relevant evidence, thus admissible, citation in this respect is “C.N. Peters v. The State” (AIR 1959 483) [Allahabad High Court]; similarly, if an accused admits his guilt before a private person, it also becomes admissible evidence. In our law of evidence, such informal admission is known as extra judicial confession regulated under Article 119(a) of QSO, 1984. To regard a fact as a res gestae evidence, it is essential that it must qualify the characteristics which include (i) Spontaneous exclamation (ii) Contemporaneous physical condition (iii) Present intention (iv) Statement accompanying an act. In this respect case reported as “Rizwan Akhtar alias Razi Bawa and another v. The State” (2021 YLR 2253) is referred. This clearly shows that a victim or a witness if states immediately anything which he has observed before, at or after the occurrence in relation to fact in issue or relevant fact to any person, the testimony of that person becomes admissible into evidence. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case reported as “Raja Khurram Ali Khan and 2 others v. Tayyaba Bibi and another” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 146), acknowledged tender years’ exception to hearsay rules particularly in rape case. That is the reason when anything is deposed before an investigating officer by the witness or victim, the evidence of investigating officer about such facts becomes admissible and the defence in order to shatter the statement of witness confront him with his previous statement.

13.  The evidence of a particular fact is deposed by the very witness as regulated under Article-71 of QSO, 1984; which says;

       “If it refers to a fact, which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he saw it; If it refers to a fact, which could be heard, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he heard it; If it refers to a fact, which could be perceived by any other sense or in any other manner, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he perceived it by that sense or in that manner; If it refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it must be the evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those grounds.”

It shows, any relevant fact perceived by senses could only be deposed by the witness who perceived it and no other. All facts which are incidental to main fact or explanatory to it are regarded as relevant facts or collateral facts which can be deposed even carrying status as “res gestae” evidence. Case reported as “Muhammad Aslam Shah v. The State” (1993 PCr.LJ 704) [Peshawar] is referred. What facts could be incidental or explanatory to main fact have very elaborately been counted in QSO, 1984; but following Articles aptly applied in the case in hand: -

       “Article 21. Motive, preparation and, previous or subsequent conduct: (1) Any fact is relevant which shows or constitutes a motive or preparation for any fact in issue or relevant fact.

       Article 22. Facts necessary to explain or introduce relevant facts: Facts necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which support or rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which establish the identity of anything or person whose identity is relevant, or fix the time or place at which any fact in issue, or relevant fact happened, or Which show the relation of parties by whom any such fact was transacted, are relevant in so far as they are necessary for that purpose.”

(Bold and underlined for emphasis)

A fact which shows preparation of any fact in issue or relevant fact must be allowed to bring on record and similarly if some facts explain further, support or rebut any of the fact in issue or relevant fact could safely be made part of evidence under above permitted provisions.

 
 
14.  In the light of above discussion, it is vividly clear that the witness Alishba PW-4 when appeared before Nasreen Bibi PW-3, she observed her fainted and a link fact Alishba stated of viewing her father while sleeping with Iqra in naked condition clubs both the facts as part of same transaction encompassing observation of Nasreen Bibi and simultaneous deposition of Alishba; therefore, what Nasreen Bibi observed by her senses could only be deposed by Nasreen herself and none other as required by Article 71 of QSO, 1984. Alishba was also witness of facts touching the preparation of offence as mention in the Article 21 of QSO, 1984 and explanatory to fact in issue as per Article 22 of Order ibid when she had seen her father in a naked condition with Iqra/victim, thus her evidence is also admissible.

Determination of admissibility of evidence

15.  How to determine admissibility of evidence and when to decide objections if any, is the questions to be met in this part. The first instruction in this regard is found mentioned in High Court Rules and Orders; relevant part of Chapter-1 is reproduced for reference: -

       PART E -- RECORD OF EVIDENCE IN CRIMINAL CASES

       1. Only relevant evidence should be recorded:---In recording evidence, Magistrates should take care to see that it is relevant and admissible under the provisions of the [Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984]. If any objection is raised as to the admissibility of any evidence, the Magistrate should endeavour to decide it forthwith and the particular piece of evidence objected to, the objection and the decision thereon should be clearly recorded.

       2. Duty of Court to elucidate facts:---Magistrates should endeavour to elucidate the facts and record the evidence in a clear and intelligible manner. As pointed out in 23 P.R. 1917, a Judge in a Criminal trial is not merely a disinterested auditor of the contest between the prosecution and the defence, but it is his duty to elucidate points left in obscurity by either side, intentionally or unintentionally, to come to a clear understanding of the actual events that occurred and to remove obscurities as far as possible. The wide powers given to the court by * [Article 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984] ***[...] should be judiciously utilized for this purpose when necessary.

The statutory provision in this respect is part of QSO, 1984 in the form of Article 131 which is reproduced as under for reference:

       131. Judge to decide as to admissibility of evidence:

       (1) When either party proposes to give evidence of any fact, the Judge may ask the party proposing to give the evidence in what manner the alleged fact, if proved, would be relevant, and the Judge shall admit the evidence if he thinks that the fact, if proved, would be relevant and not otherwise.

       (2) If the fact proposed, to be proved is one of which evidence is admissible only upon proof of some other fact, such last mentioned fact must be proved before evidence is given of the fact first mentioned unless the party undertakes to give proof of such fact, and the Court is satisfied with such undertaking.

       (3) If the relevancy of one alleged fact depends upon another alleged fact being first proved, the Judge may in his discretion, either permit evidence of the first fact to be given before the second fact is proved, or require evidence to be given of the second fact before evidence is given of the first fact.

The above Article when read with attached illustrations finally states three situations for admissibility of evidence; Sub-Article (1) deals with admissibility of relevant evidence; Sub-Article (2) talks about conditional admissibility of a fact with undertaking to prove connected or collateral facts; Sub-Article (3) gives discretion to the court in receiving the evidence of first or second fact, in such an arrangement as deems appropriate. Two forms of admissibility are most common to be used to bring on record the relevant evidence which are as follows:

       Multiple admissibility: where evidence is inadmissible for one purpose, it cannot be excluded if it is admissible for another. For example, an out of court statement may be inadmissible for the purpose of proving the truth of its contents, because of the rule against hearsay, but admissible, as original evidence, for the purpose of proving that this statement was made. This principle has been described, somewhat misleadingly, as one of multiple admissibility.4

       Conditional admissibility: an item of evidence, viewed in isolation, may appear to be irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. Taken together with or seen in the light of some other item of evidence, its relevance may become apparent. Evidence, however, can only be given at a trial in piecemeal fashion, by degrees, and it may be impossible to reduce the second item of evidence before the first. In order to overcome this difficulty, the first item of evidence may be admitted conditionally or de bene esse. If, viewed in the light of evidence subsequently adduced, it becomes relevant, it may be taken into account. If, notwithstanding the evidence subsequently adduced, it remains irrelevant, it must be disregarded.5

 
 
16.  Unlike relevance, admissibility has nothing to do with the probative or logical relationship between the evidence tendered and the effect to be proved. Admissibility involves exclusively a determination of whether the law of evidence permits relevant evidence of a particular kind to be received by the court. Some evidence, such as hearsay, is excluded, even though relevant, because of the danger of unreliability inherent in repeated statements and because it cannot be cross-examined on effectively. Confession of accused though relevant yet if recorded while in police custody is not admissible because of the reason it can be procured due to threat, duress or coercion thus regarded as unreliable. Some evidence such as evidence of the previous bad character of accused in a criminal case, is excluded, even though relevant, because of considerations of fairness to the accused and the danger of prejudice flowing from the judge’s becoming aware of his records. Some evidence, for example privileged materials and materials which may be withheld on the ground of public policy, are excluded, even though relevant, for reasons of policy that override the interest of the courts and the parties in having access to all available evidence. Some witnesses (for example young children) are held to be incompetent to testify at all, and others to be incompetent to testify in certain ways (for example, the rule excluding non-expert opinion testimony in most cases) despite the relevance of the testimony which might otherwise be given. The rules of admissibility are, therefore, unconcerned with the extent to which the tendered evidence might be probative or disprobative of fact in issue. They proceed from consideration other than relevance. It is this that gives to the law of evidence its exclusionary aspect. Inadmissible evidence cannot be received by the court, whatever its relevance and indeed however cogent it might have been. Honourable Supreme Court in a case reported as “Mst. Akhtar Sultana v. Major Retd. Muzaffar Khan MALIK through his legal heirs and others” (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 715) has dealt the relevancy and admissibility in following terms:

 
 
       (i) Relevant and admissible evidence

       10. The Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 ("Qanun-e-Shahadat") governs the law of evidence in our country. The expression "relevancy" and "admissibility" have their own distinct legal implications under the Qanun-e-Shahadat as, more often than not, facts which are relevant may not be admissible. On the one hand, a fact is "relevant" if it is logically probative or dis-probative of the fact-in-issue, which requires proof. On the other hand, a fact is "admissible" if it is relevant and not excluded by any exclusionary provision, express or implied.2 What is to be understood is that unlike "relevance", which is factual and determined solely by reference to the logical relationship between the fact claimed to be relevant and the fact-in-issue, "admissibility" is a matter of law. Thus, a "relevant" fact would be "admissible" unless it is excluded from being admitted, or is required to be proved in a particular mode(s) before it can be admitted as evidence, by the provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat. As far as the latter is concerned, and that too relating to documents, admissibility is of two types: (i) admissible subject to proof,3 and (ii) admissible per se,4 that is, when the document is admitted in evidence without requiring proof.

17.  Though discretionary rules of evidence allow the judge to override the rules of evidence in the interest of justice or expedition but there appears to be no common law discretion to admit inadmissible evidence, either in criminal or civil cases. In Myers v. DPP [1965] AC 1001 at 1024, Lord Reid said:

       “in arguments the Solicitor General maintains that, although the general rule may be against the admission of private records to prove the truth of entries in them, the trial judge has discretion to admit a record in a particular case if satisfied that it is trustworthy, and that justice requires its admission. That appears to me to be contrary to the whole framework of the existing law. It is true that a judge has a discretion to exclude legally admissible evidence if justice so requires, but it is very different thing to say that he has a discretion to admit legally inadmissible evidence… No matter how cogent particular evidence may seem to be, unless it comes within a class which is admissible, it is excluded.”

 
 
18.  It is trite that any objection on admissibility of evidence by any party is to be attended by the court then and there and decide the same first so as to proceed further in the matter. Such objection should not be reserved for its decision at the fag end of trial which usually skipped decision due to not reminding the court at that time and in this way inadmissible evidence is brought on record which prejudices the mind of the court, consequently led to wrong decision. There is plethora of judgments on this dictate of law; some of which are cited as under; “Asim Murtaza Khan v. The State through Chairman NAB, Islamabad” (2021 SCMR 1844); “Hayatullah v. The State” (2018 SCMR 2092); “Muhammad Ameen v. The State” (2019 PCr.LJ 412 [Lahore (Multan Bench)]); “Rani Bibi v. The State” (2018 PCr.LJ 310 [Lahore]); “Naveed-ul-Hassan v. The State” (2006 PCr.LJ 1804 [Karachi]); “Asif Jameel and others v. The State” (2003 MLD 676 [Karachi]); “Province of Punjab through Collector, District Gujrat and 2 others v. Muhammad Bashir and another” (1997 MLD 806 [Lahore]).

       In a case reported as “Hayatullah v. The State” (2018 SCMR 2092) cited above, the five Members’ Bench of Honourable Supreme Court has commanded the trial court as well as prosecution to be alert to deflect the inadmissible evidence, otherwise it will not only expose the ability and knowledge of law of the Judge, prosecutor and defence counsel but also case files would be found filled with inadmissible evidence, it has been directed to the trial court in following terms;

       “It is the duty of the court to stop the witness at the moment he utters inadmissible evidence and should not allow to bring on record such inadmissible evidence”

       The Honourable Court further observed;

       “that although sometime objection was raised by either party regarding the inadmissibility of such piece of evidence but the court while admitting the evidence at that time reserves the question of law as to its admissibility till the end of the trial and while delivering the judgment no such question of admissibility is usually decided. It is the duty of the trial court to decide the objection then and there and not to defer the same till the end of the trial”

Sometime though there is no objection on recording of statement of witness yet party raised objection about a particular question asked during recording of statement considering it as irrelevant or inadmissible, even in that eventuality court is obliged to first record the question, then objection and finally decision thereon. Reliance in this respect is on cases reported as Muhammad Munir v. The State (2001 PCr.LJ 1650 [Karachi]); “Liaquat Ali Channa v. Additional Sessions Judge, Gambat, District Khairpur and another” (2012 PCr.LJ 1979 [Sindh]).

19.  Whether the evidence is relevant and admissible, and is required to be brought on record for the purpose of corroboration, it is necessary to follow the scheme of law as ordained in QSO, 1984 and witness may be also be questioned as to any other circumstance which he observed at or near to the time or place at which such relevant fact occurred if the court so considers would help to complete the panoramic view of moments so going on. For reference Article 152 of QSO, 1984 is reproduced:

       152. Questions lending to corroborate evidence of relevant fact admissible: When a witness whom it is intended to corroborate gives evidence of any relevant fact, he may be questioned as to any other circumstances which he observed at or near to the time or place at which such relevant fact occurred if the Court is of opinion that such circumstances, if proved, would corroborate the testimony of the witness as to the relevant fact which he testifies.

       Illustrations

       A, an accomplice, gives an account of robbery in which he took part. He describes various incidents unconnected with the robbery which occurred on his way to and from the place where it was committed.

       Independent evidence of these facts may be given in order to corroborate his evidence as to the robbery itself.

At first, facts would be deposed in response to questions asked as required under Article 152, then previous statements made about such facts be brought on record as per Article 153 and all requirements should be met as required by Article 154 of QSO, 1984.

 
 
20.  The forms of question for examination-in-chief and cross-examination are relatively dealt under Articles 136 to 141 of QSO, 1984; questions starting with words “when, where, what, why, who and how (describe) are permitted to be asked in examination-in-chief as open-ended questions because it does not amount to a leading question; leading questions are also permitted if not objected to by the adverse party. If objected, even with the permission of the court can be asked as per Article 137 of QSO, 1984. During examination-in-chief, two out of many techniques are most popular to be allowed to follow by the prosecution i.e. (i) signposting, and (ii) piggybacking. Signposting in fact is an indicator to alert the witness to a particular part of his testimony e.g. telling the witness that now some questions would be asked about his status/work or questions about his relation with other witnesses and so on; this bit-by-bit examination helps the witness to recollect the facts clearly and it is permissible as per international best practices. Piggybacking is a form of question arranged with the part of answer given by the witness while using it as prefix to next question, e.g., if a witness replied that accused made a fire shot which hit the deceased; then by using technique of piggybacking, next question can be framed like; “when the fire hit the deceased, how did he react or what happened to him”. This technique also helps to produce a conjunction in or a symmetry to evidence. It is the domain of the court to control question which a party wants to ask as per Article 143 of QSO, 1984; therefore, court should remain vigilant while attending such questions and decide its relevancy or admissibility then and there; if a question is asked without reasonable ground, then court can take proper action as required under Articles 144, 145 and 146 of QSO, 1984.

 
 
21.  For what has been discussed above, it is summarized that permission to bring on record the relevant evidence is controlled by exclusionary rules as discussed above, therefore, court while admitting evidence must refer gist of evidence or question to be asked, objection if any, reply thereto, and decision thereon before it is made part and parcel of judicial record. Where a judge after attending the provisions of QSO, 1984 and precedents on the subject is in doubt as to the admissibility of a particular piece of evidence he should declare it in favour of admissibility rather than inadmissibility because its value would later be determined by court of appeal as per Article 162 of QSO, 1984. Keeping in view the conclusion arrived at as referred in paragraph 14 above, learned trial court shall proceed to record the evidence of PW-3 and PW-4 from the stage it was discontinued. From perusal of application of petitioner, and impugned order, it is not reflected that what was the specific objection which has not been attended by the learned trial court; therefore, this writ petition is dismissed; however, if any objection is raised by any party on the form of a question or admissibility of a fact, it shall be attended by the trial court in accordance with law as highlighted above. Learned trial court shall also proceed to complete the trial as early as possible keeping in view the provisions of section 344-A of Cr.P.C.

Criminal Revision No. 15474 of 2022
MUHAMMAD RAMZAN Versus The STATE
[12/30/25, 3:48:27 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2025 P Cr. L J 589

Criminal Appeal No. 812 of 2022
Abdul Basit Versus.The State and others-

--Ss. 365-B & 376---Abducting or inducing woman to compel for marriage, rape---Appreciation of evidence---Ocular account furnished by victim---Victim sole eyewitness of the occurrence---Sufficient for conviction---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Ocular account was furnished by victim/complainant alone, whereas, statement of father of the victim was about post occurrence events---In her examination-in-chief the victim reiterated the story as had been set out in the complaint/FIR and deposed about step by step events in the same sequence---Complainant was subjected to cross-examination at sufficient length but nothing damaging to the prosecution or favourable to the defence could be elicited from her mouth---By tenor of cross-examination the defence tried to bring on record that at one point of time the victim and the accused/appellant were residing in the same village and parents of the accused/appellant as well as victim had friendly relations, thus they both i.e. accused/appellant and the victim, were known to each other---Instead of lending any support to the defence, the admission of the victim on above aspects went on to strengthen the prosecution's stance as it was the case of prosecution itself that because of such friendly relations the accused/appellant used to visit the house of the victim's parents along with co-accused, with whom the victim also developed relations and out of such linkage she left the house along with co-accused to make some purchases and fell prey to nefarious activity by the accused/appellant---Since the statement of the victim, had been found to be worthy of credence, confidence inspiring, credible and irrefutable, therefore, even if she was a sole witness, her statement could safely be made basis to record conviction---Circumstances established that prosecution had proved the case against the appellant beyond shadow of reasonable doubt---

Nude pictures---Legal requirements for using such pictures as evidence for convicting accused---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Audio/video clip including snaps/ photographs as evidence maintained a dual character in the law of evidence; it is termed as document as well as a material thing (physical evidence), also known as real evidence---Snaps/ photographs do carry information that includes expression, gestures, voice and video, therefore, such clips/snaps are sought to be produced before the Court to prove the 'information' contained in it as evidence of facts recorded therein and oral account of which is to be spoken by a witness and not by the document alone---While as material thing it is to be produced for the inspection of Court---Principles of evidence relating to admissibility of documents are fully applicable on such type of evidence---Permission and sanction of law to bring on record evidence if it is in the form of document is regulated under Art.139 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Said Article in the light of illustration therein authorizes the Court to ask, when any witness is making statement about a fact, to support his contention with any document if such fact is incorporated therein---Room for such discretion of Court is obviously reflective of farsighted wisdom of legislature to cater to the requirement of an emerging need of evidence in a particular situation for the purpose of corroboration to fortify or strengthen the deposition---Documentary evidence runs over or defeats the oral evidence under the maxim "res ipsa loquitor"---Second status of such evidence is of material thing (physical evidence) or oral evidence which is produced for the inspection of Court as ordained in second proviso to Art. 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---In the present case pictures were put to the accused/appellant during his statement under S.342, Cr.P.C., for seeking his explanation but neither he challenged such pictures in any manner during cross-examination nor gave any explanation in his statement under S.342, Cr.P.C.---Silence of the accused/appellant over such an important factor connoted that there was nothing to defend against such nude pictures, thus the requirement of law for using these snaps/pictures was completed and those could safely be used as evidence---

Delay of one and half month in lodging the FIR---Inconsequential---Victim trying to protect her honour and reputation and that of her family---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---In this case, undoubtedly, the FIR was registered after almost one and half month of the crime having been committed---However, such delay in reporting the matter to the police was immaterial in the sense that throughout it had been the stance of the victim that her nude pictures were taken by the accused/appellant, she was blackmailed and she fell victim number of times during her captivity under such pressure and fear, therefore, she kept mum in order to save her and the family honour---When nude pictures of victim were thrown in her house and the matter stood disclosed to family members, she narrated the whole occurrence---Thus, victim being an educated lady with qualification of MA English had definitely been thinking about her family honour as well as her social and practical life before reporting the matter to police---Even otherwise, the fact that the modesty of a virgin girl was violated by sexual assault explained the apprehension of the victim and her family in approaching the police immediately---Delay in reporting the crime to the police in respect of an offence involving a person's honour and reputation which society may view unsympathetically could play on the minds of a victim and her family and deter them to go to the police---

Medical evidence---Medical officer not cross-examined---Effect---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Though the medical evidence did not contain any fact that sexual act was committed with the victim by force but it was clear from the statement of victim that she was under the effect of intoxication as well as fear of nude pictures, therefore, in either of the situations, she could not resist the act of rape---Otherwise, of course the said act of intercourse was against the will and consent of victim, which was the requirement of S.375, P.P.C---During medical examination Woman Medical Officer also found hymen of victim as old torn, though she was unmarried but Medical Officer was not even cross-examined by the defence about any fact contained in Medico-Legal Report---Moreover, it was in the evidence that delayed Medico-Legal Examination was due to the reason that victim was terrified---Prosecution had also produced Medical Officer who had examined the accused/appellant and found him potent to perform sexual act; his observations in that respect were recorded in Medico-Legal Report, therefore, such examination was also a relevant fact showing ability of accused/appellant to commit rape with the victim---

Qanun-e-Shahadat  Arts. 27 & 68---Abducting or inducing woman to compel for marriage, rape---Appreciation of evidence---Bad character of accused---Scope---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Bad character of accused in criminal cases was not relevant under Art.68 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Perusal of evidence showed that defence itself conceded the involvement of the appellant in offence of dacoity while putting question upon the victim during her cross-examination, which turned attention to Art.27 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 dealing with relevancy of facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body or bodily feeling---In the evidence of that case facts were brought on record that the appellant had affiliation with victim since her childhood and also wanted to marry her, therefore what he had done could not be regarded as innocent mistake rather his state of mind and bodily feeling made him to commit such a heinous offence---Thus, inclination and attraction of accused towards victim was a relevant fact in the case which could safely be read against him for his intention to commit act of rape and preparation of nude pictures---

Judgment
.--- Abdul Basit, hereinafter to be called as "accused/appellant" faced trial before learned Additional Sessions Judge/GBV, Multan in case FIR No.354 dated 24.05.2018 under sections 365-B/376 P.P.C Police Station New Multan and on conclusion of trial vide judgment dated 23.07.2022 he was convicted under section 365-B P.P.C and sentenced to imprisonment for life with fine of Rs.50,000/-, in case of default to further undergo six month's simple imprisonment. He was also convicted under section 376(i) P.P.C and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for fifteen years with fine of Rs.50,000/-, in case of default to further suffer simple imprisonment for six months; both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently and benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended, hence the instant appeal.

2.    According to the prosecution case as reflected from FIR Ex.PA/2 lodged on the complaint of Nadia Shaheen (victim), she was unmarried and living with her parents, the accused/appellant and Mst. Haseena Bibi (since PO) used to visit her parents, thus she developed friendship with Mst. Haseena Bibi. On 09.04.2018 at 5.00 p.m. Mst. Haseena Bibi came to her house and took her along for making some purchases from Gulshan Market. On their way near Chowk Kumharanawala the accused/appellant, already known to the victim came on a car and offered them a drive; the victim refused but Mst. Haseena forced, whereupon she sat in the car. At Vehari Chowk when the car stopped, the victim reminded Mst. Haseena Bibi to go for Gulshan Market, whereupon, Mst. Haseena pretended an urgent work there. After a while, the accused/appellant and Mst. Haseena brought sandwich and after eating it the victim became unconscious; both of them took her to the house of Mst. Haseena where accused/appellant committed rape with her with the help of Mst. Haseena and also prepared her nude pictures. On returning to senses the victim raised the voice, whereupon, both the accused while showing her nude pictures threatened to upload the same on internet. The accused/appellant continued committing rape with her and transferred her pictures to his mobile phone for the purpose of blackmailing. After two days when her health condition got worst, both the accused left her at Nishtar Hospital, Multan, where from her father and brother took her to the house. Because of intensive mental stress she did not tell anything to them, whereas, accused/appellant constantly threatened her to marry with him. She further narrated that as per her knowledge the pictures which the accused/appellant had shared with her, were still available in the mobile phone of the accused/appellant; ultimately the victim disclosed the entire facts to her parents and along with her complaint she also produced the pictures which the accused/appellant had thrown in her house.

3.    After registration of FIR and completion of investigation finally report under section 173 Cr.P.C was submitted against the accused/appellant. When charge sheeted, the accused/appellant denied the charges and claimed to be tried, whereupon, the prosecution examined Mst. Nadia Shaheen (victim) as PW-1; Ghulam Akbar, father of the victim appeared in the dock as PW-2; Shakeela 944/LC (PW-3) who took the victim to hospital for her medical examination; Zafar Iqbal Sub-Inspector (PW-5) and Ghulam Mustafa (PW-7) had investigated the case; Dr. Nasir Javed (PW-6) conducted potency test of the accused/appellant; Waseem Akram Sub-Inspector (PW-9) got issued non-warrants of arrest of the accused following by proclamation and Dr. Nighat Noureen (PW-10) medically examined the victim and rest of the witnesses appeared and made statements about the roles performed by them during the course of investigation. The accused neither opted to appear in the witness box as required by section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in defence and the trial ended in his conviction and sentence, as detailed above.

4.    Learned counsel for the appellant seeks acquittal on the grounds of delay in FIR, delayed medicolegal examination of victim, un-supporting medical evidence without DNA, sole testimony of victim without corroboration with regard to act of rape. Learned District Public Prosecutor assisted by counsel for the complainant supported the impugned judgment due to trust worthy and confidence inspiring statement of victim, supported by res gestae evidence of her father, medicolegal opinion of old torn hymen being unmarried lady and nude pictures of victim prepared by the appellant wherein he is also visible.

5.    Arguments heard. Record perused.

6.    Here in the instant case, the prosecution intended to establish the charge against the accused/appellant through the ocular account, medical evidence and the nude pictures of the victim P-1 to P-5, which were allegedly thrown into the house of victim and those which were produced on behalf of the accused/appellant i.e., P-6 to P-10. The ocular account was furnished by Mst. Nadia Shaheen victim/complainant (PW-1) alone, whereas, statements of Ghulam Akbar (PW-2) father of the victim is about post occurrence events, including recovery of nude pictures P-1 to P5 produced before the police and P-6 to P-10 on the information of accused/appellant from his house. Conscious of the fact that the victim/complainant was the solitary witness of the occurrence, we have thoroughly and carefully gone through her statement to dig out that she may have falsely involved the accused/appellant in this case in order to wreck vengeance or it may have been a motivated attempt on the part of the prosecution to level some score against the accused/appellant, but in her examination-in-chief the victim reiterated the story as had been set out in the complaint/FIR and deposed about step by step events in the same sequence. She was subjected to cross-examination at sufficient length but nothing damaging to the prosecution or favourable to the defence could be elicited from her mouth. By tenor of cross-examination the defence tried to bring on record that at one point of time the victim and the accused/appellant were residing in the same village and parents of the accused/appellant as well as victim had friendly relations, thus they both i.e. accused/appellant and the victim, were known to each other. Instead of lending any support to the defence, the admission of the victim on above aspects goes on to strengthen the prosecution's stance as it was the case of prosecution itself that because of such friendly relations the accused/appellant used to visit the house of the victim's parents along with Mst. Haseena Bibi, with whom the victim also developed relations and out of such linkage she left the house along with Mst. Haseena Bibi to make some purchases and fell prey to nefarious activity by the accused/appellant.

7.    Since the statement of the victim, direct evidence, has been found to be worthy of credence, confidence inspiring, credible and irrefutable, therefore, even if there is a sole witness, her statement can safely be made basis to record conviction. As to the number of witnesses required to establish a charge, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as "Muhammad Mansha v. The State" (2001 SCMR 199) with reference to Article 17(1)(b) of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 held that:-

       "7. A bare perusal would reveal that the language as employed in the 'said Article 17(1) (b) is free from any ambiguity and no scholarly interpretation is required. The provisions as reproduced hereinabove of the said Article would make it abundant clear that particular number of witnesses shall not be required for the proof of any fact meaning thereby that a fact can be proved only by a single witness "it is not seldom that a crime has been committed in the presence of only one witness, leaving aside those cases which are not of uncommon occurrence, where determination of guilt depends entirely on circumstantial evidence. If the Legislature were to insist upon plurality witnesses, case where the testimony of a single witness only could be available in proof of the crime, would go unpunished. It is here that the discretion of the Presiding Judge comes into play. The matter thus must depend upon the circumstances of each case and the quality of the evidence of the single witness whose testimony has to be either accepted or rejected. If such a testimony is found by the Court to be entirely reliable, there is no legal impediment to the conviction of the accused person on such proof. Even as the guilt of an accused person may be proved by the testimony of a single witness, the innocence of an accused person may be established on the testimony of a single witness, even though considerable number of witnesses may be forthcoming to testify to the truth of the case, for the prosecution. The Court is concerned with the quality and not with the quantity of the evidence necessary for proving or disproving a fact". (Principles and Digest of the Law of Evidence by M. Monir, page 1458).

       The Supreme Court further held that:-

       "……..no yardstick can be fixed as to whether statement of a solitary witness must or must not be relied upon for the simple reason that each case has its own peculiar circumstances which shall play a significant role and is motivating factor to determine the reliability of a solitary witness as the said aspect of the matter is to be dilated upon in the light of surrounding circumstances which may be taken into consideration or otherwise. We may mention here that such circumstances also cannot be confined within a limited sphere of any definition because the same may be infinitely diversified by the situation and conduct of the parties concerned. "The only general rule that can be laid down is that the circumstances must be such as would lead the guarded decision of a reasonable and just man to the conclusion".

       Thus, the well-recognized maxim remains that 'evidence has to be weighed and not counted' and here in this case as discussed above the ocular testimony though coming through one witness i.e. victim, yet the same is consistent, unimpeachable and confidence inspiring, therefore, is held to be sufficient to establish the charge. Reference may be made to the case reported as "Muhammad Ehsan v. The State" (2006 SCMR 1857). It has been held by Supreme Court in case reported as "Atif Zareef and others v. The State" (PLD 2021 SC 550) that rape victim stands on a high pedestal than an injured witness, because an injured witness gets the injury on physical form while rape victim suffers psychologically and emotionally, and single testimony is sufficient to uphold the conviction.

8.    Ghulam Akbar PW-2 father of victim deposed res gestae evidence about condition of victim when he and his son Shahbaz met her in Nishtar Hospital, Multan. PW-2 narrated the situation as under;

       "After two days, my daughter Nadia made a call on phone and informed us that she was present in Nishtar Hospital and her condition was bad. I along with my son Shahbaz went to Nishtar Hospital wherefrom, we brought back Mst. Nadia to our home. We kept on asking what had happened with her but she did not tell us anything and used to weep."

       Similarly, during cross-examination he responded as under;

       "When we had been asking our daughter Mst. Nadia where she was for two days but she started to weep and remained silent. My wife had also been asking about the reason of her weeping but she said nothing to her."

       He has also stated the fact of collection of nude pictures from his house allegedly thrown by the appellant, which has a support to prosecution case. He deposed in his examination in chief that we had family relation with accused Abdul Basit and Haseena Bibi co-accused (since PO). He had no axe to grind against the accused/appellant, nor anything was spoken against him by the defence. His support to save her family honour is reflected from the fact that he is pursuing the case and is present before us even in this appeal proceedings.

9.    In addition to the above, five nude pictures allegedly thrown by the accused/appellant in the house of the victim, were also produced before the Investigating Officer at the time of registration of case, however, were taken into possession after three days through recovery memo P-1 to P-5 (Ex.PC) and accused also produced similar pictures before the police P-6 to P-10 (Ex.PD) on call from his house. Though no evidence is available that who had produced such pictures from the accused side, likewise it has been admitted by the victim during cross-examination that no one knew that who had thrown the pictures (P-1 to P-5) in her house, but the pictures produced by the complainant party clearly show that first part of the prosecution story stands proved which was to the effect that accused after making nude pictures of the victim started blackmailing for commission of rape with her.

10.  We have observed that in one of the nude pictures P-1 to P-5 and P-6 to P-10, the accused/appellant is also visible while sitting with the side of the victim who fell unconscious. The information contained in the picture clearly speaks about the story of the victim that in a condition of unconsciousness her nude pictures were prepared by the accused/appellant, therefore, the question before us is as to whether such pictures could be used as evidence in support of prosecution case. It is trite that an audio/video clip including snaps/photographs as evidence maintains a dual character in the law of evidence; it is termed as document as well as a material thing (physical evidence), also known as real evidence. It does carry information that includes expression, gestures, voice and video; therefore, such clips/snaps are sought to be produced before the Court to prove the 'information' contained in it as evidence of facts recorded therein and oral account of which is to be spoken by a witness and not the document alone. While as material thing it is to be produced for the inspection of court. Principles of evidence relating to admissibility of documents are fully applicable on such type of evidence; permission and sanction of law to bring on record evidence if it is in the form of document is regulated under Article 139 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (the Order). This Article in the light of illustration therein authorizes the Court to ask, when any witness is making statement about a fact, to support his contention with any document if such fact is incorporated therein. The room for such discretion of Court is obviously reflective of farsighted wisdom of legislature to cater to the requirement of an emerging need of evidence in a particular situation for the purpose of corroboration to fortify or strengthen the deposition; even otherwise best evidence rule says that documentary evidence runs over or defeats the oral evidence under the maxim "res ipsa liquitor". The second status of such evidence is of material thing (physical evidence) or real evidence which is produced for the inspection of Court as ordained in second proviso to Article 71 of The Order: -

       "Provided further that, if oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of any material thing other than a document, the Court may, if it thinks fit, require the production of such material thing for its inspection"

       Articles 139 and 71 of the Order in detail in this context have been discussed and explained in a case reported as "Numan alias Nomi and others v. The STATE" (2023 P Cr. L J 1394).

11.  In a book "THE MODERN LAW OF EVIDENCE (Third edition) by Adrian Keane published by Butterworths (1994), the author while referring to a verdict of Sir Jocelyn Smith P, passed in a case reported as "The Statue of Liberty" [1968] 1 WLR 739 mentions as under;

       "It is tempting, on the basis of these words of Sir Jocelyn Smith P, to conclude that photographs and films, the relevance of which can be established by the testimony of someone with personal knowledge of the circumstance in which the photographs or films was taken or made, are admissible items of real evidence and can never give rise to problems of a hearsay nature. If the evidence of a witness to certain events is admissible, it may be reasoned, then photographs or films recording those same events should be no less admissible."

       In R v. Cook [1987] 1 All ER 1049 (CA) at page 1054, Watkins LJ has gone so far as to state that photograph, together with the sketch and photofit, are in a class of evidence of their own to which neither the rule against hearsay nor rule against previous consistent or self-serving statements applies.

       In R v. Williams (1984) 79 Cr App Rep 220 (CA), the Court of Appeal entertained no doubt that photographs taken by security cameras installed at a building society office at which an armed robbery was attempted, were admissible in evidence, being relevant to the issue of both whether an offence was committed and, if so, who committed it. It seems that it is not necessary to prove that the photographic material is original or an authentic copy; proof that the material relates to the events in question will suffice. Case reported as "The Road We're Travelling On, v. Treacy" [1989] New Law Journal (NLJ) 1079 is referred. In the attending circumstance and on the strength of above case laws, pictures P-1 to P5 can validly be used against the accused/appellant. In the case reported as "Muhammad Zaman v. The State and others" (2014 SCMR 749), the Supreme Court of Pakistan apart from other evidence relied on the pictures produced in evidence during trial and converted acquittal of the accused into their conviction.

12.  We have noted that such pictures were put to the accused/appellant during his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. for seeking his explanation but neither he challenged such pictures in any manner during cross-examination nor gave any explanation in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. Silence of the accused/appellant over such an important factor connotes that there was nothing to defend against such nude pictures, thus the requirement of law for using these snaps/pictures is complete as highlighted above and these can safely be used as evidence.

13.  Here in this case, undoubtedly, the FIR was registered after almost one and half month of the crime having been committed but such delay in reporting the matter to the police is immaterial in the sense that throughout it has been stance of the victim that her nude pictures were taken by the accused/appellant, she was blackmailed and she fell victim number of times during her captivity under such pressure and fear, therefore, she kept mum in order to save her and the family honour but when her nude pictures were thrown in her house and the matter stood disclosed to family members, she narrated the whole occurrence. Delay in reporting the matter was responded by her during cross examination as under:-

       "It is correct that I remained silent for about one and half month after the occurrence and did not get the case registered against the accused. There were thoughts in my mind for reporting the matter to police but due to intimidation of the accused, I abstained."

       Another reason for delay in registration of FIR was also deposed by PW-2 in following words:-

       "I took my daughter with me to P.S., New Multan and the police of said police station sent us to women police center. For few days, the police had been putting off and ultimately on 21.05.2018, they received application from me which is Exh. P-A."

       Thus, victim being an educated lady with qualification of MA English had definitely been thinking hundred times about her family honour as well as her social and practical life before reporting the matter to police. Even otherwise, the fact that the modesty of a virgin girl was violated by sexual assault makes understandable the apprehension of the victim and her family in approaching the police immediately. Delay in reporting the crime to the police in respect of an offence involving a person's honour and reputation which society may view unsympathetically could prey on the minds of a victim and her family and deter them to go to the police. Reliance in this respect is palced on case reported as "Hamid Khan v. The State" (1981 SCMR 448).

14.  Though the medical evidence does not contain any fact that sexual act was committed with the victim by force but it is clear from the statement of victim that she was under the effect of intoxication as well as fear of nude pictures, therefore, in either of the situation she could not resist the act of rape, but otherwise, of course the said act of intercourse was against her will and consent, which is the requirement of section 375 P.P.C. During medical examination Dr. Nighat Noureen PW-10 also found hymen of victim as old torn, though she was unmarried but doctor was not even cross examined by the defence about any fact contained in MLR. It is in the evidence that delayed medicolegal examination was due to the reason victim was terrified and this fact she has disclosed, while responding to questions during cross examination, as under;

       "My father and my brother had asked me to take me to the doctor but I refused and insisted to take me to home. My parents were insisting me for my medical treatment but I was scared and terrified that I refused and I said that I would not get out of the room."

15.  Prosecution has also produced Dr. Nasir Javed PW-6 who had examined the accused/appellant on 14/10/2020 and found him potent to perform sexual act; his observations in this respect are recorded in MLR, Ex.PP; therefore, such examination is also a relevant fact showing ability of accused/appellant to commit rape with the victim.

16.  Learned counsel for the complainant tried to show the Bench some FIRs registered against the appellant for his involvement in offences of murder and dacoity to assert his bad character. We are afraid such course is not permissible under the law, and even otherwise bad character of accused in criminal cases is not relevant under Article 68 of the Order; but perusal of evidence shows that defence itself conceded the involvement of the appellant in offence of dacoity while putting question upon the victim during her cross examination, which turned our attention to Article 27 of the Order dealing with relevancy of facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body or bodily feeling. In the evidence of this case facts were brought on record that the appellant has affiliation with victim since her childhood and also wanted to marry her, therefore what he has done cannot be regarded as innocent mistake rather his state of mind and bodily feeling roasted her to commit such a heinous offence. Thus, his inclination and attraction towards victim is a relevant fact in this case which can safely be read against him for his intention to commit act of rape and preparation of nude pictures.

17.  For what has been discussed above, it is evident that prosecution has proved the case against the appellant beyond shadow of reasonable doubt, a standard requisite to sustain a criminal charge. There is no legitimate exception to findings arrived at by the learned trial court with respect to conviction and quantum of sentence awarded to the accused/appellant. The instant appeal, therefore, being devoid of merit, is dismissed. The case property, if any, shall be dealt with as ordered by the learned trial court and the record of the learned trial court be sent back immediately.

ORDER
--------------
Through this application, the petitioner seeks post-arrest bail in case FIR No.348/2023 dated 01.11.2023 registered at Police Station Raitra, District Dera Ghazi Khan, for an offence under section 376(3) of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 (P.P.C). Earlier, he applied to the Juvenile Court for the same relief which was refused.

2.    Briefly, the allegation against the petitioner is that on 1.11.2023 at about 3:00 p.m., he committed an unnatural offence with the complainant's six-year-old son, M.I.

3.    Malik Muhammad Usman Bhatti, Advocate, contends that the petitioner is innocent and the complainant has falsely implicated him in this case due to previous enmity. He further asserts that the petitioner was a little over 11 years old at the time of the alleged occurrence and lacked maturity. Hence, his case falls within the statutory exception mentioned in section 83 P.P.C2, and he is entitled to the relief of post-arrest bail, which he has prayed for.

4.    Mr. Adnan Latif Sheikh, Deputy Prosecutor General, has refuted the allegation of false implication. He contends that the petitioner is named in the FIR with a specific accusation. The victim and PWs Muhammad Nadeem and Manzoor Ahmad support the prosecution's case. Their statements have been recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. which are corroborated by medical evidence. The Deputy Prosecutor General argues that section 83 P.P.C falls in Chapter IV of the P.P.C titled "General Exceptions". If the petitioner seeks the benefit of that exception, he must establish that he had not attained sufficient maturity on the alleged date of occurrence. He has to discharge that onus even at the bail stage, which he has failed to do. The Deputy Prosecutor General maintains that the petitioner has committed a heinous offence and is not entitled to bail.

5.    The complainant's counsel has adopted the Deputy Prosecutor General's arguments.

6.    Arguments heard. Record perused.

7.    The petitioner is specifically accused of committing an unnatural offence with six-year-old M.I. on 01.11.2023 around 03:00 p.m. The victim, M.I., and PWs Muhammad Nadeem and Manzoor Ahmad support the prosecution's case, and medical evidence further corroborates them. M.I's medico-legal certificate indicates penetration. During the investigation, the Medical Officer examined the petitioner and confirmed that he was sexually mature. On a tentative assessment of the available evidence, there is sufficient incriminating material against the petitioner.

8.    Since the petitioner was around 11 years old at the time of the alleged occurrence, Mr. Bhatti asserts that he lacks the maturity to understand the nature and consequences of his acts and claims that he is immune from prosecution under section 83 P.P.C. It is necessary to examine the specifics of this provision to appreciate the contention.

9.    Chapter IV (sections 76 to 106) of the P.P.C, captioned "General Exceptions", provides a comprehensive framework of defences and justifications that can exonerate individuals from criminal liability under specific conditions. These exceptions play a crucial role in the legal system by recognizing that some unlawful acts, although typically considered offences, are not punishable under certain circumstances.

10.  Section 82 P.P.C states that nothing is an offence done by a child under ten. The legislature considers him incapable of committing an offence and thus provides him with absolute immunity from criminal prosecution. Section 83 P.P.C extends this protection to children aged between ten and fourteen years but with a significant difference: the exemption applies only if the child has not attained sufficient maturity to understand the nature and consequences of his conduct. This conditional immunity acknowledges that while children in this age group are developing, they may still lack the full capacity to discern right from wrong. Sections 82 and 83 P.P.C collectively represent a nuanced perspective on juvenile justice, balancing the need for accountability with the recognition of children's developmental phases.

11.  Parliament has enacted the Juvenile Justice System Act 2018 (JJSA) to address young offenders' unique vulnerabilities and rehabilitative requirements. It focuses on the disposal of their cases 4 through diversion and social integration for rehabilitation.3 Section 83 P.P.C and the JJSA complement each other, providing a coherent framework that safeguards children's rights and contributes to the broader societal goal of reducing recidivism through rehabilitative and restorative justice measures.

12.  A fundamental principle of criminal law is that the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Consequently, the burden is on the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. However, if he claims an exception under Chapter IV of the P.P.C or other special laws, Article 121 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984 (QSO) requires him to prove the existence of such circumstances which bring the case within that exception. The court "shall presume" the absence of such circumstances.

13.  Sub-Articles (7), (8), and (9) of Article 2 explains the phrases "may presume," "shall presume," and "conclusive proof". The term "may presume" indicates that it is within the court's discretion to either draw the referenced presumption outlined in the law or choose not to. The words "shall presume" mandate the court to draw a presumption as specified unless the fact is disproved, establishing a rule of rebuttable presumption. "Conclusive proof" refers to cases where the law determines that any amount of other evidence will not alter the conclusion reached when the basic facts are admitted or proved. In M/s Sodhi Transport Co. and another v. State of U.P. and another (AIR 1986 SC 1099), the Supreme Court of India stated:

       "A presumption is not in itself evidence but only makes a prima facie case for the party in whose favour it exists. It is a rule concerning evidence. It indicates the person on whom the burden of proof lies. When the presumption is conclusive, it obviates the production of any other evidence to dislodge the conclusion to be drawn on proof of certain facts. But when it is rebuttable, it only points out the party on whom lies the duty of going forward with evidence on the fact presumed, and when that party has produced evidence fairly and reasonably tending to show that the real fact is not as presumed, the purpose of presumption is over. Then, the evidence will determine the true nature of the facts to be established. The rules of presumption are deduced from enlightened human knowledge and experience and are drawn from the connection, relation and coincidence of facts and circumstances."

14.  When the burden of proof is upon the accused, they must present sufficient evidence, which can be oral, documentary, or any other form. However, unlike the prosecution, which must prove the charge "beyond a reasonable doubt", the accused is not required to meet this stringent standard to succeed in their defence. Instead, they only need to establish their defence based on the civil standard of proof, which is the "balance of probabilities". If this evidence raises reasonable doubt about any element of the offence, the judge must acquit the accused, as the prosecution will have failed to establish guilt conclusively. The Supreme Court of India articulated this legal principle as follows in Vijayee Singh and others v. State of Uttar Pradesh (AIR 1990 SC 1459):

       "The general burden of establishing the guilt of accused is always on the prosecution, and it never shifts. Even in respect of the cases covered by section 105 [of the Indian Evidence Act]5, the prosecution is not absolved of its duty of discharging the burden. The accused may raise a plea of exception either by pleading the same specifically or by relying on the probabilities and circumstances obtaining in the case. He may adduce the evidence in support of his plea directly or rely on the prosecution case itself or, as stated above, he can indirectly introduce such circumstances by way of cross-examination and also rely on the probabilities and the other circumstances. Then, the initial presumption against the accused regarding the non-existence of the circumstances in favour of his plea gets displaced. On examining the material, if a reasonable doubt arises, the benefit of it should go to the accused. The accused can also discharge the burden under section 105 by a preponderance of probabilities in favour of his plea. In case of general exceptions, special exceptions, provisos contained in the Penal Code or any law defining the offence, the court, after due consideration of the evidence in the light of the above principles, if satisfied, would state, in the first instance, as to which exception the accused is entitled to, then see whether he would be entitled for a complete acquittal of the offence charged or would be liable for a lesser offence and convict him accordingly."

15.  In Abdul Sattar and another (minors) v. The Crown (PLD 1949 Lahore 372), a case in which a defence under section 83 P.P.C was raised, the High Court, while deciding the appeal, ruled that the prosecution does not need to present positive evidence demonstrating that a child under 12 years6 has attained sufficient maturity of understanding under section 83 P.P.C. Instead, the child's maturity can be inferred from the circumstances of the case. The High Court further stated that exceptions must be specifically pleaded and established by evidence by the accused person. In Sheikh Hassan v. Bashir Ahmad and another [PLD 1966 (W.P.) Peshawar 97], it was held that "sufficient maturity of understanding" is to be presumed in the case of such a child unless the contrary is proven by the defence, i.e., the burden of proof lies on the accused, above the age of seven and below twelve7, to show that he had not attained sufficient maturity.

16.  The "burden of proof" concept operates somewhat differently during an investigation than during a trial. Nevertheless, even at the investigation stage, the accused is presumed innocent. During an investigation, the goal is to gather enough evidence to determine if there is a reasonable basis to charge someone with a crime. Investigators aim to establish probable cause or reasonable suspicion, but they are not required to meet the rigorous standards of a trial. In contrast, during a trial, the prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt". This requires presenting compelling evidence to convince the judge or jury, while the defence aims to introduce reasonable doubt. In a nub, the burden of proof during an investigation focuses on justifying charges, whereas during a trial, it is about proving guilt to a high degree of certainty.

17.  Section 6 P.P.C stipulates that all definitions of offences, penal provisions, and illustrations in the Code must be interpreted subject to the exceptions contained in Chapter IV (captioned "General Exceptions"), even if they are not explicitly mentioned in each definition, provision, or illustration. Therefore, the police are obligated to take these exceptions into account during the investigation of a case. If any of them apply, the actions in question cannot be deemed as constituting an offence. In A.K. Chaudhary and others v. The State of Gujarat and others [2006 Cri.LJ 726 (Gujarat)], the Gujarat High Court ruled that when the police are assessing whether the accusations in a complaint indicate the commission of a cognizable offence, they must consider the General Exceptions outlined in Chapter IV of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)8. The Court stated that if the allegations in the complaint fall under these general exceptions, the actions cannot be deemed an offence. However, if the allegations do not clearly fall within them, the police should continue their investigation. The ruling emphasized that ignoring the General Exceptions during the investigation could lead to treating actions as offences that are actually exempt under the IPC, thereby nullifying their purpose. Rule 25.2(3) of the Police Rules, 1934, also embodies this principle. It states that it is an investigating officer's duty to discover the truth of the matter under investigation. His objective shall be to discover the actual facts of the case and arrest the real offender or offenders. He must not prematurely commit to any view of the facts for or against anyone.

18.  It follows from the above discussion that if an accused raises a defence based on exceptions during the investigation, they are required, under Article 121 of the QSO, to provide evidence supporting their claim, meeting the civil standard of proof, which is the balance of probabilities. Investigative authorities are responsible for collecting all relevant evidence, including that presented by the accused, and then submitting a report under section 173 Cr.P.C.

19.  If the accused is a juvenile, the provisions of JJSA must be followed during the investigation and trial. Section 5(1)(b) of the JJSA mandates that when a juvenile is arrested, he shall be kept in an observation home. The officer in-charge of the police station shall, as soon as possible, inform the Probation Officer concerned to enable him to obtain such information about the juvenile and other circumstances which may be of assistance to the Juvenile Court. Section 7(2) ordains that the investigating officer, with the assistance of the Probation Officer or a social welfare officer, prepare a social investigation report to be annexed with the report under section 173 Cr.P.C.

20.  The principles regarding the burden of proof discussed in paragraph 18 also apply to cases where a juvenile accused is between the ages of ten and fourteen. Thus, the investigating officer must collect evidence to establish the child's maturity level. During the investigation, the prosecution does not need to present direct evidence demonstrating the child's maturity; it can be inferred from the circumstances of the case, as stated in Abdul Sattar, supra. If the defence claims the child lacked the requisite maturity, the burden shifts to them to provide supporting evidence. They must meet the civil standard of proof by showing, on a balance of probabilities, that the child did not understand the nature and consequences of their actions. This evidence could include psychological evaluations, testimonies about the child's behaviour, or other relevant documents. If this evidence suggests the child lacked the necessary maturity, it raises reasonable doubt about their criminal responsibility. The onus shifts to the juvenile accused when preliminary evidence suggests sufficient maturity.

21.  The JJSA classifies offences into three categories: heinous, major, and minor. According to section 2(g) of the Act, "heinous offence" means an offence which is serious, gruesome, brutal, sensational in character or shocking to public morality and which is punishable under the P.P.C or any other law for the time being in force with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for more than seven years with or without fine. Section 2(m) states that "major offence" means an offence for which punishment under the P.P.C or any other law for the time being in force is more than three years and up to seven years imprisonment with or without a fine. Section 2(o) states that "minor offence" means an offence for which the maximum punishment under the P.P.C or any other law for the time being in force is imprisonment for up to three years with or without a fine.

22.  The classification of heinous, major, and minor offences in the JJSA is based on the severity of the prescribed punishment, not on moral or ethical considerations alone. Since rape, as defined under section 375 P.P.C, carries a sentence of death or life imprisonment, it unequivocally meets the criteria for a heinous offence.

23.  Rape cannot be excluded from the definition of a "heinous offence" by merely categorizing it as an offence of moral turpitude. As adumbrated, the legal definition of heinous offences under the JJSA is strictly tied to the severity of the punishment. Attempting to reclassify rape as solely an offence of moral turpitude to exclude it from the category of heinous offences would not align with the statutory language and intent of the JJSA. Such reclassification could undermine the legal consistency and the intended gravity accorded to the crime of rape within the framework of juvenile justice.

24.  Section 5 of the JJSA stipulates the procedure to be followed when a juvenile is arrested. Section 6 of the Act provides for his release on bail during the pendency of the case against him. Section 6(1) of the JJSA states that a juvenile accused of a bailable offence shall be released by the Juvenile Court on bail unless it appears that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the release of such juvenile may bring him in association with criminals or expose him to any other danger. In this situation, the juvenile shall be placed under the custody of a suitable person or Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre under the supervision of a Probation Officer. The juvenile shall not under any circumstances be kept in a police station under police custody or jail in such cases. Section 6(3) of the Act provides for treating the "minor offences" and "major offences" as bailable. Section 6(4) provides that where a juvenile is more than sixteen years of age and is arrested or detained for a heinous offence, he may not be released on bail if the Juvenile Court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds to believe that such juvenile is involved in the commission of a heinous offence. Even in cases involving heinous offences under section 6(5), the juvenile must be released on bail if he is under detention for a continuous period exceeding six months, his trial is not completed and he is not responsible for the delay. The said period is to be counted from the date of the juvenile's arrest.9

25.  Where the age of the juvenile is around 11, and he is accused of a heinous offence, the case may not strictly fall under section 6(3) or section 6(4) of the JJSA. Section 6(3) deals with minor and major offences but does not mention the third category, i.e., heinous offences. On the other hand, section 6(4), although dealing with heinous offences, applies to situations where the juvenile is over sixteen years of age. The issue is of great significance. If the case is treated under section 6(3), he can claim bail as a matter of right even after committing a heinous offence, while in the case of section 6(4), although bail can be granted to him, the juvenile cannot claim such bail as a matter of right, as indicated by the use of the words "he may not be released on bail".

26.  In the matter of Reference by the President of Pakistan under Article 162 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan [PLD 1957 SC (Pak) 219], Muhammad Munir CJ. stated: "Ever since man learnt to express his feelings and thoughts in words, the function of the person to whom the words are addressed, a function of which he is scarcely conscious, has been to understand what is intended to be conveyed by the speaker, and ever since the law began to be written the duty of those to whom it is addressed or who are called upon to expound it has been to discover the intention of the lawgiver." His Lordship set out rules for construing statutes and the Constitution, emphasizing that the primary objective in interpreting any written instrument is to discover the author's intention. He inter alia stated that the legislature's intention in enacting a statute should be derived from considering the whole enactment to achieve a consistent plan. When a statute contains both specific and general provisions, the specific provisions should take precedence, while the general provisions should apply only to other relevant parts of the statute. Effect should be given to every part, and every word of the statute or Constitution, and courts should avoid interpretations that render any provision meaningless, favouring those that make every word operative. Courts must consider the entire document to determine the true intent and meaning of any specific provision. If different provisions appear contradictory, the court should strive to harmonize them.

27.  While analyzing the statute as aforesaid, the courts should first presume that the "legislature chooses its words carefully. Therefore, if a word or phrase has been added somewhere, such addition is not to be deemed redundant; conversely, if a word or phrase has been left out somewhere, such omission is not be deemed inconsequential.10 Secondly, courts should presume that the legislature does not intend "absurd" consequences to flow from the application of its Act. In this context, "absurd" means contrary to sense and reason, "The presumption leads to avoidance by the interpreter of six types of undesirable consequences: (i) an unworkable or impracticable result; (ii) an inconvenient result; (iii) an anomalous or illogical result; (iv) a futile or pointless result; (v) an artificial result; and (vi) a disproportionate counter-mischief."11

28.  Let's now go back to the JJSA. I have already pointed out that the Act classifies offences into three categories based on their severity and the stipulated punishments-though the age of the offender is also a relevant factor in certain instances. The legislature intends to be lenient with the offender in minor and major offences and harsh in heinous offences. Therefore, it treats all minor and major offences as bailable, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure or other statute, as the case may be. The legislative intent is that the bail of juveniles accused of heinous offences should be considered on merits. In this respect, the following observations of the Supreme Court which it made in Khawar Kayani v. The State and others (PLD 2022 SC 551), are instructive:

       "Section 6(4) of the Act provides that where a juvenile is more than sixteen years of age and is arrested or detained for a heinous offence, he may not be released on bail if the Juvenile Court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds to believe that such juvenile is involved in the commission of a heinous offence. While section 6(4) deals with the bail of juveniles under a heinous offence on merits, a separate provision provides for bail to the same juveniles where they have been detained for a continuous period exceeding six months and whose trial has not been completed. Under the Act, only in a case involving "heinous offence" can a juvenile be detained in a police station or a jail. Thus, it can safely be concluded that section 6(5) of the Act does apply, rather solely applies, to a case involving a "heinous offence", irrespective of the age of the juvenile. Section 6(5) in effect works as a proviso to section 6(4) and appears to have no other purpose under the scheme of the Act. The approach of the trial court, in the present case, to decline benefit of section 6(5) of the Act to the petitioner merely by observing that the offence is "heinous" is not legally correct; this subsection is meant for, and only applies to, a case involving "heinous offence". To hold otherwise will render section 6(5) redundant and unnecessary."

(emphasis added)

29.  If the classification of the offences is based on the age of the offender, the JJSA's scheme would be disturbed. It would reduce the offences to two categories: (a) offences, whether minor, major or heinous, committed by an offender up to sixteen years, and (b) the offences of a heinous nature committed by an offender above the said threshold of sixteen years.

30.  In conclusion, the JJSA does not inherently exhibit leniency towards heinous offences. The legislative intent is that the bail decisions for juveniles accused of such offences should be based on the merits of each case. This approach allows the court to consider factors such as the nature of the offence, the juvenile's age, circumstances, and the potential threat to public safety before granting or denying bail. This nuanced treatment underscores a balanced approach - promoting rehabilitation for less severe offences while ensuring public safety and accountability for more serious crimes.

31.  Section 23 of the JJSA provides that the provisions of this Act shall have overriding effect notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force. This means that if there are any inconsistencies or contradictions between the JJSA and other existing laws, the regulations specified within the JJSA will supersede and take precedence. If the JJSA does not explicitly address a particular matter, the general law, i.e. the Code of Criminal Procedure, would apply. Section 5(2) Cr.P.C. also supports this view. It provides that all offences under any law other than the P.P.C shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions of the Code, but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offence.

32.  Section 497 Cr.P.C. specifies the conditions under which bail may be granted in non-bailable cases. Subsection (1) of this provision states that when any person accused of a non-bailable offence is arrested or detained without a warrant by an officer in charge of a police station or appears or is brought before a court, he may be released on bail, but he shall not be so released if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or mprisonment for life or imprisonment for ten years. However, the first proviso to section 497 states:

       Provided that the Court may direct that any person under the age of sixteen years or any woman or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be released on bail.

33.  The Supreme Court considered the first proviso to section 497 Cr.P.C. in Tahira Batool v. The State and another (PLD 2022 SC 764) and held that in cases of an accused under sixteen years, a woman or any sick or infirm person, irrespective of the category of offence, the bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as an exception. The relevant excerpt is reproduced below:

       "However, the first proviso to section 497(1) Cr.P.C. provides that the court may direct that any person under the age of sixteen years or any woman or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be released on bail. The expression 'such an offence' used in this proviso refers to the offence mentioned in the second part (prohibitory clause) of section 497(1) Cr.P.C., as for all other non-bailable offences the court is already empowered to release the accused on bail under the first part of section 497(1) Cr.P.C. The first proviso has thus made equal the power of the court to grant bail in the offences of prohibitory clause alleged against an accused under the age of sixteen years, a woman accused and a sick or infirm accused, to its power under the first part of section 497(1) Cr.P.C. This means that in cases of women. etc., as mentioned in the first proviso to section 497(1), irrespective of the category of the offence, bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as an exception12 in the same manner as it is granted or refused in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497(1) Cr.P.C.

       The above view was reaffirmed in Mst. Ghazala v. The State and another (2023 SCMR 887).

34.  It is neither possible nor advisable to enumerate all the "extraordinary and exceptional circumstances" that Tahira Batool and Mst. Ghazala contemplated. However, the case of Tariq Bashir and others v. The State (PLD 1995 SC 34) provides some examples. These are: (a) where there is a likelihood of the accused absconding, (b) where there is apprehension that the accused will tamper with the prosecution evidence; (c) where there is a danger of the offence being repeated if the accused is released on bail; and (d) where the accused is a previous convict.

35.  In the present case, the petitioner was around eleven at the time of the alleged occurrence. According to the FIR, he was found committing sodomy with M.I. while grazing goats in the fields. The investigating officer has not investigated the circumstances preceding the incident which were necessary to establish mens rea. He has also not obtained the reports under sections 5(1)(b) and 7(2) of the JJSA, although they were mandatory. Given that the petitioner's age is closer to the lower end of the 10 to 14 age bracket, more convincing evidence is required to establish his maturity level, even at the investigation stage. This is because younger children are generally presumed to lack the maturity to understand the nature and consequences of their actions thoroughly. If a child is closer to 14 years old, the presumption might lean more towards the likelihood of sufficient maturity, thus requiring comparatively less rigorous evidence to establish this maturity. For all these reasons, further inquiry is needed to determine the petitioner's guilt. In Resham Khan and another v. The State and another (2021 SCMR 2011), the Supreme Court held:

       ".....further inquiry is a question which must have some nexus with the result of the case for which a tentative assessment of the material on record is to be considered for reaching just conclusion. The case of further inquiry pre-supposes the tentative assessment which may create doubt with respect to the involvement of accused in the crime. It is well settled that object of trial is to make an accused to face the trial and not to punish an under-trial prisoner. The basic idea is to enable the aceused to answer criminal prosecution against him rather than to rot him behind the bars. Every accused is innocent until his guilt is proved, and the benefit of doubt can be extended to the accused even at bail stage if the facts of the case so warrant. The basic philosophy of criminal jurisprudence is that the prosecution has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and this principle applies at all stages including pre-trial and even at the time of deciding whether accused is entitled to bail or not."

36.  In addition to the need for further investigation to determine the petitioner's guilt, the case also falls under the first proviso of Section 497(1) Cr.P.C. According to the Supreme Court's ruling in Tahira Batool and Mst. Ghazala, granting bail to a juvenile of his age is the norm, while refusal is the exception. There are no exceptional circumstances in the present case for which bail may be withheld. Therefore, this application is allowed. The petitioner is admitted to post-arrest bail subject to his furnishing bail bond of Rs.200,000/- (Rupees two hundred thousand) with two sureties in the like amount to the trial court's satisfaction.

37.  Before concluding this order, I would acknowledge the assistance provided to me by Mr. Adnan Latif Sheikh, Deputy Prosecutor General.

Judgment.
----------------
Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh (convict) was tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kehror Pacca in case FIR No.587 of 2014, dated 24.10.2014, registered at Police Station City Kehror Pacca, District Lodhran in respect of offences under sections 376 and 363 of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860. The learned trial court vide judgment dated 12.01.2017 convicted Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh (convict) and sentenced him as infra:-

       Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh:

       1) Imprisonment for life under section 376(1) of the Pakistan Penal Code,1860 and directed to pay fine of Rs.200,000/-, and in case of default of payment of fine, the convict was directed to undergo, simple Imprisonment of two years further.

       2) Imprisonment for life under section 365-B of the Pakistan Penal Code,1860 and directed to pay fine of Rs.200, 000/-, and in case of default of payment of fine, the convict was directed to undergo simple Imprisonment of two years further.

       The convict was extended benefit available under Section 382-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 1898 by the learned trial court. Both the sentences awarded to the convict were ordered to run concurrently by the learned trial court .

2.    Feeling aggrieved, Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh (convict) lodged the instant Criminal Appeal No.576-J-LD of 2017 assailing his conviction and sentence.

3.    The brief facts of the prosecution case, as stated by Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), the victim of the case, in her statement before the learned trial court, are as under:-

       "On 23.10.2014 at about 8:00 AM I was going to school when I reached near Nagina Cinema accused Allah Wadhaya armed with pistol with an unknown person came and took me forcibly to an unknown place on motorcycle. After some time that unknown person alighted from motorcycle. Accused Allah Wadhaya forcibly committed rape with me. After four days I escaped from that unknown place and came to my home. My parents took me to P.S and then to Hospital. My statement was recorded in P.S. My medical examination was got conducted."

4.    After the formal investigation of the case report under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted before the learned trial court and the accused was sent to face trial. The learned trial court framed the charge against the accused on 04.02.2015 to which the accused pleaded not guilty and the learned trial court proceeded to examine the prosecution witnesses.

5.    The prosecution in order to prove its case got recorded statements of as many as nine witnesses. Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), the prosecutrix narrated the facts of the occurrence. Muhammad Murad (PW-1) stated that on 24.10.2014, he submitted the written application (Exh.PA) for the registration of the case in respect of abduction of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2). Zafar Iqbal (PW-3) stated that on 23.10.2014, he had witnessed the appellant abducting Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2). Abdul Hameed, SI (PW-9) investigated the case from 24.10.2014 till 01.11.2014, arrested the appellant on 29.10.2014 and detailed the facts discovered during the investigation of the case in his statement before the learned trial court.

6.    The prosecution also got Dr. Mumtaz Kamal (PW-4) examined, who on 27.10.2014 was posted as a Woman Medical Officer at THQ hospital Kehror Pacca and on the same day, conducted the medical examination of the victim namely Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2). Dr. Mumtaz Kamal (PW-4), after examining Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), observed as under:-

       "Local examination.

       Locally found blackish flaps of labia admit two fingers loose. minora and vagina

       ..........

       Opinion.

       My opinion is that there was penetration occurred completely. Those swabs do not match with the findings of local examination. After medical examination I issued MLC the carbon copy of which is Ex.PD that is in my hand and bear my signature. I also attested injury statement of Ex.PD/1."

       The prosecution also got Dr. Ihsan Ali (PW-5) examined who stated that he had examined the appellant on 01.11.2014 and found him capable of having sexual intercourse.

7.    On 25.04.2016, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor tendered in evidence the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PJ) and other documents (Exh.PK and Exh.PL).On 26.05.2016, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor closed the prosecution evidence after tendering, in evidence the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PM)

8.    After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined the appellant Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh, under section 342, Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question why this case against you and why the PWs have deposed against you, he stated that he had been falsely involved in the case. The appellant opted to get himself examined under section 340(2), Cr.P.C and did not adduce any evidence in his defence.

9.    On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kehror Pacca, convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to above.

10.  The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant precisely was that with regard to the abduction of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), there was not sufficient evidence, however, with regard to the conviction of the appellant under section 376(1), P.P.C., the learned counsel for the appellant sought a reduction in the quantum of imprisonment awarded to the appellant.

11.  On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General contended that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a shadow of doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General further submitted that it was a heinous offence and exploited the victim's future by the appellant at the expense of his lust: that it could not be expected from the victim to put her future at stake for any reason to falsely implicate the appellant in this case for nothing; that delay in reporting the matter to the police had no adverse effect on the fate of the prosecution case because in the cases where family honour was involved, immediate rushing to the police station for lodging the crime report and putting the honour at stake, was always difficult for anybody; that the medical evidence provided further corroboration to the Ocular account; that the impugned judgment entailing the conviction and sentence of the appellant did not warrant interference by this Court. Lastly, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General prayed for the rejection of the appeal.

12.  I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General and with their assistance perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial carefully. .

13.  Although the learned counsel for the appellant has not opted to assail the conviction recorded by the learned trial Court against the appellant under section 376(1), P.P.C., still I have gone through the evidence on the record. This Court finds that the prosecution has undoubtedly established the charge of rape by producing relevant, admissible and dependable evidence during the course of the trial. The prosecution witness namely Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) was cross-examined by the learned Counsel for the appellant, but her evidence relating to the fact of her being raped by the appellant has not been shaken at all. It is fully established by the statement of the prosecution witness namely Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) that the appellant raped her. The report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PM) according to which the DNA Profile of the appellant was found present on the shalwar of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) also lends support to the charge of rape against the appellant. The evidence of Dr. Mumtaz Kamal (PW-4) also fully supports the statement of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) that she was raped by the appellant. In all criminal cases, normal discrepancies are bound to occur in the depositions of witnesses due to normal errors of observation, namely, errors of memory due to lapse of time or due to mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence. Where the omissions amount to a contradiction, creating serious doubt about the truthfulness of the witness and other witnesses also make material improvement while deposing in the court, such evidence cannot be safe to rely upon. However, minor contradictions, inconsistencies, embellishments or improvements on trivial matters which do not affect the core of the prosecution case, should not be made a ground on which the evidence can be rejected in its entirety. The court has to form its opinion about the credibility of the witness and record a finding as to whether his deposition inspires confidence. Exaggerations per se do not render the evidence brittle. But it can be one of the factors to test the credibility of the prosecution version when the entire evidence is put in a crucible for being tested on the touchstone of credibility. Therefore, mere marginal variations in the statements of a witness cannot be dubbed as improvements as the same may be elaborations of the statement made by the witness earlier. The omissions which amount to contradictions in material particulars i.e. go to the root of the case/materially affect the trial or core of the prosecution's case, render the testimony of the witness liable to be discredited but not otherwise. In the instant case, this Court finds that the prosecution witness namely Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) has successfully evidenced her credibility, therefore, the learned trial court was quite justified to rely on her while finding the appellant guilty. The intention of the accused is the basis and the gravamen of an offence under section 376, P.P.C. Consequently, I have no hesitation in holding that the learned trial court rightly convicted the appellant for the offence punishable under section 376(1), P.P.C.

14.  With regard to the conviction of the appellant under section 365-B, P.P.C., this Court has come to the conclusion that the prosecution could not prove the said charge against the appellant. The learned trial court itself rejected the statement of the prosecution witness namely Zafar Iqbal (PW-3) who had stated that on 23.10.2014 at about 08.00 a.m he had seen the appellant abducting Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2). According to the statement of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), when she was abducted by the appellant, Zafar Iqbal (PW-3) was not present at the said time, at the said place. Furthermore, Zafar lqbal (PW-3), though being very closely related to Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), made no effort either to fail the abduction or Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) or even to follow the appellant who was taking away Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) with him. None from the locality supported the said charge of abduction levelled against the appellant. The learned trial court also observed that Muhammad Murad (PW-1) was not a witness of the said abduction. With regard to the part of the statement of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) that she was abducted by the appellant, the same is doubtful as is contradictory to the attending circumstances. Therefore, this Court has arrived at an irresistible conclusion that the appellant could not have been convicted for the offence made punishable under section 365-B, P.P.C.

15.  For what has been discussed above, this Court has come to an irresistible and clear conclusion the prosecution has proved beyond any shadow of doubt, through inspiring and truthful evidence, that the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh raped Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) . In view of the conclusions drawn by this Court, the instant Criminal Appeal No. 5764-J/LD of 2017 as lodged by the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh is partly allowed and the conviction and sentence of the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh for the offence made punishable under section 365-B, P.P.C. is set-aside, however, the conviction of the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh son of Muhammad Siddique under section 376(1), P.P.C. is upheld and maintained, however, I have observed that the appellant suffered the rigours of a protracted trial. I have also observed that it seems likely that the appellant would have mended, his conduct in these years. Learned counsel for the appellant on appellant's instructions, has earnestly and humbly prayed that the appellant may be given a chance to rehabilitate. The appellant was the sole earner in his Family and his incarceration for an extended period would result in cutting off the lifeline available to his family. There is no proof that the appellant is a man of means. As such, the case of the appellant calls for a lenient view in the matter of the quantum of sentence awarded to him under section 376(1), P.P.C. Reliance is placed on the cases of "Naseem Khan v. The State" (2021 SCMR 1771), "Mst. Sughran v. State (2021 SCMR 109) "Niaz ud Din v. The State" (2007 SCMR 206), "Shaukat Ali alias Billa v. The State" (2015 SCMR 308) and "State through the Deputy Director (Law), Regional Directorate, Anti-Narcotics Force v. Mujahid Naseem Lodhi" (PLD 2017 SC 671). Consequently, while maintaining the conviction of the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh under section 376(1), P.P.C. but taking into consideration the above-mentioned mitigating circumstances, the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh under section 376(1), P.P.C. is reduced to that of rigorous imprisonment of ten years. The punishment of payment of fine of Rs.200,000/-, and in case of default of payment of fine, to undergo simple Imprisonment of two years further awarded to the appellant is upheld and maintained.

Art. 164-- Qanun-e-Shahadat --Importance of modern forensic techniques and science under the criminal justice system explained.
-------------------
            For the law to serve people in today's technologically complex society, courts needed to understand and be open to science and its principles, tools and techniques. Legal decisions of the courts must fall within the boundaries of scientifically sound knowledge. A judge and more so a trial judge, acted as a gatekeeper of the scientific evidence and must, therefore, enjoy a good sense and understanding of science. As science grows so will the forensic techniques, tools and devices; therefore, courts must be open to developments in forensic science and embrace new techniques and devices to resolve a dispute, provided the said technique and device was well established and widely accepted in the scientific community as a credible and reliable technique or device.

  
            Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 was the gateway allowing modern forensic science to come into courtrooms. Article 164 provided that courts may allow to be produced any evidence that may have become available because of modern devices and techniques. Proviso to Article 164, provided that conviction on the basis of modern devices and techniques may be lawful. Article 164 read with Article 59, inter alia, allowed modern forensic science to enter courts through the credible and valued scientific opinions of experts as evidence, in order to arrive at the truth.

Importance and admissibility of DNA evidence to establish the guilt or innocence of an accused.
-------------------
            The most significant advancement in criminal investigation since the advent of fingerprint identification is the use of DNA technology to help convict criminals or eliminate persons as suspects.

            Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology was widely used in many jurisdictions by police, prosecutors, defense counsel, and courts. This scientific evidence was much speedier, specific, accurate and conclusive than any other human evidence and could stand the scrutiny of the court to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused. In criminal cases, like rape, murder, etc., timely medical examination and proper sampling of body fluids followed by quality forensic analysis could offer irrefutable evidence. Through the use of DNA evidence, prosecutors  could  establish  the  guilt  of  accused  and  at  the  same  time, DNA aided the search for truth by exonerating the innocent.

       Modi. A Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology, 26th Edition, LexisNexis. Pp 430- 453 and Studies in the Use of DNA Evidence to Establish Innocence After Trial by Edward Connors, Thomas Lundregan, Neal Miller, Tom McEwen, June 1996, U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, National Institute of Justice ref.

            DNA report like any other opinion of an expert under Article 59 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 ('QSO') was relevant and thus admissible. Article 164 of the QSO further underlined the admissibility, reliability and weightage of modern scientific forensic evidence, including the DNA test, as the said Article provided that convictions may be based on modern techniques and devices.

DNA evidence/report, Per-se admissibility---Meaning---Requirement of examining the expert who prepared the DNA report explained.
-------------------

       While the admissibility of expert opinion was already recognized under the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 ('the QSO'), section 510, Cr.P.C. dealt with special rules of evidence and made the evidentiary procedure simple by providing that certain reports of the chemical examiner, etc. may be used in any trial without calling the Government Chemical Examiner, Serologist, finger print expert or fire-arm expert as a witness. Allowing admission of reports of the said Governmental experts in evidence without their author appearing as a witness had the objective of saving time and speeding up criminal trials. This simple procedure of admission of these reports in evidence, was referred to as per se admissible. However, the court may if it considered necessary, in the interest of justice, summon and examine the person by whom such a report had been made. Section 510, Cr.P.C. referred to reports of certain experts only but did not specifically mention the expert who conducted DNA analysis, hence the DNA test report was not per se admissible but it was certainly admissible if tendered in evidence by examining as witness the expert under whose hand it was prepared as per the QSO. Additionally, under section 9 of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency Act, 2007 an expert of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) was considered to be an expert in terms of section 510, Cr.P.C. Therefore, DNA test report prepared by an expert of the PFSA was per se admissible.

            Article 164 of QSO held immense importance and demanded that the scope of expert opinions under Article 59 of QSO and the special rule of evidence under section 510, Cr.P.C. be interpreted progressively to come to give more space and recognition to modern forensic science. Supreme Court observed that use of the word "Chemical Examiner" in section 510, Cr.P.C. was almost obsolete and had no established definition; and, that it was time for the Government to consider revision of section 510, Cr.P.C. allowing reports of all the Government forensic scientists (as opposed to the specified ones under section 510, Cr.P.C.) to be per se admissible, to speed up the wheels of dispensation of criminal justice. Supreme Court directed that copy of present judgment be dispatched to the Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs, for consideration of the said recommendation.

Concept of DNA evidence as the strongest corroborative piece of evidence explained.
-------------------------

            DNA evidence was considered as a gold standard to establish the identity of an accused. DNA test due to its accuracy and conclusiveness was one of the strongest corroborative pieces of evidence. DNA test with scientific certainty and clarity pointed towards the perpetrator and was, therefore, considered one of the strongest corroborative evidence, especially in cases of rape. Supreme Court observed that usefulness of DNA analysis, however, depended mostly on the skill, ability and integrity shown by the investigating officers, who were the first to arrive at the scene of the crime; that unless the evidence was properly documented, collected, packaged and preserved, it would not meet the legal and scientific requirements for admissibility into a court of law.
DNA evidence---Strong circumstantial evidence---Incident was unseen, however, the most important piece of circumstantial evidence in the present case, was the DNA test report---Furthermore wajtakkar evidence, evidence of extra-judicial confession of accused, medical evidence and DNA test report, considered together, clearly connected the accused with the rape and murder of the deceased---Chain of circumstantial evidence was firm and continuous, leaving no margin for the hypothesis of innocence of the accused---Convictions and sentences awarded to the accused by the trial court, including death sentence, were maintained.

            Evidence of wajtakkar comprised of two witnesses, who were not chance witnesses, as they were residents of the locality and their presence near the place of occurrence, i.e., the field, was quite natural. They saw the accused coming out of that field while tightening the string of his shalwar at a time that was in line with the time of occurrence reported in the FIR and the approximate time of death of the deceased mentioned in the post-mortem report. The extra-judicial confession of accused though was a weak piece of evidence; but in the present case, it also inspired confidence when it was read in conjunction with other circumstantial evidence. The medical evidence, viz, the post mortem report and statement of the doctor who made the post-mortem examination of the deceased, supported the prosecution case. The fact established by the medical evidence that the deceased had suffered vaginal injury, as her hymen was found freshly torn with tear at 6 O'clock extending upto perineum with fresh bleeding, clearly supports the prosecution case that the deceased was raped before causing her death. The medical opinion of the doctor that the death of the deceased occurred due to throttling tallied with the DNA report regarding the swab obtained from the neck of the deceased: the DNA report stated matching of the DNA found in that swab with that of the accused.

            According to the DNA test report the semen from vaginal swabs, as well as, the stain of the shalwar of the deceased matched the DNA of the accused. The DNA in the swab obtained from the neck of the deceased also matched the DNA of the accused.

            The prosecution had thus proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Convictions and sentences awarded to the accused by the trial court, including death sentence, were maintained. Petition for leave to appeal was dismissed and leave was refused.

JUDGMENT
.---This is a troubling and a gut-wrenching case of rape, murder and capital punishment. Almost eight year old, Rimsha Bibi ("deceased") who left her house for summer tuition in the neighbourhood was raped in the loneliness of a jawar (millet) field and then silenced forever by being brutally murdered. First Information Report ("FIR") was registered by the father of the deceased against an unknown person for offences under sections 302 and 376(i) of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 ("P.P.C.") on 29.06.2016. In the supplementary statement recorded the next day, the complainant revealed that Jabbar Hussain (PW-6) and Tufail Shah (PW-7) had seen Ali Haider alias Pappu ("petitioner") coming out of the jawar field from where the dead body of the deceased was recovered at 4:00 p.m. on the fateful day, while tightening the string of his shalwar.

2.    The petitioner was indicted and tried for the alleged offences. On conclusion of the trial, he was convicted by the trial Court under section 302(b) of P.P.C., and sentenced to death and directed to pay compensation of Rs.200,000/- to the legal heirs of the deceased and in default thereof to undergo further simple imprisonment for six months. He was also convicted under section 376 of P.P.C. and sentenced to imprisonment for life with fine of Rs.30,000/- to be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased and in default thereof to further undergo simple imprisonment for three months. On appeal to the High Court by the petitioner,  which  was  heard  along  with  the  Murder  Reference  sent  up  by the trial court, the High Court maintained the convictions and  sentences of the petitioner. The murder reference was answered in the affirmative and the death sentence was confirmed through the impugned judgment.

3.    We have examined the record of the case with the able assistance of the learned counsel for the parties. The gruesome incident was unseen. The circumstantial evidence pieced together by the prosecution, to tie the petitioner with the rape and murder of the deceased comprises: (i) the evidence of waj takkar of Jabbar Hussain (PW-6) and Tufail Shah (PW-7) who had seen the petitioner coming out of the place of occurrence, i.e., jawar field, at 04:00 p.m. tightening the string of his shalwar; (ii) the extra judicial confession of the petitioner, admitting commission of rape and murder of the deceased in the presence of the complainant (PW-1) and the said two witnesses of waj takkar evidence (iii) the medical evidence including the post-mortem report (Ex-PL) and the statement of Dr. Sunia (PW-11), WHO, DHQ Hospital Vehari, who had conducted the post-mortem examination of the deceased: and (iv) the DNA Test Report regarding the vaginal swabs of the deceased as well as the swab obtained from the neck of the deceased, which reported matching of the DNA found in those swabs with that of the petitioner.

Importance of modern forensic science and DNA

4.    Before analyzing the circumstantial evidence, it might be useful to underline the role of science, modern forensic techniques and devices under our criminal justice system. For the law to serve people in this technologically complex society, courts need to understand and be open to science and its principles, tools and techniques. Legal decisions of the courts must fall within the boundaries of scientifically sound knowledge. A judge and more so a trial judge, acts as a gatekeeper of the scientific evidence and must, therefore, enjoy a good sense and understanding of science. As science grows so will the forensic techniques, tools and devices; therefore, courts must be open to developments in forensic science and embrace new techniques and devices to resolve a dispute, provided the said technique and device is well established and widely accepted in the scientific community as a credible and reliable technique or device.1 Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (QSO) is our gateway allowing modern forensic science to come into our courtrooms. Article 164 provides that courts may allow to be produced any evidence that may have become available because of modern devices and techniques. Proviso2 to Article 164, added in the year 2017, provides that conviction on the basis of modern devices and techniques may be lawful. Article 164 read with Article 59, inter alia, allows modern forensic science to enter courts through the credible and valued scientific opinions of experts as evidence, in order to arrive at the truth.

5.    The most significant advancement in criminal investigation since the advent of fingerprint identification is the use of DNA technology to help convict criminals or eliminate persons as suspects. DNA as a scientific evidence means 'deoxyribonucleic acid.' DNA can be found in the human body and samples from semen, hair, blood, flesh can establish a DNA matching with the DNA of another human being. Each human being has a unique DNA pattern, which is acquired by inheriting it from the biological parents. DNA analyses on saliva, skin tissue, blood, hair, and semen can now be reliably used to link criminals to crimes. Increasingly accepted during the past 10 years, DNA technology is now widely used in many jurisdictions by police, prosecutors, defense counsel, and courts.3 This scientific evidence is much speedier, specific, accurate and conclusive than any other human evidence and can stand the scrutiny of the court to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused. In criminal cases, like rape, murder, etc., timely medical examination and proper sampling of body fluids followed by quality forensic analysis can offer irrefutable evidence. Criminal justice system is in search for the truth. The development of DNA technology furthers the search for truth by helping police and prosecutors in the fight against violent crimes. Through the use of DNA evidence, prosecutors can establish the guilt of accused and at the same time, DNA aids the search for truth by exonerating the innocent.4 An authoritative study on the forensic uses of DNA, conducted by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, USA has noted that:

       "...the reliability of DNA evidence will permit it to exonerate some people who would have been wrongfully accused or convicted without it. Therefore, DNA identification is not only a way of securing convictions; it is also a way of excluding suspects who might otherwise be falsely charged with and convicted of serious crimes."5

Admissibility of DNA Test

6.    DNA Report like any other opinion of an expert under Article 59 is relevant and thus admissible. Article 164 of the QSO further underlines the admissibility, reliability and weightage of modern scientific forensic evidence, including the DNA test, as the said Article provides that convictions may be based on modern techniques and devices. Over the years DNA test has also come to be recognized by our statutory criminal law. Section 164-A6, Cr.P.C provides that where an offence of committing rape, unnatural offence or sexual abuse or an attempt to commit rape or unnatural offence or sexual abuse under section 376, section 377 or section 377B respectively of the P.P.C. is under investigation the victim shall be examined by a medical practitioner who shall examine the victim and prepare a report of examination giving, inter alia, the "description of material taken from body of the victim for DNA profiling" under section 164A(2)(c). Similarly, under section 53A7 where a person is arrested on a charge of committing an offence of rape or unnatural offence or sexual abuse or an attempt to commit rape or unnatural offence or sexual abuse under section 376, section 377 or section 377B respectively of the P.P.C. and there are reasonable grounds for believing that an examination of the arrested person will afford evidence as to the commission of such offence it is lawful for the medical practitioner to make such an examination of the arrested person and to use such force as is reasonably necessary for that purpose. The medical practitioner conducting examination is to examine, without delay, such person and prepare a report of the examination giving, inter alia, the description of material taken from person of the accused for DNA profiling, under section 53A(2)(d). Under section 164-B8 where an offence under sections 376, 377 or section 377B, P.P.C. is committed or attempted to have been committed or alleged to have been committed, DNA samples where practicable, are to be collected from the victim with his or her consent or with the consent of his or her natural or legal guardian as provided in section 164A and DNA samples of the accused under section 53A, both within optimal time period of receiving information relating to the commission of such offence. Under subsection (2) of section 164B, such DNA samples are to be sent, at the earliest, for investigation to a forensic laboratory where these are to be properly examined and preserved by observing confidentiality of such examination at all times. The above legislative framework underscores the relevancy and thus the admissibility of a DNA Test.

Admissible versus per se admissible

7.    While the admissibility of expert opinion is already recognized under QSO, section 510, Cr.P.C. deals with special rules of evidence and makes the evidentiary procedure simple by providing that certain reports of the chemical examiner, etc. may be used in any trial without calling the Government Chemical Examiner, Serologist, finger print expert or fire-arm expert as a witness. Allowing admission of reports of the said Governmental experts in evidence without their author appearing as a witness has the objective of saving time and speeding up criminal trials. This simple procedure of admission of these reports in evidence, is referred to as per se admissible. However, the court may if it considers necessary, in the interest of justice, summon and examine the person by whom such a report has been made. Section 510, Cr.P.C refers to reports of certain experts only but does not specifically mention the expert who conducts DNA analysis, hence the DNA Test report is not per se admissible but it is certainly admissible if tendered in evidence by examining as witness the expert under whose hand it is prepared as per the QSO. Additionally, under section 9 of the Punjab Forensic Science  Agency Act, 2007 an expert of the PFSA is considered to be an expert in terms of section 510 Cr.P.C. Therefore, DNA Test Report prepared by an expert of the PFSA is per se admissible.

8.    This Court in Azeem Khan case9 questioned the admissibility of the DNA Test Report on the touchstone of section 510, Cr.P.C. and left it open to be discussed in some other case. It is, therefore, important to address this question and clear the air regarding the admissibility of DNA Test Report. As explained above, per se admissibility is a procedural facility for tendering evidence extended to reports of certain experts but it does not affect or have any bearing on the admissibility of a document which is governed by the QSO, and any report or opinion of an expert in matters of science, etc., which is recognized to be relevant under Articles 59 and 164 QSO and is thus admissible under the law of evidence (QSO). Besides, much water has flown under the bridge, since Azeem Khan case. There has been new legislation giving DNA Test, statutory recognition and importance. Article 164 QSO holds immense importance especially after the insertion of the proviso through Act 4 of 2017 in the year 201710 and demands that the scope of expert opinions under Article 59 QSO and the special rule of evidence under section 510, Cr.P.C. be interpreted progressively in the years to come to give more space and recognition to modern forensic science.

9.    It is important to underline that the use of the word "Chemical Examiner" in section 510 Cr.P.C. is almost obsolete and has no established definition. Now, "forensic scientists" run and manage modern forensic laboratories. It is time for the Government to consider revision of section 510 Cr.P.C. allowing reports of all the Government forensic scientists (as opposed to the specified ones under section 510 Cr.P.C) to be per se admissible, to speed up the wheels of dispensation of criminal justice in the country. Needless to say that under the proviso to section 510 Cr.P.C the courts can always summon and examine the expert who has prepared and authored the report.

DNA, strongest corroborative piece of evidence today

10.  DNA evidence is considered as a gold standard to establish the identity of an accused. As a sequel of above discussion, it can safely be concluded that DNA Test due to its accuracy and conclusiveness is one of the strongest corroborative pieces of evidence. In Salman Akram Raja case11 this Court has held that DNA test help provides the courts the identity of the perpetrator with high degree of confidence, and by using of the DNA technology the courts are in a better position to reach at a just conclusion whereby convicting the real culprits and excluding the potential suspects, as well as, exonerating wrongfully involved accused. DNA test with scientific certainty and clarity points towards the perpetrator and is, therefore, considered one of the strongest corroborative evidence today, especially in cases of rape. The usefulness of DNA analysis, however, depends mostly on the skill, ability and integrity shown by the investigating officers, who are the first to arrive at the scene of the crime. Unless the evidence is properly documented, collected, packaged and preserved, it will not meet the legal and scientific requirements for admissibility into a court of law.

11.  Coming back to the merits of the case, we find that Jabbar Hussain (PW-6) and Tufail Shah (PW-7) were not chance witnesses. They were residents of the locality and their presence near the place of occurrence, i.e., the jawar field, was quite natural. They saw the petitioner coming out of that field while tightening the string of his shalwar at a time that is in line with the time of occurrence reported in the FIR and the approximate time of death of the deceased mentioned in the post-mortem report. The extrajudicial confession though is a weak piece of evidence; but in the present case, it also inspires confidence when it is read in conjunction with other circumstantial evidence. The medical evidence, viz, the post mortem report (Ex-PL) and statement of Dr. Sunia (PW-11) who made the post-mortem examination of the deceased, supports the prosecution case. The fact established by the medical evidence that the deceased had suffered vaginal injury, as her hymen was found freshly torn with tear at 6 O'clock extending upto perineum with fresh bleeding, clearly supports the prosecution case that the deceased was raped before causing her death. The medical opinion of Dr. Sunia (PW-11) that the death of the deceased occurred due to throttling tallies with the DNA report regarding the swab obtained from the neck of the deceased: the DNA report states matching of the DNA found in that swab with that of the petitioner. The most important piece of circumstantial evidence in the present case, we find, is the DNA Test Report (Ex-PP) of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency ("PFSA"). Three vaginal swabs, one swab taken from the neck of the deceased and stained sections of the shalwar and shirt of the deceased along with buccal swab of the petitioner were sent to the PFSA for forensic examination. According to the DNA Test Report the semen from vaginal swabs, as well as, the stain of the shalwar of the deceased matched the DNA of the petitioner. The DNA in the swab obtained from the neck of the deceased also matched the DNA of the petitioner. The waj takkar evidence, evidence of extrajudicial confession, medical evidence and DNA Test Report, together and clearly connects the petitioner with the rape and murder of the deceased, Rimsha Bibi. The chain of circumstantial evidence is firm and continuous, leaving no margin for the hypothesis of innocence of the petitioner. The rope of circumstantial evidence, adduced by the prosecution, ties the dead body of the deceased with the neck of the petitioner. The prosecution has thus proved its case against the petitioner beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, we are not persuaded to espouse a view different from that given by the trial court and confirmed by the High Court as to the convictions and sentences of the petitioner. Accordingly, leave is refused and this petition is dismissed.

       "For the reasons to be recorded later, this criminal petition is dismissed in toto."

JUDGMENT
.---As per brief allegations levelled by Mst. Mumtaz Bibi, complainant (PW-1), 04 years earlier to the registration of FIR, she was married to one Gohar Aman. However, due to matrimonial disputes she was divorced one month earlier by the said Gohar Aman. The complainant thereafter started living in the house of her brother namely Muhammad Zaman (PW-3). Muhammad Imran, petitioner, was a friend of Muhammad Zaman who used to come to the house of the complainant party. On 11-7-2016 at 08:00 PM (night), Mst. Mumtaz Bibi, complainant, was alone in her house. In the meanwhile, Muhammad Imran, petitioner, came to the house of the complainant party and while entering the said house, he bolted the outer gate of the house from inside, where-after, the petitioner forcibly dragged the complainant towards a room of the above-mentioned house where he committed rape with her after removing her shalwar. The petitioner, thereafter, fled away from the spot. After the occurrence, the complainant raised hue and cry, whereupon, Muhammad Zaman (PW-3) and Muhammad Waseem Akram (PW-2) attracted to the spot. Hence, the FIR (Ex.PA/1) of the instant case.

2.    The prosecution produced 09 witnesses before the learned trial Court to prove the charge against the petitioner. After recording the statement of the petitioner under Section 342, Cr.P.C. and hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties, the learned trial Court convicted and sentenced the petitioner as under:-

       Under Section 376, P.P.C.

       10 years RI with fine of Rs.1,00,000/-, in default thereof to undergo 06-months SI.

       Under Section 449, P.P.C.

       02-years RI with fine of Rs.20,000/-, in default thereof to undergo 03-months S.I.

       Both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently and the benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was also extended to the petitioner.

3.    The appeal filed by the petitioner was dismissed by the learned Bahawalpur Bench of the Lahore High Court vide judgment dated 17-5-2023 in Criminal Appeal No. 452/2019. Hence, the instant Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal before this Court bearing No. 725/2023.

4.    Arguments heard. Record perused.

5.    Although during the pendency of this case before this Court, the petitioner moved Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 374/2024 for grant of permission to compound the offence whereupon a report was requisitioned, which has been received from the learned District and Sessions Judge, Bahawalnagar, and according to the said report, the sole eye-witness of the case namely Mst. Mumtaz Bibi, complainant (PW-1) has exonerated the petitioner from the charge and she stated that due to some misunderstanding she named the petitioner in this case and now she is satisfied that the petitioner is innocent, hence, she has no objection on the acquittal of the petitioner but it is noteworthy that the complainant/ victim did not exonerate the petitioner at the time of recording of her statement by the learned trial Court and at that time she supported the prosecution case. Furthermore, the offence under Section 376, P.P.C. is a non-compoundable offence, therefore, the petitioner cannot be acquitted on the basis of the above-mentioned ground. We, therefore, while dismissing Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 374/2024 for grant of permission to compound the offence, proceed to decide the main Criminal Petition No. 725/2023, on merits.

6.    The main contention of learned counsel for the petitioner is that it was not a case of rape punishable under Section 376, P.P.C. and at the most it was a case of fornication (zina with consent) punishable under Section 496-B, P.P.C. As mentioned above, the complainant has already exonerated the petitioner from the charge, therefore, no one appeared on behalf of the complainant to oppose the above-referred contention of learned counsel for the petitioner. However, learned Additional Prosecutor General has controverted the above-mentioned argument of learned counsel for the petitioner while arguing that according to the facts of the case and evidence produced by the prosecution, it is a case of rape punishable under Section 376, P.P.C.

       It is true that as per report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, the DNA profile of Muhammad Imran, petitioner matched with the DNA profile of semens detected on the vaginal swabs of Mst. Mumtaz Bibi, complainant, which shows that illicit intercourse took place between the petitioner and the complainant and the complainant (PW-1) also alleged that the petitioner committed rape with her but the moot point for determination before this Court is that as to whether it is a case of rape punishable under Section 376, P.P.C. or it a case of fornication (zina with consent) punishable under Section 496-B, P.P.C. In order to resolve the above-mentioned controversy, we have noted that occurrence in this case took place on 11-7-2016 at 08:00 PM (night) whereas the FIR was lodged on 13-7-2016 at 05:45 PM and, as such, there is a delay of about two days in reporting the matter to the Police. It was so mentioned in the FIR that brother of the complainant namely Muhammad Zaman (PW-3) and another witness namely Muhammad Waseem Akram (PW-2) attracted to the spot when the complainant raised hue and cry after the occurrence but even then the FIR was not promptly lodged and the complainant party kept on consulting with each other for about two days. No plausible explanation has been given by the prosecution for the above-mentioned delay in reporting the matter to the Police. Under the circumstances, the sanctity of truth cannot be attached to the FIR, as there was every possibility that the FIR was lodged after deliberations while narrating an exaggerated story to make the offence graver. Although mere delay in such like cases is not always fatal to the prosecution's case but while keeping in view the other particular facts of a case, the same may be relevant.

7.    We have further noted that in the contents of the FIR (Ex.PA/1), the complainant has herself stated that 04 years prior to the occurrence, her marriage was solemnized with one Gohar Aman but one month prior to the occurrence she (complainant) was divorced by her husband and thereafter she was living in the house of her brother namely Muhammad Zaman (PW-3). We have also noted that Mst. Mumtaz Bibi, complainant, who is the sole eye-witness of the occurrence has admitted during her cross-examination that prior to the registration of the instant FIR, earlier another FIR bearing No. 145/16 under Section 294, P.P.C. was lodged by the Police of Police Station City A-Division (Bahawalnagar) and she (complainant) as well as the present petitioner Muhammad Imran, both were arrested by the Police in the said case. The relevant parts of the statement of Mst.Mumtaz Bibi, complainant, in this respect are reproduced hereunder for ready reference:-

       "It is correct that prior to registration of this case on 23.05.2016 a case FIR No. 145/16 was registered with P/S City A-Division U/S 294, P.P.C. in which I was arrested by Muhammad Afzal ASI complainant of said FIR from Railway Colony, at that time I was arrested by police official. ……………………………………. ………………………………………………………………………………..

       It is correct that Imran accused present in court was also an accused of said FIR and he was also released on bail/surety before police. It is correct that my brother Muhammad Zaman PW got me released on bail/surety on 23.05.2016 in case FIR No. 145/16."

8.    It is, therefore, evident from the perusal of the above- mentioned parts of the statement of Mst. Mumtaz Bibi, complainant (PW-1) that she was earlier arrested by the Police along with the petitioner in a case of obscene acts. It is further noteworthy that although the complainant claimed that she was forcibly dragged by the petitioner towards a room of her house where the petitioner committed rape with her after forcibly removing her shalwar but no signs of dragging have been mentioned in the site plan of the place of occurrence (Ex.PB). Similarly, no mark of dragging or mark of any laceration, bruise or contusion was noted on the entire body of Mst. Mumtaz Bibi, complainant by the Medical Officer Dr. Nayab Arshad (PW-9). It was not alleged in the contents of the FIR or in the statement of Mst. Mumtaz Bibi, complainant (PW-1) recorded by the learned trial Court that the petitioner was armed with any firearm, churri, danda or any other weapon at the time of occurrence due to which the complainant became frightened and could not offer any resistance. The petitioner was admittedly empty handed at the time of occurrence. A female who is not a consenting party would offer very strong resistance in a case of attempt to commit rape with her by a male but as mentioned earlier in the instant case no mark of violence whatsoever was noted on the entire body of Mst. Mumtaz Bibi, complainant by the Medical Officer at the time of her medical examination. Likewise, the allegation of forcibly removing the clothes (shalwar) of Mst. Mumtaz Bibi, complainant (PW-1) was not corroborated with the recovery of any torn clothes of the complainant. All the above-mentioned facts show that Mst. Mumtaz Bibi, complainant was a consenting party. Under the circumstances, we are of the view that ingredients of offence of rape punishable under Section 376, P.P.C. are not attracted in this case rather it is a case of fornication (zina with consent) punishable under Section 496-B, P.P.C.

       We are aware of the fact that once we hold that it is a case of fornication punishable under Section 496-B, P.P.C. then Mst. Mumtaz Bibi, complainant is also liable to be proceeded against and punished as an accused of the offence of illicit intercourse with consent but as she was not challaned by the Police and no charge of fornication under Section 496-B, P.P.C. was framed against her by the learned trial Court, thus, she had no opportunity to defend herself, therefore, it will not be appropriate to punish her without providing her opportunity of defence.

9.    For what has been discussed above, by a majority of 2:1 (Justice Ayesha A. Malik dissenting), this petition is converted into appeal, partly allowed and the impugned judgment is modified to the extent that conviction and sentence of the petitioner/appellant under Section 376, P.P.C. is set aside and instead the petitioner/appellant is convicted under Section 496-B, P.P.C. and is sentenced to 05 years rigorous imprisonment with the fine of Rs.5000/- or in default whereof to further undergo 02 months simple imprisonment. As we have converted the conviction and sentence of the petitioner/appellant from the charge under Section 376, P.P.C. to the offence under Section 496-B, P.P.C., therefore, conviction and sentence of the petitioner/appellant under the charge of Section 449, P.P.C. is also set-aside and the petitioner/ appellant is convicted under Section 448, P.P.C. and sentenced to 01 year rigorous imprisonment. Both the sentences awarded to the petitioner/appellant shall run concurrently and benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. is also given to the petitioner/appellant.

                                                                   Sd/-

                                                                   Judge

       I Disagree with the reasons and conclusion of the majority opinion and have added my dissent to explain why.

                                                                   Sd/-

                                                                   Judge

       AYESHA A. MALIK, J.---I have read the opinion of the majority as contained in the judgment authored by Mr. Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan with the concurrence of Mr. Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail. However, I cannot agree with the reasoning given nor the conclusion drawn therein. Hence, my dissent is based on the reasons given hereunder.

2.    As per the prosecution's case, reflected in the First Information Report (FIR), Mumtaz Bibi (Complainant) was in the house of her brother Muhammad Zaman when on 11.07.2016, at 8:00 p.m., Muhammad Imran (Petitioner), who was a friend of her brother (Muhammad Zaman) and visited often, came to the house when her brother was not home and she was alone. He bolted the outer gate of the house, forcibly took her to the bedroom placing his hand over her mouth, where she was subjected to rape. On her hue and cry, Muhammad Waseem Akram (PW-2) and Muhammad Zaman, her brother (PW-3) came to the house where she narrated the incident. She approached the police station on the same night through her application dated 11.07.2016 (Ex.PA); she was brought by the police before Dr. Nayab Arshad, WMO DHQ Hospital, Bahawalnagar (PW-9) for her medical examination on the same night at 2:25 a.m. on 12.07.2016. The doctor examined her physically and also obtained, for the purposes of the Deoxyribonucleic Acid test (DNA), two external and two internal vaginal swabs and blood samples and sent the same to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (PFSA). Buccal swab standards of the Petitioner as well as the Complainant were taken on 22.07.2016 at the PFSA. The DNA test came positive as per the Report dated 28.09.2017 (DNA Report).

3.    The Petitioner was arrested on 21.10.2017. The Petitioner was sent to face trial before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Bahawalnagar. The trial court vide judgment dated 11.07.2019 convicted the Petitioner as under:

       "Under Section 376, P.P.C.: 10-Years rigorous imprisonment with fine of Rs.100,000/- or six months SI in the event of default.

       Under Section 449, P.P.C.: 02-Years rigorous imprisonment with fine of Rs.20,000/- or three months SI in the event of default.

       The sentences were ordered to run concurrently with benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C."

4.    The Lahore High Court, Bahawalpur Bench, Bahawalpur

(High Court) vide the Impugned Judgment dated 17.05.2023

(Impugned Judgment) dismissed the appeal filed by the Petitioner while maintaining his conviction and sentence mainly on the ground that the Complainant stood firm in her stance of rape and that the MLC (Ex.PE) and DNA Report (Ex.PF) corroborated her story. The High Court also concluded that there is no evidence on the record that the Complainant and the Petitioner willfully engaged in sexual intercourse. The High Court decided that the Petitioner failed to prove that the Complainant wanted to marry him and, on his refusal, she filed a fake case against him.

5.    As per the opinion of the majority, the Complainant failed to make out a case of rape under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (P.P.C.) and instead, a case under Section 496-B of the P.P.C., being a case of 'fornication', has been made out. Consequently, the majority's opinion has modified the Impugned Judgment to the extent that the conviction and sentence of the Petitioner under Section 376 of the P.P.C. has been set aside and instead, the Petitioner has been convicted under Section 496- B of the P.P.C. and sentenced to 5-years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5000/- or in default to undergo 2-months simple imprisonment. The majority's opinion has also set aside the conviction and sentence recorded under Section 449 of the P.P.C. and convicted him under Section 448 of the P.P.C.1 Consequently, as per the opinion of the majority, the offense of rape is not made out and in its place the offense of fornication has been made out for which the Petitioner has been convicted and sentenced. This finding has two important parts to it, one being with reference to proving the offense of rape and the second being that in view of a positive DNA Report, this Court has imputed consent on behalf of the Complainant and subjected the Petitioner to a conviction under Section 496-B of the P.P.C.. I will take up both these issues separately.

6.    With reference to the charge of rape, for the purposes of this case, in terms of Section 375 of the P.P.C.,2 rape is when a man has sexual intercourse with a woman against her will, without her consent, or with her consent which is obtained by putting the fear of death in her or by hurting her and finally where she gives consent believing that she is married to him or where the consent is given to a minor under the age of sixteen. In terms of the said section, what was required by way of evidence was proof that she was subjected to sexual intercourse against her will and without her consent. As per the law settled by this Court, the most definitive and conclusive evidence in a case of rape is the DNA test. In the Ali Haider case, this Court has held that DNA evidence is considered to be the gold standard to establish the identity of an accused due to its accuracy and conclusiveness and is one of the strongest and most corroborative pieces of evidence in rape cases.3 This Court has explained that DNA test with scientific and clarity points towards the perpetrator and leaves very little room for doubt. In the Salman Akram Raja case, this Court has held that the DNA test provides a high degree of confidence for identifying perpetrators and is extremely useful for ascertaining the real culprits and excluding potential suspects.4 DNA tests are considered to be as accurate as fingerprints especially in a rape case as it clearly establishes the fact that a perpetrator has had sexual intercourse with the victim. A recent study rendered the impact of DNA tests on the prosecution case is such that when the DNA evidence matches the suspect in a rape case, the odds of conviction are substantially greater than in cases with ordinary evidence.5 As per the study, DNA evidence establishes that the suspect had sexual contact with the victim and highlights the importance of quality forensic medical examinations. Accordingly, the veracity and significance of the DNA test cannot be ruled out or ignored when the test becomes corroborative evidence in support of the allegation of rape.

7.    With reference to the value of the statement of a complainant, this Court has also held that the solitary statement of the victim is sufficient to award a conviction in a rape case if that statement is trustworthy, consistent and reliable.6 The Supreme Court of India (SCI) in the Gurmit Singh case has ruled that the courts should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable.7 The SCI further held that corroborative evidence is not an imperative component of judicial credence in every case of rape.8 This Court has also repeatedly ruled that marks of violence in a case of sexual offence are not essential to establish rape and that in the absence of visible marks of violence, it cannot be inferred that the plea of rape is devoid of any merit, especially where the medical evidence confirms sexual intercourse.9 In this context, it is important to note that the victim's character or reputation is also immaterial by way of evidence, there being no nexus between her reputation, character and the offense of rape. Similarly, questions targeting her character have no relevance to the matter on trial, that is, the commission of rape.10 Similarly, physical resistance need not be established in a rape case as different people react differently when confronted with trauma and to subject all women to a stereotypical presumption that she must resist in a particular form in order to establish rape is totally without basis. These cases show the shift in the jurisprudence which relies on the statement of the victim and corroborative scientific evidence to establish rape and essentially denounce myths, presumptions and stereotypical arguments.

8.    The offense of rape is made on the body of the victim and her response to this offensive act cannot be standardized as per expected responses. As per expert psychiatrists, the reflexive reaction of fear or threat in a victim may automatically lead to fight, flight or freeze responses.11 Especially, in sexual violence, the victim may not be able to make decisions to protect themselves as they might freeze or get stuck in response to the traumatic experience.12 The use of force or intimidation, the act itself, its trauma and the response will vary from victim to victim and is, therefore, totally subjective. Hence, I totally disagree with the findings given in the opinion of the majority that, since the Petitioner was unarmed, having no weapon at the time of occurrence, a female who is not a consenting party would offer very strong resistance in a case of rape and consequently, there would be marks of resistance on her body. There is no uniform or predictable response of a victim in a case of rape, and at the same time, there is no standardized response of behavior after the rape that would culminate into evidence against the victim. A United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, while considering the stereotypical standards imposed on women to establish rape concluded that such stereotypical standards deny women fair trial because it reinforces a typical myth that women must resist sexual assault. In this regard, the said Committee stressed that there can be no assumption of law or practice that a woman gave her consent simply because there are no marks of resistance.13 As per Jan Jordan, the requirement that the victim display evidence of resistance or 'she must fight back' is one of the influential myths in rape trials.14 She highlighted that the masculinist and restrictive approach in rape cases denies and invalidates the realities of women's experiences. By reducing to a physical act of insertion, "the act of rape is stripped from the fear that surrounds women's existence within patriarchal structures of gender inequality."15 A recent study concluded that most people do not believe that a high ratio of rape or sexual assault cases exists in Pakistan and they further believed that these cases are completely false and fabricated.16 Sometimes, to silence the victims of rape or sexual abuse and to bar them to seek justice, criminal defamation proceedings are initiated against them by the perpetrators.17 In my opinion, relying on marks of injury or visible signs of resistance as evidence of rape is a fallacy and a denial of a fair trial to the complainant, who is the victim of a serious and heinous crime. Catharine MacKinnon highlights that the deeper problem is the rape law's assumption that a single, objective state of affairs existed and when the reality is split, "the law tends to conclude that a rape did not happen."18

9.    At this point, it is relevant to note that victims of rape are subjected to a higher burden of proof than victims of other crimes based on certain misconceptions or presumptions against the victim and the rape. For example, the presumption that women usually lie that they are raped or that women who are widowed or divorced are more likely to consent to intercourse or even that every woman will resist her perpetrator in a particular manner which resistance must be evident and obvious for her to establish rape. Furthermore, gender-based violence is often viewed in the framework of morality, public decency and honor, rather than viewed as violence against women's integrity. This is so notwithstanding the fact that the law on the subject of rape has evolved over the years where this Court has held that the best evidence in a rape case is a DNA test and that her previous character or reputation is irrelevant. In the same way her sexual history has become irrelevant and most importantly, in cases of rape, this Court has repeatedly recognized that the statement of the victim is sufficient if it is confidence inspiring.

10.  In the facts of the instant case, to establish rape, the prosecution has shown a positive DNA test by PFSA where both the Petitioner and the Complainant were tested and as per the DNA Report, the DNA profile of the Petitioner matched that taken from the Complainant. Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the statement of Dr. Nayab Arshad, WMO DHQ Hospital, Bahawalnagar (PW-9) is not conclusive proof as she has not stated that the Complainant was subjected to rape. This is again an irrelevant contention given that the doctor has confirmed sexual intercourse with the Petitioner and clearly stated that it is not in her domain to declare that the Complainant was raped or otherwise as she has confined herself to the medico-legal examination and the condition of the victim. Furthermore, the ocular evidence of the Complainant and Muhammad Zaman (PW-3) places the Petitioner at the house of Muhammad Zaman at the time of the occurrence as PW-3 states that he saw the Petitioner fleeing from the house. Muhammad Waseem Akram (PW-2) also states that he saw the Petitioner fleeing from the house on the date of the occurrence at the given time. The Complainant's statement is without any discrepancy and she has dispelled the allegations raised by the Investigating Officer that she wanted to marry the Petitioner and on his refusal she filed a false case against him. In terms of the medical examination and filing of FIR, the record does not show any delay as the record shows that she promptly approached the police on the same night through her application dated 11.07.2016 (Ex.PA); she was brought by the police before Dr. Nayab Arshad, WMO DHQ Hospital, Bahawalnagar (PW-9) for her medical examination on the same night at 2:25 a.m.; the Medico-Legal Examination Certificate for Female Survivors of Sexual Violence (Ex.PE) dated 12.07.2016 was issued by the said WMO. So there is no delay on the part of the Complainant in reporting the incident to the police and having herself examined which included the DNA test. Notwithstanding the clear set of facts in this case, with reference to delay, this Court has held that delay is of no consequence as such cases involve the victim and her family's reputation and honor, hence, some delay in reporting a crime of sexual offense is immaterial.19 In the Hamid Khan's case, a three-day delay in reporting the crime to the police was deemed as insignificant.20 Hence, there is no rule of thumb that a delay in reporting the crime suggests that victim has lied or registered a fake case.

11.  The Petitioner has also relied upon the registration of FIR No. 145/2016 and stated that there has been a previous case filed against them under Section 294 of the P.P.C. in which she obtained bail.21 The Petitioner contends that this previous case under Section 294 of the P.P.C. suggests that the Complainant has a relationship with the Petitioner, however, the said provision is totally irrelevant as it pertains to obscene acts and songs wherein any obscene act in a public place or recitation of obscene song constitutes to an offense under Section 294 of the P.P.C. In no manner does an offence under Section 294 of the P.P.C. suggest that the Petitioner and the Complainant were involved sexually based on their willingness and consent.

12.  So, for the purposes of establishing rape, I am of the opinion that the Complainant has made out a case of rape against the Petitioner and, therefore, I am in agreement with the concurrent findings of the trial court as well as the High Court in this case.

13.  It is crucial to observe that the Constitution specifically deals with preserving, protecting and promoting the rights of women, which are clearly violated in gender-based violence cases. Article 9 of the Constitution protects the right to life. Article 14 grants the inviolable right to dignity as well as the right to privacy. In cases of rape, there is a gross violation of the right to life, dignity and privacy. In this context, the State is responsible for ensuring that essential and required steps are taken to protect women from such crimes, and also to protect them from gender stereotyping which undermines a woman's ability to enjoy her basic fundamental rights. It goes without saying that gender stereotyping should not undermine the rule of law. The act of rape has serious consequences as it deprives a woman of her right to life and her right to dignity and privacy which includes the right to mental and physical integrity. Every woman is entitled to respect for her life, her integrity and the security of her person. No woman should be stigmatized simply because she has availed her right to access to justice and reported a heinous crime against her person and body.

14.  Pakistan is a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) which condemns discrimination against women in all its forms and requires that appropriate measures be taken to eliminate discrimination against women. It recognizes gender-based violence, constitutes a form of discrimination and requires States to take steps to eradicate this. It specifically requires that the law must respect the integrity and dignity of women. Article 5 of the CEDAW requires that the right to be free from violence means the right to be valued, educated and free from eliminating stereotypical patterns of behaviors including social and cultural practices, which also include prohibiting inferiority or superiority ideas on the basis of sexes.

15.  Now, I come to the second part of the opinion of the majority wherein they have changed the charge of rape under Section 376 of the P.P.C. to fornication under Section 496-B of the P.P.C. The underlying reason and basis for doing so is that sexual intercourse was established by the DNA test meaning it is not rape but rather consensual intercourse between the parties. Section 496-B of the P.P.C. states that a man, and a woman not married to each other are said to commit fornication if they willfully have sexual intercourse with one another and further that whoever commits fornication shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine not exceeding ten thousand rupees. The essential ingredient of fornication is the establishment by way of evidence of the fact that it was a willful intercourse between the parties. Hence, it is essential that for the purposes of fornication consent be established. Consent means an unequivocal voluntary agreement with the woman by words, gestures or any form of verbal or non-verbal communication, which communicates her willingness to participate in the sexual act. Consent goes to the very root of the right to dignity under Article 9 of the Constitution because in a case of rape where she states that there is no consent then to impute consent, that too without evidence of the same, undermines the dignity and the right to privacy of a woman. Consequently, without any evidence on the fact of consent or willingness the offence of fornication cannot be made out because consent has to be established and it cannot be assumed. In the Ashraf case, the Federal Shariat Court described the word 'consent' to be of the same mind; to agree to give assent; to yield to comply. The said judgment further stated that consent necessarily implies agreement as a free agent with the presence of the free mind and free will.22 Recently, the Indian Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 introduced Section 114A in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 which states where sexual intercourse is proved, and the woman did not consent to it then the law mandates that the court shall presume that she did not consent.23 Section 53A of the Indian Evidence Act even requires that the evidence of character or previous sexual experience is not relevant in rape cases, and where the issue is of consent involved, Section 146 of the said law requires that no questions in cross-examination will be put to the victim as to her character or sexual for proving such consent. It is important to note that Pakistan has similarly expanded the definition of 'consent'24 in Section 375 of the P.P.C. by stating that consent means an unequivocal voluntary agreement, gestures of any form of verbal or nonverbal communication, and communicates willingness to participate in the specific sexual act. Furthermore, this Court by giving a finding of fornication against the Complainant, who has successfully established her case of rape before the trial court and the High Court on the basis of evidence, now at this stage, it means the denial of due process and fair trial as this Court by way of a declaration has stated that she indulged in an act of fornication with the Petitioner. This is significant given that it is not the Petitioner's case that he was involved with the Complainant nor is it the Petitioner's case that he went to the Complainant's house at that particular time nor did he by way of defense raise the plea of consent or willingness. The Petitioner in his statement under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Cr.P.C.) denied the Prosecution's case and specifically took the plea that the Complainant wanted to marry him and, on his refusal, she managed to register a fake case against him. He neither appeared as his own witness under Section 340(2) of the Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in his defense. Hence, it is not the Petitioner's case that there was consensual intercourse between him and the Complainant. The Petitioner did not specifically raise this defense that he was involved with her and had consensual intercourse. Therefore, I cannot subscribe to this view that an offense under Section 496-B of the P.P.C. is made out. Accordingly, the judgments passed by the trial court as well as the High Court do not call for interference.

16.  The opinion of the majority has referred to the report of the District and Sessions Judge, Bahawalnagar (Cr.M.A. No.374 of 2024) wherein it was reported that the Complainant has tendered her affidavit Mark-A that she has no objection if the Petitioner is acquitted from this case. This fact is irrelevant given that the offense of rape is non-compoundable, and the Cr.M.A. No.374 of 2024 has been rightly turned down.

17.  In view of the foregoing, this Criminal Petition is dismissed, and leave is refused.

                                                                   Sd/-

JUDGMENT
.---Asif Masih, Qasim Iqbal and Sajid Majeed, petitioners, were tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faisalabad, pursuant to a case registered vide FIR No. 847/2013 dated 14.08.2013 under Sections 365-B, 376, 109 P.P.C. at Police Station Madina Town, Faisalabad. The learned Trial Court vide its judgment dated 11.10.2017 convicted and sentenced the petitioners as under:-

Asif Masih

Under Section 376(i) P.P.C.

       Sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 25 years along with fine of Rs.50,000/- or in default thereof to further undergo three months simple imprisonment. He was also directed to pay compensation amounting to Rs.500,000/- to the child namely Maryam or in default thereof to further suffer imprisonment for a period of six months. Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. was also extended to the petitioner.

Qasim Iqbal alias Moon and Sajid Majeed

Under Section 365-B P.P.C.

       Sentenced to life imprisonment along with fine of Rs.50,000/- each or in default thereof, each accused was ordered to further undergo simple imprisonment for three months.

Under Section 376(ii) P.P.C.

       Sentenced each of the petitioner to rigorous imprisonment for life along with fine of Rs.50,000/- each or in default thereof each convict was ordered to further undergo simple imprisonment for three months.

2.    In appeal, the learned High Court while maintaining the convictions and sentences of Qasim Iqbal and Sajid Majeed, petitioners, under Section 365-B P.P.C., set aside their convictions and sentences under Section 376(ii) P.P.C. However, to the extent of Asif Masih, petitioner, the learned High Court upheld the judgment of the learned Trial Court.

3.    Arguments heard. Record perused.

4.    According to the contents of the FIR, on 13.08.2013 at 04:30 AM, Qasim Iqbal alias Moon, petitioner, Mst. Ishrat Bibi, co-accused (since acquitted), Mst. Aqsa daughter of Muhammad Iqbal, co-accused (since acquitted) and Mst. Hameeda Bibi, co-accused (since acquitted) abducted the daughter of the complainant namely Mst. Aqsa Riaz through inducement and thereafter handed her over to Sajid Majeed, petitioner. Gold ornaments weighing three tolas and cash amount of Rs. 40,000/- along with clothes were also stolen from the house of the complainant. The complainant started search for his daughter Mst. Aqsa Riaz and during the said search, he was told by Muhammad Niaz (PW-4) and Lashkar Ali Dogar (PW-5) that Qasim Iqbal alias Moon (petitioner) and his above-mentioned co-accused had abducted his daughter and handed her over to Sajid Majeed, petitioner, hence, the FIR of this case.

5.    The ocular account of the prosecution was furnished by Mst. Aqsa Riaz, alleged abductee (PW-1), Muhammad Niaz (PW-4) and Lashkar Ali (PW-5). It is true that the alleged abductee Mst. Aqsa Riaz (PW-1) had given birth to a female illegitimate child and according to the DNA test report (Exh.PM), Asif Masih, petitioner, was found to be her biological father but the moot point for determination before this Court is that as to whether it was a case of forcible abduction and rape as envisaged under Sections 365-B and 376 P.P.C. or it was a case of zina with consent punishable under Section 496-B P.P.C.

       It is noteworthy that according to the prosecution evidence on the night of occurrence i.e. on 13.08.2013 at 04:30 AM, the complainant along with his other family members and Mst. Aqsa Riaz, abductee (PW-1), was sleeping at the roof of his house when his daughter was allegedly abducted by four (04) accused. In the contents of the FIR, it was not alleged that the accused persons were carrying any weapon at the time of abduction of Mst. Aqsa Riaz (PW­1). Under the circumstances, it is not understandable that as to why Mst. Aqsa Riaz (PW-1) did not raise any hue and cry at the time of her abduction from the roof of her house at night time (04:30 AM) when her other family members were also sleeping on the same roof. Although, Mst. Aqsa Riaz while appearing in the Court has given a contradictory story to that of the story mentioned in the FIR wherein she stated that the accused persons abducted her at pistol point but no such allegation was levelled in the FIR. Moreover, no pistol was recovered from any accused during the investigation of this case. It is further noteworthy that Muhammad Niaz (PW-4) was real brother of the complainant who saw the accused persons while abducting Mst. Aqsa Riaz but he did not raise any hue and cry when he saw the abduction of his real niece Mst. Aqsa Riaz at the odd hours of night i.e. 04:30 AM. The conduct of said witness was highly un­natural which makes his evidence and the evidence of his companion Lashkar Ali Dogar (PW-5) as unreliable.

       It is further noteworthy that Mst. Aqsa Riaz (PW-1) was statedly abducted on 13.08.2013 and she came back to her parent's house from Darul Aman on 11. 12.2014 i.e. after one year and four months from the occurrence. She candidly conceded during her cross-examination that she appeared before the Magistrate about 3/4 times during her stay in Darul Aman but she never levelled the allegation of her abduction or rape against the petitioners/ accused. The relevant parts of her statement in this respect are reproduced hereunder for ready reference:-

"It is correct that I appeared before the Magistrate three/four time during my stay in Dar ul Aman. It is correct that whenever I appeared before the Magistrate I never stated before the Magistrate about my abduction and commission of rape. It is correct that on the day of my release I appeared before the Magistrate and it is also correct that on that day I also did not state before the Magistrate about my abduction and commission of rape. It is correct that many police officials were present in the Katchery premises always."

       ……………………………………………………..

       "It is correct that I always got recorded my statement before the Magistrate to stay further in the Dar-ul -Aman."

It is, therefore, evident that the prosecution story of forcible abduction and rape of the alleged abductee was result of an afterthought of the abductee and her family members after return of the alleged abductee to her parent's house. It is further noteworthy that no ornament or cash amount was recovered from any accused. As per medico legal report, no mark of violence was noted on the body of Mst. Aqsa Riaz (PW-1).

6.    In the light of above, we have come to this irresistible conclusion that neither it was a case of forcible abduction punishable under Section 365-B P.P.C. nor it was a case of forcible intercourse/ rape punishable under Section 376 P.P.C. It is evident from the perusal of above-mentioned evidence that Mst. Aqsa Riaz (PW-1) had left her house with her free will and consent, whereafter, Asif Masih, petitioner, committed intercourse with her with her consent due to which an illegitimate child was born. The ingredients of offence of commission of zina with consent punishable under Section 496-B P.P.C. are, however, proved in this case only to the extent of Asif Masih, petitioner, on account of the evidence of Mst. Aqsa Riaz and medical evidence brought on the record through Dr. Sumera Ashraf (PW-12), as well as, positive report of DNA test (Ex.PM), whereby Asif Masih (petitioner) was found to be the biological father of the illegitimate child of Mst. Aqsa Riaz (PW-1). Although, it is argued by the learned DPG that while keeping in view the provisions of Section 496-B P.P.C., Mst. Aqsa Riaz (PW-1) is also liable to be convicted and sentenced for offence of zina with consent but we have noted that she was not made an accused in this case by the Police. No charge was framed against her by the learned Trial Court and she has not been provided a chance to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses and defend herself, therefore, it will not be justified to convict and sentence her in absence of fulfilment of the legal requirements. Reference in this context may be made to a majority judgment passed by this Court (approved for reporting) in the case of Muhammad Imran v. The State in Criminal Misc. Application No. 374/2024 in Criminal Petition No. 725/2023. In the light of above, the conviction and sentence of Asif Masih, petitioner, for the charge under Section 376(i) P.P.C. is set aside. He is, however, convicted under Section 496-B P.P.C. and sentenced to undergo five years rigorous imprisonment. He is also directed to pay fine amounting to Rs.10,000/- or in default thereof to further undergo three months' rigorous imprisonment. Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. is also extended to Asif Masih, petitioner. To the extent of Asif Masih, petitioner, this petition is converted into an appeal and is partly allowed in the above-mentioned terms. The impugned judgment is modified accordingly.

7.         Insofar as the case of Qasim Iqbal and Sajid Majeed, petitioners, are concerned, we have noted that the said petitioners have already been acquitted by the High Court from the charge under Section 376(ii) P.P.C. and they have been convicted and sentenced only for the offence under Section 365-B P.P.C. but, as mentioned earlier, the case of abduction of Mst. Aqsa Riaz as envisaged under Section 365-B P.P.C. could not be proved by the prosecution. The prosecution evidence in this respect is not worthy of reliance. We have already held that the alleged abductee Mst. Aqsa Riaz with her free will and consent had left her house, whereafter, Asif Masih, petitioner, committed intercourse with her with her consent. Consequently, to the extent of Qasim Iqbal and Sajid Majeed, petitioners, this petition is converted into an appeal and allowed. The impugned judgment to their extent is set aside. They are acquitted of the charge. They shall be released from the jail forthwith unless required to be detained in any other case.

8.    Above are the detailed reasons of our short order of even date.

جسٹس راحیل کامران
فیصلہ ۔۔۔۔۔۔
کام کی جگہ پر ہراسانی صرف دفتری حدود تک محدود نہیں ہوتی بلکہ جب بھی اختیارات کا ناجائز استعمال ملازمت سے منسلک ہو، وہ ہراسانی کے زمرے میں آتا ہے، چاہے وہ دفتر سے باہر ہی کیوں نہ ہو۔ محتسب (Ombudsperson) کو یہ اختیار حاصل ہے کہ وہ فوجداری مقدمے کے نتائج کا انتظار کیے بغیر آزادانہ طور پر کارروائی کر سکے۔

عدالت نے یہ بھی قرار دیا کہ عزت، خاندانی وقار اور معاشرتی دباؤ جیسے عوامل اکثر خواتین کو خاموش رہنے پر مجبور کر دیتے ہیں، اس لیے شکایت میں تاخیر کو نہ تو رضامندی (Consent) تصور کیا جا سکتا ہے اور نہ ہی اسے عورت کے حقِ انصاف کو ناکام بنانے کے لیے استعمال کیا جا سکتا ہے۔
کیس کی مختصر تفصیل 

مہوش نامی ایک خاتون کا جھنگ کے ایک گورنمنٹ گرلز ووکیشنل انسٹیٹیوٹ میں بطور عارضی ٹیچر تقرر ہوگیا۔ اسی ادارے میں عمر شہزاد نامی ایک افسر بھی بطور ڈی ایم تعینات تھا۔ خاتون کے بقول عمر شہزاد اس پر بری نظریں ڈالتا، نازیبا وٹس ایپ پیغامات بھیجتا اور اس سے ناجائز تعلقات قائم کرنے کا تقاضا کرتا تھا۔ عمر کہتا کہ میں نے تمہاری ملازمت میں بہت سے رعایتیں دلوائی ہیں، اب بدلے میں اگر میرے مطالبات پورے نہ کیے تو میں تمہاری نوکری، جو پہلے ہی کچی ہے، ختم کروا دوں گا۔

اسی چکر میں عمر شہزاد 14 ستمبر 2022ء کی رات خاتون کے گھر آیا، دروازہ کھٹکھٹایا، پوچھنے پر بتایا کہ تمہیں کچھ ضروری کاغذات دینے آیا ہوں۔ دروازہ کھولنے پر عمر زبردستی گھر میں داخل ہوگیا، خاتون کو ایک کمرے میں بند کرکے اس کا ریپ کرنے کی کوشش کی، مزاحمت پر خاتون کے کپڑے بھی بری طرح پھٹ گئے، اس نے فوراََ 
پولیس کو 15 پر کال کی، جس پر عمر شہزاد وہاں سے بھاگ گیا۔ 

خاتون کا کہنا تھا کہ اس واقعے سے اسکا خاوند جو پہلے ہی معذور تھا، اسکی حالت مزید بگڑ گئی، خود وہ بھی کسی کو منہ دکھانے کے قابل نہ رہی اور عمر شہزاد مزید اسے دھمکیاں دیتا رہا جس سے وہ اور اسکی فیملی شدید ذہنی دباؤ میں مبتلا ہوگئی۔

خاتون نے پولیس FIR کے علاوہ "خواتین کو ملازمت کی جگہ پر ہراسانی سے تحفظ کا قانون، 2010ء" کے تحت صوبائی خاتون محتسب پنجاب کے پاس وٹس ایپ میسجز کے سکرین شاٹس و دیگر ثبوتوں کے ساتھ مرد افسر کیخلاف شکایت بھی درج کروادی۔ محتسب نے عمر شہزاد کو طلب کر لیا۔

عمر نے جوابی موقف اپنایا کہ خاتون نے شکایت ذاتی رنجش میں درج کروائی ہے کیونکہ میں نے خاتون کے بھائی(جو خود اسی ادارے میں ملازم تھا) کی سرکاری رہائش میں جس میں یہ خود بھی رہتی رہی ہے، مشکوک قسم کے لوگوں کی آمد ورفت کی شکایات پر ختم کردی تھی۔ مزید یہ کہ خاتون کی تقرری ڈیلی ویجز پر تھی جو بعد میں ختم ہوگئی تو اس سے طیش میں آکر اس نے یہ شکایت دائر کی ہے، مزید یہ کہ معاملے پر چونکہ پہلے ہی ایف آئی آر درج ہو چکی ہے، لہذا محتسب کے ہاں اس کیخلاف کارروائی نہیں ہوسکتی۔

خاتون محتسب پنجاب نے فریقین کے ثبوتوں، خاص طور پر وٹس ایپ میسجز کا جائزہ لینے کے بعد مرد افسر عمر شہزاد کو خاتون ٹیچر کو ہراساں کرنے کا مرتکب قرار دیا اور اسے ملازمت سے برطرف کرنے کی سزا سنائی۔ افسر نے اس سزا کیخلاف گورنر پنجاب کے پاس اپیل کی جسے رواں سال مارچ میں خارج کردیا گیا۔ اس کے بعد عمر شہزاد نے ان دونوں فیصلوں کیخلاف لاہور ہائیکورٹ میں رِٹ پٹیشن دائر کی، جس کی سماعت فاضل جسٹس راحیل کامران شیخ نے کی اور فریقین کے وکلاء کو تفصیلاََ سنا۔

ہائیکورٹ میں مرد افسر کے وکیل نے ایک قانونی نکتہ یہ اٹھایا کہ مذکورہ قانون 'ملازمت کی جگہ' پر ہراسمنٹ کیلئے بنایا گیا جبکہ اس کیس میں خاتون کے ساتھ مبینہ آبرو ریزی کا واقعہ اس کے گھر میں پیش آیا ہے، وہ یقیناََ 'ملازمت کی جگہ' نہیں ہے، لہذا اس قانون کے تحت محتسب کے پاس شکایت دائر نہیں کی جاسکتی۔ عدالت نے اس دلیل کی تردید میں قانون میں دی گئی 'ملازمت کی جگہ' کی تعریف کی وضاحت کی اور قرار دیا کہ 'ملازمت کی جگہ' کی تعریف میں ہر وہ صورتحال شامل ہے جس میں ہراسمنٹ براہ راست ملازمت کے تعلق سے جڑی ہوئی ہو۔

ہائیکورٹ نے مرد افسر کی رِٹ پٹیشن خارج کردی اور ملازمت سے برطرفی کی سزا کو برقرار رکھا۔ یوں خاتون ٹیچر جسکی خود کی ملازمت پکی نہ ہوسکی لیکن اس نے قانونی جدوجہد سے اس لفنگے آفیسر کی پکی ملازمت بھی برقرار نہیں رہنے دی۔

قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 

1. بنیادی قانونی سوال (Core Legal Issues)
اس مقدمہ میں درج ذیل اہم قانونی سوالات پیدا ہوئے:

کیا خاتون محتسب کو اختیار حاصل تھا کہ وہ ایسے واقعہ کا نوٹس لے جو بظاہر ملازمت کی جگہ کے علاوہ (خاتون کے گھر) پیش آیا؟

کیا ایف آئی آر کے اندراج کے بعد محتسب کے سامنے کارروائی چل سکتی ہے؟

کیا واٹس ایپ پیغامات بطور شہادت قابلِ قبول ہیں؟

کیا ڈیلی ویجز / عارضی ملازمہ بھی 2010ء کے قانون کے تحت تحفظ کی حقدار ہے؟

کیا افسر کی ملازمت سے برطرفی متناسب (proportionate) سزا تھی؟

2. متعلقہ قانون: Harassment Act, 2010
(الف) دفعہ 2(h) — ہراسمنٹ کی تعریف
قانون کے مطابق:

“Harassment” means any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature or sexually demeaning attitudes, where submission is made a condition of employment, or where refusal results in adverse employment consequences.

اطلاق
ناجائز تعلقات کا تقاضا

ملازمت ختم کروانے کی دھمکی

نازیبا وٹس ایپ پیغامات
یہ تمام عناصر دفعہ 2(h) میں مکمل طور پر فٹ ہوتے ہیں۔

(ب) دفعہ 2(n) — “ملازمت کی جگہ” (Workplace) کی تعریف
قانون میں Workplace کو وسیع (Expansive) انداز میں بیان کیا گیا ہے، جس میں شامل ہے:

کوئی بھی جگہ جہاں ملازمت کے تعلق سے براہ راست یا بالواسطہ تعامل ہو

وہ حالات جہاں طاقت (Authority) یا عہدہ استعمال کر کے خاتون کو دباؤ میں لایا جائے

عدالت کی درست تشریح:
لاہور ہائیکورٹ نے درست قرار دیا کہ:

اگر ہراسمنٹ کی جڑ ملازمت کا تعلق ہو، تو مقام (Place) ثانوی حیثیت رکھتا ہے۔

یعنی:

گھر میں آنا

کاغذات دینے کا بہانہ

ملازمت کا حوالہ دے کر ناجائز مطالبہ
یہ سب ملازمت سے جڑی ہراسمنٹ ہے۔

3. فوجداری مقدمہ (FIR) 
اور محتسب کی کارروائی — تضاد یا نہیں؟
مرد افسر کا موقف
چونکہ ایف آئی آر درج ہوچکی ہے، اس لیے محتسب کارروائی نہیں کر سکتا۔

قانونی جواب:
یہ موقف غلط ہے۔

قانونی اصول:
فوجداری کارروائی (PPC کے تحت) اور

انتظامی / تادیبی کارروائی (Harassment Act کے تحت)

دو الگ الگ دائرہ اختیار (Jurisdictions) ہیں۔

عدالتی نظائر:
PLD 2022 Lahore 773
سول و فوجداری کارروائیاں بیک وقت چل سکتی ہیں۔

لہٰذا:

ایف آئی آر → جرم (Offence)

محتسب → سروس ڈسپلن اور خواتین کا تحفظ

4. واٹس ایپ پیغامات بطور شہادت
قانون شہادت 1984:
آرٹیکل 164: جدید آلات سے حاصل شدہ شواہد قابل قبول

الیکٹرانک ریکارڈ اب مسلمہ شہادت ہے

محتسب کا درست عمل:
اسکرین شاٹس

پیغامات کا تسلسل

سیاق و سباق (Context)

یہ سب corroborative evidence بنے۔

5. ڈیلی ویجز / عارضی ملازمہ کا تحفظ
قانونی پوزیشن:
Harassment Act, 2010 میں کہیں یہ شرط نہیں کہ:

صرف مستقل ملازمہ ہی شکایت کر سکتی ہے

اصول
جہاں اختیار (Power) اور

ملازمت کا تعلق

موجود ہو، وہاں قانون لاگو ہوگا۔

لہٰذا

عارضی تقرری

کنٹریکٹ

ڈیلی ویجز

سب اس قانون کے دائرے میں آتے ہیں۔

6. سزا: ملازمت سے برطرفی — کیا یہ قانونی تھی؟
دفعہ 4(4) Harassment Act
محتسب کو اختیار حاصل ہے کہ وہ

وارننگ

جرمانہ

ترقی روکنا

ملازمت سے برطرفی

تک کی سزا دے۔

کیس کے حقائق:
اختیارات کا ناجائز استعمال

جنسی استحصال کی کوشش

دھمکیاں

مسلسل ہراسمنٹ

نتیجہ
سزا متناسب (Proportionate) اور قانونی تھی۔

7. 
ہائیکورٹ کا دائرہ اختیار 
(Judicial Review)
اصول
ہائی کورٹ

حقائق کا ازسرنو جائزہ نہیں لیتی

صرف دیکھتی ہے:

کیا اختیار سے تجاوز ہوا؟

کیا قانون کی غلط تشریح ہوئی؟

عدالت کا فیصلہ:
محتسب اور گورنر دونوں نے

قانون کے مطابق

ثبوتوں کی بنیاد پر فیصلہ کیا

لہٰذا رِٹ ناقابلِ سماعت قرار پائی۔

8. نتیجاً مختصراً 
یہ فیصلہ درج ذیل اصولوں کو مضبوط کرتا ہے:

ملازمت کی جگہ ایک جامد تصور نہیں

خواتین کا تحفظ علامتی نہیں بلکہ عملی ہے

اختیارات کا غلط استعمال ناقابلِ برداشت ہے

فوجداری کارروائی، تادیبی کارروائی کو نہیں روکتی

عارضی ملازمہ بھی مکمل قانونی تحفظ رکھتی ہے

علامتی پیغام:
جو عورت خود مستقل نہ ہو سکی،
اس نے قانون کے ذریعے
طاقتور افسر کی مستقل کرسی بھی چھین لی۔

[12/30/25, 3:48:41 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: It is an admitted and undisputed position that the income received by the applicant in the form of mark-up or interest arises in the course of providing services to its customers and is in that sense, intrinsically service related. However, by virtue of the express exclusion contained in Rule 4 of the Punjab Sales Tax on Services (Specific Provisions) Rules, 2012, such mark-up or interest does not form part of the "gross amount charged" for the purposes of levy of tax and, therefore, stands excluded from the taxable value. Interest or mark-up represents consideration for the use of money and, notwithstanding its nexus with the provision of services, has been consciously excluded from taxation by the subordinate legislation. Any attempt to characterize such earnings as falling outside the scope of services, despite their express recognition within the statutory framework, would be contrary to the intent of the subordinate legislation and would defeat the clear exclusion expressly provided under Rule 4. Accordingly, it is held that although the services rendered by the applicant to its customers may yield income in the nature of mark-up or interest, and such income undeniably arises from the provision of services, the same is expressly excluded from the taxable value under Rule 4. Consequently, while mark-up or interest falls within the scope of services rendered by the applicant, it remains exempted from the levy of tax thereunder.

[12/30/25, 5:44:34 PM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: حساس اور غیر مصدقہ معلومات کے پھیلاؤ کے خلاف بھرپور مزاحمت

از: چیئرمین، عرباب سلطان حسین

غریب کی آواز  جیل

ریاستِ پاکستان کے موجودہ حالات میں کسی مبینہ خفیہ یا حساس سرکاری دستاویز کو بغیر تصدیق عوامی سطح پر پھیلانا ایک نہایت سنگین، غیر ذمہ دارانہ اور قابلِ تعزیر عمل ہے، جس کی سخت الفاظ میں مذمت کی جاتی ہے۔

غریب کی آواز  جیل اس طرزِ عمل کے خلاف واضح، دو ٹوک اور غیر مبہم مؤقف رکھتی ہے کہ: قانون نافذ کرنے والے اداروں، وکلاء، صحافیوں اور سرکاری عہدیداران کا فرض ہے کہ وہ قانون، ریاستی وقار اور عوامی امن کے محافظ بنیں، نہ کہ غیر مصدقہ معلومات کے ذریعے خوف و ہراس پھیلانے کا ذریعہ۔

⚖️ قانونی مؤقف

پاکستان کے قوانین اس امر میں بالکل واضح ہیں کہ:

تعزیراتِ پاکستان (PPC) دفعہ 505
ایسی اطلاعات یا بیانات کی اشاعت یا تشہیر جو:

عوام میں خوف و اضطراب پیدا کریں

امنِ عامہ کو نقصان پہنچائیں

یا ریاستی اداروں کے خلاف بداعتمادی کو فروغ دیں
ایک قابلِ سزا جرم ہے۔


PPC دفعہ 499 اور 500 (ہتکِ عزت)
کسی فرد، ادارے یا ریاستی محکمے کو بغیر عدالتی ثبوت دہشت گردی یا مجرمانہ سرگرمی سے جوڑنا سنگین قانونی خلاف ورزی ہے۔

PECA Act 2016 (دفعہ 20 و 21)
الیکٹرانک ذرائع سے جھوٹی، غیر مصدقہ یا خوف پھیلانے والی معلومات کا پھیلاؤ قابلِ گرفت اور قابلِ سزا جرم ہے۔

Official Secrets Act
کسی مبینہ سرکاری یا خفیہ دستاویز کی غیر مجاز تشہیر، چاہے وہ اصلی ہو یا جعلی، سنگین قانونی نتائج کی حامل ہے۔
📌 ادارہ جاتی ذمہ داری

یہ بات بطور خاص ان افراد کے لیے ہے جو:

وکالت کے منصب پر فائز ہیں

پولیس یا دیگر قانون نافذ کرنے والے اداروں سے وابستہ ہیں

یا خود کو ریاستی معاملات کا نمائندہ سمجھتے ہیں


انہیں یہ سمجھنا ہوگا کہ: ریاستی معاملات میں سنسنی نہیں، ذمہ داری درکار ہوتی ہے۔

دفعہ 17(9) پنجاب رینٹڈ پریمیسز ایکٹ، 2009
 — کرایہ جمع کرانے میں تاخیر، لازمی شق، دفاع کے اخراج 
(Strike Off Defence) کا دائرہ اختیار

قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 

 قانونی پس منظر
پنجاب رینٹڈ پریمیسز ایکٹ، 2009 کا بنیادی مقصد کرایہ دار اور مالک مکان کے حقوق و فرائض میں توازن قائم کرنا ہے۔ اسی مقصد کے تحت دفعہ 17 کو ایک سخت اور مؤثر مالی نظم کے طور پر متعارف کرایا گیا تاکہ:

کرایہ دار بلا جواز تاخیر نہ کرے

مالک مکان کو بروقت کرایہ ملے

عدالتی کارروائی غیر ضروری طوالت کا شکار نہ ہو

 دفعہ 17(9) کا متن اور مفہوم
دفعہ 17(9) کے مطابق

اگر کرایہ دار مقررہ تاریخ تک، یا ہر ماہ کی 5 تاریخ تک کرایہ جمع کرانے میں ناکام رہے تو اس کا دفاع لازماً خارج (Strike Off) کر دیا جائے گا۔

 سادہ قانونی مفہوم
ایک دن کی تاخیر بھی قانونی نادہندگی (Default) ہے

“Shall” کا لفظ شق کو Mandatory بناتا ہے

عدالت کے پاس صوابدید (Discretion) موجود نہیں

 عدالت کا کلیدی قانونی نکتہ
جسٹس رسال حسن سید نے واضح طور پر قرار دیا کہ:

دفعہ 17(9) لازمی نوعیت کی حامل ہے

رینٹ کنٹرولر

 وقت میں توسیع نہیں دے سکتا

 تاخیر معاف (Condone) نہیں کر سکتا

عدالت ہمدردی، حالات یا نیک نیتی کی بنیاد پر قانون سے انحراف نہیں کر سکتی

 Mandatory اور Directory
 دفعات میں فرق
عدالت نے بالواسطہ طور پر یہ اصول بھی دہرا دیا کہ:

Mandatory Provision Directory Provision
عدم تعمیل پر لازمی نتیجہ عدم تعمیل قابلِ اصلاح
عدالت کو کوئی اختیار نہیں عدالت صوابدید رکھتی ہے
“Shall” استعمال ہوتا ہے “May” استعمال ہوتا ہے
دفعہ 17(9) میں “Shall strike off” استعمال ہوا ہے، جو کسی تشریح کی گنجائش نہیں چھوڑتا۔

 کرایہ دار کے دفاع کے اخراج کے اثرات
دفاع خارج ہونے کے بعد:

کرایہ دار

گواہ پیش نہیں کر سکتا

تحریری جواب مؤثر نہیں رہتا

مقدمہ عملاً یک طرفہ (Ex Parte in effect) ہو جاتا ہے

اخراجِ دفاع بذاتِ خود اخراجِ دعویٰ نہیں بلکہ مالک مکان کے دعویٰ کو مضبوط کرتا ہے

 اعلیٰ عدالتی نظائر سے ہم آہنگی
یہ فیصلہ مکمل طور پر سابقہ عدالتی نظائر کے مطابق ہے، جن میں بارہا قرار دیا گیا کہ:

رینٹ قوانین میں مالی نظم سختی سے نافذ کیا جائے

کرایہ دار کو رعایت دینے سے قانون کا مقصد فوت ہو جاتا ہے

(مثلاً: PLD 2019 SC، 2022 LHC، 2023 LHC کے فیصلے)

عملی قانونی رہنمائی
 (For Advocates)
 مالک مکان کے وکیل کے لیے
ایک دن کی تاخیر پر فوراً Strike Off Defence کی درخواست

نیت، بیماری یا تکنیکی عذر ناقابلِ قبول

 کرایہ دار کے وکیل کے لیے
کرایہ ہر صورت 5 تاریخ سے پہلے جمع کرائیں

بعد ازاں کسی رحم یا صوابدید کی امید بے بنیاد ہے

نتیجاً مختصراً ۔۔۔۔
2025 LHC 7788 ایک leading judgment ہے جو یہ اصول قطعی طور پر طے کرتا ہے کہ:

دفعہ 17(9) میں معمولی سی بھی خلاف ورزی ناقابلِ معافی ہے، اور رینٹ کنٹرولر قانون سے ہٹ کر کوئی رعایت نہیں دے سکتا۔

یہ فیصلہ رینٹ معاملات میں سخت قانونی نظم، عدالتی اختیار کی حد، اور قانون کی بالادستی کا واضح اظہار ہے۔

JUDGMENT

       SHAHID WAHEED, J.---This petition seeks leave to appeal against the decree issued under the judgment dated 24th of May, 2022 from a Division Bench of the High Court of Sindh at Karachi. This judgment upholds a consolidated judgment dated 31st of August, 2020 and a decree dated 15th of September, 2020 rendered by a Single Bench of said High Court.

2.    To better understand the matter, we will refer to the parties involved in the petition as the "vendor" and the "vendee." This terminology will help to clarify the intricate circumstances and complexities we are evaluating, allowing for a more nuanced comprehension of the issues under review.

3.    This petition is by the vendor, who contends that the vendee had not fulfilled his contractual obligations, justifying the contract's rescinding and arguing against its specific performance.

4.    This case emerges from two distinct suits: one seeking the annulment of the contract and the other pursuing the specific performance of the said contract. The foundation of these legal actions is a contract dated 26th of March, 2013 (Exh.5/57), wherein the vendor committed to sell his property, identified as No.72/III, located at 16th Lane, Phase VII, Pakistan Defence Officers Housing Authority, Karachi, to the vendee for the total consideration of Rs.25,850,000/-. An advance part payment of Rs.2,585,000/- had been made, with the remainder of the purchase price to be settled in two separate installments. As of this point, the facts presented are admitted by both parties, and there exists a clear consensus with no contention or disagreement between them.

5.    The core of the disagreement revolves around the payment of the remainder of the purchase price. To fully comprehend the intricacies of this issue, it is imperative to scrutinize the payment schedule, the consequences of any deviations from the agreed-upon timeline, and the respective obligations that must be fulfilled by each party to finalize the sale. Thus, a thorough examination of the complete text of the contract (Exh.5/57) is essential, and we will provide the contract in its entirety for clarity and context.

       "THIS AGREEMENT TO SELL is made at Karachi, this 26 day of March, 2013.

BETWEEN

       MR. ZEESHAN PARVEZ son of MR. PARVEZ MAZHAR, Muslim, adult holding CNIC No.42301-0582900-3, Resident of 72/III, 16th Lane, Kh-e-Badar, Phase-VII DHA, Karachi, hereinafter referred to as the "VENDOR" (which expression shall wherever the context so permits mean and include his heirs, executors, successors, attorney, administrators and assigns) of the ONE PART.

       IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties above named have set and subscribed their respective hands, the day, month and the year first above written."

6.    It is evident from a perusal of the contract that the remainder of the purchase amount was divided into two distinct sums. The first sum was stated as a "further sum" and was set at Rs.3,415,000/-, while the second sum was described as a balance payment of Rs. 19,850,000/- (see Clause 2 of the contract). First, we take up the timeline related to the payment of a further sum of Rs.3,415,000/-. Be it noted here that the whole contract was typed save a few specific items: the date on which the contract was made, the date by which payment of Rs.3,415,000/- was due, and a few figures stated in Clause (1) of the contract, which were handwritten. However, the payment for Rs .3,4 15,000 / - was stipulated to be made by the 20th of March, 2013. The vendor claimed that payment of Rs.3,415,000/- had not been made by the stated deadline, arguing that this failure resulted in the extinction of his right to seek specific performance of the contract, suggesting instead that the contract ought to be cancelled. On the contrary, the vendee's plea was that the date of 20th of March, 2013 was a slip of hand, as it was impossible for the payment to be completed prior to the contract's signing date of 26th of March, 2013. He asserted that, in fact, the correct date was the 20th of May, 2013. Upon reflection, we agree that the reference to the 20th of March, 2013 for the payment of Rs.3,415,000/- was a slip-up. The pertinent question that arises is whether this payment of a further sum was strictly time-bound and if noncompliance would incur any penalties. It appears that there was an intended timeframe for the payment of Rs.3,415,000/-. What was that? It is shrouded in mystery, as neither party had presented convincing evidence to clarify this matter. So, the actual payment date of the further sum cannot be ascertained. Given the circumstances surrounding this case, determining that date is not even necessary. There are two primary reasons for this conclusion. The first is that there is no evidence indicating that the vendor made any effort to inform the vendee that the payment had not been made as scheduled. The second is that the contract does not impose any strict requirements regarding the timely payment of the sum of Rs.3,415,000/-. The only consequence of this payment was that it made the vendor responsible for fully paying off the debt or loan associated with the property in question and obtaining a clearance certificate or No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the relevant bank (see Clause 4 of the contract). This responsibility could be easily fulfilled because, long before the date intended for registration of the sale deed, the vendee, by the 20th of May, 2013, had already paid Rs.6,815,000/-, an amount that the vendor accepted without any protest or objection. This fact is supported by two receipts dated 19th of April, 2013 (Exh.6/5) and 20th of May, 2013 (Exh.5/6). The vendor has not disputed the validity or execution of these receipts. Therefore, there is no need to consider oral evidence in light of these two documents. Under these circumstances, the vendor cannot base his claim on the incorrect date specified in the contract for the payment of Rs.3,415,000/-and, as a result, is estopped from raising any concerns regarding the payment of this further sum.

7.    This leads us to consider the circumstances surrounding the balance payment of Rs. 19,850,000/-. Before delving into that analysis, it is important to highlight that the property in question was mortgaged to the Bank, serving as collateral for the loan at the time the contract was executed. In this context, a conjoint reading of Clauses 2, 3, and 5 of the contract reveals that the responsibility for the balance payment by the vendee depended on the vendor fulfilling specific obligations. These obligations included (a) securing a Clearance Certificate or No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Bank, (b) settling all outstanding dues, debts, claims, loans, mortgages, taxes, and any other liabilities associated with the property, (c) ensuring that the property's mutation was duly processed in the vendor's name, and (d) completing all necessary sale formalities, which encompassed the registration of the sale deed or granting a General Power of Attorney in favour of the vendee or his nominee. All of these conditions were expected to be fulfilled by the vendor on or before the 15th of August, 2013 deadline. Only after successfully meeting these prerequisites was the vendee obligated to pay the outstanding amount. However, evidence indicates that as late as the 9th of September, 2013, the property remained mortgaged (Exh.X/10), which severely undermined the vendor's position. Consequently, the penalty of forfeiture stipulated in Clause (4) of the contract could not legitimately be invoked, nor could the vendee be deemed at fault for any failure to meet contractual obligations. In fact, it seems clear that there was no opportunity for the vendee to proceed with the balance payment. Despite this, the vendor attempted to shift the burden of his shortcomings onto the vendee by issuing a Notice dated 2nd of September, 2013, claiming that the contract had been cancelled due to the alleged non-payment of the balance amount. Subsequently, on the 4th of September, 2013, the vendor filed a suit seeking a decree for the cancellation of the contract. This manoeuvre appears to be gamesmanship, violating the well-established legal maxim nullus commodum capere potest de injuria sua propria, which means no one should benefit from their wrongdoing. It is important to note that before the final hearing of the suit, the vendee had demonstrated his commitment by depositing a sum of Rs. 19,800,000/- with the Court, which notably exceeded the required amount by Rs.765,000/-. This detail reinforces the conclusion that the vendee had consistently been ready and willing to fulfill his contractual obligations, leading us to the equitable inference that the scales of justice lean favourably towards the vendee in this matter.

8.    The outcome of this matter is that the decree issued by the High Court in favour of the vendee is completely justified and shows no grounds for objection. Consequently, this petition lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. Leave to appeal is denied.

9.    Since the main petition (C.P.L.A. No. 812-K of 2022) has been finally decided by us today, all pending miscellaneous applications therein have become infructuous and are accordingly disposed of.

JUDGE

IRFAN SAADAT KHAN, J.---The lis before us pertains to a Sale Agreement, dated 26.03.2013, ("Agreement") for the sale of land bearing number 72/III measuring about 550 square yards, located at 16th Lane, Phase VII DHA, Karachi, along with the construction thereon, between Zeeshan Pervez, who is represented by his legal heirs, ("Petitioner/Vendor") and Muhammad Nasir ("Respondent/Vendee").

2.    The Petitioner/Vendor is aggrieved by the short Order of the High Court of Sindh at Karachi, dated 24.05.2022 ("Impugned Judgment"), whereby the High Court Appeal No. 194 of 2020, under Section 3 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972, against the consolidated judgement1, dated 31.08.2020, rendered in Suit 1114 of 2013 (filed by the Petitioner/Vendor) and Suit 1214 of 2013 (filed by the Respondent Vendee), was dismissed.

3.    The facts pertaining to the lis are that after having executed the aforementioned Agreement, the Petitioner/Vendor filed a Suit (1114 of 2013) wherein he sought the cancellation of the Agreement on the premise that the Respondent/Vendee was unable to pay the requisite amounts within the stipulated timeline. Whereas, the Respondent/ Vendee filed a separate Suit (1214 of 2013) wherein he sought specific performance of the Agreement and pled that the Petitioner/ Vendor was unlawfully reneging from the binding obligations placed upon him by virtue of the Agreement. Both the Suits were consolidated, vide Order, dated 09.10.2014, and proceeded in the usual manner: written statements filed, issues framed, pro and contra evidence recorded and thereafter, final arguments were made by the respective parties. After this process, the Single Judge, vide Order, dated 31.08.2020, decreed the consolidated Suits, in the following terms:

       "The Vendee has made out a fit case for grant of specific performance of the Agreement, whereas, the Vendor has been unable to demonstrate and/or prove any grounds to merit cancellation therefor. Therefore, Suit 1214 of 2013 is decreed, with costs, in favour of the plaintiff with directions to the defendant to forthwith execute a conveyance deed in favour of the Plaintiff with respect to the Suit Property and deliver peaceful possession thereof. The balance sale consideration, being Rs. 19,035,000, and profit accrued thereon, may be paid by the Nazir to the defendant upon execution of conveyance deed and delivery of the Suit Property to the Plaintiff. The excess amount deposited with the Nazir, being Rs. 765,000/- and profit accrued thereon, shall be returned to the plaintiff. Suit 1114 of 2013 is hereby dismissed with costs."

       As mentioned prior, the Appeal filed against the aforenoted consolidated judgment, was dismissed via a short Order, dated 24.05.2022. On 04.08.2023, the High Court, in its reasoning for the short Order2, dated 24.05.2022, stated the following:

       "In view of the hereinabove facts and circumstance of the instant case, we are of the considered view that the appellant has failed to make out a case requiring this Court to interfere with the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned Single Judge, which prima fade does not suffer from any factual error or legal infirmity. Whereas, the findings as recorded by the learned Single Judge are based on proper reading of the evidence produced by the parties in both the suits and correct interpretation of the terms of the sale agreement. Accordingly, instant High Court Appeal was dismissed vide our short order dated 24.05.2022 and above are the reasons of such short order."

4.    Mr. Abdul Qadir Khan, AOR/ASC appeared through video link, before us on behalf of the Petitioner/Vendor and contended that the impugned judgment did not appeal to a prudent mind, as the High Court had failed to interpret the Agreement properly and has ignored the two successive breaches, of the timeline stipulated in the Agreement, by the Respondent/Vendee. Elaborating upon these two breaches, learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Vendor stated that the total sale consideration to be paid in respect of the property was PKR 25,850,000/-, out of which the Respondent paid a sum of PKR 2,585,000/-, on the date of signing of the Agreement; however has failed to pay PKR 3,415,000/-, as determined in the Agreement, by the stipulated timeline of March 2013, and has also failed to pay the remainder of the total sale consideration, PKR 23,265,000/-, by the stipulated date of 15.08.2013. Learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Vendor further submitted that the High Court had failed to consider that the Respondent/Vendee's Suit for specific performance of the agreement was not maintainable as prior to the institution of the said Suit, the Petitioner/Vendor through legal notice, dated 02.09.2013, had already revoked the Agreement, and thus no cause of action existed in the Respondent/Vendee's favour, when his Suit was instituted on 27.09.2013. Learned Counsel further stated that the High Court had also failed to realise that there was no breach of Agreement on the part of the Petitioner/Vendor since the property was mortgaged, the Petitioner/Vendor had already cleared all dues on the property, had affected the release of the documents from the bank along with a no-objection-certificate ("NOC"), and also applied for redemption of the property; therefore, the Petitioner/Vendor was all set to sell the property but the Agreement was frustrated due to the non-performance and breaches on the part of the Respondent/ Vendee by failing to pay the remainder of the sale consideration. In light of these averments, learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Vendor prayed for the impugned judgment, dated 24.05.2022,3 and the judgement and decree dated 31.08.2020, passed by the learned Single Judge, be set aside.

5.    Mr. Muhammad Vawda, ASC appeared on behalf of the Respondent/Vendee and defended the impugned judgment and that passed by the learned Single Judge by submitting that the Petitioner/Vendor had failed to point out factual errors or legal infirmities in the impugned judgment or that of the learned Single Judge; and that the two judgments were based on correct appreciation of the evidence recorded by the learned Single Judge and rightly endorsed by the Division Bench of the said High Court. Learned Counsel for the Respondent Vendee contended that the Respondent/Vendee had successfully discharged the onus of proof to seek a declaration with regard to specific performance of the Agreement and the said declaration had rightly been granted to the Respondent Vendee, as the Petitioner/Vendor had failed to perform the conditional aspects of the Agreement. He further submitted that the Respondent/Vendee had not breached any term of the Agreement, a fact which had been recognised by the two fora below and therefore no case for interference by this Court was made out. The learned Counsel therefore prayed for dismissal of the instant petition, as being devoid of any merit and uncalled for.

6.    We have heard the learned Counsel for both the parties at some length and have perused the record with their assistance.

7.    The ability to contract is not merely an act of legislative grace;

it is a capability that, in practical application, is essential for an individual to live and conduct daily affairs.4 Therefore, it is essential, that the Courts of this country do not hamper the ability of this country's populace to contract as they see fit, as long as the contract is legal and in accordance with the law. Courts should only interfere with contracts, if they are illegal or if one party to a contract uses the contract to disadvantage or deprive the other party to the contract by choosing self-serving interpretations. In this backdrop, since certain terms of the Agreement, which concern the stipulated timeline of payment of consideration and are the main source of contention between the parties to this lis, it would be pertinent to reproduce them hereunder:

       "This Agreement to Sell is made at Karachi, this 26 day of March 2013...

       That the Vendor has received from the Vendee a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lac only) through Cheque No. 0041740420 dated 22/03/2013 drawn on Faysal Bank Ltd, Karachi, and now on signing of this Agreement a further sum of Rs.23,85,000/- (Rupees Twenty-Three Lac Eighty-Five Thousand only) THROUGH No. 01700373 Rs. 1,900,000/- FBL H.O 0041740422 Rs.485,000/- FBL H.O. both the sums totaling to Rs. 25,85,000/- (Rupees Twenty-Five Lac Eighty Thousand only) being the advance part-payment towards sale consideration of the said property, receipt of which the Vendor doth hereby fully admit and acknowledge separately.

       2. That a further sum of Rs. 34,15,000/- (Rupees Thirty-Four Lac Fifty Thousand only) shall be paid by the Vendee to the Vendor on or before 20 March 2013 and balance payment of Rs. 1,98,50,000/- (Rupees One Crore Ninety-Eight Lac Fifty Thousand only) shall be paid by the Vendee to the Vendor at the time of handing the vacant and peaceful physical possession of the said property and completion of sale formalities including registration of Sale Deed/General Power of Attorney in favour of the Vendee or his nominee(s) on or before 15/08/2013...

       4. That after the payment of Rs.34,15,000/- the Vendor shall be responsible to full pay off the debt/ loan against the said property and obtain the Clearance Certificate/NOC from the Bank concerned."

       A cursory glance of the terms of the Agreement, reproduced above, show that the Agreement's inception took place on 26.03.2013, and it has been acknowledged therein that a sum totalling to PKR 2,585,000/- had already been paid in advance by the Respondent Vendee to the Petitioner/Vendor, as part-payment towards the total sale consideration of PKR 25,850,000/-. As per clause 2 of the Agreement, a further sum of PKR 3,415,000/- was to be paid by the Respondent/Vendee to the Petitioner/Vendor, after which, as per clause 4, the Petitioner/Vendor would be responsible for paying off the debt owed on the property (since the property was mortgaged to Summit Bank) and obtaining a NOC from the said bank. Learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Vendor maintained before us that the PKR 3,415,000/- was payable by 30.03.2013 and since the Respondent/Vendee had not done so, it constituted the first breach. The Agreement presented before this Court, clearly shows a misprint with regards to the date on which the PKR 3,415,000/- sum towards the total sale consideration was payable, which also happens to be an admitted position before the two fora below. The Single Judge, in the judgement dated 31.08.2020, has dealt with the issue in the following manner:

       "16. The learned counsel for the Vendee argued that the date was erroneously depicted as 20.03.2013, and the same was supposed to read 20.05.2013. Although the Vendor had pleaded, in the plaint in Suit 1114 of 2013 and in the legal notice referred to supra, that the relevant date was correctly stated to be 20.03.2013, however, during final arguments the Vendor's counsel conceded that the date was in fact an inadvertent misprint, however, it was supposed to be read as 30.03.2013, and not 20.05.2013 as alleged by the Vendee. Prior to proceeding further it merits to be recorded that the factum of the relevant date being a misprint is an admitted position, therefore, all that remain to be done is to ascertain as whether the evidence supports the alternate date theorized by the Vendor or the Vendee.

       17. Per Vendee's counsel it was absurd for an agreement to require a future payment prior in time to its date of execution. It was demonstrated that the amounts in excess of that sought per clause 2 of the agreement were received by the Vendor up until May 2013 without any objection or demur, hence, the belated plea was contradicted inter alia by the conduct of the Vendor himself.

       The Vendor has specifically pleaded that the date per the Agreement, 20.03.2013, was the correct date and had predicated his claim for rescission of the Agreement thereupon. However, in a complete departure from his pleadings had deposed that the said date was 30.03.2013. The subsequent interpretation of the date was also iterated by his counsel during final arguments. No rationale was provided for not mentioning the appropriate date in the legal notice or the plaint that was filed in Suit 1114 of 2013.

       13. The Agreement is dated 26.03.2013 and records the payments that have already been made thereunder, until the date of execution, in clause 1 thereof. The Agreement specifically mentions three instruments, particularized therein, and the same is also corroborated by the certification of Faysal Bank Limited available in evidence. Clause 2 then says that 'That a further sum of … shall be paid ... on or before March (sic) 20,2013'. It is prima facie apparent that the amount in contemplation is an amount to be paid post execution of the Agreement. The evidence denotes that the Vendor accepted 2 payments from the Vendee post execution of the Agreement, vide pay order dated 11.04.2013 and 20.05.2013, demonstrably realized per the admission of the Vendor's counsel and the bank statement. There is nothing on the record to show any attempt by the Vendor to point out to the Vendee that payment/s, purportedly due by 30.03.2013. have not been received in time. On the contrary the Vendor demonstrably and admittedly received and realized the relevant payment in the third week of May 2013."

(EMPHASIS ADDED)

       The Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned judgment has agreed with the interpretation of the date, with regards to the payment of the PKR 3,415,000/-. A useful rule to remember vis-a-vis interpretation of contracts is that the words of written documents are interpreted more forcibly against the party putting forward the document.5 The rule is based on the principle that a party putting forward the wording of a proposed agreement may be assumed to have looked after its own interests, is responsible for the ambiguities in its own expression, and has no right to induce another to make a contract on the supposition that the words mean one thing, and then to argue for a construction by which they would mean another thing, more to its advantage.6 In Latin, this rule is known as contra proferentem and has been part of English law since the medieval period.7 A full version of the rule was given by Edward Coke: 'verba cartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem,' or 'the words of deeds are to be taken more strongly against the one who put them forward.'8 Having said that, we have pondered over the misprint of the date and have arrived at the irresistible conclusion that if the inception of the contract took place on 26.03.2013, then how could the payment of PKR 3,415,000/- under the contract be demanded on 20th March 2013, and that too when the Petitioner had admittedly already paid PKR 2,585,000/-, in advance? This question has remained unanswered before the lower fora.

8.    The record reveals that the Petitioner/Vendor has taken divergent stances with regards to the date of payment of PKR 3,415,000/-, as at page-45 of the paper book submitted before this Court, the said date was mentioned as 20.03.2013; at page-91 of the paper book as March 2013 with no specific date; and at page-110 of the paper book as 30.03.2013. It is also worth noting that in the cross-examination of the Petitioner/Vendor9, he has admitted that the date of 20.03.2013, "in the Agreement, was a mistake as payment cannot be made before the date of the Agreement", which statement in our view belies his own assertions made via the legal notice, dated 02.09.2013, and further depositions made in the instant matter before the Single Judge and the Division Bench.

9.    Having said that, in Modi and Co10 the Indian Supreme Court was of the view that in constructing a contract, it is legitimate to consider the surrounding circumstances for ascertaining the intention of the parties; hence, the Court observed:

       "It is true that when a contract is reduced to writing we must look only to that writing for ascertaining the terms of the agreement between the parties but it does not follow from this that it is only what is set out expressly and in so many words in the document that can constitute a term of the contract between the parties. If upon a reading of the document as a whole, it can fairly be deduced from the words actually used therein that the parties had agreed on a particular term, there is nothing in law which prevents them from setting up that term. The terms of the contract can be expressed or there can be a necessary implication of a term from what has been expressed in the contract. The question therefore resolves in the ultimate analysis upon the construction of the terms of the contract between the parties. In this connection it is well-established that in construing such a contract it is legitimate to take into account the surrounding circumstances for ascertaining the intention of the parties."

       As noted above, Courts should refrain from substituting the wisdom of the contracting parties with their own but in the instant matter we are left with no recourse but to interpret the intention of the two contracting parties by considering the surrounding circumstances. Reliance on the contra proferentem rule and the aforenoted case-law leads us to the conclusion that a reasonable person, considering the context of the contract, ought to be able to identify its meaning without any ambiguity and if the ambiguity persists, the meaning that accords best with common sense would prevail.11 Therefore, in light of the admitted misprint, we find ourselves in agreement with the interpretation of the Single Judge, reiterated in the impugned judgement, with regards to the date of payment of PKR 3,415,000/ - and have therefore arrived at the conclusion that the payment was indeed made within time and thus does not constitute as breach of the Agreement, as pressed for by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Vendor. Nevertheless, it is also pertinent to mention section 56 of the Contract Act, 1872, which reads:

       "56. Agreement to do impossible act: An agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void."

If we were to accept the interpretation of the Agreement being pressed by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Vendor, we are afraid that the Agreement would squarely fall under section 56 of the Contract Act, 1872 as the Respondent/Vendee cannot go back in time and pay a sum which was due even before the inception of the Agreement.

10.  This brings us to the learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Vendor's assertions with regards to the second breach. Learned Counsel stated that the remainder sum of the total sale consideration was to be paid on or before 15.08.2013 by the Respondent Vendee as per clause 2 of the Agreement, so that the sale envisioned in the Agreement could be concluded. With respect to the learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Vendor, we do not agree. Before the process envisioned in clause 2 of the Agreement could be completed, there is a condition which kicks in by virtue of clause 4 of the Agreement, which is:

       "after the payment of Rs.34,15,000/- the Vendor shall be responsible to full pay off the debt/ loan against the said property and obtain the Clearance Certificate / NOC from the Bank concerned."

(EMPHASIS SUPPLIED)

       After the Petitioner/Vendor had received the payment of PKR 3,415,000/- in the third week of May 2013, which has been interpreted as the stipulated timeline for the said payment herein above, it was the Petitioner/Vendor's responsibility to pay off the outstanding debt and obtain a NOC from the bank concerned. This was a necessary condition to be fulfilled by the Petitioner/Vendor to conclude the sale by 15.08.2013. Clause 2 and clause 4 of the Agreement point towards the Agreement being a conditional contract. A conditional contract is a contract the very existence and performance of which depends upon the happening of some contingency or condition expressly stated therein.12 The responsibilities of the Petitioner Vendor have been stated as expressly as possible in clause 4 and a failure to fulfil those responsibilities on part the Petitioner/Vendor points towards a breach of this conditional contract/agreement. This breach in turn gave the Respondent/Vendee an option to void the Agreement by virtue of section 55 of the Contract Act, 1872, part of, which reads:

       "55. Effect of failure to perform at fixed time, in contract in which time is essential. When a party to a contract promises to do a certain thing at or before a specified time or certain things at or before specified times, and fails to do any such thing at or before the specified time, the contract, or so much of it as has not been performed, becomes voidable, at the option of the promisee, if the intention of the parties was that time should be of the essence of the contract."

       Whether time is the essence of a contract always depends upon the wordings of an agreement, intention of the parties, and above all is a question of fact. This Court in Jaiwanti Bai13 has observed that generally in a sale of immoveable property, time is not the essence of the contract, unless it is made so. Moreover, in Muhammad Iqbal14 this Court held that:

       "In relation to contracts of immovable property the rule is that time ordinarily is not the essence, however, this by no means is an absolute rule and it is always open to the party, who claims exception thereto, to establish otherwise from the contents/text, letter and spirit of the agreement and/or from the intent and conduct of the parties, as well as the attending circumstances."

       There has been a repeated reliance before us and the fora below and in the pleadings of the Petitioner at all fora that the stipulated timeline was the essence of the contract and thus when the promisor (Petitioner/Vendor in this case) had by virtue of clause 4 agreed to pay off the outstanding debt and obtain a NOC from the bank concerned after he had received the payment of PKR 3,415,000/- and then had failed to do so, then the Agreement became voidable at the option of the promise (Respondent/Vendee). Therefore, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Vendor's assertions with regard to the second breach and that the suit for specific performance of the agreement was not maintainable as prior to the institution of the said suit, the Petitioner/Vendor through legal notice, dated 02.09.2013, had already revoked the Agreement, and thus no cause of action existed in the Respondent/Vendee's favour when his Suit was instituted on 27.09.2013, are meritless.

11.  If we were to treat the Agreement between the parties as one where time was not the essence of the contract because, as noted above, it is well settled law that in transactions of immoveable property time is not the essence of the contract15, even then the claim of the Petitioner/Vendor would fail as the second part of section 55 of the Contract Act, 1872, reproduced below, would come into play:

       "55. Effect of such failure when time is not essential. If it was not the intention of the parties that time should be of the essence of the contract, the contract does not become voidable by the failure to do such thing at or before the specified time; but the promisee is entitled to compensation from the promisor for any loss occasioned to him by such failure."

       By virtue of this limb of section 55 of the Contract Act, 1872, it is quite clear that in agreements where time is not of the essence, the contract does not become voidable by the failure to do such thing at or before the specified time; and the only remedy available is to the promisee (the Respondent/Vendee in this case), which is that they are entitled to compensation from the promisor (the Petitioner/Vendor in this case).

12.  There is another aspect of the Respondent/Vendee's suit for specific performance. Recently, this Court, in Masood Ahmad Bhatti16 whilst reiterating settled law, opined:

"Even otherwise, it is now well settled that where the vendor refuses to accept the sale consideration amount, the vendee seeking a specific performance of the agreement to sell is essentially required to deposit the amount in the Court. The vendee has to demonstrate that he has been at all relevant times ready and willing to pay the amount and to show the availability of the amount with him. A vendee cannot seek enforcement of reciprocal obligation of the vendor unless he is able to demonstrate that not only his willingness but also his capability to fulfil his obligations under the contract."

       A bare perusal of the judgement of the Single Judge shows that the Respondent/Vendee not only submitted the remainder of the sale consideration owed to the Petitioner/Vendor before the Court but deposited an amount well-above the remainder of the sale consideration owed, which was then directed by the Single Judge to be returned to the Respondent/Vendee. The record also reveals that when the Petitioner/Vendor fell short of funds to pay the liability he owed to the bank, he approached the Respondent/Vendee for payment of PKR 730,000/-, which was so done by the Respondent/Vendee on 11.04.2013 to the Petitioner/Vendor's bank, namely Summit Bank, to enable him to obtain NOC from the said bank, which even was acknowledged by the Petitioner/Vendor vide receipt dated 19.04.2013.17 This conduct of the Respondent/Vendee shows that he had indeed been ready at all relevant times to conclude the Agreement and acquire the property but has been hindered by the conduct of the Petitioner/Vendor, who has repeatedly tried to establish breaches on part of the Respondent/Vendee and then tried to use the Courts to get a rubber stamp of approval on self-serving interpretations of the Agreement. This Court in Rao Abdul Rehman (Deceased)18 has observed:

       "The person seeking specific performance has to establish that he is enthusiastic and vehement to act upon his obligations as per the contract but the opponent is refusing or delaying its execution."

Therefore, we have no hesitation in concluding that the Respondent Vendee has not only exhibited that he was enthusiastic about concluding the Agreement but has also acted vehemently in trying to fulfil his obligations.

13.  Be that as it may, it is pertinent to state here that as a general rule, either party to a contract for the sale of land is entitled to sue for specific performance of agreement.19 This is because the Vendor is parting with a piece of land, which is unique and cannot readily be replaced in the market, and the Vendee is entitled to a reciprocal remedy, because he/she acquires an immediate equitable interest in the land by virtue of the contract/agreement.20

14.  The upshot of the aforementioned discussion is that there was no breach on part of the Respondent/Vendee rather it was on the part of the Petitioner/Vendor, therefore the recourse to a Suit for Specific Performance was the appropriate remedy for the Respondent Vendee. With that being said, the Single Judge through judgment, dated 31.08.2020, arrived at the correct conclusion, and the Division Bench vide impugned judgment, dated 24.05.2022 (detailed judgment of which was given on 04.08.2023), rightfully declined to interfere; therefore, Leave to Appeal is refused and this Petition is dismissed, with no order as to costs. Accordingly, C.M.A. 572-K of 2022 is also disposed of.

MH/Z-8/SC                                                                                         Petition dismissed.

ORDER

       SHAHID WAHEED, J.---These two direct appeals come before us from the decree issued under the judgment dated 4th of July, 2023, by the Mingora Bench (Dar-Ul-Qaza), Sawat of the Peshawar High Court. This judgment was made in exercising the jurisdiction granted under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

2.    The parties involved in these appeals will be referred to in this judgment by the title they had in the suit.

3.    The suit giving rise to these two appeals was for possession of immovable property and recovery of mesne profit. The suit was dismissed by the Trial Court by its decree dated 11th of June, 2011, holding that the plaintiffs had failed to prove their title over the property. The plaintiffs appealed, and on the case coming before the Additional District Judge, Swat, he arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiffs had proved their ownership of the property by tendering a gift deed, and the evidence brought on record demonstrated that the defendants had no legal claim to the property, and as such, granted a decree to the plaintiffs as prayed for. Accordingly, on 1st of February, 2012 a decree was drawn. The defendants then sought revision of the appellate decree. The High Court, by its judgment dated 12th of June, 2023, partially revised the decree by which the decree to the extent of recovery of possession was maintained, and the decree to the extent of mesne profit was set aside. Now, the defendants have brought their appeal (C.A. No. 493 of 2023) to challenge the decree for possession, while the plaintiffs have also preferred their appeal (C.A. No.494 of 2023) before us to assail the refusal to grant a decree to recover mesne profit. The point arising for decision is common to both appeals; consequently, they will be disposed of by this single judgment.

4.    The arguments presented to us suggest that the fate of these appeals hinges on the decision of the question of whether, on the state of facts, the plaintiffs who brought a suit for possession of immovable property by ejectment of the defendants, based on their own title, but failed to prove that title, would nevertheless be entitled to a decree for possession of the property as the Court found that the defendants were in possession without any valid title.

5.    The facts of the case are to be considered with reference to the pleadings of the parties, and we shall, therefore, begin with those pleadings because without fully appreciating them, it is scarcely possible to appreciate the point of law stated above to which the circumstances of this case have given birth. The property in suit is two shops situated in the revenue estate of Saidu Sharif, Tehsil Babuzai, District Swat. Upon the two shops thus in suit, it was claimed that these were originally owned and occupied by Badshah Sahib, the former ruler of the State of Swat. Following the integration of Swat into Pakistan, in 1972, the Government of Pakistan established a Land Inquiry Commission tasked with identifying and determining properties belonging to Badshah Sahib. This Commission conducted a thorough investigation across various villages in Swat and issued a notification detailing the properties associated with Badshah Sahib, including the two disputed shops. Upon Badshah Sahib's passing, his estate was inherited by his two sons, Miangul Jahanzeb and Miangul Sultan. The two brothers amicably divided their father's assets, with Miangul Jahanzeb acquiring both of the shops in question. Miangul Jahanzeb then gifted these shops to Miangul Aurangzeb, who subsequently gifted them to the plaintiffs. This transfer of ownership established the plaintiffs as the rightful owners of the shops. However, the plaint asserted that the defendants initially took possession of the shops as licensees, with the plaintiffs' consent. When the plaintiffs approached the defendants to reclaim possession of the shops, citing their personal needs, they refused. This refusal led to a dispute over the possession of the shops. Upon these assertions, a two-fold relief was sought: first, a decree for possession of the shops by ejectment of the defendants be granted, and second, a decree for recovery of mesne profit at Rs. 10,000 per month.

6.    It is now essential to delineate the defences raised against the claims put forth. The defendants asserted that on the 12th of November, 1973, Miangul Jahanzeb, the son of Badshah Sahib, entered into a formal, written agreement in which he sold the shops to their father, Rehmani Gul. Following this transaction, he duly delivered possession of the shops to him. On the death of Rehmani Gul, the ownership of the shops was devolved upon the defendants. Therefore, they contended that the alleged gift claimed by the plaintiffs was nothing more than a sham - without any legal validity or merit.

7.    On the pleadings, as already stated by us, it is clear that the suit was brought under Section 8 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, and, as such, it rested upon the plaintiffs who sued to oust the defendants to prove their title for seeking such ouster1. It laid upon them to establish the reason why the defendants should be ousted and why the mesne profit claimed should be awarded. The plaintiffs desired to disturb the state of things as it existed on the 28th of November, 2005, when this suit was instituted, and of the defendants that it should remain undisturbed. The suit must be defeated unless the plaintiffs show such a cause, which would require a Court at the date of the suit to disturb the state of things as they were on that date. We have spoken too abstractly in enunciation of this doctrine of jurisprudence because it will be easier for us to explain the application of that doctrine to the circumstances of this case by referring to concrete facts as they have been found in the case itself.

8.    To begin addressing the matter before us, it is crucial first to investigate whether the plaintiffs had a title to the shops of which they claimed possession and recovering mesne profit which they sought in the plaint. A thorough title investigation will provide the essential groundwork for any subsequent legal deliberations. This process will not only clarify the legitimacy of their ownership but also shape the direction of the case moving forward. The question then is, what is their title? The title they asserted is a gift. This led the Trial Court to frame the issue on it; to be precise, it was issue No.8, burdening the plaintiffs to prove it by adducing evidence. The plaintiffs called upon two witnesses to testify to discharge their burden of proof. Through their testimonies, they presented a total of five documents as evidence to support their case. Nisar Ahmad was the plaintiffs' attorney and appeared before the Trial Court as P.W.2. In his examination-in-chief, he deposed that Badshah Sahib originally owned the shops in the suit. After the death of Badshah Sahib, all his assets, including two shops, were devolved on his two sons, Miangul Sultan and Miangul Jahanzeb. The two brothers amicably divided the assets, and as a result, shops came in the share of Miangul Jahanzeb. He then gifted the shops to Miangul Aurangzeb, who subsequently gifted them to the plaintiffs. This deposition was in line with the contents of the plaint. This witness, in his statement, tendered four documents. The first was his power of attorney deed (Ex.P.W.2/ 1). The second was the copy of the Notification No.10/ 16-SOTA-II/HD/72-1525 dated 28th of September, 1972 (Ex.PW.2/2). This document established the details of Badshah Sahib's assets. The third document was the list, dated 8th of June, 1984, showing the details of the houses belonging to Miangul Aurangzeb (Ex.P.W.2/R-1). The fourth document was the list, dated 1st of September, 1982, of shops allegedly owned by Miangul Aurangzeb (Ex.P.W.2/R-2). The last two documents were written on plain paper, and no witness was produced to prove them. It is essential to mention here that the gift deed by which allegedly Miangul Jahanzeb transferred the shops to Miangul Aurangzeb was not tendered in evidence. The omission to produce this vital link in the transaction was fatal. Needless to say, in the absence of this document, the ownership of Miangul Aurangzeb over the properties mentioned in Ex.P.W.2/R-1 and Ex.PW.2/R-2 could not be held to be proved. Given the circumstances, when ownership of Miangul Aurangzeb over the shops was not proved, further gift transactions with the plaintiffs also failed.

9.    There is yet another aspect of the matter, and an appraisal of it will help determine the plaintiffs' ownership claim. The second witness produced by the plaintiffs was Muhammad Nazir, P.W.1. He was a Senior Clerk in the office of the Sub-Registrar, Babuzai. He tendered gift deed No. 151 dated 6th of May, 2000, (Ex.P.W.1/1) executed in favour of the plaintiffs. However, during his cross-examination, this witness admitted that the disputed shops were not explicitly mentioned in the gift deed (Ex.P.W.1/1). The plaintiffs' attorney, P.W.2, also admitted in his cross-examination that disputed shops were not mentioned in the gift deed (Ex. P.W.1/1). So, the broad effect of the evidence is that the plaintiffs had no title, that those under whom they claimed had no title, and that the very gift of disputed shops never existed. In light of the above-stated circumstances that surround this case, it is clear that the plaintiffs failed to establish their ownership or title to the property in question. As a result, the plaintiffs could not call upon the defendants to establish the legitimacy of their property title, nor could they seek a decree for possession based on claims that the defendants either lacked a title or possessed a flawed one. Its underlying rationale is quite straightforward: the plaintiffs must succeed based solely on the strength and validity of their own title rather than capitalising on any potential shortcomings of the defendants' situation. Along the line of this legal doctrine, the court was also precluded from examining the validity of the defendants' title, particularly since the plaintiffs did not formally challenge it. We are therefore poised to affirm that the trial court's method of addressing the issue at hand, along with its findings that were unfavourable to the plaintiffs, was indeed correct. In stark contrast, both the first Appellate Court and the Revision Court veered off course, misinterpreting the plaintiffs' claims and erroneously overturning the Trial Court's decree due to flawed application of the law.

10.  There is another essential aspect to consider regarding the frame and competency of the suit. The defendants asserted that their father purchased the shops from Miangul Jahanzeb through registered agreement No.76, dated 12th of November, 1973, (Ex.D.W.1/1). They provided evidence of this document by presenting its marginal witness, Bakhat Jahan (D.W.2), and retrieving the record from the Tehsil Office via Rehmat Ali, Junior Clerk (D.W.3). This sale occurred before the alleged transaction in which Miangul Jahanzeb gifted the shops to the plaintiffs' transferor. The sale agreement (Ex.D.W.1 / 1) created uncertainty regarding not only Miangul Aurangzeb's title but also that of the plaintiffs. The general principle governing situations where a mere suit for possession will lie is well established. In brief, if the plaintiff is in possession but his title to the property is disputed or clouded, or if the defendant claims title and poses a threat of dispossession, the plaintiff must sue for a declaration of title and seek injunctive relief. Likewise, if the plaintiff's title is clouded or disputed, and he is not in possession or not able to establish possession, he must file suit for a declaration, possession, and injunction. In this case, the plaintiffs sued for possession based on their title. However, an intervening sale regarding the property in question cast doubt on their title; therefore, they should have sought a declaration of their rights before claiming relief for possession. Their simple suit for possession was not maintainable.2 Despite the defendants' assertions in their written statement, the plaintiffs did not take any step to seek a declaration of title. This oversight went unaddressed by the High Court, so its judgment cannot be affirmed.

11.  A thorough review of the case records shows that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate the necessary diligence in pursuing their suit. They failed to call any witnesses to substantiate the alleged gift transaction, which significantly weakened their position. The solitary statement provided by their attorney was insufficient to support their claims, particularly since it did not effectively demonstrate that the defendants, as licensees, had possession of the shops in question. Furthermore, the rationale behind their demand for mesne profits of Rs.10,000 per month was not adequately established, and there was a lack of tangible evidence to justify this figure. Additionally, the plaintiffs did not provide a credible basis for seeking the eviction of the defendants from the shops. Consequently, the suit brought by the plaintiffs was liable to be dismissed in its entirety.

12.  We accordingly accept the defendants' appeal, C.A. No.493 of 2023. Consequently, we dismiss the plaintiffs' appeal, C.A. No.494 of 2023. In doing so, we set aside the decrees issued by both the High Court and the first Appellate Court, and we restore the Trial Court's decree that dismissed the plaintiffs' suit in toto. We will not impose any costs related to this matter.

MH/K-12/SC                                                                                      Order accordingly.

ORDER

       SHAHID WAHEED, J.---This case presented a simple question for the grant of leave to appeal against the judgment, dated 14th of December, 2018, of the Peshawar High Court. That question was: Could the plaint of the petitioners' declaratory suit, given the facts, be rejected on the ground of limitation? While hearing arguments on this question, we noticed some misunderstanding on the part of the High Court concerning its jurisdiction. So, the second question that attracted our attention was whether, in a case where an order of rejection of plaint in terms of Order VII, Rule 11, of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (C.P.C.) was passed by a Court exercising revisional jurisdiction, a first appeal would be available to the aggrieved party?

2.    We take up the first question first. To answer this question, it is essential to state a few facts about the case and a little detail on how it progressed in the court's hierarchy. The petitioners before us are the unsuccessful plaintiffs. On 19th of July, 2006, they had brought a suit seeking a declaration that mutations Nos.2357 and 2357, both sanctioned on 15th of March, 1975, were illegal and ineffective upon their rights. The respondents traversed the allegations levelled in the plaint by submitting their joint written statement. The respondents also filed a separate application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C., seeking rejection of the plaint on two-fold legal objections. The first was that the contents of the plaint did not disclose the cause of action, and the second was that the suit was out of time. The petitioners contested this application. On coming the matter for consideration, the Civil Judge concluded that the objections raised could not be resolved summarily, as they necessitated an inquiry by recording evidence. He, therefore, dismissed the application with his order dated 28th of May, 2008. The respondents then applied for the revision of the order dated 28th of May, 2008. The Additional District Judge noticed substance in the objections and, revising the order of the Civil Judge, rejected the plaint by his order dated 17th of December, 2008. The petitioners then went to the Peshawar High Court. In the later part of this judgment, we will mention in detail which jurisdiction of the Peshawar High Court they went to and to which they should have gone. However, it is important to note that the next forum to evaluate the orders issued by the two courts on the objections raised by the respondents was the High Court. The findings returned by the Additional District Judge were found by the High Court to be valid enough to reject the plaint. The petitioners, therefore, could not succeed in the High Court.

3.    The petitioners now seek leave to appeal against the judgment of the High Court by canvassing the first question. It is well recognised that per Article 120 of the Limitation Act, 1908, the limitation period of six years for a suit for declaration begins to run when the right to sue accrues. The objection to the suit was that since it had not been instituted within six years, its plaint must be rejected at the outset. Before proceeding further, we take a pause to say that rejecting the plaint under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. is a drastic power conferred on the Court to terminate a civil action at the threshold. Therefore, the conditions precedent to exercising power under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. are stringent. This Court has consistently held that the averments in the plaint must be read as a whole to determine whether it discloses a cause of action or whether the suit is barred under any law. This includes a bar created due to the lapse of the limitation period. At the stage of exercise of power under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C., if the averments in the plaint ex-facie do not disclose a cause of action or on a reading thereof, the suit appears to be barred under any law; the plaint can be rejected. In all other situations, the claims will have to be adjudicated in the course of the trial. Based on the principle stated above, when, in the present case, we read the plaint as a whole and proceed on the basis that the averments made therein are correct, it comes up that the said pleadings ex facie discloses that the suit is barred by limitation. The petitioners were aggrieved by the entries recorded in two mutations: mutation No.2357 and mutation No. 2358. These two mutations were sanctioned on the 15th of March, 1975. Here, two material dates were to be examined to determine the limitation period during which the petitioners could seek relief from the Court against the alleged illegal revenue entries. The first was when the right to sue accrued to the petitioners. The second was when the suit was instituted. As regards the first, it is well recognised that there can be no "right to sue" until there is an accrual of the right asserted in the suit and its infringement or threat to infringe that right. It implies that the date of accrual of the cause of action, and not the cause of action itself, would be terminus a quo for computing limitation time under Article 120 of the Limitation Act, 1908. This depended mainly upon the material facts on which the petitioners' pleadings relied for their claim. In the case at hand, the petitioners, in their plaint, had explicitly stated that before the year 2000, they had approached the respondents to rectify the wrong. Upon their refusal, the jirga was convened, and subsequently, the remedy was also pursued under the laws governing the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. All these material facts pleaded by the petitioners indicated two things: first, they knew about the disputed mutations before the year 2000, and second, upon the refusal of the respondents to recognise their rights, the cause of action had also accrued much before the year 2000. Still, on the contrary, they took more than six years to bring their suit before the Civil Court on the 19th of July, 2006. Given the circumstances, the suit of the petitioners could not be held to be instituted within time. Thus, the District Court rightly rejected its plaint under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C., and the High Court correctly upheld the rejection.

4.    The second question that caught our attention was not raised by the petitioners. As such, it could not serve as a basis for granting leave to appeal. This particular question emerged from a misunderstanding on the part of the High Court, and we think it necessary to clarify it for future reference.

5.    A thorough examination of the records indicates that the Additional District Judge (District Court) had rejected the plaint of the petitioners' suit, acting within his revisional jurisdiction as provided for in Section 115, C.P.C. Subsequently, the petitioners sought to contest that order by filing an application with the High Court under the same section. However, this application effectively represented a second revision, which was not permissible due to the prohibition stipulated in subsection (3) of Section 115, C.P.C. Recognising this significant legal obstacle, the petitioners chose to withdraw their second revision application. The order pertaining to this second revision application is particularly noteworthy, and we have included it below for clarity and context:

       "States that in view of the bar contained in section 115(3) of the C.P.C., second revision is barred and that he be allowed to withdraw this revision petition with the permission to file Writ Petition.

       Dismissed as withdrawn. The petitioner may, if so advised, file a fresh Writ Petition."

In light of the guidance outlined in the above order, the petitioners initiated legal proceedings by submitting an application under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (i.e. W.P. No. 1146 of 2009). This application was scheduled for a hearing before a Division Bench of the High Court on the 26th of October, 2009. During the proceedings, the Division Bench came to hold that the order rejecting the plaint should be regarded as a decree as defined in section 2(2), C.P.C. Upon being informed of this legal position, the counsel representing the petitioners sought permission to withdraw W.P. No. 1146 of 2009 in order to pursue the alternative remedy of appeal. The High Court granted this request with the following order:

       "After hearing the learned counsel at some length, when it was pointed out to him that since through the revisional order of the Additional District Judge, the plaint has been rejected, though the suit has been dismissed but it was for all practical purposes rejection of the plaint and not dismissal, therefore, it was an appealable order as a decree under section 2(2), C.P.C. On this learned counsel requested for withdrawal of this writ petition with a request that certified copies of the documents attached with this writ petition should be returned to him for enabling him to file an appeal in accordance with law. Office is accordingly directed to return the certified copies after retaining photo copies of the documents attached with the writ petition, who may, if so advised, file appropriate proceedings in accordance with law."

After W.P. No. 1146 of 2009 was returned, the petitioners preferred a First Appeal against Order (FAO). It is important to note that Section 104 and Order XLIII, C.P.C., specify the types of orders that can be appealed. The High Court entertained this appeal for consideration, which resulted in a judgment that led to the filing of this petition.

6.    The legal recourse taken by the petitioners in the High Court indicates a lack of clarity regarding the appropriate remedy for an aggrieved person when a Court exercising revisional jurisdiction issues an order to reject a plaint in accordance with Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. We are therefore obliged to clarify the confusion surrounding the remedies available against such orders. The petitioners had approached three distinct jurisdictions of the High Court to seek an order that would annul the judgment made by the Additional District Judge (District Court). We will analyse each of these jurisdictions to determine which one is permissible.

7.    We will first examine the scope of jurisdiction established under Section 115, C.P.C. This jurisdiction is referred to as revisional jurisdiction and is conferred upon both the District Court and the High Court. Two fundamental principles regarding this matter are well founded. The first principle states that if an application has been filed under subsection (1) of Section 115, C.P.C., no further application of this nature may be made. The second principle indicates that the High Court will not entertain any proceedings in revision against a revisional order made by the District Court. The essence of these two principles is that a second revision under Section 115, C.P.C. is not permissible. Given this legal framework, it follows that a second revision of an order rejecting a plaint under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C., by the District Court cannot be pursued by invoking Section 115, C.P.C. before the High Court.

8.    We will now delve into the intriguing realm of the second jurisdiction of the High Court, commonly known as the first appeal. Within this category, we can identify two distinct types of first appeals: one involving an appeal against an order and the other concerning an appeal against a decree. It is important to understand that certain orders hold special significance under the law. For instance, an order that rejects a plaint under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. is classified as a decree, as outlined in Section 2(2), C.P.C. This classification is vital because it informs the avenues available for challenging such orders. When it comes to appealing decrees, Section 96, C.P.C. permits appeals against all decrees without exception. In contrast, the path for appealing orders is more restrictive; appeals can only be made against those orders expressly enumerated in Section 104 or Order XLIII, C.P.C. A noteworthy point to consider is that an order made under Rule 11 of Order VII, C.P.C. is conspicuously absent from this list of appealable orders. Consequently, it remains impermissible to challenge such an order through an appeal. This brings us to a question: if a Court exercising its revisional jurisdiction issues an order to reject a plaint, would a first appeal under Section 96, C.P.C. still be an available option? A thorough examination of Section 96, C.P.C. indicates that any decree issued by a Court exercising original jurisdiction is appealable. According to Section 2(2), C.P.C., an order that rejects a plaint qualifies as a decree; nevertheless, such an order can only be appealed when issued by a Court exercising its original jurisdiction. While, a revisional court discharging jurisdiction under Section 115, C.P.C. does not operate under original jurisdiction. Therefore, although a revisional court's order rejecting a plaint is classified as a decree, it cannot be appealed under Section 96, C.P.C1.

9.    The preceding analysis clearly demonstrates that when a District Court issues a decree while exercising its revisional jurisdiction, the remedy options are significantly limited under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Expressly, a second revision is not permitted, and parties cannot file a first appeal because the District Court's order arises from its jurisdiction in a revisional capacity. Furthermore, it is important to note that a second appeal against such a decree is also not permissible; this type of appeal can only be made concerning decrees issued by Courts operating in their appellate jurisdiction. However, in instances where parties feel aggrieved by revisional orders, they may pursue a writ application under Article 199 of the Constitution. It is crucial to understand that this writ application must go beyond merely alleging illegality. It must establish that the underlying merits of the case have been adversely impacted and that a party's legal rights have been compromised as a result. This requirement emphasises the need for a meaningful connection between the alleged procedural irregularities and the substantive rights of the parties involved2.

10.  The analysis presented above allows us to conclude that in the present case the petitioners' writ application was a suitable and legitimate avenue to contest the revisional order issued by the Additional District Judge. It was inappropriate for their application to be returned to them under the pretext of seeking an appeal. This irregularity arose from a mix of confusion and misunderstanding within the Court process, yet it did not have an adverse impact on the substance of the petitioners' case. Given these circumstances, we have decided to overlook this procedural misstep.

11.  The outcome of this petition is that it has not succeeded and is therefore dismissed. Leave to appeal is refused.

(a) Specific Relief Act (I of 1877)---

----Ss. 9, 39, 42 & 54---Suit for declaration, cancellation of documents and possession along with perpetual injunction---Dispute between members of a family over distribution of assets---Family settlement---Purpose and significance of a family settlement and principles governing such settlements stated.

       Members of a family descending from a common ancestor or a near relation can make an agreement to settle their dispute and divide their property either orally or in writing to foster peace within the family. A family settlement involves members of the same family striving to resolve their differences and disputes to achieve lasting resolution. Through these arrangements, family members aim to bring about harmony and goodwill, settling conflicting claims or disputed titles to promote peace within the family. Courts recognise the special significance of family arrangements and uphold them when made in good faith. This principle has been developed by courts over a long period of time to discourage litigation driven by greed, particularly in cases involving the distribution of family estates.

       The principles governing family settlement or arrangements that may be deduced from case law and the law books may be outlined in the following form:

(i)    The family settlement has to be genuine, bona fide and must aim to resolve family disputes and conflicting claims by ensuring a fair and equitable distribution or allocation of properties among all family members.

(ii)   When an agreement is entered into to preserve the honour of a family and is reasonable, the Court will seize any justifiable reason to enforce the agreement and promote peace within the family.

(iii)   The settlement must be made willingly and should not be influenced by fraud, social or familial pressure, and undue influence.

(iv)  Like an oral contract, family settlements may well also be oral and if it is, no registration of the settlement is necessary.

(v)   It is well established that registration of a family settlement is required only if the terms of the settlement are put into writing. However, it is important to distinguish between a document that includes the terms and details of a family settlement and a simple memorandum created after the arrangement has been made, intended either for record purposes or for informing the Court to effect necessary mutation. In such cases, the memorandum does not create or extinguish any rights in immovable property and, therefore, does not fall under the requirements of the Registration Act, 1908 making it not subject to compulsory registration.

(vi)  In cases where the parties are not inclined to divide property permanently, they cannot be forced to do so. The decision to distribute the property is based on their own preferences, and it is considered a personal and family matter. In such situations, there is no requirement for registering such an agreement.

(vii)  The members involved in the family settlement must have a pre-existing title, claim, or interest, even a potential claim, in the property that is recognised by all parties to the settlement. If one party lacks a title but, under the arrangement, another party relinquishes all claims or titles in favour of that person and acknowledges them as the sole owner, a preexisting title will be assumed. Consequently, the family arrangement will be upheld, and the Courts will readily endorse it.

(viii) A genuine and bona fide family settlement can resolve disputes, whether current or potential, even if they do not involve legal claims. As long as the arrangement is fair and equitable, it is final and binding on all parties involved.

(ix)  Courts tend to favour maintaining the family arrangement rather than disturbing it on technical or trivial grounds. Where the Courts find that the family arrangement suffers from a legal deficiency or a formal defect, the principle of estoppel is invoked and applied to turn down the plea of the person who, being a party to family arrangement, seeks to set aside a settled dispute, and claims to revoke the family arrangement under which he himself has received some material benefits.

(x)   Family settlements are not governed by principles that apply to dealings between strangers. When deciding the rights of party under the family settlement or claims to upset such settlement, the Court considers what, in the broadest view of the matter, is most for the interests of a family. Matters that would be fatal to the validity of a similar transaction between strangers are not objections to the binding effect of a family settlement or arrangement. [pp. 1998, 2000] B & D

JUDGMENT

       SHAHID WAHEED, J.---The appellants in this direct appeal
are the legal heirs of one of the defendants, namely defendant No. 2 who, though succeeded up to the first Appellate Court but, could not secure approval of a decree issued in their favour from the Revision Court. This case, therefore, necessitates a comprehensive review of both the facts and the law. This is essential not only due to the disparity in reasoning between the Revision Court and the first Appellate Court but also because it sheds light on the concerning aspects of our society.

2.    It is a well-established fact that family serves as the fundamental building block of our society, and despite advancements in various aspects of our lives, many business entrepreneurs still continue to uphold the tradition of living in a joint family setting, where the ownership of assets is often unclear. This social structure plays a pivotal role in their accomplishments. However, it is disheartening that such joint families frequently encounter internal conflicts and disagreements, ultimately leading to their disintegration. These disputes often culminate in legal battles, leaving a lingering bitterness among the family members involved. The case at hand is a poignant example of such a situation, where one brother thinks that the family is like a sponge in his hands, to be squeezed for his own benefit. With this lead-in note, we now move on to the details of the dispute, which calls for our decision.

3.    This direct appeal involves a dispute among brothers. Nazir Ahmad, the plaintiff, had three brothers: Muhammad Sharif, Bashir Ahmad (Defendant No.2), and Abdul Rashid (Defendant No.3). Abdul Rashid's daughter, Bilqees Akhtar, was arrayed as defendant No.1 in the suit. It is important to note that Muhammad Sharif was not included in the suit. The brothers jointly and severally owned properties which included: (i) commercial land measuring 46 marlas, situated at Pasrur Road, Daska (Madina Industries), (ii) two commercial plots, 10 marlas each, situated at College Road, near Tank Water Supply No.2, Daska, (iii) two shops comprising land measuring 15 marlas, situated at College Road, Daska, (iv) one plot measuring 1 kanal, situated at College Road, Daska, (v) agricultural land measuring 53 kanals and 17 marlas, situated at Jamke Cheema, Daska, (vi) one plot measuring 12 marlas, situated at Jinnah Road, Gujranwala, and (vi) a house measuring 11½ marlas at Zahid Colony, Gujranwala. A feud giving rise to this appeal relates
to agricultural land measuring 53 kanals, 17 marlas at Jamke Cheema, Daska. This land was in the name of Nazir Ahmad, the plaintiff, who, in respect of it, constituted his brother Abdul Rashid (Defendant No.3) as his general attorney by a registered power of attorney, dated 15th of August, 2002 (Ex.D.9). Based on that authority, Abdul Rashid, firstly, sold 2 kanals land jointly to Bilqees Akhtar (Defendant No.1)
and Bashir Ahmad (Defendant No.2) by mutation No.4766 dated 13th
of November, 2002 (Ex.P.4), and then on 29th of April, 2003, sold the remaining 51 kanals, 17 marlas jointly to his daughter Bilqees Akhtar and brother Bashir Ahmad by a registered sale deed (Ex.P.3).

4.    On 10th of May 2003, Nazir Ahmad, the plaintiff, instituted a suit for declaration, cancellation of documents, and possession along with perpetual injunction, contending therein that he was the owner of 53 kanals, 17 marlas land, situated in village Jamke Cheema, Daska, and that he constituted Abdul Rashid (Defendant No.3), his brother as his general attorney to look after his affairs as well as the land held by him, employing a registered power of attorney (Ex.D.9). However, he revoked the same by a deed registered on the 5th of May, 2003 (Ex.P1). He alleged that his general attorney misused his authority and abused his trust by executing a sale deed dated 29th of April, 2003 (Ex.P.3) in favour of Bashir Ahmad (Defendant No.2, now in this appeal, his legal heirs are representing him as the appellants) and Bilqees Akhtar (Defendant No. 1) regarding land measuring 51 kanals, 17 marlas. Likewise, a mutation No.4766 dated 13th of November, 2002 (Ex.P.4) regarding 2 kanals of land was also attested by him in the name of the persons described above. He prayed that the above sale deed and the mutation be declared to have been executed and attested in excess of the authority conferred on the general authority and, as such, ineffective upon his rights.

5.    The appellants' predecessor, Bashir Ahmed (Defendant No.2) and other defendants denied the claims set up in the plaint by submitting a joint written statement. They emphasized that the power of attorney (Ex.D.9) resulted from a family settlement by which the brothers agreed to divide the family properties among themselves. In paragraph 2 of the written statement, the scheme of how the properties stated above were to be divided among the brothers was described in the following words:

i.      Abdul Rashid: Land measuring 53 kanals and 17 marlas, situated at Jamke Cheema, Tehsil Daska, and plot measuring 7-marlas situated at Gali Sargodian College Road, Daska.

ii.     Muhammad Sharif: One commercial plot measuring 10-marlas, situated at Karkhana Rustam Road, College Road, Daska, and vacant plot measuring 12-1/2 marlas in Gali Sargodian, Water Tank No.2, College Road, Daska.

iii.    Bashir Ahmed: Plot measuring 12-marlas, situated at Jinnah Road Gujranwala, commercial plot measuring 10 marlas adjacent to house, and a house measuring 7-marlas situated at Gali Sargodian, College Road, Daska.

iv.    Nazir Ahmed: Commercial area measuring 2-kanals and 6-marlas (46 marlas) situated at Pasrur Road, Daska, where "Madina Industries" is running along with a house measuring 15- marlas, situated at Gali Sargodian, College Road, Daska.

It was further maintained in paragraph 3 of the written statement that according to the scheme of the partition of properties, each brother was given the general power of attorney deed of the other brothers. In this way, Abdul Rashid (Defendant No.3) was given registered general power of attorney deed dated 20th of March, 2002 (Ex.D.9). It was also pointed out that Bashir Ahmed (Defendant No.2) had also executed a general power of attorney (Ex.D.6) in favour of Nazir Ahmed, the plaintiff. Based on this, Nazir Ahmed transferred the land owned by Bashir Ahmed to his sons. In essence, their plea was that this was a case of quid pro quo.

6.    The first question on facts emanating from the parties' pleadings for determination was whether any family settlement embodied a scheme or the arrangement regarding the division of properties. A perusal of the record indicates that after the plaintiff presented his affirmative evidence, Bashir Ahmed (Defendant No.2) and Bilqees Akhtar (Defendant No. 1) jointly filed an application with the Trial Court. They claimed that a scheme for partition of properties was documented in a memorandum dated 23rd of November, 2000, which the plaintiff and his brothers signed as an acknowledgement and the original memorandum was in the plaintiff's possession. They requested the Trial Court to direct the plaintiff to produce original memorandum dated 23rd of November, 2000, containing the scheme for properties partition, or alternatively to allow them to produce it as secondary evidence. The plaintiff contested this application. The Trial Court dismissed the application on 22nd of May, 2006, finding no merit in it. The revision of this order was sought. The Revision Court, on careful consideration of the affirmative evidence led by the plaintiff, revised the Trial Court's order on 5th of October, 2006, stating that the execution of the memorandum was proved and allowed it to be placed on record. This revisional judgment was not further assailed; thus, it became final. Given the situation, there is no need to reassess the evidence because the above revisional judgment, which has become final, is sufficient to conclude that a settlement to divide the family properties, as claimed by the defendants in their written statement, was reached among the brothers, and that was recorded in the memorandum dated 23rd of November, 2000 (Ex.D. 1). Be it noted that this memorandum/ document merely stated the nature of arrangement arrived at as regards the division of properties; it did not effect a partition.

7.    Now, it becomes necessary to investigate one more question on facts. How did the brothers give effect to the arrangement among them regarding the division of properties? This takes us to the deposition made by the plaintiff (P.W. 1) in his cross-examination. He admitted during cross-examination that his brothers had granted him power of attorney for their properties. He also admitted that three different deeds of power of attorney were executed in his name. He clarified that the first power of attorney concerned the land behind Madina Industry, given by his two brothers, Muhammad Sharif and Bashir Ahmad. The second power of attorney pertained to Muhammad Sharif's house located in Gali Sargodian. The third power of attorney was related to Bashir Ahmad's 7-Marla house on College Road. Furthermore, the plaintiff acknowledged during cross-examination that, using the aforementioned power of attorney, he had gifted his sons the 27 Marla land of Madina Industry and transferred the College Road house to his wife. The above statement, when read with the documents tendered by the defendants in evidence, shows that the mode of distribution of the properties was the same as the defendants had disclosed in their written statement. A perusal of the evidence suggests that the defendants submitted three deeds of power of attorney. The first deed (Ex.D.2) was executed by Muhammad Sharif in favour of the plaintiff regarding 71/2 Marlas of land. The second deed (Ex.D.3) was executed by Muhammad Sharif and Bashir Ahmad (Defendant No.2) in favour of the plaintiff regarding 2-Kanals of land. The third deed (EX.D.6) was executed by Bashir Ahmad (Defendant No.2) in favour of the plaintiff regarding 7-Marlas of land. The evidence further suggests that the plaintiff then executed a gift deed of 8-Marlas using a power of attorney (Ex.D.3) in favour of his sons Muhammad Qaisar, Muhammad Mehmood-ul-Hasan, and Muhammad Faiz-ul-Hassan. He also executed a registered sale-deed of 7-Marlas using a power of attorney (Ex.D.6) in favour of his son Muhammad Faiz-ul-Hassan. Moreover, the plaintiff executed a gift deed of land measuring 19 marlas (Ex.D.7) in favour of his sons Muhammad Qaisar Nazir, Muhammad Mehmood-ul-Hassan, and Muhammad Faiz-ul-Hassan using a power of attorney (Ex.D.3) issued by Muhammad Sharif and Bashir Ahmad (Defendant No.2). Lastly, the plaintiff executed a sale deed (Ex.D.8) using a power of attorney (Ex.D.2) issued by Muhammad Sharif, and transferred the land measuring 7-Marlas to his wife, Mst. Razia. From the above appreciation of evidence, it stands established that four brothers had joint properties and a partition took place between them. The brothers gave each other general power of attorney to formalize the partition. The plaintiff then alienated the land to his sons and wife, which he had obtained through the partition from joint properties based on the general power of attorney in his favour on behalf of his brothers. Similarly, Abdul Rashid (Defendant No.3)
acted upon the general power of attorney (Ex.D.9) in his favour on behalf of the plaintiff and alienated the land measuring 53 kanals and 17 marlas to defendants Nos. 1 and 2, which he had obtained from joint properties through the partition. So, the scheme of partitioning joint properties amongst brothers was proved, as stated in the written statement.

8.    This brings us to the stage of examining the last question on facts whether the plaintiff had revoked the power of attorney (Ex.D.9) in favour of Abdul Rashid (Defendant No.3) and, therefore, the sale deed dated 29th of April, 2003 (Ex.P.3), and mutation No.4766 dated 13th of November, 2002 (Ex.P.4) in favour of Bilquees Akhtar (Defendant No.1) and Bashir Ahmad (Defendant No.2) were illegal. It was claimed in the plaint that during the last ten days of March, 2003, in the presence of Muhammad Asghar (P.W.2) and Shahid Ali (P.W.3), the plaintiff had verbally told Abdul Rashid (Defendant No.3) that he had cancelled his power of attorney (Ex.D.9), so it could not be used; subsequently, on legal advice, the revocation deed was drawn on 29th of April, 2003, but the stamp vendor recorded this fact in his register on 30th of April, 2003; and finally, it was registered with the Sub-Registrar on 5th of May, 2003. Mere, this assertion is sufficient to hold that mutation No.4766 (Exh.P.4) was valid because it was sanctioned much before the alleged revocation of power of attorney. Now, we need to determine whether the sale deed dated 29th of April, 2003 (Exh.P.3) could be declared illegal, based on the facts pleaded in the plaint. We do not hold the view that the revocation deed (Exh.P.1) was signed on 29th of April, 2003, and came into effect from that date, and thus, the sale deed (Exh.P.3) based on the revoked power of attorney (EXh.D.9) was illegal. This is for two reasons. Firstly, the revocation deed (Ex.P.1) shows that on 30th of April, 2003, the plaintiff had purchased its stamp paper, but the writing upon it contained the date of 29th of April, 2003. This solitary fact is sufficient to infer that the revocation deed (Ex.P.1) was not scribed on 29th of April, 2003. It appears that due to this discrepancy, the plaintiff, in his plaint, stated that the stamp paper was purchased on 29th of April, 2003, but the vendor entered it in his register at Serial No.7040 on 30th of April, 2003. This position is unacceptable because it does not appeal to the mind of any prudent man. Secondly, on 29th of April, 2003, both the plaintiff and Abdul Rashid (Defendant No.3) were present at the Sub-Registrar's office to produce documents for registration. The plaintiff presented a sale deed (Ex.D.5) using the power of attorney given by his brother, Bashir Ahmed (Defendant No.2), while Abdul Rashid (Defendant No.3) presented the sale deed (Ex.D.3). If the plaintiff had revoked the power of attorney in March, 2003, he could have made a written request to the Sub-Registrar to not register the sale deed (Ex.D.3) by stating the revocation, but he did not. Given the state of affairs, the plaintiff's claim of revoking the power of attorney before the registration of the sale deed (Ex.P.3) was not plausible, and the testimonies of Muhammad Asghar (P.W.2) and Shahid Ali (P.W.3) were also not credible. Therefore, the sale deed (Ex.P.3) could not be considered illegal based on these circumstances.

9.    It is important to note that our determination of factual questions aligns with the findings of the District Courts, which were based on the probable conclusions drawn from the preponderance of evidence presented by the parties to the suit. However, in its revisional jurisdiction, the High Court did not take into account the exposition of facts. Instead, it reversed the decrees in favour of the defendants, and upheld the plaintiff's claim because it found that the defendants had not complied with certain legal requirements. It is, therefore, essential to assess the points that prevailed with the High Court.

 
 
10.  Before delving into the points on which the High Court revised the concurrent findings of its subordinate courts, it is imperative to discuss the general impact and significance of family settlement. A family settlement involves members of the same family striving to resolve their differences and disputes to achieve lasting resolution. Through these arrangements, family members aim to bring about harmony and goodwill, settling conflicting claims or disputed titles to promote peace within the family. Courts recognise the special significance of family arrangements and uphold them when made in good faith. This principle has been developed by courts over a long period of time to discourage litigation driven by greed, particularly in cases involving the distribution of family estates, such as the one being considered here. In this context, we may refer to some earlier case law.

11.  The oldest case on the subject that comes to our hands dates back almost three hundred years, which is the case of Stapilton (1739).1 In this case, Philip Stapilton, the father, in order to prevent disputes and ill consequences between his two sons, drafted an agreement to divide his real estate between them. The dispute in the case was that Stapilton's elder son, Henry, was a bastard and, thus, not a legal heir to the estate. The defendant, being the only legitimate son, claimed the right to all his father's estate. The Court held that the purpose behind this agreement was to save the family honour, preserve harmony and affection amongst family members and thus, resting upon grounds which would not have been considered satisfactory if the transaction had occurred between mere strangers, but because the agreement was entered into to save the honour of the family, and was a reasonable one, a court of equity should, if it is possible, decree a performance of it. It further observed that a court should be glad to lay hold of any just ground to carry the agreement into execution and establish the peace of a family giving effect to the agreement.

12.  The second case is that of Gordon (1821),2 where Lord Eldon observed that when family agreements have been fairly entered into, without concealment or imposition upon either side, with no suppression of what is true, or suggestion of what is false, then, although the parties may have greatly misunderstood their situation and mistaken their rights, a Court of Equity will not disturb the quiet, which is the consequence of that agreement.

13.  Coming to the third case of Khunni Lal (1911),3 their Lordships of the Privy Council, considering a compromise entered into between certain members of a family by which they had settled their disputes and divided the family property, quoted with approval certain observations in Mewa Koonwer4 wherein the learned Judges had said that the true character of the transaction appeared to us to have been a settlement between the several members of the family of their disputes, each one relinquishing all claim in respect of all property in dispute other than that falling to his share, and recognising the right of the others, as they had previously asserted it to the portion allotted to them respectively. It was in this light, rather than as conferring a new distinct title on each other, that the parties themselves seem to have regarded the arrangement, and it is the duty of the Courts to uphold and give full effect to such an arrangement. And so, through equity, a family settlement was cured and given full effect.

14.  The fourth case that we need to look at is of Mahomed Musa (1915),5 where the Privy Council pointed out in a case of family settlement that although the compromise and the decree taken together were considered to be defective or inchoate as elements making up a final and validly concluded settlement for the extinction of the equity of redemption, the actings and the conduct of the parties founded upon the performance or part performance of such an agreement were sufficient to cure all defects; for equity will support a transaction clothed imperfectly in those legal forms to which finality attaches after the bargain has been acted upon.

15.  The fifth case that we may refer to here is of Musammat Hardei (1919),6 where the Privy Council held that the plaintiff was bound by her family agreement and did not allow her to repudiate it because a long period of time which had elapsed since it was made, nor to impeach the sale, which was made upon the faith of it.

16.  The sixth case that we would like to mention is of Martin Cashin (1938).7 In this case their Lordships of the Privy Council observed that a parent can be generous to a son, or legitimate children to an illegitimate one, or a son to a mother upon the occasion of a family arrangement without its being proper or possible in equity merely on that ground to suggest that the arrangement is an unfair one and ought to be set aside. It would indeed be strange if an agreement entered into by parties of full contracting capacity could be set aside in equity because, regarded from the standpoint of the family, it was generous as well as just.

17.  The decision of the Indian Supreme Court is also an important reference to consider in this context. In Tek Bahadur Bhujil8 (1966), it was pointed out that a family arrangement could be arrived at even orally and registration would be required only if it was reduced into writing. It was also held that a document which was no more than a memorandum of what had been agreed to did not require registration. The Indian Supreme Court had observed thus, "Family arrangement as such can be arrived at orally. Its terms may be recorded in writing as a memorandum of what had been agreed upon between the parties. The memorandum need not be prepared for the purpose of being used as a document on which future title of the parties be founded. It is usually prepared as a record of what had been agreed upon so that there be no hazy notions about it in future. It is only when the parties reduce the family arrangement in writing with the purpose of using that writing as proof of what they had arranged and, where the arrangement is brought about by the document as such, that the document would require registration as it is then that it would be a document of title declaring for future what rights in what properties the parties possess."

18.  The next reference is to a case of this Court. In Atta Hussain Khan (1979)9, it was held that a document that embodies a bona fide settlement whereby a person agrees to surrender his rights for the preservation of peace, amity and harmony between the members of the family amounts to a family settlement arrived between the members for a lawful consideration, and is fully binding on them.

19.  We would now refer to another case of this Court. In Anwar Khan (2004)10, it was argued that since the family arrangement was not registered, it could not be relied upon, nor could it be produced as evidence in Court. This Court concluded that if the parties were not interested in partition of property on permanent transfer basis, they could not be forced or compelled to do so as it depended upon their whims and wishes to distribute the property in any manner as may be deemed fit and proper, being their personal and family affair. In such an eventuality, the question of registration of such agreement, did not arise. The Court relied upon the case of Jahanzeb11 to reach this conclusion.

20.  The last case that we may refer to is of Allah Dad12 (2005), where one of the questions before this Court was whether an unregistered family settlement was admissible in evidence. The Court observed that the object behind the family settlement is always to settle existing or future property disputes amongst the family members, create goodwill, and avoid future disputes between the successors-in-interest. The bona fide transaction of family settlement would be binding on
the parties and if the settlement by the conduct of the parties, is
capable of receiving constant recognition for a long time, the right to assert under the agreement must not be subsequently allowed to be impeached, and Courts may not reject the family settlement on technical grounds.

21.  On this subject, we found the relevant insights in section 132 of "Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence".13 To better understand the effect and value of the family settlement, it would be helpful to read it here in extenso. It says: "There are cases of family compromise, where, upon principles of policy, for the honour or peace of families, the doctrine sustaining compromises has been carried further. And it has been truly remarked, that in such family arrangements the Court of Chancery has administered an equity, which is not applied to agreements generally. Such compromises, fairly and reasonably made, to save the honour of a family, as in case of suspected illegitimacy, to prevent family disputes and family forfeitures, are upheld with a strong hand; and are binding, when in cases between mere strangers the like agreements would not be enforced. Thus, it has been said, that if, on the death of a person, seised in fee, a dispute arises, who is heir; and there is room for a rational doubt, as to that fact, and the parties deal with each other openly and fairly, investigating the subject for themselves, and each communicating to the other all that he knows, and is informed of, and at length they agree to distribute the property, under the notion that the elder claimant is illegitimate, although it turns out afterwards that he is legitimate; there, the court will not disturb such an arrangement, merely because the fact of legitimacy is subsequently established. Yet, in such a case, the party acts under a mistake of fact. In cases of ignorance of title, upon a plain mistake of the law, there seems little room to distinguish between family compromises and others."

22.  Here, it would also be apposite to cite the points made in the treaties "Kerr on Fraud and Mistake"14 regarding family arrangements. On page 168, it is noted that: "the principles which apply to the case of ordinary compromises between strangers do not equally apply to the case of compromises in the nature of family arrangements. Family arrangements are governed by a special equity peculiar to themselves, and will be enforced, if honestly made, although they have not been meant as a compromise, but have proceeded from an error of all parties, originating in mistake or ignorance of fact as to what their rights actually are, or of the points on which their rights actually depend."

23.  The law in England on this point is almost the same. In Halsbury's Laws of England,15 on pages 623-625 following apt observations regarding the essentials of the family settlement and the principle governing the existence of the same are made:

       903. Meaning of family arrangements. A family arrangement is an agreement between members of the same family, intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of the family either by compromising doubtful or disputed rights or by preserving the family property or the peace and security of the family by avoiding litigation or by saving its honour.

       The agreement may be implied from a long course of dealing, but it is more usual to embody or to effectuate the agreement in a deed to which the term 'family arrangement' is applied.

       906. Principles governing family arrangements. Family arrangements are governed by principles which are not applicable to dealings between strangers'. When deciding the rights of parties under a family arrangement or a claim to upset such an arrangement, the court considers what in the broadest view of the matter is most in the interest of the family, and has regard to considerations which, in dealing with transactions between persons not members of the same family, would not be taken into account. Matters which would be fatal to the validity of similar transactions between strangers are not objections to the binding effect of family arrangements. Conversely, an intention to create a legally enforceable contract may be negatived more readily where the parties to an arrangement are members of the same family than where they are not.

       Although usually and necessarily present where a family arrangement is made, parental influence will not by itself render the transaction voidable, but where, at a time when he is not fully emancipated from his parent's influence, a child enters into a family arrangement under which the parent benefits to the total exclusion of the child or benefits to an extent out of all proportion to the benefit accruing to the child, there is a presumption of undue influence. The presumption will be rebutted if it appears that, when the arrangement was entered into, the child was able to form a free and unfettered judgment independent of any sort of control.

 
 
24.  The principles governing family settlement or arrangements that may be deduced from the above referred survey of case law and the law books may be outlined in the following form:

       (i) The family settlement has to be genuine, bona fide and must aim to resolve family disputes and conflicting claims by ensuring a fair and equitable distribution or allocation of properties among all family members.

       (ii) When an agreement is entered into to preserve the honour of a family and is reasonable, the Court will seize any justifiable reason to enforce the agreement and promote peace within the family.

       (iii) The settlement must be made willingly and should not be influenced by fraud, social or familial pressure, and undue influence.

       (iv) Like an oral contract, family settlements may well also be oral and if it is, no registration of the settlement is necessary.

B
 
       (v) It is well established that registration of a family settlement is required only if the terms of the settlement are put into writing. However, it is important to distinguish between a document that includes the terms and details of a family settlement and a simple memorandum created after the arrangement has been made, intended either for record purposes or for informing the Court to effect necessary mutation. In such cases, the memorandum does not create or extinguish any rights in immovable property and, therefore, does not fall under the requirements of the Registration Act, 1908 making it not subject to compulsory registration.

       (vi) In cases where the parties are not inclined to divide property permanently, they cannot be forced to do so. The decision to distribute the property is based on their own preferences, and it is considered a personal and family matter. In such situations, there is no requirement for registering such an agreement.

       (vii) The members involved in the family settlement must have a pre-existing title, claim, or interest, even a potential claim, in the property that is recognised by all parties to the settlement. If one party lacks a title but, under the arrangement, another party relinquishes all claims or titles in favour of that person and acknowledges them as the sole owner, a pre-existing title will be assumed. Consequently, the family arrangement will be upheld, and the Courts will readily endorse it.

       (viii) A genuine and bona fide family settlement can resolve disputes, whether current or potential, even if they do not involve legal claims. As long as the arrangement is fair and equitable, it is final and binding on all parties involved.

       (ix) Courts tend to favour maintaining the family arrangement rather than disturbing it on technical or trivial grounds. Where the Courts find that the family arrangement suffers from a legal deficiency or a formal defect, the principle of estoppel is invoked and applied to turn down the plea of the person who, being a party to family arrangement, seeks to set aside a settled dispute, and claims to revoke the family arrangement under which he himself has received some material benefits.

 
 
25.  We will now have a go at applying the principles mentioned above to the facts of the present case. This is to determine whether the legal issues that influenced the High Court's decision could justify accepting the plaintiff's claim and reversing the first Appellate Court's decree.

 
 

 
 
26.  The first legal omission that the High Court noticed was that the attorney Abdul Rashid (Defendant No.3) had transferred the plaintiff's property to his own relatives (i.e., his brother Bashir Ahmed, Defendant No.2, and his daughter Bilqees Akhtar, Defendant No. 1, who are also close relatives of the plaintiff) without his specific permission. This was founded on the precautionary principle first expounded by this Court in Fida Muhammad (1985)16 and subsequently followed in different cases17, as referenced in the High Court's judgment. According to this principle, the agent transferring the principal's property is obligated to firstly, in case of difficulty (and it will be a case of difficulty if a power of attorney is susceptible to doubt about its interpretation), use all reasonable diligence in communicating with the principal and seeking to obtain his instructions. Secondly, if the agent deals on his own account with the property under the agency, e.g., if he purchases it himself or for his own benefit, he, in his own interest, should obtain the consent of the principal in that behalf after acquainting him with all material circumstances on the subject, failing which the principal is at liberty to repudiate the transaction. We take the view that there was no warrant to apply this principle to the peculiar facts of the present case. The general powers of attorney accompanied by a family settlement, exchanged by the parties to achieve the objectives of a family settlement, are to be treated as a species apart and an exception to the above-mentioned precautionary principle. It is reminded here that family settlements are not governed by principles that apply to dealings between strangers18. When deciding the rights of party under the family settlement or claims to upset such settlement, the Court considers what, in the broadest view of the matter, is most for the interests of a family19. Matters that would be fatal to the validity of a similar transaction between strangers are not objections to the binding effect of a family settlement or arrangement20. Considering this legal perspective, upon reviewing the evidence presented, it becomes apparent that the true intention behind the arrangement outlined in the memorandum dated 23rd of November, 2000 (Ex.D.1) was to fairly distribute the properties among real brothers to buy peace of mind and bring about complete harmony in the family and prevent potential legal disputes and, for this purpose, each brother acknowledged the claims of the other brothers and granted them a general power of attorney, allowing them to easily transfer their respective share of the properties through sale, gift, etc. to anyone they deemed fit. Such arrangements are governed by a special equity peculiar to them and must be enforced if honestly made. In this case, the plaintiff did not claim that the property distribution arrangement embodied in the memorandum dated 23rd of November, 2000 (Ex.D.1) was unfair or involuntary. He also did not allege any fraud, coercion, or undue influence. Therefore, the precautionary principle did not apply in this situation and could not be used to disrupt the family settlement. If it did, it would essentially allow the plaintiff to exploit the family settlement for his own gain, potentially straining harmony and goodwill within the family. This was not wholesome and permissible under the law. It is important to note that the plaintiff had previously used general powers of attorney (i.e., Ex.D.2, Ex.D.3, and Ex.D.6) from his brothers, given to him under the same family settlement (Ex.D.1), without seeking their permission in favour of his sons and wife. The details whereof have been stated hereinabove in paragraph 7. This conduct constitutes and operates against the plaintiff as an estoppel to challenging transactions recorded in the sale deed (Ex.P.3) and mutation (Ex.P.4) made by Abdul Rashid (Defendant No.3) based on a power of attorney (Ex.D.9) given by him.

 
 
27.  The High Court also discounted the memorandum dated 23rd of November, 2000 (Ex.D.1) for three reasons. Firstly, it was not attested by a witness in accordance with Articles 17 and 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984. Secondly, it fell under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 and was a document that should have been registered, and since it was not registered, it was considered ineffective for transferring any rights. Lastly, the High Court found that it was not proved in accordance with the law. The objections raised by the High Court regarding the memorandum (Ex.D. 1) appear to be based on a misinterpretation of the evidence and a flawed application of the law; as a result, these objections do not hold up under legal scrutiny. We explain why. In legal terms, members of a family descending from a common ancestor or a near relation can make an agreement to settle their dispute and divide their property either orally or in writing to foster peace within the family. In the case at hand, a document (Ex.D. 1) detailing the distribution of properties was drafted on 23rd of November, 2000. This document could be categorized as a family arrangement rather than a standard partition deed. Its contents revealed that the brothers initially reached an oral agreement regarding property distribution, which was then recorded in a memorandum (Ex.D.1). The property division outlined in the memorandum (Ex.D.1) did not involve transferring property from one brother to another, nor did any brother derive their property rights from another. Instead, the arrangement embodied in the memorandum (Ex.D.1) acknowledged the rights of each brother to specific properties listed under their names. How the properties were to be transferred from one brother to another was verbally settled among the four brothers, and general powers of attorneys were exchanged among all the brothers to give effect to this verbal agreement, which details have been explained above. Since the memorandum (Ex.D. 1) did not constitute a deed of transfer, gift, exchange, surrender, etc., it did not fall under the clauses of Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, which require registration21. It also did not contain any financial or future obligations requiring attestation by two witnesses as per Article 17 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984. However, it is made clear that if the settlement were used as a document to create or declare rights in immovable property worth more than Rs.100, it would have needed attestation by two witnesses and also registration. It is important to note that, even though the memorandum (Ex.D.1) was not registered, it was open for either party to prove that there had been a family settlement which was acted upon. It seems that the defendants were aware of this legal position and, therefore, not only presented oral evidence to establish the family settlement but also requested to present secondary evidence of the memorandum (Ex.D.1). The Additional District Judge granted permission to produce secondary evidence by his order dated 5th of October, 2006, as the evidence on record proved its execution. As the plaintiff did not challenge this order, it became final. Therefore, the High Court's conclusion that it was not proved according to law was incorrect.

 
 

E
 
28.  Having analyzed the questions on facts and law, we have found that the cause for bringing the suit, giving rise to this appeal, was not bona fide but an outcome of greed and an attempt to foil the unity achieved by the family settlement. Although this bitter fact stood established in the Trial Court, still the plaintiff manipulated his niece Bilqees Akhtar (Defendant No. 1) to employ another tactic at the appellate stage to disrupt the family peace. He took her to the first Appellate Court and had her statement recorded. In her statement, she claimed to have reached a compromise with the plaintiff and stated that she would have no objection if the suit was decreed. How did this happen? Why did she give a statement against her father, Abdul Rashid (Defendant No.3)? A perusal of the record suggests three plausible reasons therefor. The first is that by then, her father had died; secondly, her daughter married to plaintiff's son; and lastly, she had sold the property to Shazia Yaqoob by registered sale deed dated 17th of February, 2005. These factors cast a reasonable doubt on the mind of a prudent man that Bilqees Akhtar's statement was not voluntary but under the undue influence of the plaintiff. Given the situation, Bilqees Akhtar's statement could not be considered credible. As such, it could not be made basis for accepting the plaintiff's claim, and it was rightly excluded from consideration by the first Appellate Court. We are in complete agreement with the first Appellate Court because we subscribe to the principle that if the entire foundation of the cause of action is found to be false, the suit cannot succeed in part on the same cause of action even as regards a defendant admitting the plaintiff's claim22. In this background, we are not inclined to implead subsequent purchaser, Shazia Yaqoob as a respondent in this appeal; so her application (i.e., C.M.A. No.5618 of 2022) is dismissed.

29.  C.M.A. No.3759 of 2022 is an application for transposing Appellants No. 1-b, Imtiaz Ahmed, and legal representatives of Muhammad Asghar, Appellant No.2-a, as Respondents Nos. 3, 4-a, and 4-b. Based on the reasons stated in this application, it is allowed as prayed for.

30   Given the preceding discussion, we conclude that the opinion propounded by the Lahore High Court suffers from misreading of facts and evidence and misapplication of law and thus cannot be approved. This appeal, therefore, succeeds. The decree granted by the judgment dated 29th of April, 2019, of the Lahore High Court is set aside, and resultantly, the decree drawn by the first Appellate Court is restored with costs throughout.

C.P.L.A. No. 47 of 2024, decided on 11th September, 2024.

ORDER

       SHAHID WAHEED, J.---In a suit for declaration and injunction, the plaintiffs (petitioners herein) applied for a summons to be issued to the first defendant, Mst. Saima Saeed, as their witness. The Trial Judge declined the application, and his order was first upheld by the Appellate Court and then by the Revision Court. It is these orders that have given rise to this petition under Article 185(3) of the Constitution.

2.    The Courts' refusal is supported by the observations of the Privy Council in Kishori Lal v. Chunni Lal (31 All. 116 at page 122). Their Lordships of the Privy Council have referred to the practice, which sometimes seemed to obtain in some Courts of calling /the party's opponent as a witness. They have observed that this practice is highly objectionable. "Such a practice," said their Lordships, "ought never to be permitted in the result to embarrass judicial investigation." In another case titled Mahunt Shatrugan Das v. Bawa Sham Das and others (AIR 1938 PC 59), the Privy Council reiterated that the practice of calling the defendant as a witness to give evidence on behalf of the plaintiff is condemnable.

3.    Based on the precedents cited above, we may say that it is a bad practice for parties to refrain from entering the witness box when they are in a position to give personal evidence. Therefore, the first defendant in the suit, giving rise to this petition, is expected to provide personal testimony in support of her case. If she does not appear without sufficient cause, it will amount to suppression or withholding of evidence, and the Court will be entitled to draw an inference against her.

4.    Be it noted that, in the facts of the present case, if the first defendant fails to appear in the witness box, allowing the plaintiffs to compel her presence by the issue of a witness summons would still be objectionable. Such a practice places the examination and cross-examination of a witness in the wrong hands, hinders fair trial, and obstructs justice.

5.    That seems to be the effect of the orders made by the Courts below. As a result, we do not find infirmity in the orders and are poised to uphold them.

6.    This petition is dismissed, and leave is accordingly refused.

MWA/M-47/SC                                                                                  Petition dismissed.

Civil Appeal No.1877 of 2016, decided on 14th November, 2023.

       (On appeal against the judgment dated 27.05.2016 passed by the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad in Civil Revision No.65 of 2016).

(a) Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908)---

----O. II, R.2---Suit to include the whole claim---Order II, Rule 2, C.P.C---Object and scope stated.

       Order II, Rule 2, C.P.C is intended to deal with the vice of splitting a cause of action. It provides that a suit must include the whole of any claim that the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action on which he sues and that if he omits (except with the leave of the Court) to sue for any relief to which his cause of action would entitle him, he cannot claim it in a subsequent suit. The object of this salutary rule is doubtlessly to prevent a multiplicity of suits. It is to be noted that this rule does not require that when several causes of action arise from one transaction, the plaintiff should sue for all of them in one suit.

----O.

JUDGMENT

       SHAHID WAHEED, J.---This direct appeal is by the unsuccessful plaintiff and excites two legal questions. The first is whether the plaintiff, after withdrawing his suit for specific performance of the agreement to sell, could file a fresh suit to recover the earnest money paid to the defendants under the said agreement. The second is what the limitation period would be if the second suit is found to be competent.

2.    The above questions arise from a suit brought by the plaintiff for recovery of earnest money, which was a sequel to his suit for specific performance. The pivot of both the suits was an agreement to sell dated 20th of July, 2005. The need, therefore, is to state the cause which led the plaintiff to institute both suits so as to find a clear answer to the moot questions. The unvarnished facts constituting the cause in brevity are that defendant No.2, Raja Arshad Mehmood, was the owner of 1200 kanals of land located in Mouza Sihala and Mouza Gagir, Tehsil and District Islamabad. Malik Ghulam Murtaza, now represented by his legal heirs, was his attorney. He was arrayed as defendant No.1 in the suit. On 20th of July, 2005, the plaintiff entered into an agreement with defendant No.1 to purchase the land of defendant No.2 for Rs.785,000 per kanal and paid Rs.5,000,000 as earnest money. After that, certain disputes arose between the parties, the details of which need not be mentioned here, which led to the cancellation of the sale agreement. According to the plaintiff, the cancellation of the agreement was the result of coercion and force exerted on him by the defendants, which became the cause of bringing a suit (the first suit) for declaration, possession and specific performance of agreement dated 20th of July, 2005. This suit was instituted in the original jurisdiction of the Islamabad High Court. There is no denying that on the 6th of May, 2009, defendant No.1 appeared before the Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of the Islamabad High Court and recorded his following statement:

       "Statement of Malik Ghulam Murtaza son of Malik Sher Muhammad defendant No.1 on oath:-

       The plaintiff had entered into an agreement with me for purchase of suit land. The suit land was owned by Raja Arshad Mehmood, defendant No.2 and I was attorney of defendant No.2. Thereafter, some settlement was made between the plaintiff and defendant No.2 in which it was decided that the agreement executed between me and plaintiff be cancelled, and Arshad Mehmood had promised to refund the earnest money of Rs.50,00,000/- to the plaintiff. I have got no concern with this suit. The Hon'ble Court may decide the suit on merits.

                                                       Deputy Registrar, Judicial"

As the other defendants in the case were not present on the date when the above statement was recorded, notices were issued to them. It is also on record that based on the above statement, the plaintiff subsequently applied for withdrawal of the suit with permission to file a fresh one. Notice was issued to the defendants on this application (i.e. C.M No.249 of 2013) vide order dated 3rd of July, 2013, and finally, on 18th of November, 2013, the suit was dismissed as withdrawn; and permission was not given to institute a fresh suit. Here end the facts of the first suit.

3.    A perusal of the record indicates that on the 13th of February, 2014, the plaintiff brought his second suit for recovery of Rs.5,000,000. This suit was instituted in the Civil Court, Islamabad (West). It is evident from the contents of the plaint of this suit that it stated the facts up to the withdrawal of the first suit. The cause for instituting this suit was stated to be premised on the statement recorded by defendant No.1 before the Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of the Islamabad High Court, as a result of which a compromise was reached between the parties, and the first suit was withdrawn. Defendant No.1 filed cognovit, while defendant No.2 invoked Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C., seeking rejection of the plaint on four grounds: firstly, the first suit was to include the whole of the claim, but the plaintiff omitted to sue for the relief of recovery of the amount and only sued for specific performance of the agreement, and as such, the second suit was barred under Order II, Rule 2, C.P.C.; secondly, simple withdrawal of the first suit under Order XXIII, Rule 1, C.P.C. renders the second suit incompetent; thirdly, per Section 19 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, the plaintiff ought to have claimed compensation in his first suit; and lastly, the second suit was barred by time. The plaintiff, by his reply, contested each of the grounds stated above.

4.    Taking stock of the material placed on record and appraising the rival contentions of the parties, the Trial Court came to hold that recording of evidence is necessary to answer the question whether the statement of defendant No.1, recorded before the Deputy Registrar (Judicial), was binding on defendant No.2, and as such, it was premature to say about the question of limitation and applicability of Order II, Rule 2, C.P.C., and Section 19 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877. The application seeking rejection of the plaint was, thus, dismissed by order dated 24th of November, 2015, and defendant No.2 was directed to file a written statement.

5.    Defendant No.2 was not satisfied with the findings returned by the Trial Court and, therefore, sought revision. The High Court found merit in the stance of defendant No.2 and proceeded to observe that the relief claimed by the plaintiff was available when filing the first suit, even so, he deliberately chose to file a suit for specific performance of the agreement, and thus, the bar of Order II, Rule 2, C.P.C. was attracted. The suit was found to be out of time, and also incompetent under Order XXIII, Rule 1, C.P.C. However, the High Court did not say anything about Section 19 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877. By judgment dated 27th of May, 2016, the revision was granted.1

6.    Having now noted the facts which gave rise to the cause of action of each of the two suits, we have to determine which of the Courts below has correctly dealt with the objections to the maintainability of the second suit. In furtherance of this objective, in the first place, it is to be looked into whether the second suit for recovery of earnest money was barred by the provisions of Order II, Rule 2, C.P.C. It is now old-line that this Rule is intended to deal with the vice of splitting a cause of action. It provides that a suit must include the whole of any claim that the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action on which he sues and that if he omits (except with the leave of the Court) to sue for any relief to which his cause of action would entitle him, he cannot claim it in a subsequent suit. The object of this salutary rule is doubtlessly to prevent a multiplicity of suits. It is to be noted that alongside the above, this rule does not require that when several causes of action arise from one transaction, the plaintiff should sue for all of them in one suit. This proposition gets strength from Saminathan Chetty v. Planaiappa Chetty,2 in which the Privy Council observed that Rule 2 of Order II, C.P.C. is directed to securing the exhaustion of the relief in respect of a cause of action and not to inclusion in one and the same action of different causes of action, even though they arise from the same transactions. In light of the anatomy of this rule, it is clear that the cause of action in the second suit was not the same as in the first suit. The first suit was brought alleging that the defendants illegally got cancelled an agreement to sell dated 20th of July, 2005, and as such, the plaintiff claimed a decree for possession of the property by specific performance of the said agreement. Whereas the second suit of the plaintiff was based upon the allegations that the agreement to sell dated 20th of July, 2005, was cancelled by mutual consent of the parties, and it was agreed that the defendants would return the earnest money of Rs.5,000,000 to the plaintiff. In support of these allegations, the plaintiff relied on the statement of defendant No.1, which he recorded before the Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of the Islamabad High Court, and the prayer of the plaint was for recovery of earnest money. This relief could not have been claimed by the plaintiff in his first suit for possession of the property by specific performance of the agreement to sell dated 20th of July, 2005, because the right to possession accrues only when specific performance is decreed, similarly, the right to refund of earnest money accrues only when specific performance is denied. As such, the facts relating to the denial of specific performance resulting from the cancellation of the agreement to sell dated 20th of July, 2005, and the settlement agreement in the case constituted a fresh cause of action, and therefore, the second suit for recovery of money based thereon could not be held to be barred under Order II, Rule 2, C.P.C.

7.    Apropos of the objection based on the bar contained in the provisions of Order XXIII, Rule 1, C.P.C., it would be enough to say that the subject-matter or claim of the second suit, as stated above, was different from the first suit and, as such, the plaintiff could not be held to be precluded from instituting the second suit.

8.    The next objection of the defendants was that the plaintiff could not have instituted a separate suit for specific performance and recovery of earnest money by virtue of the provisions of Sections 19 and 29 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877. Again, this objection was unfounded. Section 19 enables a person claiming specific performance to seek compensation in addition. Section 29 prohibits a suit for compensation after the dismissal of a suit for specific relief. None of these sections have anything to do with the plaintiff's second suit, where the claim is for recovery of earnest money.

9.    The last plea raised was that of limitation. The High Court was of the view that Article 181 of the Limitation Act, 1908, was the Article applicable to the facts of the second suit which provided for a period of limitation of three years and was, therefore, barred by time. The High Court concluded that if the cause of action available to the plaintiff was based on 20th of July, 2005, the date of the agreement to sell or 5th of August, 2005, when the said agreement was allegedly cancelled, the period of limitation computing from either of the stated dates had expired. We disagree with this. The law of limitation being a disabling provision, its various Articles is to be construed by its plain language. The suitor approaching the courts for adjudication of his claim is entitled to a trial on the merits unless his claim is time-barred. The provision of Article 181, being a residuary Article, applies to any or all applications for which, specifically, no limitation period is provided elsewhere. It does not apply to any suit.

10.  In our view, the only Article which could have been applied, in the given circumstances, was Article 97. This Article deals with a suit "for money paid upon an existing consideration which afterwards fails". We say so because a plain reading of it dictates three ingredients for its applicability: firstly, the suit must be for money; secondly, such money must have been paid upon a consideration which was in existence at the time of the payment; and lastly, the said consideration must have afterwards failed. Be it noted that if all these ingredients are established, the application of Article 97 cannot be resisted, and the starting point of limitation of three years under it would be not the date when the money was paid but when the consideration fails. Now, let us see if these ingredients are fulfilled in this case or not. As to the first ingredient, we would like to point out that payment of earnest money under the agreement to sell dated 20th of July, 2005, would fall within the meaning of the phrase "for money paid". The next factor which must be satisfied is that such money must have been paid upon an existing consideration. It is clarified that money paid under an agreement is paid for "existing consideration". We are, therefore, clearly of the opinion that the present case meets this qualification. Now, it remains to be seen, whether it can be predicated that the consideration for which the money had been paid had afterwards failed. We have no hesitation in holding in the circumstances of the case that it had failed. It may be reasoned that the earnest money is intended to serve as evidence of the buyer's (in this case plaintiff's) bona fide so that the amount will be forfeited if the transaction is terminated due to the buyer's cause, or if this is due to the seller (in this case the defendants) then the money will be refunded. It may also be noted that if the transaction proceeds, the earnest money becomes part of the purchase price. The facts stated by the plaintiff in the second suit show that the transaction did not fructify in a completed sale and thus the inevitable conclusion is that the consideration for which the money was paid was extinguished. Thus, it will be seen that all the three requirements of Article 97 are fully met in the present case, and, that being so, the limitation for the plaintiff's second suit would rightly start from the date of failure of the consideration, and the second suit would be within time having been brought within three years of the date of the failure of the consideration, which in this case could be said to have failed only when the first suit was dismissed.3 So, we are definitely of the opinion that the plea of limitation has no force and must be repelled.

11.  Before parting, we find it necessary to observe that suits for recovery of earnest money after failure of a suit for specific performance is a common law development and dates back to more than a century. To the legal mind, this procedural aspect is correct, but what is worth noting, which this case effectively illustrates, is that the sale agreement was executed on 20th of July, 2005. After that, a suit for specific performance was instituted. The case continued until it was dismissed on 18th of November, 2013, after eight years of litigation. On 13th of February, 2014, the second round of litigation was brought by the plaintiff to recover earnest money, to which the cause of action arose after the dismissal of the first suit for specific performance, and has reached us in appeal 18 years after the agreement. In total, these two rounds of litigation, starting with the same agreement, will complete 19 years of litigation this year. The famous saying of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. fits here perfectly that "the life of law has not been logic: it has been experience", and therefore, based on empirical study it is advisable to suggest that suitable amendments to the Specific Relief Act, 1877, be made so as to do away with such litigations and reduce the burden on the courts and on parties. The proposed amendments should provide for a provision by which any person suing for the specific performance of a contract for the transfer of immovable property, in appropriate cases, may ask for (a) possession or partition and separate possession, of the property in addition to such performance; or (b) any other relief to which he is entitled, including the refund of any earnest money or deposit paid or made by him, in case his claim for specific performance is refused.

12.  Given the preceding discussion, we conclude that the opinion propounded by the Islamabad High Court suffers from misreading of facts and misapplication of law and thus cannot be approved. This appeal, therefore, succeeds. The judgment dated 27th of May, 2016, of the Islamabad High Court is set aside, and resultantly, the application filed by defendant No.2 under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. is dismissed. The trial Court is directed to decide on the merits of the suit in accordance with the law.

13.  The Registrar of this Court shall forward a copy of this judgment to the Hon'ble Chairperson of the Law and Justice Commission, Attorney General for Pakistan and Secretary Law to Government of Pakistan and to Provincial Governments for their information and necessary action.

JUDGMENT

       SHAHID WAHEED, J.---One swallow does not a summer make. This case is illustrative of this adage.

2.    This appeal arises in this way. The appellant before us is the plaintiff, who by a summary suit had sued upon a promissory note claiming that the defendant, respondent herein, owed him Rs.800,000. The defendant traversed the claim and posited that he used to purchase pesticide from the plaintiff and as he was illiterate, some blank papers thumb-marked by him were obtained by the plaintiff in business dealing, which he had now made a promissory note. He specifically denied making any promissory note and receiving Rs 800,000 thereunder from the plaintiff. On these assertions, issues were settled, and parties were called upon to produce evidence. During evidence, the objection was raised that the promissory note was not admissible in evidence: for, firstly, some of its revenue stamps were not cancelled, and secondly its second marginal witness in terms of Articles 17 and 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, was not produced before the Court. These objections were counted against the plaintiff. The facts pleaded by the plaintiff were also found to be disproved. The suit failed and was dismissed. The plaintiff could not succeed in appeal either. Now, with our leave, the plaintiff is before us.

3.    We have to first decide on the admissibility of the promissory note and, secondly, whether, in the given circumstances, the promissory note had been proved. The first question has two facets, and the law applicable to each is misconstrued and misapplied. We will explain how. The second question will illustrate the prefatory adage.

4.    So far as the question of admissibility is concerned, the first objection was that since two witnesses attested the promissory note and one of them was not produced in Court, in terms of Article 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, it had to be excluded from evidence. This statement is not correct. It may be noted that as per Section 4 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, a promissory note is required to contain four essential ingredients: (i) an unconditional undertaking to pay, (ii) the sum should be the sum of money and certain, (iii) the payment should be to or to the order of a person who is certain, or to the bearer, of the instrument, and (iv) the maker should sign it. If an instrument fulfils these four conditions, it will be called a promissory note, and the requirement of attestation of a document provided under Article 17(2)(a) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, does not apply to a promissory note.1 That apart, two more things also need to be clarified here. First, if an instrument, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, is attested by witnesses, the nature and character thereof shall not be affected. It shall remain a promissory note and shall not be converted into a bond within the meaning of section 2(5)(b) of the Stamp Act, 1899.2 Secondly, if a promissory note is not witnessed, it does not appear that any third person saw it signed, in which case, the best evidence is the handwriting of the parties. But if it is witnessed, then it appears, on the face of the promissory note, that there is better evidence behind it; and the best evidence that the nature of the case admits of, the law requires.3

5.    There is no denying that in this case, two persons, namely Khalil Ahmed and Ghulam Hussain, were shown as witnesses of the promissory note, but only Ghulam Hussain (PW.2) was produced in the witness box. As stated above, the attestation of the promissory note was not a requirement of law; the non-appearance of the second witness could not be made a ground for excluding the promissory note from evidence. It follows, therefore, that the courts erred in law in holding that the promissory note was not admissible in evidence.

6.    The second objection to the admissibility of the promissory note was that some of its adhesive stamps were not cancelled. A perusal of the record reveals that Bashir Ahmad (PW-1), stamp vendor and deed writer, tendered the promissory note in his examination-in-chief, and immediately after his tender, counsel for the defendant objected that all its stamps were not cancelled and, thus, it was not admissible in evidence. The Trial Court, after noting this objection, held that it would be decided while making a final judgment, marked the promissory note as Ex.P.1and proceeded with the trial. The promissory note was then used by the parties in examination and cross-examination. The record shows that the Trial Court, in its final judgment, after reviewing the evidence, held that the objection of non-admissibility of the promissory note was valid and dismissed the suit. This leads us to consider whether the procedure adopted by the Trial Court was correct and whether, in such circumstances, the promissory note could not be held to be admissible in evidence. To find the answer to these questions, a quick but careful look at Section 36 of the Stamp Act, 1899, will be helpful. Section 36 is in these terms:

       36. Admission of instrument where not to be questioned: Where an instrument has been admitted in evidence, such admission shall not, except as provided in section 61, be called in question at any stage of the same suit or proceeding on the ground that the instrument has not been duly stamped.

This section is categorical in its terms that when a document has once been admitted in evidence, such admission cannot be called into question at any stage of the suit or in proceedings, on the ground that the instrument has not been duly stamped. The only exception the section recognizes is the class of cases contemplated by Section 61, which is not material to the present moot. Section 36 does not admit other exceptions. It is now well settled that where a question as to the admissibility of a document is raised on the ground that it has not been stamped or has not been properly stamped, it has to be decided there and then when the document is tendered in evidence. Once the Court, rightly or wrongly, admits the document in evidence and allows the parties to use it in examination and cross-examination, so far as the parties are concerned, the matter is closed. It is, therefore, essential that parties to litigation, where such a controversy is raised, must be cautious, and the party challenging the admissibility of the document must be alert to see that the document is not admitted in evidence by the Court. The Court is also required to judicially determine the matter as soon as the document is tendered in evidence and before it is marked as an exhibit in the case. On the contrary, the record in this case discloses that, notwithstanding the defendant's objection, the promissory note was marked as Ex.P.1 under the signature of the Court. It is not, therefore, one of those cases where a document had been inadvertently admitted. So, once the promissory note had been marked as an exhibit and the trial had proceeded along the footing that the promissory note was made an exhibit, and had been used by the parties in the examination and cross-examination of their witnesses, then Section 36 of the Stamp Act, 1899, will come into operation. Inasmuch as the promissory note had been admitted in evidence, as aforesaid, it was not open to the Trial Court to exclude it from consideration while writing the final judgment, nor to the appellate Court. It is clarified that the admission of the document in terms of Section 36 of the Stamp Act, 1899, cannot be reviewed or revised by the same Court or a Court of superior jurisdiction.4 So, we hold that the approach was incorrect, and the Courts below had erred in law in refusing to admit the promissory note in evidence.

7.    It is clear from the above discussion that in the present circumstances of the case, the promissory note was admissible and could not be excluded from evidence. But was this enough for the plaintiff's claim to succeed? In our opinion, this was not sufficient, and he had yet to discharge another burden, and that was to prove that the promissory note was valid. This was because the defendant had pleaded non est factum to the promissory note. He had stated in his written statement that he had neither borrowed any money from the plaintiff nor executed any promissory note to repay the alleged amount. Explaining this, the defendant said that he was an illiterate person, the plaintiff was in the business of lending pesticides at double cost, and he thumbed several blank papers while procuring the pesticides from him, and it could be that the plaintiff had used these documents to make a promissory note. This statement indicates that the matter to be resolved here is not one where one person knowingly signs and delivers to another paper stamped in accordance with the law, either wholly blank or having written thereon an incomplete negotiable instrument, in order that it may be made or completed into a negotiable instrument. Therefore, the principle governing such cases, explained in different case law,5 would be inapplicable here.

8.    On the stance of the defendant stated above, the Trial Court framed issue No. 1, by which it was to prove whether the promissory note in question was a forged document. The initial onus to prove issue No.1 was upon the defendant. He discharged the onus to prove this negative fact and substantiated his allegations by making a statement, on oath, while appearing before the Trial Court as DW-4. The onus was then shifted to the plaintiff to prove that the transaction was bona fide and that the promissory note was legal6. The plaintiff appeared before the Trial Court as PW-2 and stated that he accompanied the defendant and the witnesses to the Court premises, where at the instance of the defendant, a deed writer named Bashir Ahmad scribed the promissory note, upon which the defendant had thumb-marked, and the witnesses had signed, and then he gave Rs.800,000 to the defendant in the presence of the witnesses. However, in his cross-examination, he admitted that he had no business relationship with the defendant or family ties with him. This statement causes eyebrows to be raised and gives a fillip to ponder how the plaintiff could lend a considerable amount to a stranger. This necessitates examining the circumstances of this case more carefully. Here, it must be noted that circumstantial evidence is sufficient when it enables the Court to make reasonable inferences about the ultimate facts in issue; it must be more than mere conjecture, speculation, or guess.7 With this principle in mind, we proceed. It is a matter of common knowledge that in the course of the ordinary conduct of such a transaction, a two-step procedure is followed. Firstly, the document is written on a paper (or the blanks of the printed document are filled in, as happened in the present case) and then it is signed or thumb-marked. This is a standard mode of deed writing. According to the plaintiff, the same procedure was adopted; however, the defendant alleges that the plaintiff, while giving him pesticides, had obtained his thumb mark on some blank papers on which he had made the promissory note, so what is to be seen whether the promissory note (Ex.P-1) was written on a paper on which the thumb-mark was already present. This can be easily deciphered by having a look at the promissory note. It is visible to the naked eye that the blanks of a printed form of a promissory note (Ex.P.1) are filled in with black ink, names of the parties and witnesses are also written with black ink, while the ink of the thumb mark is purple. It is also clear that black ink superimposes the purple ink of the thumb mark, and this depiction elucidates that the paper was first thumb-marked and then written upon. In case otherwise, the purple ink of the thumb mark would have overlapped the black ink of the writing. From such a circumstance, we can fairly and reasonably draw the only conclusion that the stance of the defendant that blank documents thumb-marked by him had been converted to a promissory note is correct. It is trite law that the witness may lie, but circumstances/ documents do not. There is nothing on record to suggest that the defendant had, expressly or impliedly, authorized the plaintiff to use the said blank papers as promissory note. We are, therefore, poised to hold that the promissory note was not executed in the manner described by the plaintiff, and the probable inference is that the promissory note was the result of knavery on the part of the plaintiff.

9.    We now focus on another aspect of the matter and examine whether the preponderance of evidence brought on record suggest a probability to conclude that any amount was paid to the defendant. Be it noted here, no doubt, special rules of evidence are provided for under the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881. Its section 118 says that until the contrary is proved, inter alia the presumption that every negotiable instrument was made for consideration shall be drawn. Such a presumption is only a prima facie, and may be displaced by raising a probable defence. Since the circumstantial evidence discussed above gave rise to a probable defence and created a reasonable doubt regarding the valid execution of the promissory note (Ex.P.1), the burden was shifted to the plaintiff to prove the payment of consideration of Rs.800,0008 and as such, we have to examine the plaintiff's evidence. The deed writer (PW-1) was one of the plaintiff's material witnesses. He, in his statement, admitted that though he wrote the amount of Rs.800,000, but this fact was reflected in his register by pencil. He was confronted with the various entries made in his register in black ink and asked as to why he wrote the amount of Rs.800,000 with pencil and not black ink that he had used for the promissory note, and he had no plausible explanation to give in his cross-examination. This statement created the first reason for suspicion. The next witness in the row was the plaintiff himself. He was PW.2. He, in his cross-examination categorically stated that he had no relation with the defendant, and neither was he in the business of selling pesticides. This statement reflects some awkward transactions and raises another severe doubt in the mind as to how the plaintiff could lend a huge sum of money to a person with whom he had no relation or acquaintance. The last witness of the plaintiff was Ghulam Hussain (PW.3). This witness stated that a sum of Rs.800,000 was given to the defendant in the form of notes having denominations of 500 and 1000 in the Court premises. Again, this is an unusual act and is another factor for wariness because, normally, such dealing would take place in private, where money can safely and securely be handed over and counted by the other party; this clearly cannot be done in Court premises, on the stall of a stamp vendor. The last but not least aspect of the matter is that two persons were named as witnesses in the promissory note (Ex.P.1), but only Ghulam Hussain (PW.3) was produced, while the other witness, Khalil Ahmad, was not produced in the Court. No explanation was made available for the atypical circumstances described above. Such evidence that draws a veil over truth or does not explain the true intent and purpose of that transaction, which does not take place in the manner in which it is done in the ordinary course of human conduct, never inspires confidence and, thus, does not serve to persuade the court to tip the scales in favour of a person who is burdened to prove the fact. Given this scenario, we return our findings against the plaintiff and declare that the payment of any amount to the defendant has not been proved. And so, as the prefatory adage suggests, the only fortune that the plaintiff had was to get the thumb mark of the defendant on the blank papers, but his ploy could not set sail in Court.

10.  The above discussion concludes that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the promissory note was not forged; consequently, he was not entitled to the decree as he sought in his plaint, for contemporaneous payment was also not proved. Therefore, we are not inclined to disturb the dismissal of the suit, not for the reasons given by the Courts below, but for what we have stated above.

11.  This appeal fails, and accordingly, it is dismissed.

MWA/N-18/SC                                                                                   Appeal dismissed.

            (On appeal against the judgment dated 22.10.2021 passed by the Lahore High Court, Lahore in Civil Revisions Nos. 3332 and 3333 of 2010)

(a) Contract Act (IX of 1872)---

----Ss. 11 & 12---Unsoundness of mind---Proof---Registered sale deed and exchange deed executed by plaintiffs' father challenged on the plea that their father had been suffering from paralysis for a long time; his hands and other limbs were affected with tremors and trembles; he could not relieve himself of his natural urges, and even to talk he used to express himself in gestures; and because of his illness he was very weak and could not walk around---Validity---Crucial point of determination in case a plea of insanity or unsoundness of mind is taken is the time of execution of the contract---In the present case, the disputed documents were registered in 1996 while plaintiffs' father (executant) died in 1998 and thus the plaintiffs were to clearly state when their father had an attack of paralysis; did this occur before the documents were executed or after it?---This was a material fact that ought to have been disclosed in the plaint, but was conspicuously omitted, and since the plaintiffs could not go beyond the scope of their pleadings, they could not even be allowed to put in any statement or material to rectify the omission during the course of evidence, and as such, it would be fair to hold that the plaintiffs had failed to discharge their burden of pleadings, and tumbled at the first stage of the trial of their claim---Best evidence of the father's mental disorder could have been the medical attendant (hakeem) who treated him at the relevant time---However said physician (hakeem) was not examined, nor was any explanation furnished why he was not presented---One of the plaintiffs, who was also son of the executant, stated in his examination-in-chief that his father was ill and suffering from paralysis; but he did not say that his father was mentally challenged---However, during cross-examinations he said that his father had tremor in his body before his death, and that in the year 1995-1996, his father had sold his other land to another person---Such statement proved that the father (executant), though ill, was of sound mind and able to look after his own affairs at the time of registration of the disputed sale deed and exchange deed---Burden of proving their father's unsoundness in the first place was on the plaintiffs and when they failed to do so, the Court could not cure that infirmity by reading the statement of the defendants' witness, such as the lambardar who had verified the father's thumb impression on the disputed documents---In the ordinary course of life, the said witness (lambardar) was not supposed to have any information about the father's health and the details of his medication---Contents of the disputed documents and of the statement of the witnesses, particularly of the Sub-Registrar did not support the inference, drawn by the High Court, that the father did not understand the value of the property he was selling or of which he was exchanging---Even if it was accepted that the father had paralysis and tremors, it cannot be said that the father did not comprehend the nature and effect of the disputed documents at the time of their writing and registration---Suits for declaration filed by the plaintiffs were rightly dismissed by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court---Appeals were allowed and impugned judgments and decrees of High Court were set-aside.

(b) Contract Act (IX of 1872)---

(c) Specific Relief Act (I of 1877)---

----S. 42---Suit for declaration---Registered sale deed and exchange deed---Plea of fraud---Not established---Sale deed and exchange deed executed by plaintiffs' father was challenged on the plea that their father was unable to walk due to illness, so the defendants produced another person before the Sub-Registrar and got the disputed documents registered fraudulently, and that the Sub-Registrar did not mention their father's identity card number on the disputed documents---Validity---Neither the plaintiffs in their plaint nor any of their witnesses had alleged that the Sub-Registrar was in cahoots with the defendants---Disputed documents were registered by the Sub-Registrar/Naib Tehsildar, and he was produced as a witness by the defendants; he clearly stated in his examination-in-chief that the disputed documents were presented before him by the father himself, and he was identified by the lambardar, the statements of witnesses were recorded, and the father admitted that consideration amount had been received, and also acknowledged the exchange of land---During cross-examination, the Sub-Registrar/Naib Tehsildar admitted that the father's identity card number was not mentioned on the disputed documents, but stated that if there was no identity card number, the document was registered on the identification of a proper person, which included lambardar, councillors etc.---Plaintiffs' father was identified by the lambardar, who appeared in Court and confirmed it---Even without so, the father's identification would not have been difficult to ascertain as he was a lambardar himself, and generally the Sub-Registrar/Naib Tehsildar knows the lambardar of his area---Thus, in the given circumstances, merely on the basis of non-recording of the father's identity card number, it could not be said that any other person had appeared instead of the father at the time of registration of the disputed documents, and any fraud was committed---Since the plaintiffs, had failed to discharge their initial burden, it did not shift to the defendants to prove the transactions---Defendants not only produced all the witnesses to the disputed documents, the identifier, and the Sub-Registrar, but also produced all their records from the custody of the Record-Keeper before the Trial Court and from the statements of all of them, the transactions recorded in the disputed documents were proved---Suits for declaration filed by the plaintiffs were rightly dismissed by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court---Appeals were allowed and impugned judgments and decrees of High Court were set-aside.

JUDGMENT

       SHAHID WAHEED, J.---These two appeals are by the defendants and arise out of two declaratory suits and the relief claimed therein was first dismissed by the trial Court, and then on appeal by the first appellate Court, but on revision, this was accepted and the High Court issued decrees in favour of the plaintiffs, and we wish to consider them together in this judgment for not only the matter in issue in both of them are directly and substantially the same, but it is also between the same parties, who are litigating under the same title.

2.    The cause for brining both the suits is related to two parcels of land situated in Mouza Ramdiana, Tehsil Bhalwal, District Sargodha. The subject matter of Civil Appeal No.1731 of 2021 is 162 1/2 kanals of land whereas Civil Appeal No.1732 of 2021 covers 98 kanals and 4 marlas. These two parcels of land were owned by Noora. He was lambardar of the village and had a brother Nazira. On 12th of September 1996, Noora sold his 162-1/2 kanals of land to Nazir's four sons vide registered sale-deed No.206, while the other land was exchanged with Nazir's 49 kanals and 3 marlas vide registered exchange-deed No.207 dated 15th of September 1996. Both these transactions were brought to the notice of the Revenue Officer who entered them in the record on 13th of October 1996 under mutation Nos.379 and 383 respectively.

3.    Noora died on 15th of December 1998 and thereafter his legal heirs (respondents Nos.1 to 3 herein) instituted two suits for declaration of rights, title and for cancellation of the above- mentioned two registered deeds as illegal. The suit challenging the sale-deed was against Nazira's four sons, while the suit questioning the exchange-deed was against Nazira. In both the suits, the Province of Punjab through the Collector was also made a defendant (herein respondent No.4). It is a matter of record that Nazira also passed away while the litigation was going on and as such his legal heirs joined the proceedings. They are now the appellants before us. Hereinafter, for the sake of convenience, both the aforesaid documents will be referred to as the disputed documents, the present appellants as defendants, and the present respondents Nos.1 to 3 as plaintiffs.

4.    Before proceedings further in the matter we would like to pause here to state that in the given circumstances the plaintiffs were faced with two presumptions. The first was that while executing the disputed documents, the executant i.e. their father Noora was in sound disposing mind. And the second was that the Registrar had registered the disputed documents by completing the procedure according to the law. Both these presumptions were rebuttable and to do so the plaintiffs had to discharge a threefold burden. One, the pleading burden whereby plaintiffs had to set forth all material facts and particulars of illegality in their pleadings in order for them to be in issue. Two, the burden of producing evidence and, three, the burden of persuasion. Let us now see how each of the above two types of presumptions is rebutted by the plaintiffs.

5.    First of all, we look at what the plaintiffs have stated in their plaint about their father's sanity, what evidence they have presented about it and how they have been able to persuade that their plea is accepted. The plaintiffs pleaded that their father, Noora, had been suffering from paralysis for a long time, his hands and other limbs were affected with tremors and trembles, he could not relieve himself of his natural urges, even to talk, he also used to express himself in gestures, and because of his illness he was very weak and could not walk around. These assertions indicate that the plaintiffs had purportedly taken the plea of insanity or unsoundness of mind to rebut the first presumption. Be it noted that plea of insanity or unsoundness of mind is an exception and the standard of proof for such a plea is somewhat higher than that of normal proof in civil cases. In the light of this legal position, it is to be seen whether the aforesaid assertions, even if admitted to be true, meet the requirements of law, and are sufficient to hold that the plaintiffs have successfully discharged their burden of pleadings. So for as the legal provisions taking care of such a situation is concerned, section 12 of the Contract Act, 1872 may be referred to, which is extracted herein below:-

       "What is a sound mind for the purposes of contracting:---A person is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract if, at the time when he makes it , he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests.

       A person who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, may make a contract when he is of sound mind.

       A person who is usually of sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a contract when he is of unsound mind.

Illustrations

(a)   A patient in a lunatic asylum, who is at intervals of sound mind, may contract during those intervals.

(b)   A sane man, who is delirious form fever or who is so drunk that he cannot understand the terms of a contract or form a rational judgment as to its effect on his interest, cannot contract whilst such delirium or drunkenness lasts."

6.    A bare perusal of the said provision of law would bring us to a conclusion that the crucial point of determination in case a plea of insanity or unsoundness of mind is taken is the time of execution of the contract. In the present case, the disputed documents were registered in 1996 while Noora (executant) died in 1998 and thus the plaintiffs were to clearly state when their father (Noora) had an attack of paralysis. Did this occur before the documents were executed or after it? This was a material fact that ought to have been disclosed in the plaint, but was conspicuously omitted, and since the plaintiffs could not go beyond the scope of their pleadings, they could not even be allowed to put in any statement or material to rectify the omission during the course of evidence1, and as such, it would be fair to hold that the plaintiffs had failed to discharge their burden of pleadings, and tumbled at the first stage of the trial of their claim.

7.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, to meet the ends of justice, we proceed to consider what evidence the plaintiffs had adduced in support of their position and to what extent they had been able to prove it. Before going into this, it seems appropriate to point out that the best evidence of Noora's mental disorder could have been the medical attendant who treated him at the relevant time. Evidence of layman especially relatives like son, daughter, wife etc, may be relevant, but being biased and exaggerated it cannot be conclusive2. In the present case, it was stated by the plaintiffs in their plaint and Umar Hayat (PW1), son of Noora, also admitted that Noora was under the treatment of Hakeem, but he was not examined, nor was any explanation furnished why he was not presented? We consider this to be a serious flaw in the plaintiffs' case.

8.    That apart, we find that three witnesses were produced on behalf of the plaintiffs. The first witness is Umer Hayat (PW.1), Noora's son, who is also one of the plaintiffs. He only said in his examination-in-chief that his father was ill and suffering from paralysis. He did not say that his father was mentally challenged. However, during cross-examinations he said that his father had tremor in his body before his death, and that in the year 1995-1996, Noora had sold his other one-and-a half acre land to a person named Mohabbat Khan. This statement proves that Noora, though ill, was of sound mind and able to look after his own affairs at the time of registration of the disputed documents. In the light of this statement of the plaintiffs, the additional information of their other witnesses about Noora's physical and mental health was of no value and could not be taken into account3, and accordingly the District Courts rightly did, and reached a correct conclusion.

9.    It is pertinent to mention here at this stage that Muhammad Khan was lambardar and he had verified Noora's thumb impression on the disputed documents. He was produced by the defendants as DW-3 before the trial Court. During cross-examination, he said that he did not know that Noora had suffered paralysis second time and that Noora was taking medication to treat tremors. On the basis of this statement, it could not be concluded that Noora was not of sound mind, for, the burden of proving Noora's unsoundness in the first place was on the plaintiffs and when they failed to do so, the Court could not cure that infirmity by reading the statement of the defendants' witness, secondly, that the denial of a particular fact for want of its knowledge by a witness cannot be said to be an admission of fact, and thirdly, that in the ordinary course of life, the said witness was not supposed to have any information about Noora's health and the details of his medication. We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that the High Court has misdirected itself in taking a view different from that which we have expressed above.

10.  Looking at the matter from another angle, it is worth noting that a contract of sale, like any other contract, would be vitiated if the consent of either party is given by a person of unsound mind as provided in section 11 of the Contract Act, 1872. Under section 12 of that Act, a person is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making the contract, if at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interest. A person of unsound mind is thus not necessarily a lunatic or insane. It is sufficient if the person is incapable of judging the consequences of his acts. Taking into account this position of law, the question for us to consider is whether the deceased Noora was capable of appreciating that he was transferring his property to the defendants. The contents of the disputed documents and of the statement of the witnesses, particularly of the Sub-Registrar do not support the inference, drawn by the High Court, that Noora did not understand the value of the property he was selling or of which he was exchanging. We have noted above that Umar Hayat, son of the deceased Noora, has only stated in his testimony that Noora had paralysis and was suffering from tremors. He had not said that the paralysis had also affected his father's mental strength. It is now well recognized that a permanent paralytic affection, though it somewhat saps the physical energy of the sufferer, does not necessarily impairs his mental power to such an extent to render him incapable of transacting business4. Suffice it to say in this scenario that even if it is accepted that Noora had paralysis and tremors, it cannot be said that Noora did not comprehend the nature and effect of the disputed documents at the time of their writing and registration. We would, therefore, hold that the deceased Noora did possess a sound disposing mind for the making of the disputed documents.

11.  We now turn our attention to the second aspect of the case which relates to the execution, correctness, and truthfulness of the disputed documents. One of these documents is a sale-deed while the other is an exchange-deed, and in respect of both, the Sub-Registrar has issued a certificate under the Registration Act, 1908 that they have been registered by completing all the prescribed procedure. It is important to stress here that registration of a document is a solemn act to be performed in the presence of a competent officer appointed to act as Registrar, whose duty it is to attend to the parties during the registration and see that the proper persons are present, are competent to act, and are identified to his satisfaction; and all things done before him in his official capacity and verified by his signature will be presumed to be done duly and in order. Therefore, the certificate endorsed on the conveyance deed by the Registering Officer under Section 60 of the Registration Act, 1908 is a relevant piece of evidence to presume that the deed is valid in law5. In view thereof, in the present case, the initial onus to rebut the said presumption was on the plaintiffs, who had challenged the documents.

12.  The stand of the plaintiffs was that their father was unable to walk due to illness, so the defendants produced another person before the Sub-Registrar and got the disputed documents registered. Based on this allegation, they argued that the registration of the disputed documents was a fraud. In support of it, they say that if Noora had appeared in person, the Sub-Registrar would have written his identity card number on the disputed documents, which was not done. We do not agree with this. It may first be noted that neither the plaintiffs in their plaint nor any of their witnesses have alleged that the Sub-Registrar was in cahoots with the defendants. In this context the statement of the Sub-Registrar, who is a public servant, becomes very important. The disputed documents were registered by Rana Ghulam Mustafa, Sub-Registrar/Naib Tehsildar, and he was produced as a witness by the defendants. He clearly stated in his examination-in-­chief that the disputed documents were presented before him by Noora himself, and he was identified by Muhammad Khan, Lambardar, the statements of witnesses were recorded, and Noora admitted that consideration amount had been received, and also acknowledged the exchange of land. During cross-examination, he admitted that Noora's identity card number was not mentioned on the disputed documents. In response to a question, he said that if there is no identity card number, the document is registered on the identification of a proper person, which includes lambardar, councillors etc. It must be noted here that it is not the case of the plaintiffs that this statement was wrong in law. Responding to another question, he said that it is incorrect that Noora did not appear before him. In the light of this statement, when we examine the disputed documents, it is revealed that Noora was identified by Muhammad Khan, lambardar, who appeared in the Court and confirmed it. Even without so, we think, Noora's identification would not have been difficult to ascertain as he was a lambardar himself, and generally the Sub-Registrar/Naib Tehsildar knows the lambardar of his area. Thus, in the given circumstances, merely on the basis of non-recording of Noora's identity card number, it cannot be said that any other person had appeared instead of Noora at the time of registration of the disputed documents, and any fraud was committed. Since the plaintiffs, had failed to discharge their initial burden, it did not shift to the defendants to prove the transactions6. Nevertheless, we find that the defendants not only produced all the witnesses to the disputed documents, the identifier, and the Sub-Registrar, but also produced all their records from the custody of the Record-Keeper before the trial Court and from the statements of all of them, the transactions recorded in the disputed documents are proved.

13.  It is settled that the standard of proof required in a civil dispute is preponderance of probabilities and not beyond reasonable doubt. In absence of any tangible evidence produced by the plaintiffs to support the plea of fraud, it does not take the matter further. Rather, in this case the testimony of the attesting witness, identifier and other independent witnesses, such as, the Sub-Registrar and the Record-Keeper (Reader to the Sub-Registrar) plainly support the case of the defendants. That evidence dispels the doubt if any; and tilt the balance in favour of the defendants.

14.  Suffice it to observe that since the plaintiffs could not establish the existence of fraud, it must follow that their suits have ex-facie no merit.

15.  In view of the foregoing discussion, we hold that the trial Court and the first appellate Court had appreciated the evidence properly and that view being a possible view, the High Court ought not to have disputed the same in revision and that too on surmises and conjectures.

16.  In the result, the present appeals are allowed and the impugned judgments and decrees passed by the High Court are set aside. The judgments and decrees passed by the first appellate Court are hereby restored. No order as to costs. Pending applications, if any, are disposed of.

MWA/M-31/SC                                                                                  Order accordingly.

JUDGMENT

       SHAHID WAHEED, J.---This appeal with the leave of this Court is by the defendants and raises two very simple questions, whether Mst. Nooran Bibi and Mst Fateh Khatoon were sisters of Mohammad son of Khanoo and whether they were rightly excluded from the inheritance of Mohammad. Mst. Nooran Bibi and Mst. Fateh Khatoon (represented by their legal heirs) said that their late brother Mohammad was married to Mst. Zohra daughter of Janoo but had no children and died issueless before 1947 and after his death, according to custom, all his property (now suit property) devolved on his wife as limited owner, later Mohammad's wife remarried, on which the suit property was to be transferred to all the heirs of Mohammad including his sisters, but on the contrary, the defendants illegally got it transferred to their name only vide mutation No.675 dated 29th September 1992, and thus, the sisters were deprived of their right. Based on the above-stated facts, the suit was brought before the Civil Court seeking a declaration that Mst. Nooran Bibi and Mst. Fateh Khatoon being real sisters of Mohammad were entitled to get their share from the inheritance of Mohammad and mutation No.675 was void. On the other hand, the stance of the defendants was that Mohammad had no sister, so the claim of the plaintiffs was baseless.

2.    On pleadings, the trial Court framed as many as ten issues but out of them issues Nos. 8 and 9 were important. Issue No.8 was whether mutation No.675 dated 29th September, 1992 was void, while issue No.9 was whether Mst. Nooran Bibi and Mst. Fateh Khatoon, were real sisters of Mohammad and died after him? Both parties presented their evidence on these issues. Sultan (PW-1), Manzoor Hussain (PW-2) and Khan Mohammad alias Khanoo, one of the plaintiffs, (PW-3) appeared from the side of the plaintiffs and their counsel in his statement tendered some documents, i.e. copy of Jamabandi for the year 1993-1994 (Exh.P-1), copy of Jamabandi for the year 1984-85 (Exh.P-2), copy of mutation No.675 (Exh.P-3), copy of amended appeal (Exh.P-4), copy of orders of ADCC (Exh.P-5), copy of mutation No.2006 (EXh.P-6) and copy of birth certificate of Mst. Nooran Bibi (Exh.P-7). The defendants in their evidence produced Habib (DW-1), one of the defendants, and. Ghulam Mohammad (DW-2). Their counsel in his statement tendered copy of mutation No.2004 (Exh.D-1), copy of mutation No.2005 (Exh.D-2), Copy of mutation No.675 (Exh.D-3), copy of mutation No.2005 (Exh.D-4), copy of plaint (Exh.D-5), copy of orders (Exh.D-6), copy of pedigree-table (Exh.D-7), copy of mutation No.1837 (Exh.D-8) and copy of mutation No.1836 (Exh.D-9).

3.    After examining the statements of witnesses and the documents, the trial Court concluded that Mst. Nooran Bibi and Mst. Fateh Khatoon were the sisters of Mohammad. Accordingly, the trial Court through its judgment dated 21st April 2001, issued a decree in favour of the plaintiffs.

4.    On appeal, the Additional District Judge re-examined the evidence and returned following findings:

       "10. The respondents also examined one Manzoor Hussain son of Khan Muhammad as P.W.2. He has deposed that he knows both the parties; that he also knows Muhammad deceased. Though he has admitted that said Muhammad deceased has died before attaining his age of puberty, yet he is the Lumberdar of village Rohila Gharbi, so would be more relevant person. He has stated that Mst. Nooran Bibi and Fateh Bibi were sisters of Muhammad deceased, while respondents are legal heirs of those ladies and are entitled to get the inheritance. Khan Muhammad alias Khanoo one of the respondents has appeared as P.W.3. He has deposed that he knows Muhammad deceased, who was his maternal uncle; that name of his maternal grandfather is Khanoo; that his maternal grandfather was survived by one son namely Muhammad and two daughters Nooran Bibi and Fateh Mai; that Fateh Mai is his real mother; that when Muhammad deceased died before partition, the estate was mutated in favour of Zohran Bibi his widow as limited owner; that Mst. Zohran Bibi contracted second marriage, so mutation of inheritance of Muhammad deceased was entered and attested vide mutation No.675 in favour of Mst. Nooran Bibi and Fateh Mai etc. the widow; that the said mutation was later on cancelled by Consolidation Officer and appeal was preferred before the Additional Deputy Commissioner Mianwali, where the matter was referred to Civil Court. He has contended that in pursuance of the reviewed mutation, they have been deprived from inheritance of Muhammad deceased, while they are entitled to inherit him.

       11. The learned counsel for the appellants though have conducted the cross-examination on the P.Ws yet after having been giving the anxious consideration. I am of the considered opinion that nothing favourable has come on the record for the appellants. In cross-examination, the case of the respondents has been improved, where it is established that Khanoo was survived by one Muhammad as son, Mst. Nooran Mai and Fateh Mai as daughters. At the advent of death of Muhammad deceased, who was issueless, the estate was mutated in favour of Zohran Mai, his widow; being limited owner. When she contracted the second marriage, the estate would be reverted to the legal heirs of last male owner and was required to be mutated according to the shares of the legal heirs in the Muhammadan Law of Inheritance.

       .........................

       .........................

       .........................

       20. In view of oral as well as documentary evidence produced by the respondents, which is cogent, strong and confidence inspiring that Mst. Nooran Bibi and Fateh Khatoon were the real sisters of Muhammad deceased, the pedigree table appearing on the mutation No.1837 dated 26.03.43 and mutation No.1836 dated 26.03.43 Ex.D-8 Ex.D-9 respectively would not be sufficient to exclude Mst. Nooran Bibi and Fateh Khatoon from the inheritance of Muhammad deceased. It appears that both these mutations have also been sanctioned incorrectly and without any lawful authority".

       Based on the above-cited finding the appeal of the defendants was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 19th July, 2006 and that was maintained by the High Court through its judgment and decree dated 21st November, 2006.

5.    Now the defendants through this appeal submit before us that the three documents produced by them viz. that pedigree-table (Exh.D-7), mutation No. 1837 (Exh.D-8) and mutation No.1836 (Exh.D-9) have not been properly examined by all the Courts, and thus, their decrees are not valid. They say that it is clear from these documents that Mst. Nooran and Mst. Fateh Khatoon were not sisters of Mohammad and mutation No.675 (Exh.D-3) was rightly sanctioned.

6.    We are not impressed by the arguments of the defendants. They sans merit. It is now well settled that pedigree-table alone and by itself is not a proof of relationship unless such relationship is proved through witnesses or other independent evidence. If any reference to this effect is needed, the case of Bashir Ahmad through L.Rs. v. Muhammad Hussain and another (2010 SCMR 822) may be cited. A perusal of the evidence available on record indicates that the defendants produced Ghulam Muhammad (DW-2) to prove the pedigree-table (Ex.D.7). The statement of this witness, in our view cannot be believed because he did not state what special means of knowledge he had about the relationship of the parties to the suit. Since no other independent witness appeared on behalf of the defendants to prove the contents of pedigree-table (Ex:D.7), the simple production of pedigree-table (Ex.D.7) through the counsel without any corroborative evidence was not sufficient to conclude that Mst. Nooran Bibi and Mst. Fateh Khatoon were not sisters of Muhammad.

7.    As regards the other two documents i.e. mutation No.1836 (Exh.D-9) and mutation No.1837 (Exh.D.-8), it is suffice to say that according to principle settled by this Court in the cases reported as Mst. Hameeda Begum and others v. Mst. Irshad Begum and others (2007 SCMR 996), Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Defence and another v. Jaffar Khan and others (PLD 2010 SC 604) and Province of the Punjab through Collector, Shikhupura and others v. Syed Ghazanfar Ali Shah and others (2017 SCMR 172) the document should be produced in the evidence by the party itself and a fair opportunity should be given to the opposite party to cross-examine the same, as such, the said two documents produced by the defendants counsel in his statement could not be taken into consideration.

8.    After examining the evidence available on the record, we are not persuaded to take a different view than the three Courts, and we hereby agree with their findings that Mst. Nooran Bibi and Mst. Fateh Khatoon were sisters of deceased Mohammad and were illegally excluded from the inheritance of their brother, and, as a consequence, mutation No.675 dated 29th of September, 1992 was not valid.

9.    In the result, this appeal fails and accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.

MWA/R-1/SC                                                                                     Appeal dismissed.

JUDGMENT

       SHAHID WAHEED, J.---The variant decree drawn by the Islamabad High Court has impelled the plaintiff to appeal before us to restore the decree issued to him by the trial Court in his suit for specific performance of the contract.

2.    It will conduce to analytical clarity of the questions to be determined by us, if we relate the facts giving rise to them, and to do so, we deem it appropriate to make it clear that we will refer to the parties by their array in the trial Court, and secondly, since this appeal excites two questions, one of which does not ordinarily arise, while the other is a standard feature of such suits and the answer to it helps to determine the entitlement of the plaintiff to get a decree in his favour, we will bifurcate the facts into two sets, as to find out a clear and a definite answer to the questions.

3.    The first question, to be decided by us, will automatically come to the fore on stating the relevant facts, which are not in dispute, so without further ado, we proceed to the facts. The plaintiff, who is appellant before us, was interested to purchase the property (i.e. industrial plot No.88, measuring 2444.41 Sq. Yds, Industrial Area, I-9, Islamabad), owned by Mrs. Zahida Parveen Ahmed, who was, at all the relevant points of time, a non-resident Pakistani living in the United Kingdom, but for the affairs of her property, including its sale, had authorized her mother, namely, Begum Maroof Ahmed through a registered Power of Attorney dated 15th of November, 2002 [Ex.D-4(1)]. The plaintiff therefore negotiated the sale with the Attorney. As a result of negotiations, on 18th of December, 2002, the Attorney through a written contract (Ex.P.3) agreed to sell the property to the plaintiff for a consideration of Rs.7,100,000/- (seventy one lac rupees only). Out of this consideration, a sum of Rs.250,000/- (two lac fifty thousand rupees only) was paid by the plaintiff to the Attorney in presence of the witnesses and it was agreed that the balance amount would be payable on or before 18th of March, 2003, but it was not paid and this led to a dispute between the parties. On 15th of September, 2003, the plaintiff brought his suit before the trial Court seeking specific performance of the contract (Ex.P.3). In his suit he joined the Attorney, namely, Begum Maroof Ahmed as defendant No.1 and the Capital Development Authority as defendant No.2. These two defendants resisted the suit by filing their separate written statements. On the pleadings, the trial Court by order dated 24th of January, 2004, framed issues and called upon the parties to adduce their evidence. The statement of the plaintiff's two witnesses, i.e. PW.1 and PW.2 was recorded on 24th of January, 2007. At this stage the plaintiff realized his omission and thought it necessary to implead the property owner as a defendant. He therefore applied to the trial Court on 11th of October, 2007, under Order I, Rule 10 of the C.P.C. to implead the owner as a defendant, so as to avoid any formal defect in the proceedings. The trial Court allowed the plaintiff to amend the plaint by adding the property owner. Needless to indicate here that the owner of the property being a party to the contract through her Attorney was a necessary party to the suit for the specific performance of the contract1 because in her absence no decree could be passed, and as such, she ought to have been included in it. In light of this position of law, the trial Court was justified in allowing the plaintiff to bring the owner of the property on record. The order of the trial Court was dated 25th of October, 2007, and in pursuance thereof, an amended plaint was filed on 30th of October, 2007, making the owner named Zahida Parveen Ahmed as defendant No. 1-A. Upon filing of the amended plaint by the plaintiff, notices were ordered to be issued to the newly added defendant No. 1-A. A memo was filed before the trial Court by the counsel of defendant No. 1- A, on 24th of November, 2007, which provided that she was residing in England and sought time to submit a duly attested power of attorney. However, she failed to do so, even after given several opportunities, and therefore, was proceeded against ex-parte by the trial Court and her defence was struck off.

4.    Given the circumstances stated above, the first question, for our consideration, is whether the suit to the extent of owner of the property, who was subsequently added as defendant No. 1-A, was within time, and if not, could it be maintained against the other defendants. The answer to the first part of this question is not difficult to find and we do not even need to wade through the various provisions of the law. Be it noted that the suit in which defendant No. 1-A was added was for the specific performance of the contract dated 18th of December, 2002 (Ex.P.3), which had fixed a date of 18th of March, 2003, for the performance. As such, according to Article 113 of the first schedule to the Limitation Act, 1908, the plaintiff had a period of three years from the said date of performance to bring a suit against Zahida Parveen Ahmed, defendant No. 1-A. She was not included as a defendant in the original plaint, however, since she was a necessary party being an owner of the property and party to the contract, the importance of adding her was felt during the recording of evidence, and to rectify this omission, permission was sought from the trial Court, and it was granted on 25th of October, 2007, and accordingly amended plaint adding her was filed on 30th of October, 2007. Now, in terms of Section 22 of the Limitation Act, 1908, the suit would, as regards defendant No. 1-A, be deemed to have been instituted from the point of time when she was so made a party, and that would come to 30th of October, 2007. Undoubtedly by that date a period of three years, computing it from the date of performance of the contract, that is, 18th of March, 2003, had expired and therefore the suit, to her extent was not within time.2

5.    We now enter upon the later part of the first question, whether the plaintiff could maintain a suit against the Attorney for specific performance of the contract, particularly when it was not within time to the extent of the necessary party, that is to say, the owner of the property (defendant No.1-A). It is not denied that defendant No.1-A had authorized her mother, who is defendant No.1, through a registered power of attorney [Ex.D-4(1)], to sell her property. It is now well recognized that a power of attorney is the creation of the agency whereby the grantor (the principal) authorizes the grantee (the agent) to do the acts specified therein on behalf of the grantor (the principal), which, when executed will be binding on the grantor (the principal) as if done by him.3 As such, it is ordinarily the function and the duty of an agent in his contractual dealings for his principal to act not only for and on account of his principal, but in the principal's name. The recitals of the contract (Ex.P.3) and the evidence brought on record suggest that defendant No.1, acting as an agent/attorney, had disclosed the identity of her principal (defendant No.1-A) and intended to impose the obligations of the contract (Ex.P.3) upon defendant No.1-A and also secured its advantages to her. Defendant No.1 had no beneficial interest in the contract (Ex.P.3). It is a general rule that where a contract is made for and on account of the principal and in his name, and the agent has no beneficial interest in the contract, the right of action upon the contract is in the principal alone and the agent neither can sue and be sued upon it.4 This principal is also embedded in Section 230 of the Contract Act, 1872. We, therefore, are poised to conclude that defendant No.1, as an agent/attorney, acted for and on behalf of defendant No.1-A and thus suit for specific performance of the contract was not maintainable against her, especially when the plaintiff had added defendant No.1-A after the prescribed period of limitation,5 and secondly, her status in it, at best, could only be regarded as a proper party and, in terms of Section 27 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, specific performance of the contract (Ex.P.3) also could not be sought against her.

6.    We will now touch upon the second question involved in this case, whether the plaintiff had been able to prove that at all material time he had been ready and willing to perform his obligations arising out of the contract (Ex.P.3). Such a question is a standard feature of the suit seeking a decree for the specific performance of the contract, and the answer to it not only contributes to determine the parties' rights but also provides a base for the Court in exercising its equitable jurisdiction. Determination of the readiness and willingness to perform the obligations emanating from the contract is a calculus for ascertaining the bona fide of the parties. As the initial burden is always on the plaintiff, he must first state in his plaint the facts demonstrating his readiness and willingness to perform his part of the contract and then prove it by producing convincing and reliable evidence. Mindful of these prefatory observations, we move on to the facts relating to this second question and the evidence on record. Before going any further, we wish to say that since this question is diverse, we will deal with it in three parts.

7.    It would be appropriate first to examine how the plaintiff discharged his pleading burden. The law governing this aspect of the matter is provided in Forms Nos. 47 and 48 in Appendix-A of the First Schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. According to para-2 of Form 47, the plaintiff was to state in the plaint that he had applied to the defendants specifically to perform the contract on their part, but the defendants had not done so. Similarly, per para-2 of Form 48, the plaintiff was required to state in his plaint that on such and such date, he tendered an amount to the defendants and demanded a transfer of the property.6 Thus, in his suit for specific performance, the plaintiff ought to have pleaded and proved his readiness and willingness to perform his obligations under the contract (Ex.P.3). There is no denying that according to contract conditions, the plaintiff was to pay the balance of Rs.6,850,000/- to the defendants on or before 18th of March, 2023, subject to the registration/ completion of property transfer documents by the defendants in his favour. The plaintiff did not pay this amount. The plaintiff's stance was that he had been ready to pay the balance, but, defendant No.1 procrastinated the matter and delayed the completion of the transfer documents, which led him to institute the suit. A perusal of the evidence suggests that the plaintiff could not prove his narrative. His witness PW.3, namely, Abdul Raoof, who was UDC in the Estate Management Department of the Capital Development Authority [(CDA)/defendant No.2], in his cross-examination, admitted that all CDA's formalities for issuance of completion certificate had been complied with and as regards the property there was no failure on the part of defendants Nos.1 and 1-A. It alludes that it was not the defendants but the plaintiff who was negligent in performing his duty. It is one way of looking at the plaintiff's default in fulfilling his part of the obligation under the contract (Ex.P.3).

8.    Notwithstanding the above, there is another facet of the second question that provides us additional ground to decline the plaintiff's appeal. There was no doubt that the plaintiff had to prove that he was always ready and willing to perform his obligations in terms of the contract, so it was also necessary for him to go into the witness box and give evidence that he had all along been ready and willing to perform his part of the contract, and would even subject himself to cross-examination on that issue. On the contrary, in this case, the plaintiff did not appear as a witness but instead produced his Attorney, Tasawar Hussain, as PW.2. This was a material irregularity which vitiated the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff could not examine in his place, his Attorney who did not have personal knowledge about his readiness and willingness. His attorney was also irrelevant to the issue because he was neither involved in the negotiations culminated into the contract (Ex.P.3), nor signed the contract nor was he a witness to it. What is more, readiness and willingness refer to the state of mind and conduct of the vendee, as also his capacity and preparedness on the other. One without the other is not sufficient. Therefore, the Attorney (PW.2), who had no personal knowledge, could not give evidence about plaintiff's readiness and willingness to perform the obligations in terms of the contract (Ex.P.3). In the wake of the above, the Attorney's evidence must be excluded from consideration. If we do so, we do not find any other piece of evidence to accept the claim of the plaintiff that he had been ready and willing to perform obligations in terms of the contract. This, indeed, is fatal to the plaintiff's suit.

9.    From whatever angle we examine this case, we do not find anything on which we can base the plaintiff's claim as valid. Even if we ignore the pitfalls mentioned earlier, one more remain and that too is deadly. In a suit for specific performance, the vendee also has to prove that at the appointed time, he had sufficient money with which he could pay the balance amount, or if he did not have such money, he made such arrangements, with the help of which, he could pay as promised. In this case, the contents of the plaintiff's plaint and the evidence brought by him on record are completely silent on this essential element of the suit for specific performance of the contract. In other words, the plaintiff had failed to prove his readiness to perform his obligations of the contract, therefore, his claim could not be allowed, and as such, we think, the High Court has rightly dismissed it.

10.  Having regard to our above findings, the plaintiff is bound to fail in this appeal. We, therefore, dismiss this appeal and maintain the decree of the High Court.

MWA/I-9/SC                                                                                      Appeal dismissed.

JUDGMENT

       SHAHID WAHEED, J.----This petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is of the plaintiff, and arises from her suit seeking decree for possession of the land belonging to the defendants, respondents Nos. 3 to 8 herein, who allegedly executed an agreement, dated 21st June, 1993, to sell it in favour of the plaintiff for a sum of Rs.136,688/- against a down payment of Rs.85,500/- vide receipt of even date. Claim of the plaintiff for possession of the land through specific performance of the said agreement was traversed by the defendants. The rival stances canvassed by the parties to the suit led the Trial Court to frame issues and invite evidence thereon. At the trial, the plaintiff filed an application under Article 76 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 seeking permission to produce secondary evidence in respect of agreement to sell dated 21st June, 1993 and receipt of payment of Rs.85,500/- on the plea that they had been lost; which was resisted by the defendants. This application did not find favour with the Trial Court and was dismissed vide order dated 22nd July, 2013 on the ground that she had failed to prove as to how and when the documents were misplaced and what efforts were made to trace out the same. The plaintiff thereupon filed an application under Section 115, C.P.C. before the Addl. District Judge, Jaranwala and sought revision of the order dated 22nd July, 2013 of the Trial Court. The Revisional Court concurring with the reasoning of the Trial Court declined the leave to produce secondary evidence through order dated 19th September, 2015.

2.    Impeaching the orders of the courts below, it is contended on behalf of the plaintiff that refusal to grant permission for producing secondary evidence in relation to agreement to sell and receipt dated 21st June, 1993 was not only contrary to the provisions of Article 76 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 and the principle settled by the superior Courts but was also result of mis-reading of the contents of the application filed by the plaintiff. Elaborating this argument, it was submitted that since the plaintiff had stated in her application that the original of the agreement to sell and receipt were in the possession of her predecessor, namely, Haji Noor Muhammad who died on 12th September, 2006 and after that the same were misplaced/lost and could not be found despite much effort, the burden was on her to prove this assertion. The Trial Court was, therefore, required to grant opportunity to the plaintiff to produce evidence in respect of loss of original documents, which was not given, so, the courts below could not conclude that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the original documents were lost and they misdirected themselves by declining the permission to produce secondary evidence.

3.    On the other hand, name of the defendants' counsel is printed in the cause list and despite this fact neither the defendants nor their counsel has turned up to oppose this petition. It is to be noted that this Court did not stay the proceedings of the suit but the Trial Court nevertheless without any cause adjourned the case sine die. In these circumstances particularly as this petition has been pending for the last more than five years, adjournment to procure attendance of the dormant and carefree defendants would not serve interest of justice. Since equity does not assist carelessness, the law must take its course. The defendants are, therefore, proceeded against ex-parte.

4.    After the hearing, I find that the grouse made by the plaintiff is well founded, arguments canvassed on her behalf have weight and thus am persuaded to approve them. This is the case where the plaintiff wants to produce secondary evidence in respect of agreement to sell dated 21st June, 1993 and receipt of payment of Rs.85,500/- of even date with the plea that original of the said documents was in possession of her predecessor, namely, Haji Noor Ahmad who died on 12th September, 2006 and after that the same were lost and could not be traced despite hectic efforts made by her. It is to be noted that defendants Nos.1 to 3, 5 and 6 have admitted the execution of documents whereas the defendant No.4 has denied them. Now the question which falls for determination is as to how in the given circumstances the plaintiff could be allowed to give secondary evidence of the lost documents. The principle is that so long as the original document exists and is available, it being the best evidence, must be produced. If it cannot be had on account of its loss, secondary evidence is admissible. The rationale of this principle is that when a person losses the higher proof, it may offer the next best in its power. It does not mean that person's rights are to be sacrificed because it cannot guard against events beyond its control. It only means that, so long as the higher or superior evidence is within possession of a person or may be reached by it, it shall give no inferior proof in relation to that.

5.    Clause (c) of Article 76 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 provides for permitting the parties to adduce secondary evidence of the existence, condition or contents of a document when the original has been lost. However, such a course is subject to certain limitations as it is not intended to be utilized for the benefit of a person who deliberately or with sinister motives refuses to produce in Court a document which is in its possession, power or control. It is designed only for the protection of a person who, in spite of best efforts, is unable from circumstances beyond its control to place before the Court primary evidence as required by law1. Thus the party tendering secondary evidence must prove the existence and execution of the document directly, if possible, or presumptively, where not and then establish its loss, either by the admission of the adversary or by proof that it cannot be found after diligent search2. Needless to mention here that the sufficiency of the search necessary to let in secondary evidence is a preliminary question for the Court, which will vary according to the nature of the document itself, the custody it is in, and indeed all the surrounding circumstances of the particular matter before the Court3. However, it is not necessary for the party to show or prove the exact mode and time of the loss4.

6.    In the present case, it appears that both the Courts below were conscious of the fact that the plaintiff per above stated position of law had to prove as to how and when the original documents were lost and what efforts were made by her to find them. It is astonishing to note that the Trial Court, on the one hand, in its judgment referred the case of Mukhtar Ahmad5 which stated that proof of loss of document is condition precedent to permission to lead secondary evidence and if the loss is not proved secondary evidence would become valueless whereas, on the other hand, without giving opportunity to the plaintiff to prove the loss of document by leading evidence, declined her request to produce secondary evidence with the observation that she had failed to prove as to how and when the documents were lost. This was not proper approach and thus, resulted into miscarriage of justice. The Trial Court ought to have granted opportunity to the plaintiff to lead some positive evidence so as to satisfy the preconditions for giving secondary evidence relating to the agreement to sell dated 21st June, 1993 and the receipt of even date and then exercised its discretion in such a way so that it could be inferred that justice had been done. Now, in the attending circumstances, the appropriate course of action is to follow the modus operandi adopted in the case of Sardar Bakhsh6 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan examining somewhat similar facts approved the direction given by the High Court whereby Trial Court was asked to treat the application for production of secondary evidence as pending; to record evidence of the parties thereon; and, to decide the same on the basis of evidence.

7.    In the result this petition is accepted and it is hereby declared that orders of the courts below have been passed without lawful authority and are of no legal effect and thus the same are set aside. As a consequence, the application of the plaintiff under Article 76 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 shall be deemed to be pending before the Trial Court which shall decide the same afresh after allowing the plaintiff to produce evidence thereon.

KMZ/B-8/L                                                                                                                                         Petition allowed.

C.A. No. 113-L of 2010
Mst. RAMZANU BIBI Versus IBRAHIM 

Mutation of gift---Proof---Plea of fraud---Onus to prove---Appellant/plaintiff claimed to be owner of suit land and assailed mutation of gift on the plea of fraud, allegedly attested on her behalf in favour of respondents/defendants---Validity---Beneficiaries under mutation in question had burden to demonstrate validity of original transaction---This entailed meeting a threefold burden---Firstly, there was a pleading burden; respondents / defendants had to articulate all relevant facts and material particulars regarding purported gift in their written statement---Secondly, respondents/defendants had the burden of producing evidence, which meant presenting documents or testimony supporting their claims---Thirdly, they carried burden of persuasion, effectively convincing the Court of the legitimacy of their assertions regarding original gift transaction---Such burdens were not abstract legal formalities and formed the bedrock of fairness in civil litigation---Burden of pleading ensures proper framing of issues; the evidentiary burden establishes factual basis; and the burden of persuasion is the ultimate determinant of legal entitlement---Appellant/plaintiff was justified in delaying any legal action until the threat to her rights had become overt and undeniable---This point accrued when respondents/defendants formally denied her claim before revenue authorities---Such event culminated in an order directing appellant/plaintiff to pursue her claim in civil Court---Appellant's/plaintiff's suit was instituted within the stipulated limitation period---

Gift, reason of---Principle---Donor is not legally obligated to provide a rationale for his/her decision to make a gift---It is generally uncommon for a gift to be made without some form of explanation or justification, unless the donor suffers from a serious impairment in mental capacity---Superficial or frivolous gifts are often made, particularly to disadvantage female family members and undermine their inheritance rights---Courts retain the power to scrutinize motives and circumstances surrounding a gift, ensuring that rightful ownership is protected and that established lines of inheritance are respected.

Fingerprints---Forensic analysis---Dactyloscopy---Object, purpose and scope---Practice of utilizing fingerprints for identification, called dactyloscopy, has gained widespread acceptance and has become an indispensable tool to law due to its straightforward nature and cost-effectiveness---Dactyloscopy operates on the foundational principle that no fingerprints are alike and that an individual's fingerprint patterns remain constant throughout life---Such uniqueness makes fingerprints an invaluable asset in forensic science.

----Fraus et jus nunquam cohabitant---Meaning---Fraud and justice never dwell together.
Fraudulent transactions, challenging of---Limitation---Fraud, by its very nature, unravels all aspects of any transaction, regardless of how solemnly it may have been conducted under the law---Any transaction born of deceit must be declared void, allowing the matter to be judged based on its substantive merits---This is important to prevent entrenchment of fraudulent actions, regardless of any time limitation issues.

Mutation does not confer title in favour of any party but constitutes merely an official record for fiscal purposes---Illegal approval of any mutation by Revenue Officer has no bearing on the title and can be treated as a nullity.

Suit for declaration---Right to sue, accrual of---Principle---Declaratory suit that seeks to establish title to a particular property represents a subsisting right---Right to institute such a suit is a continuing right, remaining intact as long as the claimant (plaintiff) possesses rights to disputed property---Pivotal point at which right to sue accrues arises when opposing party denies or challenges specific rights associated with property in question or at least exerts an unequivocal threat to infringe that right---In situations characterized by successive acts of denial, a new cause of action arises each time as there is a significant challenge to the claimant's (plaintiff's) rights.

ORDER
.---This appeal, by leave of this court, is brought forward by the unsuccessful plaintiff, who has raised significant concerns regarding the ownership of a parcel of land she inherited from her mother, Mst. Jimmy. The appellant alleges that the land was wrongfully and deceitfully recorded as having been gifted by her to Ibrahim (respondent No. 1) and Shadi (represented herein by his legal heirs, respondents Nos. 2 to 5) under mutation No.914 dated 24th of September, 1974, (Ex.P-2). To substantiate her claim, the appellant argues that respondents Nos. 1 to 5, the purported beneficiaries of this alleged gift, failed to discharge their pleadings burden; that they also did not present adequate or compelling evidence to prove the claimed gift; and, that even so, the courts below have dismissed her claims, prompting her to seek redress through this appeal. The matter raises important questions about property rights, the standards of proof required to establish a gift, and the implications of fraudulent conveyance, and as such, to examine them, leave was granted.

2.    A few undisputed facts need to be stated to better understand the appellant's gravamen. Mst. Jimmy was Ibrahim and Shadi's cousin. She married Jummay Khan, and from that wedlock, the appellant, Ramzanu Bibi was born. Mst. Jimmy inherited 33 kanals and 16 marlas of land from her father, Nawaz Khan. Upon her death, her land devolved upon her husband, Jummay Khan (respondent No.6), daughter, Ramzanu Bibi, and sister, Mst. Millie. The land measuring 16 kanals and 18 marlas of Mousa Boharwal Kalan, Tehsil Chunian, District Kasur, came into the appellant's share. On 24th of September, 1974, the Revenue Officer sanctioned two mutations. The first was inheritance mutation No.913, by which Mst. Jimmy's land was devolved upon her legal heirs. This mutation was sanctioned on the identification of Toolay Khan, Lambardar, and Heera Khan, Patidar. This mutation does not reflect the presence of Ramzanu Bibi. The second was mutation No.914 (Ex.P-2), which reflected that Ramzanu Bibi's land was transferred to Ibrahim and Shadi based on an oral gift. This mutation was sanctioned on the identification of Rahim Khan, Lambardar (DW-4), and Gonga, Patidar (DW-3). It carried the thumb impression of Ramzanu Bibi and Jummay Khan. The appellant first challenged the gift mutation No.914 (Ex.P-2) before the Collector, Chunian, but he, by his order dated 20th of January, 1979 (Ex.P-3), dismissed her appeal with the observation that she had a remedy before the Civil Court. Following this, the appellant, on 18th of February, 1979, instituted her suit and sought a declaration of title by declaring the mutation No.914 (Ex.P-2) illegal and ineffective upon her rights. By submitting a joint written statement, the respondents traversed the allegations. They posited that the appellant, of her free volition, appeared before the Patwari and recorded the fact of making a gift. Her statement was recorded by the Patwari on 14th of September, 1974, in his Roznamcha Waqiati at serial No. 499 (Ex.D-1).

3.    Before addressing the questions that come up for determination, and appreciating the evidence brought on record for their resolution, it is essential to clarify that an oral gift is legally permissible. The entry into the Rozenamcha Waqiati does not itself serve as the instrument of the gift. Even if a mutation-based on an entry in the Rozenamcha Waqiati-is attested, this documentation does not confer ownership rights. This Court has consistently held that mutation proceedings are not judicial in nature; they are administrative processes that merely embody the ownership changes to ensure the realisation of land revenue but do not inherently confer title to the property involved.1 Consequently, when the authenticity of any mutation is brought into question, it is incumbent upon the parties asserting their rights through the mutation to refer back to the original transaction that led to the mutation's attestation. They must then substantiate their claims concerning this original transaction, which underpins the entry and validation of the mutation.2 In this particular case, respondents Nos. 1 to 5, who were identified as beneficiaries under mutation No.914 dated 24th of September, 1974, (Ex.P-2), had the burden to demonstrate the validity of the original transaction. This entailed meeting a threefold burden. Firstly, there was a pleading burden; these respondents ought to have articulated all relevant facts and material particulars regarding the purported gift in their written statement. Secondly, they had the burden of producing evidence, which means presenting documents or testimony supporting their claims. Thirdly, they carried the burden of persuasion, effectively convincing the court of the legitimacy of their assertions regarding the original gift transaction. It is pertinent to note that these burdens are not abstract legal formalities-they form the bedrock of fairness in civil litigation. The burden of pleading ensures proper framing of issues; the evidentiary burden establishes factual basis; and the burden of persuasion is the ultimate determinant of legal entitlement. Now, let us examine how the respondents addressed and discharged each of these critical burdens.

4.    In the first instance, our focus must be directed towards the content of the written statement provided by the respondents concerning the gift in question. It is important to emphasise that this transaction was conducted orally with an illiterate woman, Ramzanu Bibi. Given these circumstances, the respondents were responsible for disclosing two crucial and material facts in their written statement. The first required disclosure pertained to the specifics of the gift transaction. The respondents were obligated to clearly articulate the date, time, and location of the transaction, as well as the names of the witnesses, who were present when Ramzanu Bibi purportedly proposed to gift her inherited land, and the respondents affirmed their acceptance of this gift at that time.3 The second critical point that needed to be stated was whether Ramzanu Bibi genuinely understood the implications of the gift she was making. The respondents were required to aver that this act was a sequel of Ramzanu Bibi's voluntary, intelligent, and conscious decisions.4 Upon thoroughly reviewing the respondents' written statements, it becomes evident that these crucial details were not furnished. This significant omission severely undermined their position and turned out to be detrimental upon evaluating their subsequent evidence. During the course of the trial, five witnesses were presented by the respondents to support their claims: DW-1 (Muhammad Afzal, Patwari), D-W-2 (Muhammad Shabbir, Patwari), DW-3 (Gonga), DW-4 (Rahim Khan, Lambardar), and DW-5 (Ibrahim, one of the respondents). However, none of these witnesses provided the requisite details concerning the transaction needed to validate the gift. In particular, DW-5, one of the alleged recipients of the gift, in his examination-in-chief only disclosed that Ramzanu Bibi had gifted her land to him. Notably absent from his testimony was any indication that he had formally accepted the gift, as well as the names of witnesses who were present during the proposal and acceptance of the gift. Moreover, DW-5's statement did not indicate whether the gift resulted from Ramzanu Bibi's informed understanding based on independent guidance. This lack of supporting detail suggests that the respondents had significantly failed to meet their burden of proof regarding the validity of the gift transaction recorded in mutation No.914 dated 24th of September, 1974, (Ex.P-2). As a result, the foundation of their defence stood critically weakened.

5.    That apart, the appellant had challenged the legitimacy of the gift mutation, asserting that it was executed under conditions of fraud and collusion. These serious allegations warrant a thorough examination, urging the necessity to lift the veil surrounding the purported transaction to uncover the underlying motivations that prompted the gift. While it is indeed true that a donor is not legally obligated to provide a rationale for their decision to make a gift, it is generally uncommon for a gift to be made without some form of explanation or justification-unless the donor suffers from a serious impairment in mental capacity.5 The importance of providing a reason for making a gift is amplified in light of empirical studies, which indicate that superficial or frivolous gifts are often made, particularly to disadvantage female family members and undermine their inheritance rights. Consequently, the courts retain the power to scrutinise the motives and circumstances surrounding a gift, ensuring that rightful ownership is protected and that established lines of inheritance are respected. In this case, when we pierce the veil and investigate the essence of the transaction, we find ourselves questioning the genuine intent and purpose behind the gift. The respondents, tasked with justifying the decision of Ramzanu Bibi to gift her land to them, failed to provide any compelling rationale in their written statement regarding the implication of mutation No. 914 (Ex.P-2). Nonetheless, during his testimony before the trial Court, respondent No.1, Ibrahim (DW-5), claimed that Ramzanu Bibi transferred her land for the sake of Allah, suggesting that the motivations for the gift stemmed from a desire to please God Almighty rather than genuine affection for the donees. If it was indeed Ramzanu Bibi's intention to secure blessings from God, it would be implausible that she would ignore the needs of her husband and children, effectively denying them their rightful shares in the land.6 The murkiness further deepened as the respondents failed to provide any evidence demonstrating that they were economically disadvantaged or in dire need of support- factors that might have influenced Ramzanu Bibi's decision to gift her land. Ultimately, this leads us to conclude that the primary objective behind this gift was to strip the appellant of her legitimate inheritance rights unfairly. As such, we are poised to hold that the gift made to the respondents was unjust and void ab initio, emerging from circumstances tainted by fraud and deceit.

6.    Another facet of this case unveils itself in the form of an insincere alleged gift transaction, revealing a fraudulent scheme to deceive the appellant, Ramzanu Bibi. While describing the facts of this case, we noted that two mutations were sanctioned on 24th of September, 1974. The first of these, mutation No.913, pertained to the inheritance of Mst. Jimmy, which transferred the disputed land to Ramzanu Bibi. This mutation is particularly significant for two factors. Firstly, it is noteworthy that Ramzanu Bibi was absent during the approval process of this mutation. Secondly, the sanctioning of this mutation relied solely on the identification and confirmations provided by Toolay Khan, the Lambardar, and Heera Khan, the Pattidar. This scenario confounded the immediately following mutation No.914. This second mutation was approved with Ramzanu Bibi present, relying on the identification of Rahim Khan, the Lambardar (DW-4), and Gonga, the Pattidar (DW-3). This inconsistency begs an important inquiry: if Ramzanu Bibi was present at the approval of mutation No.914, why was her presence not recorded in mutation No.913? Furthermore, why was it deemed necessary to involve a different Lambardar and Pattidar in the latter mutation? Ramzanu Bibi contended that she had neither made any gift to the respondents nor was she present when mutation No.914 was sanctioned. To address her concerns and assert her claims, she petitioned the trial Court, under Article 59 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, for a forensic analysis comparing her thumbprint on mutation No.914 with a verified sample. Here, we will pause to highlight and underscore fingerprint's vital role in revealing on individual's true identity. Whether concerning living persons or those who have passed away, known or unknown persons, fingerprints serve as critical evidence to support or challenge the claim of the parties involved in civil cases. The practice of utilizing fingerprints for identification, called dactyloscopy, has gained widespread acceptance and has become an indispensable tool to law due to its straightforward nature and cost-effectiveness. Dactyloscopy operates on the foundational principle that no fingerprints are alike and that an individual's fingerprint patterns remain constant throughout their life. This uniqueness makes them an invaluable asset in forensic science. It appears that the trial Court was conscious of the significant implications of fingerprint analysis in the case at hand, and, therefore, it had granted the appellant's request, leading to an expert's evaluation (Exh. P-1) that conclusively demonstrated that the thumbprint on mutation No.914 differed from Ramzanu Bibi's verified print on the sample paper. It is to be noted that for examination and comparison purposes, the fingerprint expert must prepare or get prepared enlarged photographs of the disputed and the specimen thumb impressions to the same scale. The best enlargements for examination are Two, Three, or Four diameters so that ridges of the impression may not loose definition or sharpness. Muhammad Idrees, the expert fingerprint analyst (PW-1), presented his findings (Exh. P-1) to the trial Court, explaining the scientific methodology that led him to conclude the incongruity between the thumbprint on mutation No.914 and that of Ramzanu Bibi. He furnished a comparison chart of image enlargements and a sheet of thumbprints obtained in open court. His report and statement indicate that the fingerprint analysis was in accordance with approved standards. The respondents could not gain anything in their favour during cross-examination of this expert and therefore failed to counter this forensic evidence. It is now widely acknowledged that the science of identifying thumb impressions has developed to such an extent that today it is an exact science and does not admit of any mistake or doubt.7 As such, the report (Exh. P-1) affirmed Ramzanu Bibi's objections and reinforced the notion that the purported gift transaction underlying mutation No.914 was indeed rooted in deceit. We hold the view that the courts below, by not adequately considering this aspect of the matter, allowed adroit manoeuvres to flourish, thereby depriving a rightful claimant of her property. This omission represents a grave infraction of justice and a violation of Ramzanu Bibi's fundamental right to her land, as preserved under Article 24 of the Constitution.

7.    Fraud and justice never dwell together (fraus et ius nunquam cohabitant). This pristine maxim brings us to examine whether the factor of time limitation was rightly held to be a significant obstacle to the rectification of fraud, particularly given the specific facts and circumstances of the case at hand. A thorough review of the records reveals that this time limitation was pivotal in influencing the courts below to dismiss the appellant's suit. We say, with the utmost respect, that this approach was misguided, for such an approach had failed to remedy the underlying wrong stemming from fraud and left the appellant's rightful claims unaddressed. In light of this, it becomes essential to emphasise that in these situations, the courts must act as protectors of justice, wielding their authority to effectively restore the rights of aggrieved individuals rather than merely producing perfunctory rulings that sidestep the essence of justice. Therefore, the courts must seize any justifiable reason that might allow for removing obstacles impeding fair resolutions. This ensures that individuals are granted their rightful claims. To deviate from this crucial principle invites the potential for societal corruption and lawlessness-an outcome that must be rigorously avoided. Fraud, by its very nature, unravels all aspects of any transaction, regardless of how solemnly it may have been conducted under the law. Consequently, any transaction born of deceit must be declared void, allowing the matter to be judged based on its substantive merits. This is particularly important to prevent the entrenchment of fraudulent actions, regardless of any time limitation issues.8 Doing so would have helped to nix the fraud, ensured that the respondents did not gain any illegal benefits from their illicit actions, and guaranteed that the aggrieved appellant received what was rightly due to her.

8.    Notwithstanding what has been stated above, we find that the appellant's suit was timely, even based on the respondents' stance. It is to be noted that on 17th of February, 1979, the appellant brought her legal action seeking a declaration of title, aiming to set aside mutation No. 914, which had been sanctioned on 24th of September, 1974, and to obtain a decree for possession of the property in question. Taking stock of these essential facts, the trial Court, agreeing with the respondents, held that because the appellant challenged the mutation on the grounds of fraud and had admitted in her statement as P.W.2 that she had knowledge of the transaction three years before the time she approached the Collector for annulment of the mutation, her case fell under the stipulations of Article 95 of the Limitation Act of 1908, and as such, the suit was barred by time. This view was flawed. This Article allows for three years from when the fraud becomes known to the party wronged. The fraud referenced in this legal provision pertains specifically to deceptive actions perpetrated against a party directly involved in the transaction in question. To put it another way, this Article applies only to cases where a party has been, by means of fraud, induced to enter into some transaction, execute some deed, or do some other act, and desires to be relieved from the consequences of such act. As it stands, the appellant did not participate in the fraudulent transaction that led to mutation No. 914. She was absent, and someone had impersonated her before the revenue officer to get the mutation approved, thereby keeping the appellant out of possession. Since the appellant was not a party to the mutation, she was not bound by it. The mutation, as stated above, does not confer title in favour of any party but constitutes merely an official record for fiscal purposes. As such, its illegal approval by the revenue officer had no bearing on the appellant's title and could be treated as a nullity. Given the situation, Article 95 was inapplicable to her case.9

9.    Now, it is necessary to determine which specific Article of the Limitation Act, 1908 is relevant and will govern the time limitations applicable to the appellant's case. A careful examination of the plaint reveals that the appellant's claim was based on her asserting ownership over the disputed property. Central to her allegations was the assertion of fraud, particularly that mutation No. 914 was sanctioned in her absence, accompanied by alleged collusion between the respondents and certain revenue officials. The legal framework governing such a claim, particularly for a suit seeking a declaration and a request for consequential relief-such as possession-falls under Article 120 of the Limitation Act, 1908. According to this Article, the limitation period for the suit begins when the right to sue accrues. The determination of when this right arises in a declaratory suit hinges significantly on the specifics of each case. It is important to understand that a declaratory suit that seeks to establish title to a particular property represents a subsisting right. The right to institute such a suit is a continuing right, remaining intact as long as the claimant (plaintiff) possesses rights to the disputed property. The pivotal point at which the right to sue accrues arises when the opposing party denies or challenges the specific rights associated with the property in question or at least exerts an unequivocal threat to infringe that right. However, in situations characterised by successive acts of denial, a new cause of action arises each time there is a significant challenge to the claimant's (plaintiff's) rights. In the context of the present case, it is evident that the cause of action for the appellant emerged initially due to the respondents' attempts to disrupt the then-existing status quo by sanctioning mutation No. 914. This mutation was sanctioned on 24th of September, 1974, marking an important date of the accrual of the cause of action. However, one must recognise that a cause of action is rarely founded on a singular event; rather, it typically comprises a complex interplay of various facts. The appellant's plaint provides further insight, indicating that, following the sanctioning of mutation No. 914, the respondents actively continued to deny her rights despite her explicit renunciation of their claims. Consequently, the appellant was justified in delaying any legal action until the threat to her rights became overt and undeniable. This point accrued when the respondents formally denied her claim before the Collector. This event culminated in an order dated 20th of January, 1979 (Ex. P.3), directing the appellant to pursue her claim in the civil Court. Taking these facts into account, the appellant's suit, filed on 18th of February, 1979, was, indeed, instituted within the stipulated limitation period. Given this analysis, the judgments rendered by the Courts below are fundamentally flawed and cannot be upheld.10

10.  The result is that this appeal succeeds, and by setting aside the judgments and decrees issued by the Courts below, we decree the appellant's suit with the requested relief. The respondents shall bear the costs of the appellant throughout.

2025 LHC 8107 — جسٹس انوار حسین

عدالتِ عالیہ کے سامنے درجِ ذیل اہم سوالِ قانون رائے کے لیے پیش کیا گیا:

کیا کوآپریٹو سوسائٹیز ایکٹ، 1925 کی دفعہ 54 کے تحت رجسٹرار کوآپریٹو سوسائٹیز پنجاب یا اس کے کسی مجاز نمائندے (مثلاً موجودہ مقدمہ میں جواب دہندہ نمبر 7) کی جانب سے جاری کردہ ایسا حکم، جس کے خلاف ایکٹ کے تحت اپیل دائر نہ کی گئی ہو، دیوانی عدالتوں پر لازم و ملزم ہوتا ہے اور کیا وہ دیوانی عدالتوں کو مبینہ معاہدۂ فروخت (Agreement to Sell) کی قانونی حیثیت جانچنے سے روک دیتا ہے؟

فیصلہ (Held)

عدالت کی رائے میں کوآپریٹو سوسائٹیز ایکٹ، 1925 کی دفعات 27 اور 54 ایک دوسرے کی تکمیل کرتی ہیں:

دفعہ 27 سوسائٹی کے کسی رکن کی وفات کے بعد، اس کی جائیداد یا حصص کی اندرونی (administrative) منتقلی سے متعلق ہے۔

دفعہ 54 سوسائٹی، اس کے ارکان یا دعویداروں کے درمیان پیدا ہونے والے تنازعات کے حل کا طریقہ کار فراہم کرتی ہے۔

دفعہ 54 کا پرووائزو (Proviso) رجسٹرار کے اختیارات پر ایک اہم قدغن ہے۔
اگر تنازعہ میں پیچیدہ قانونی و حقائق کے سوالات شامل ہوں، تو رجسٹرار پر لازم ہے کہ وہ کارروائی معطل کرے اور ایسے معاملات کے فیصلہ کے لیے دیوانی عدالت کو موقع دے۔

عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ

دفعہ 27 کے تحت نامزدگی (Nomination) صرف انتظامی سہولت کے لیے ہوتی ہے، تاکہ سوسائٹی ادائیگی یا منتقلی کر سکے؛
یہ نامزد شخص کو ورثاء کے حق میں ملکیت (Ownership) منتقل نہیں کرتی۔

قانون کا مجموعی ڈھانچہ اس بات کو یقینی بناتا ہے کہ پنجاب کوآپریٹوز ڈیپارٹمنٹ کا کوئی افسر (چاہے وہ رجسٹرار ہو یا اس کا مجاز نمائندہ)
ایسے متنازعہ حقِ ملکیت کا فیصلہ نہ کرے جس کے لیے مکمل شواہد اور تفصیلی سماعت درکار ہو — یہ اختیار صرف دیوانی عدالت کا ہے۔

مزید قرار دیا گیا کہ

دفعہ 54 کے تحت رجسٹرار یا اس کے مجاز نمائندے کی جانب سے جاری کردہ ایسا حکم، جس کے خلاف اپیل نہ کی گئی ہو

کوآپریٹو سوسائٹی پر اس حد تک لازم ہو سکتا ہے جہاں سوسائٹی نے دفعہ 27(3) کے تحت نیک نیتی (good faith) میں عمل کیا ہو؛

لیکن ایسے حکم کو درخواست گزار کے حقِ ملکیت کا ناقابلِ تردید (unimpeachable) فیصلہ نہیں سمجھا جا سکتا،
اور نہ ہی یہ دیوانی عدالتوں کو معاہدۂ فروخت یا حقِ ملکیت کی قانونی جانچ سے روکتا ہے۔

خلاصہ اصول
رجسٹرار کا حکم انتظامی نوعیت کا ہو سکتا ہے، مگر ملکیت کے حتمی اور متنازعہ سوالات کا فیصلہ صرف دیوانی عدالت کرے گی۔
قانونی تجزیاتی جائزہ 
اور 
 مقدمہ کا مرکزی سوالِ قانون
 (Core Question of Law)
عدالت کے سامنے بنیادی سوال یہ تھا

کیا Co-operative Societies Act, 1925 کی دفعہ 54 کے تحت رجسٹرار یا اس کے مجاز افسر کا ایسا حکم، جس کے خلاف اپیل دائر نہ کی گئی ہو،
(i) دیوانی عدالتوں کو پابند کرتا ہے؟
(ii) اور کیا وہ دیوانی عدالت کو معاہدۂ فروخت یا حقِ ملکیت کی جانچ سے روک دیتا ہے؟

 متعلقہ قانونی دفعات کا متن اور دائرۂ اختیار
 دفعہ 27 — Nomination on death of a member
قانونی مفہوم

اگر کسی کوآپریٹو سوسائٹی کا رکن فوت ہو جائے،

تو وہ اپنی زندگی میں کسی شخص کو nominee نامزد کر سکتا ہے۔

اہم ذیلی دفعات

 Section 27(1)
رکن کو حق حاصل ہے کہ وہ نامزدگی کرے تاکہ اس کی وفات کے بعد سوسائٹی اس کے حصص یا واجبات کے بارے میں انتظامی فیصلہ کر سکے۔

 Section 27(3)
سوسائٹی اگر نیک نیتی (good faith) میں nominee کو رقم ادا کرے یا منتقلی کرے تو وہ قانونی تحفظ (indemnity) کی حقدار ہوگی۔

 اہم قانونی نکتہ
دفعہ 27 ملکیت منتقل نہیں کرتی بلکہ صرف:

سوسائٹی کو انتظامی تحفظ

اور nominee کو temporary recipient بناتی ہے

 Nominee ≠ Owner

 دفعہ 54 — Disputes to be decided by Registrar
 Section 54(1)
یہ دفعہ رجسٹرار کو اختیار دیتی ہے کہ وہ درج ذیل تنازعات کا فیصلہ کرے:

ارکان کے درمیان

رکن اور سوسائٹی کے درمیان

سوسائٹی اور دعویداروں کے درمیان

 Proviso to Section 54 (انتہائی اہم)
Provided that where complicated questions of law and fact are involved, the Registrar shall suspend proceedings and allow the Civil Court to decide the matter.

 قانونی اثر

رجسٹرار Civil Court کا متبادل نہیں

جہاں

title disputed ہو

agreement to sell مشکوک ہو

وراثتی حقوق زیرِ بحث ہوں

گواہوں اور شواہد کی ضرورت ہو

وہاں رجسٹرار لازماً پیچھے ہٹے گا

دفعات 27 اور 54 کا باہمی تعلق 
(Harmonious Construction)
عدالت نے واضح کیا کہ

Sections 27 and 54 operate in a complementary fashion

 عملی تشریح
دفعہ دائرہ
Section 27 Administrative / Interim arrangement
Section 54 Limited dispute resolution
Proviso to 54 Civil Court supremacy
 یعنی

Nomination صرف سہولت

Registrar صرف محدود اختیار

Civil Court حتمی فورم برائے ملکیت

 رجسٹرار کے حکم کی قانونی حیثیت
عدالت نے نہایت واضح اصول وضع کیا:

 رجسٹرار کا غیر اپیل شدہ حکم:
سوسائٹی کو bind کر سکتا ہے

اگر سوسائٹی نے Section 27(3) کے تحت good faith میں عمل کیا ہو

 لیکن
یہ حکم

title decide نہیں کرتا

وراثتی حقوق ختم نہیں کرتا

Civil Court کو روک نہیں سکتا

Agreement to Sell کی جانچ سے مانع نہیں

 دیوانی عدالت کا اختیار (Civil Court Jurisdiction)
عدالت نے دوٹوک الفاظ میں قرار دیا:

Registrar or his delegate cannot adjudicate contested title requiring plenary evidentiary probe

 اس کا مطلب

رجسٹرار

cross-examination نہیں کر سکتا

detailed evidence record نہیں کر سکتا

equitable relief نہیں دے سکتا

 یہ تمام اختیارات صرف 
Civil Court
 کے پاس ہیں۔

 فیصلہ کا Ratio Decidendi (قابلِ استناد اصول)
 اصول نمبر 1
Nomination under Section 27 ownership confer نہیں کرتی۔
 اصول نمبر 2
Registrar کا فیصلہ administrative / limited ہوتا ہے، final adjudication نہیں۔
 اصول نمبر 3
Section 54 کا proviso Civil Court کی بالادستی کا آئینی اظہار ہے۔
 اصول نمبر 4
Unchallenged registrar order res judicata نہیں بنتا۔

 عملی قانونی اطلاق
 (For Practicing Lawyers)
اگر آپ Civil Suit فائل کر رہے ہوں
Registrar کے حکم کو

prima facie administrative act

not final determination
کہہ کر challenge کیا جا سکتا ہے۔

اگر مخالف فریق reliance لے
"Registrar ka order final hai"

تو جواب

Order binds society, not Civil Court

 مختصراً نتیجاً ۔۔۔۔۔
 (One-line Holding)
Co-operative Societies Act, 1925 کے تحت رجسٹرار کا غیر اپیل شدہ حکم انتظامی طور پر سوسائٹی کو پابند کر سکتا ہے،
مگر یہ نہ تو حقِ ملکیت کا حتمی فیصلہ ہے اور نہ ہی دیوانی عدالت کے اختیار کو ختم کرتا ہے۔

[1/3/26, 5:19:03 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: *سول پریکٹیشنرز کے لیے ایک بہترین تفصیلی جائزہ سیکشن 9 CPC....* 

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*

سیکشن 9 آف دی سول پروسیجر کوڈ (CPC) سول عدالتوں کے دائرہ اختیار (jurisdiction) سے متعلق ہے۔ یہ سیکشن ان اصولوں کی وضاحت کرتا ہے جن کی بنیاد پر سول عدالتیں کسی مقدمے کی سماعت کر سکتی ہیں۔ اس پر مکمل جامع نوٹس ہر پہلو سے درج ذیل ہیں:

سیکشن 9 سی پی سی: متن

The courts shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred."
اہم نکات:
دائرہ کار کا اصول (General Rule of Jurisdiction):

سول عدالتیں ان تمام مقدمات کی سماعت کر سکتی ہیں جو "سول نوعیت" (civil nature) کے ہوں۔
صرف وہی مقدمے خارج ہیں جنہیں کسی مخصوص قانون کے تحت ممنوع قرار دیا گیا ہو۔
سول نوعیت کے مقدمے:

ایسے مقدمے جن کا تعلق نجی حقوق (private rights) اور واجبات (obligations) سے ہو، جیسے:
جائیداد کے تنازعات
کنٹریکٹ کے مسائل
خاندان کے معاملات (وراثت، تقسیم)
سول نوعیت کے مقدمے میں کسی فریق کو انصاف کے لیے عدالت میں آنے کا حق ہوتا ہے۔
بارڈ مقدمات (Barred Suits):

دو قسم کے بارڈ مقدمات:
ایکسپریس بارڈ (Expressly Barred): قانون واضح طور پر ان مقدمات کی سماعت سے روکتا ہے، جیسے:
ٹیکس معاملات جن کے لیے ٹربیونلز مقرر ہیں۔
فوجی معاملات جو عدالتِ مارشل کے دائرے میں آتے ہیں۔
امپلائیڈ بارڈ (Impliedly Barred): ایسے مقدمات جو کسی مخصوص قانون کے دائرہ کار میں آتے ہیں یا پبلک پالیسی کے خلاف ہوں، جیسے:
مذہبی رسوم یا عقائد پر مبنی مقدمات۔
اصولی حدود:

اگر سول نوعیت کے مقدمے کو کوئی مخصوص فورم تفویض کیا گیا ہے، تو سول عدالتوں کا دائرہ کار محدود ہو جاتا ہے۔
عدالت کا دائرہ کار تبھی روکا جا سکتا ہے جب واضح قانون یا مخصوص حالات موجود ہوں۔
اہم عدالتی نظائر (Case Laws):
مہاراجہ دھیرجہ کرشنا سنگھ کیس:
عدالت نے وضاحت کی کہ کسی تنازع کے "سول نوعیت" ہونے کا فیصلہ اس کے حقائق پر مبنی ہوتا ہے، نہ کہ اس کے دعوے پر۔
موٹس موہن لال کیس:
عدالت نے کہا کہ اگر مقدمہ کسی کے قانونی حق کو متاثر کرتا ہے، تو وہ سول نوعیت کا ہے۔
عبدالغنی و دیگر بنام فضل الرحیم 
اس مقدمے میں وضاحت کی گئی کہ "ایکسپریس بارڈ" اور "امپلائیڈ بارڈ" کا اطلاق کن حالات میں ہوگا۔
اہم پہلو:
1. سیکشن 9 کا مقصد:
افراد کو انصاف فراہم کرنا اور ان کے قانونی حقوق کا تحفظ کرنا۔
عدالت کے دائرہ کار کو وسیع کرنا تاکہ انصاف تک رسائی ممکن ہو۔
2. سیکشن 9 اور خصوصی قوانین:
بعض معاملات میں، خصوصی قوانین کے تحت خصوصی ٹربیونلز قائم کیے جاتے ہیں، جیسے:
لیبر قوانین کے تحت لیبر کورٹ۔
ٹیکس قوانین کے تحت ٹیکس ٹربیونلز۔
ان معاملات میں سول عدالتیں مداخلت نہیں کر سکتیں۔
3. ریلیف کی نوعیت:
اگر مقدمہ ریلیف طلب کرتا ہے جو قانون کے مطابق ہو، تو عدالت اسے سن سکتی ہے۔
غیر قانونی یا پبلک پالیسی کے خلاف ریلیف سول عدالتیں فراہم نہیں کر سکتیں۔
4. متوازی عدالتی نظام:
سیکشن 9 خصوصی اور عمومی عدالتی دائرہ کار کے درمیان توازن قائم کرتا ہے۔
خلاصہ:
سیکشن 9 سی پی سی سول عدالتوں کے دائرہ کار کی بنیاد فراہم کرتا ہے۔
یہ قانون واضح کرتا ہے کہ تمام سول نوعیت کے مقدمے سول عدالت کے دائرہ کار میں آتے ہیں، جب تک کہ انہیں کسی قانون کے تحت ممنوع نہ کیا گیا ہو۔
عدالت کو مقدمے کے سول نوعیت کے ہونے کا تعین کرنے کے لیے حقائق اور حالات کا جائزہ لینا ہوتا ہے۔
یہ سیکشن انصاف کی فراہمی میں بنیادی حیثیت رکھتا ہے اور قانونی نظام کے بنیادی ستونوں میں سے ایک ہے...

تربیلا ڈیم منصوبے سے متاثرہ افراد—تربیلا ڈیم اوستی اسکیم (اسکیم)—متبادل زمین کی الاٹمنٹ—الاٹ کی گئی زمین کے متعلق مالکانہ حقوق کی منظوری، الاٹمنٹ کی تاریخ سے متعلق—زمین کا قبضہ دیا گیا لیکن مالکانہ حقوق کی منظوری سے انکار، کیونکہ زمین ممنوعہ زون میں واقع تھی—قانونی حیثیت—

ایک جامع اور خود مختار طریقہ کار مرتب کیا گیا تھا (زمین کی الاٹمنٹ کے لیے) جو کہ Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 ("کالونائزیشن ایکٹ") کی دفعہ 10(4) کے تحت الاٹمنٹ کے باضابطہ احکامات کے جاری ہونے اور پھر الاٹی کو زمین کے قبضے میں دینے پر منتج ہوا۔ یادداشت مورخہ 01.05.1969 کے ذریعے بورڈ آف ریونیو نے نامزد افسران پر یہ فرض عائد کیا کہ منتخب زمین کی حالت کو مکمل طور پر جانچیں۔ ریونیو آفیسر اور سیٹلمنٹ آفیسر، واپڈا کی ذمہ داری تھی کہ وہ یقینی بنائیں کہ منتخب زمین ہر قسم کے نقائص اور بوجھ سے پاک ہو۔

ڈپٹی کمشنر ملتان نے 20.08.1980 کو بورڈ آف ریونیو کو خط کے ذریعے تصدیق کی کہ مجوزہ زمین "ہر قسم کے نقائص اور بوجھ سے پاک تھی" اور "ممنوعہ حدود سے باہر واقع تھی"۔ ڈپٹی کمشنر نے 21.09.1991 کے خط میں مزید تصدیق کی کہ زمین کی الاٹمنٹ کے وقت میونسپل کمیٹی خانیوال کو "دوسری کلاس" کا درجہ حاصل تھا اور اس وجہ سے الاٹ شدہ زمین ممنوعہ علاقے میں شامل نہیں تھی۔

بعد میں، جب خانیوال کو ضلع کے طور پر اپ گریڈ کیا گیا اور میونسپل کمیٹی کو 01.07.1985 سے "فرسٹ کلاس" کا درجہ دیا گیا تو ممنوعہ علاقے کی حدود میں توسیع کر دی گئی۔ تاہم، جب زمین الاٹ کی گئی، تو وہ اسکیم کی شق (viii) کے تحت مقرر کردہ حدود سے باہر تھی اور ہر قسم کے نقائص اور بوجھ سے پاک تھی۔ ممنوعہ علاقے کی وہ حدود جو زمین کی الاٹمنٹ کے وقت موجود تھیں، اہم تھیں، یعنی جب کالونائزیشن ایکٹ کی دفعہ 10(4) کے تحت حکم نامہ جاری کیا گیا۔

ممنوعہ علاقے کی حیثیت میں بعد کی تبدیلی الاٹ شدہ حقوق کو متاثر یا ختم نہیں کر سکتی تھی۔ اس لیے، اسکیم کے تحت زمین کے متعلق مالکانہ حقوق کا تعلق الاٹمنٹ کی تاریخ سے تھا۔ نتیجتاً، کالونائزیشن ایکٹ کی دفعہ 10(4) کے تحت جاری حکم کے مطابق مالکانہ حقوق کی منظوری کا تعلق الاٹمنٹ کی تاریخ سے تھا اور خانیوال کو تحصیل سے ضلع کے طور پر اپ گریڈ کیے جانے سے ممنوعہ علاقے میں تبدیلی نے الاٹی کے حقوق کو متاثر نہیں کیا۔

اس کیس میں مالکانہ حقوق کی منظوری سے انکار آئین کے آرٹیکل 24 کے تحت فراہم کردہ بنیادی حق کی خلاف ورزی تھی۔

۔ اس کیس میں سپریم کورٹ نے غیر منقولہ جائیداد سے متعلق مقدمات میں "لیس پینڈنس" (Lis Pendens) کے اصول کی تشریح کی ہے۔ "List pendens" کا مطلب ہے کہ جب کسی جائیداد پر مقدمہ زیر سماعت ہو، تو اس دوران اس جائیداد کی منتقلی یا فروخت اس مقدمے کے نتیجے پر اثر انداز ہو سکتی ہے۔

کیس کا پس منظر

مقدمہ اس صورت میں پیش آیا جب ایک غیر منقولہ جائیداد کا مقدمہ پہلے خارج کیا گیا، پھر بعد میں بحال کر دیا گیا۔ اس دوران، جائیداد کی منتقلی یا فروخت کی گئی۔ سپریم کورٹ نے اس بات کا جائزہ لیا کہ کیا اس منتقلی یا فروخت پر "List pendens" کا اصول لاگو ہوتا ہے یا نہیں۔

فیصلے کی تفصیلات

سپریم کورٹ نے فیصلہ دیا کہ جب کوئی مقدمہ خارج کیا جائے اور بعد میں بحال ہو جائے، تو بحالی کا حکم ماضی میں مؤثر ہوتا ہے۔ یعنی، بحالی کے بعد، مقدمہ اس تاریخ سے مؤثر سمجھا جائے گا جب وہ پہلے دائر کیا گیا تھا۔ اس لیے، اگر مقدمے کے خارج ہونے اور بحالی کے درمیان جائیداد کی منتقلی یا فروخت ہوئی ہو، تو وہ "List pendens" کے اصول کے تحت آتی ہے۔

"لیس پینڈنس" کا اصول:

"List pendens" کا اصول ٹرانسفر آف پراپرٹی ایکٹ 1882 کے سیکشن 52 میں بیان کیا گیا ہے۔ اس کے مطابق، جب کسی جائیداد پر مقدمہ زیر سماعت ہو، تو اس دوران اس جائیداد کی منتقلی یا فروخت اس مقدمے کے نتیجے پر اثر انداز ہو سکتی ہے۔

مختصراً 
اس کیس میں، سپریم کورٹ نے واضح کیا کہ اگر مقدمہ بحال ہو جائے، تو اس کی مؤثر تاریخ وہی ہوگی جب وہ پہلے دائر کیا گیا تھا۔ اس لیے، بحالی کے بعد کی جانے والی جائیداد کی منتقلی یا فروخت "List pendens" کے اصول کے تحت آتی ہے اور اس کا مقدمے کے نتیجے پر اثر ہو سکتا ہے۔

اس فیصلے سے یہ بات واضح ہوتی ہے کہ غیر منقولہ جائیداد سے متعلق مقدمات میں "List pendens " کے اصول کا اطلاق مقدمے کی بحالی کے بعد بھی ہوتا ہے، اور اس دوران کی جانے والی منتقلی یا فروخت اس اصول کے تحت آتی ہے۔

ریپ کیسز میں رضامندی کا تعین اکثر پیچیدہ اور حقائق پر مبنی ہوتا ہے۔ ابتدا میں، رضامندی کی عدم موجودگی کو ثابت کرنے کی ذمہ داری استغاثہ پر ہوتی ہے، جو قابل اعتبار شواہد، جیسے متاثرہ کی گواہی، طبی معائنے کی رپورٹوں، اور فرانزک شواہد پیش کرکے پوری کی جا سکتی ہے۔ چونکہ ریپ کا جرم عمومی طور پر نجی جگہوں پر ہوتا ہے، اس لیے آزاد گواہوں کا ملنا مشکل ہوتا ہے۔ لہٰذا، متاثرہ کی اکیلی گواہی بھی مقدمے میں سزا کے لیے کافی ہو سکتی ہے، بشرطیکہ وہ قابل اعتماد، مستقل اور قابل اعتبار ہو۔

جہاں براہ راست شواہد دستیاب نہ ہوں، وہاں حالات و واقعات سے حاصل شواہد عدالتی فیصلے میں اہم کردار ادا کرتے ہیں اور رضامندی کی موجودگی کا تعین کرنے میں مدد دیتے ہیں۔ ان میں متاثرہ کی جسمانی حالت، مزاحمت کی نشاندہی کرنے والی چوٹیں، فرانزک شواہد جیسے ملزم کے جرم سے منسلک ڈی این اے، واقعات کا وقت اور تسلسل، یا فریقین کے درمیان پیغامات یا کالز جیسے مواصلاتی ریکارڈ شامل ہو سکتے ہیں۔ تاہم، یہ زور دینا ضروری ہے کہ متاثرہ کے جسم پر چوٹوں کی عدم موجودگی یا جسمانی مزاحمت کے آثار کا نہ ہونا رضامندی کا ثبوت نہیں ہے۔ جیسا کہ زیر بحث آیا، تعزیرات پاکستان کی دفعہ 375 کی وضاحت نمبر 2 واضح کرتی ہے کہ غیر رضامندی کو ثابت کرنے کے لیے جسمانی مزاحمت ضروری نہیں۔

عدالت کا کردار ان تبدیل ہوتی ذمہ داریوں کو متوازن کرنے میں اہم ہے۔ اسے استغاثہ کے شواہد کی سختی سے جانچ پڑتال کرنی چاہیے تاکہ یہ یقینی بنایا جا سکے کہ یہ شک سے بالاتر ہو کر رضامندی کی عدم موجودگی کو ثابت کرتا ہے۔ اسی وقت، عدالت کو ملزم کے شواہد یا دفاع کی معقولیت اور اعتبار کا جائزہ لینا ہوتا ہے۔

تحقیقات کے دوران، پولیس نے نتیجہ اخذ کیا کہ یہ کیس زنا بالجبر کے بجائے زنا کا ہے۔ یہ نتائج بنیادی طور پر سی سی ٹی وی فوٹیج، تصاویر، اور فریقین کے درمیان ہونے والے واٹس ایپ پیغامات پر مبنی ہیں۔ اگرچہ یہ شواہد قریبی تعلقات کی نشاندہی کرتے ہیں، شاید شکایت کنندہ کے اعتراف سے زیادہ، لیکن یہ اس بات کا قطعی تعین نہیں کرتے کہ عمل رضامندی کے ساتھ ہوا یا نہیں۔ یہ اہم تعین مقدمے کی سماعت کے دوران تمام شواہد کی تفصیلی جانچ پڑتال کا متقاضی ہے۔

جیسا کہ پہلے ذکر کیا گیا، دفعہ 375 کے تحت، دھمکیاں، خوفزدہ کرنا یا جبر رضامندی کو کالعدم قرار دیتے ہیں۔ لہٰذا، اگر یہ ثابت ہو جائے کہ پستول دکھانے اور قابل اعتراض مواد جاری کرنے کی دھمکیاں دی گئیں، تو کوئی بھی ظاہری رضامندی غیر متعلق ہو جائے گی۔ ٹرائل کورٹ وہ مناسب فورم ہے جو سی سی ٹی وی فوٹیج، واٹس ایپ پیغامات، اور دیگر مواد سمیت شواہد کا جائزہ لے کر جرم کی نوعیت کا تعین کرے۔

پیشگی گرفتاری ضمانت ایک غیر معمولی ریلیف ہے جو ایسے مقدمات کے لیے مخصوص ہے جہاں ملزم یہ ثابت کر سکے کہ ایف آئی آر بدنیتی، ذاتی دشمنی، یا اس جیسی وجوہات کے تحت درج کی گئی ہے۔ درخواست گزار اس شرط کو پورا کرنے میں ناکام رہا ہے۔ استغاثہ کے شواہد میں تضادات جیسے ایف آئی آر اور شکایت کنندہ کے دفعہ 164 ضابطہ فوجداری کے تحت بیان میں اختلافات کو دیگر شواہد کے ساتھ تفصیلی جانچ پڑتال کی ضرورت ہے۔ ایسی جانچ پڑتال پیشگی گرفتاری ضمانت کی درخواست کے دائرہ کار سے باہر ہے۔

"اس کے باوجود کہ خارج کرنے کا حکم موجود ہو، پولیس حکام معاملے کی دوبارہ تفتیش کر سکتے ہیں۔ شکایت کیس کے زیر التواء ہونے کے دوران، اسی موضوع سے متعلق فوجداری کیس میں دفعہ 182 تعزیرات پاکستان کے تحت کارروائی شروع نہیں کی جا سکتی۔"

جائزہ ۔۔۔۔
1. خارجی حکم کے باوجود دوبارہ تحقیقات کا اختیار
پولیس کے پاس ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعہ 173(3) کے تحت یہ اختیار موجود ہے کہ وہ مقدمہ خارج ہونے کے بعد بھی نئی معلومات یا شواہد کی بنیاد پر دوبارہ تحقیقات کر سکتی ہے۔
یہ اصول اس بات کی اجازت دیتا ہے کہ اگر کوئی اہم شواہد سامنے آئیں تو انصاف کے حصول کے لیے معاملے پر دوبارہ غور کیا جا سکتا ہے۔
سپریم کورٹ کے فیصلے بھی اس بات کی تصدیق کرتے ہیں کہ پولیس کے پاس دوبارہ تحقیقات کرنے کا قانونی حق محفوظ ہے، لیکن یہ اختیار غیر قانونی یا بدنیتی پر مبنی نہیں ہونا چاہیے۔
2. شکایت کیس کے زیر التوا ہونے کے دوران دفعہ 182 کے تحت کارروائی کی ممانعت
دفعہ 182 تعزیرات پاکستان کے تحت جھوٹی شکایت درج کروانے پر کارروائی کی جا سکتی ہے۔ تاہم، یہ کارروائی صرف اس وقت ممکن ہے جب یہ واضح ہو جائے کہ شکایت جھوٹی، بدنیتی پر مبنی، اور بے بنیاد تھی۔
اگر متعلقہ کیس پہلے ہی عدالت میں زیر سماعت ہو، تو شکایت کو جھوٹی قرار دینا اور دفعہ 182 کے تحت کارروائی شروع کرنا مناسب نہیں ہوگا کیونکہ عدالت کے فیصلے سے پہلے ایسا اقدام قانونی عمل میں رکاوٹ بن سکتا ہے۔
یہ اصول عدالتی نظائر کی روشنی میں ترتیب دیا گیا ہے تاکہ انصاف کے عمل میں تعصب پیدا نہ ہو۔
3. قانونی نظائر (Precedents)
کئی عدالتی فیصلے یہ واضح کرتے ہیں کہ جب ایک معاملہ شکایت کیس کے طور پر عدالت میں موجود ہو، تو اس دوران دفعہ 182 کے تحت مقدمہ درج کرنا انصاف کے عمل میں مداخلت کے مترادف ہو سکتا ہے۔
مثال کے طور پر:
پہلا نظیر: اگر عدالت اس بات کا تعین کرے کہ شکایت کنندہ نے بددیانتی سے شکایت درج کروائی تھی، تب ہی دفعہ 182 کے تحت کارروائی کا آغاز کیا جا سکتا ہے۔
دوسرا نظیر: شکایت کے میرٹ پر فیصلہ ہونے سے پہلے پولیس یا دیگر حکام دفعہ 182 کے تحت کوئی اقدام نہیں کر سکتے۔
4. اثر اور اہمیت
اس اصول کا مقصد شکایت کنندگان کو تحفظ دینا ہے تاکہ وہ خوف یا دباؤ کے بغیر شکایت درج کروا سکیں۔
یہ عدالتی عمل کی آزادی کو برقرار رکھنے کے لیے بھی اہم ہے کیونکہ عدالت کو فیصلہ کرنے کا مکمل موقع ملنا چاہیے۔

عادل خالد باجوہ بمقابلہ بشیر احمد طاہر اور دیگر
فوجداری اپیل نمبر 81002 برائے 2021 اور سول نظرثانی نمبر 12886 برائے 2022
دعویٰ برائے ڈیکلیریشن اور حکم امتناعی --- مقدمے کا خارج ہونا --- اصول:
مدعا علیہ/مدعی کے ذریعہ دائر کردہ مقدمہ ٹرائل کورٹ نے خارج کر دیا تھا، لیکن ماتحت اپیلٹ کورٹ نے اس حکم کو منسوخ کر کے معاملہ دوبارہ سماعت کے لیے ٹرائل کورٹ کو بھیج دیا تاکہ قابل سماعت ہونے پر نقاط مرتب کیے جا سکیں۔

جواز:
یہ طے کرنے کے لیے کہ آیا درخواست میں کوئی سبب دعویٰ ظاہر ہوتا ہے یا نہیں، عدالت کو یہ فرض کرنا پڑتا ہے کہ درخواست میں کیے گئے تمام الزامات سچ ہیں۔
سی پی سی کے آرڈر II، رول 11 کے تحت مقدمے کو خارج کرنے کا اختیار صرف اس صورت میں استعمال کیا جانا چاہیے جب عدالت اس نتیجے پر پہنچے کہ اگر تمام الزامات ثابت بھی ہو جائیں، تو بھی مدعی کسی قسم کا ریلیف حاصل کرنے کا حقدار نہیں ہوگا۔
مدعا علیہ/مدعی کے ذریعہ دائر کردہ مقدمہ قانون کے مطابق ممنوع تھا اور اس میں کسی وجۂ دعویٰ کا ذکر نہیں تھا، اس لیے اسے خارج کیا جانا ضروری تھا۔

ہائی کورٹ نے ماتحت اپیلٹ کورٹ کے جاری کردہ حکم کو منسوخ کر دیا کیونکہ وہ غیر قانونی، غیر آئینی اور اختیارات کے ناجائز استعمال کے تحت جاری کیا گیا تھا۔

*قانونِ حدبندی اور وراثتی دعوے: عدالتی نظائر*
*PLD 2024 SC 1268*

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*

وراثتی مقدمات، دعویٰ دائر کرنے کی مدت - اصول
یہ ضروری نہیں کہ ہر وراثتی مقدمے میں وقت کی حد (Limitation) کا سوال غیر متعلق ہو جائے۔ کچھ غیر معمولی حالات ہو سکتے ہیں جن میں وراثت کی بنیاد پر مقدمے میں وقت کی حد کا مسئلہ اہمیت اختیار کر لیتا ہے۔ بعض مقدمات میں سپریم کورٹ نے وراثتی معاملات میں وقت کی حد اور دعویٰ کنندہ کی خاموشی کے اصول کو مدنظر رکھا ہے۔

قانونِ حدبندی - مقصد اور دائرہ کار
قانونِ حدبندی (Law of Limitation) اصول 
"Vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt" پر مبنی ہے، جس کا مطلب ہے: "قانون ان کی مدد کرتا ہے جو چوکنا رہتے ہیں، ان کی نہیں جو اپنے حقوق پر سوتے رہتے ہیں"۔ یہ اصول انصاف کا ایک اہم ستون ہے، جو ظاہر کرتا ہے کہ قانون اُن لوگوں کا ساتھ دیتا ہے جو فوری اور مستعدی سے عمل کرتے ہیں۔ اس کا مقصد یہ ہے کہ افراد اپنے حقوق کے دعوے میں سرگرم رہیں اور جو لوگ معقول وقت میں ایسا نہ کریں وہ عدالت سے اپنی مدد کی توقع نہ رکھیں۔

قانونِ حدبندی محض ایک تکنیکی شرط نہیں بلکہ ایک منظم قانونی نظام کا لازمی حصہ ہے۔ یہ ایک ایسا فریم ورک مہیا کرتا ہے جو یقینی بناتا ہے کہ قانونی معاملات بروقت حل ہوں، شواہد ضائع نہ ہوں، یادداشت کمزور نہ پڑے، اور حقائق مسخ نہ ہوں۔ مزید برآں، یہ ممکنہ مدعا علیہان کو ان دعووں سے تحفظ فراہم کرتا ہے جو طویل عرصے بعد کیے جاتے ہیں، اور قانونی معاملات میں یقین دہانی اور حتمی فیصلے کو فروغ دیتا ہے۔

قانونِ حدبندی دعویٰ کنندگان کو وقت مقررہ میں عمل کرنے پر مجبور کرتا ہے، اور جو اپنے حقوق کے تحفظ میں تاخیر کرتے ہیں وہ مؤثر طور پر اپنی قانونی چیلنج کرنے کی اہلیت کھو دیتے ہیں، جو پہلے ہی حل ہو سکتے تھے۔

وراثتی انتقال کو چیلنج کرنے کا دعویٰ - مدت
وراثتی انتقال کی قانونی حیثیت کو چیلنج کرنے کے لیے اعلانِ دعویٰ دائر کرنے کی مدت کا جائزہ لیا جائے تو ریکارڈ سے ظاہر ہوتا ہے کہ زمین کے حوالے سے انتقال کے اندراجات 1982 میں مدعا علیہ (مدعی) کے حق میں کیے گئے۔ تاہم، مدعی نے 2009 میں، یعنی 27 سال سے زائد عرصہ گزرنے کے بعد، پہلی بار مقدمہ دائر کیا۔ مدعی کی جانب سے ٹرائل کورٹ میں مقدمہ دائر کرنے میں تاخیر کی کوئی وضاحت پیش نہیں کی گئی۔

قانونِ حدبندی کا مقصد ایسی غفلت کو روکنا ہے، تاکہ دعوے اس وقت پیش کیے جائیں جب شواہد تازہ اور حقائق واضح ہوں۔ اتنی غیر معمولی تاخیر کے بعد دعویٰ کو قبول کرنے سے نہ صرف قانونی نظام کی ساکھ متاثر ہوگی بلکہ یہ ایک خطرناک مثال بھی قائم کرے گا، جس سے یہ پیغام ملے گا کہ دہائیوں کے گزرنے کے باوجود قانونی حقوق کا دعویٰ کیا جا سکتا ہے۔

مزید برآں، دوسرے قانونی وارثان میں سے کسی نے بھی مذکورہ وراثتی انتقال کو مدعا علیہ کے نام پر چیلنج نہیں کیا۔ مدعی وقت کی حد کی رکاوٹ کو عبور کرنے میں ناکام رہا، اور اس کا مقدمہ ٹرائل کورٹ نے صحیح طور پر وقت کی حد ختم ہونے کی بنیاد پر مسترد کر دیا۔

[1/3/26, 5:19:11 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: *سپریم کورٹ نے قرار دیا ہے کہ خاتون جب بھی تقاضا کرے شوہر #حق مہر کی ادائیگی کا پابند ہوگا۔*
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*

اس حوالے سے 3 صفحات پر مشتمل فیصلہ چیف جسٹس قاضی فائز عیسیٰ نے تحریر کیا ہے۔

عدالت نے 6 سال تک حق مہر ادائیگی میں تاخیر پر شوہر پر ایک لاکھ جرمانہ کردیا اور شوہر کو قانونی چارہ جوئی کے اخراجات کی ادائیگی کا بھی حکم دیا ہے۔

سپریم کورٹ نے فیصلے میں کہا ہے کہ حق مہر شرعی تقاضا ہے جس کا تحفظ ملکی قوانین میں بھی ہے، حق مہر کی ادائیگی کا وقت نکاح نامے میں مقرر نہ ہو تو بیوی کسی بھی وقت تقاضا کرسکتی ہے۔

فیصلے میں کہا گیا ہے کہ خاتون کو حق مہر کے لیے مقدمہ دائر کرنا پڑا جو 6 سال بعد سپریم کورٹ پہنچا، عدالتوں نے غیر ضروری اپیلیں دائر کرنے پر شوہر پر جرمانہ عائد نہیں کیا۔

سپریم کورٹ کے فیصلے میں کہا گیا ہے کہ غیر ضروری اپیلوں پر جرمانہ کیا ہوتا تو نوبت یہاں تک نہ پہنچتی، غیر ضروری اپیلیں دائر کرنے سے عدالتی نظام مفلوج ہوتا جارہا ہے۔

فیصلے میں کہا گیا ہے کہ بلاوجہ کی مقدمہ بازی ختم کرنے کے لیے عدالتوں کو جرمانہ کرنے سے ہچکچانا نہیں چاہیے

Warrant issued by the Court can be cancelled by the Court which issued under Section 75 Cr.P.C.
Prime and basic purpose of issuance of process including summons, (naeem)warrants as well as proclamation is to bring the accused before the Court for facing the proceedings in the case; order in said regard is not judgment in terms of (naeem)Section 369 Cr.P.C. and on the basis of cogent, convincing and valid reasons, same can be recalled by the Court after surrender of the accused.

Recalling of Proclaimed Offender declaring order---Trail Court, powers of---As the accused did not appear before the Trial Court on date fixed for hearing; Trial court declared him as Proclaimed Offender (PO) carrying out the proceedings under S.87, Cr.P.C against him ('PO declaring order')---Thereafter, the accused, while marking his attendance before Trial Court, filed application for recalling of said 'PO declaring order'---Accused/appellant approached High Court as his application to re-call PO declaring order was dismissed by the Trial Court---Trial Court declined re-calling of PO declaring order,primarily, by holding that "… … Legality and propriety of such an order can be looked into by Hon'ble High Court being revisable under Ss.435 and 439 Cr.P.C. In view of above, application stands dismissed."---Validity---Basic and prime purpose of issuance of process through notice, summons, bailable warrants, non-bailable warrants as well as proclamation was to bring the accused in the court for facing the proceedings of the case in accordance with law---When application for re-calling of order dated 09.10.2024 was filed on behalf of appellant / accused and he (appellant) himself appeared/surrendered before the court then it was appropriate for the court either to take him into custody as his surety bond was already forfeited vide PO declaring order (dated 09.10.2024) or to recall the same (PO declaring order) if reasons were cogent, relevant and plausible for recalling the same, and undoubtedly PO declaring order (dated 09.10.2024) was not a judgment rather an interim order---Furthermore, pertinently, even warrant issued by the Court can be cancelled under S.75(2), Cr.P.C.by the Court which issued it---Application for recalling of order qua issuance of "warrant of arrest" or "proclamation" of accused is neither entertainable/maintainable nor proceedable without surrender of the accused in the Court---High Court, with the concurrence of the parties and for the safe administration of justice set-aside impugned order (dated 14.10.2024) passed by Trial Court and remanded the matter to the Trial Court where the application filed by the appellant / accused for re-calling of (PO declaring order) dated 09.10.2024 would be deemed as pending and if appellant surrendered before Trial Court on 11.11.2024 then said application would be decided through fresh order after hearing all concerned and strictly in accordance with law, however, if appellant did not surrender before Trial Court on 11.11.2024 then his application would not be proceedable---

سپریم کورٹ کا فیصلہ ۔۔۔۔ 
ملزم/درخواست گزار پر یہ الزام تھا کہ اس نے مدعی کی بیٹی کے ساتھ زبردستی زنا بالجبر کیا۔
اگرچہ متاثرہ لڑکی کے میڈیکو لیگل سرٹیفکیٹ اور فارنزک سائنس ایجنسی کی ڈی این اے رپورٹ سے یہ بات ظاہر ہوتی ہے کہ ملزم اور متاثرہ کے درمیان جنسی تعلق قائم ہوا، تاہم میڈیکو لیگل رپورٹ میں متاثرہ کے جسم پر کسی قسم کے تشدد یا جبر کے نشانات ظاہر نہیں ہوئے۔

لہٰذا یہ سوال کہ آیا مذکورہ جنسی تعلق رضامندی سے تھا یا زبردستی—ابھی ٹرائل کے دوران طے ہونا باقی ہے۔ اس مرحلے پر معاملہ مزید انکوائری کا متقاضی سمجھا گیا، جس کے باعث ملزم کو ضمانت دی گئی۔

خلاصہ قانونی نکتہ
صرف ڈی این اے یا میڈیکو لیگل رپورٹ سے جنسی تعلق ثابت ہو جانا بذاتِ خود زنا بالجبر ثابت کرنے کے لیے کافی نہیں، جب تک رضامندی یا جبر کا پہلو واضح طور پر ثابت نہ ہو؛ ایسی صورت میں ضمانت دی جا سکتی ہے۔

 — ضمانت (Bail)
سزائے موت یا عمر قید والے مقدمات میں ضمانت اصولاً ممنوع، مگر اگر

شواہد میں شک ہو،

یا معاملہ مزید انکوائری 
(Further Inquiry) 
میں آتا ہو،
تو ضمانت دی جا سکتی ہے۔

(ب) “مزید انکوائری” کا تصور
جب استغاثہ کے شواہد ابتدائی مرحلے پر حتمی یقین پیدا نہ کریں۔

اگر رضامندی بمقابلہ جبر کا سوال واضح نہ ہو اور ٹرائل کا متقاضی ہو۔

عدالتی اصول: ضمانت کے مرحلے پر حتمی فیصلہ نہیں دیا جاتا؛ صرف یہ دیکھا جاتا ہے کہ آیا ملزم کا کیس مزید انکوائری میں آتا ہے یا نہیں۔

3) میڈیکل جریسپرڈینس 
(Medical Jurisprudence) 
کا تجزیہ
(الف) میڈیکو لیگل سرٹیفکیٹ (MLC)
زنا بالجبر کے مقدمات میں تشدد، مزاحمت، چوٹوں کی علامات اہم قرائن سمجھی جاتی ہیں

تازہ خراشیں

زخم

جسمانی مزاحمت کے آثار

اگر ایسے آثار موجود نہ ہوں تو:

جبر کا پہلو کمزور پڑ جاتا ہے

اور رضامندی کا امکان زیرِ بحث آتا ہے

(ب) ڈی این اے رپورٹ
ڈی این اے رپورٹ صرف یہ ثابت کرتی ہے کہ:

جنسی تعلق ہوا

ڈی این اے یہ ثابت نہیں کرتی کہ:

تعلق زبردستی تھا یا رضامندی سے

طے شدہ اصول
DNA evidence is confirmatory of intercourse, not of consent or force.

4) تعزیراتِ پاکستان 
(PPC) 
کے تحت قانونی پہلو
دفعہ 375 PPC — زنا کی تعریف
زنا بالجبر ثابت کرنے کے لیے ضروری ہے:

عدمِ رضامندی

یا زبردستی / جبر / خوف

اگر رضامندی کا سوال پیدا ہو جائے:

تو جرم کی نوعیت متنازع ہو جاتی ہے

اور معاملہ ٹرائل کا تقاضا کرتا ہے

دفعہ 376 PPC — سزا
سزا کا تعین ثبوتِ جبر پر منحصر ہے

محض تعلق کا ثابت ہونا کافی نہیں

5) عدالتی جریسپرڈینس 
(Judicial Jurisprudence)
(الف) سپریم کورٹ کے مسلمہ اصول
زنا بالجبر کے مقدمات میں

صرف الزام کافی نہیں

قرائنِ جبر کا واضح ہونا ضروری ہے

جہاں

MLC تشدد ظاہر نہ کرے

اور رضامندی کا سوال اٹھے
تو کیس
 Further Inquiry
 میں آتا ہے

(ب) 2025 SCMR 1952
 کا نچوڑ
عدالت نے قرار دیا

ڈی این اے اور MLC سے جنسی تعلق ثابت

مگر جبر ثابت نہیں

لہٰذا

رضامندی یا عدمِ رضامندی کا فیصلہ ٹرائل میں ہوگا

ضمانت دی جا سکتی ہے

6) شہادت کے قانون 
(Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984) 
کا اطلاق
آرٹیکل 117 — بوجھِ ثبوت

ٹرائل مکمل شہادت، جرح، حتمی فیصلہ

8) نتیجاً مختصراً 
 (Conclusion)

2025 SCMR 1952 
ایک اہم نظیر ہے جو واضح کرتی ہے کہ

ڈی این اے رپورٹ بذاتِ خود زنا بالجبر ثابت نہیں کرتی

میڈیکو لیگل رپورٹ میں تشدد کی عدم موجودگی، رضامندی کے سوال کو جنم دیتی ہے

ایسے حالات میں معاملہ
 Further Inquiry 
کا بنتا ہے

اور دفعہ 497 Cr.P.C.
 کے تحت ضمانت دی جا سکتی ہے

[1/7/26, 5:17:20 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: VVVVI. MUST READ JUDGEMENT

The legal framework governing gifts under Muslim law. 
..........

A gift, or Hiba, is defined in Hedaya as the donation of a thing from which the donee may derive a benefit. In legal terms, it refers to the immediate and unconditional transfer of property without any consideration or exchange . 

Similarly, Mulla defines a hiba or gift as "a transfer of property, made immediately and without any exchange," by one person to another, and accepted by or on behalf of the latter. The Principles of Mohammedan Law by D.F Mulla outlines three essential conditions for the validity of a gift under Section 149 thereof which reads as under:- 

(i) A clear and unequivocal declaration of the gift by the donor,

(ii) Acceptance of the gift, either express or implied, by or on behalf of the donee, and

(iii) Delivery of possession of the subject matter of the gift by the donor to the donee, as further explained in Section 150.  

The fulfillment of these conditions renders the gift complete and legally valid. Needless to mention that gift can be made orally and requires no registration, even writing is not necessary to the validity of the gift made regarding immovable property.

PLD 2025 SC 339
M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE
[1/7/26, 5:17:23 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: It is also well settled that in the case of a gift of immovable property by the husband to the wife, the fact that the husband continues to live in the house gifted or to receive the rents after the date of gift, will not invalidate the gift, the presumption being that the rents are collected by the husband as a rent collector on behalf of the wife and not on his own accord.  
Civil Petition No.552-K of 2021 & 1108-K of 2023 
Syed Masood Ali Versus Mst. Feroza Begum and another
PLD 2025 SC 339
M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE
[1/7/26, 5:17:23 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Under Mohammadan Law, the concept of spes successionis (the mere hope or expectation of inheriting) is not recognized, meaning a presumptive heir has no rights in the property of the deceased until his death occurs. Therefore, the appellants, as potential heirs, could not challenge the validity of the gift made by their father. 

The donor, having made the gift voluntarily, affirmed it during his lifetime, and never questioned its validity before his death, leaving his successors (legal heirs) without standing to dispute the gift’s validity.

*"آڈیو/ویڈیو/تصاویر جو پنجاب سیف سٹی اتھارٹی سے حاصل کی  گئی ہیں، ان کے شواہد کے طور پر قابل قبول ہونے کے لیے ایک مختلف ضابطہ یا طریقہ کار موجود ہے۔"*

*امجد رفیق جسٹس کے فیصلہ* 

*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
قانون شہادت (Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984) کے مطابق آڈیو، ویڈیو، اور تصاویر جیسے ڈیجیٹل شواہد کے قابل قبول ہونے کا تجزیاتی جائزہ درج ذیل نکات کی روشنی میں پیش کیا جا سکتا ہے:

1. ثبوت کی نوعیت اور قانونی دائرہ کار
آرٹیکل 46-A: قانون شہادت کے تحت الیکٹرانک ریکارڈز کو بطور ثبوت قبول کیا جا سکتا ہے، بشرطیکہ ان کی صداقت اور اصلیت ثابت ہو۔
آڈیو/ویڈیو یا تصاویر کی قانونی حیثیت کا انحصار اس پر ہے کہ آیا یہ حقیقی اور مستند ہیں یا نہیں۔
پنجاب سیف سٹی اتھارٹی (PSCA): چونکہ یہ مواد سرکاری اتھارٹی سے حاصل کیا جاتا ہے، اس لیے اس کی ساکھ کو زیادہ وزن دیا جاتا ہے، بشرطیکہ اتھارٹی کی جانب سے اس کی تصدیق کی گئی ہو۔
2. صداقت کی تصدیق
قانون شہادت کے مطابق کسی ڈیجیٹل ثبوت کو قبول کرنے کے لیے ضروری ہے کہ:
مواد کے ذریعے چھیڑ چھاڑ نہ کی گئی ہو۔
ماخذ (source) اور چین آف کسٹڈی (chain of custody) محفوظ ہو۔
ماہرین یا تکنیکی افراد کی گواہی سے اس کی تصدیق کی جائے۔
3. چین آف کسٹڈی کی اہمیت
شواہد کے طور پر پیش کیے جانے والے ڈیجیٹل مواد کے لیے چین آف کسٹڈی کا محفوظ ہونا ضروری ہے تاکہ یہ ثابت کیا جا سکے کہ یہ مواد اپنی اصل حالت میں موجود ہے۔
سیف سٹی اتھارٹی کی جانب سے فراہم کردہ مواد کی چین آف کسٹڈی عام طور پر محفوظ تصور کی جاتی ہے۔
4. آرٹیکل 73 اور 78 کے تحت تکنیکی ثبوت
آرٹیکل 73 اور 78 قانون شہادت کے تحت، ڈیجیٹل مواد کو بطور ثبوت قبول کرنے کے لیے ضروری ہے کہ:
اس کے ساتھ سرٹیفکیٹ ہو جس میں یہ بیان کیا گیا ہو کہ مواد کو کس طرح حاصل کیا گیا۔
سرٹیفکیٹ معلومات فراہم کرے کہ یہ مواد کسی مستند اور قابل اعتماد ذریعے سے حاصل کیا گیا ہے۔
5. سپریم کورٹ اور اعلیٰ عدلیہ کے فیصلے
مختلف عدالتی فیصلوں کے مطابق، ڈیجیٹل شواہد کی قبولیت کا انحصار اس کی اہمیت اور صداقت پر ہوتا ہے۔
عدالت یہ بھی دیکھتی ہے کہ:
آیا مواد مقدمے سے متعلق ہے۔
آیا اس مواد کو پیش کرنے سے کسی کے بنیادی حقوق متاثر تو نہیں ہو رہے۔
6. پنجاب سیف سٹی اتھارٹی کے شواہد کی خصوصیات
سیف سٹی اتھارٹی کے مواد کو قابل اعتماد مانا جاتا ہے کیونکہ:
یہ سرکاری طور پر ریکارڈ کیا جاتا ہے۔
اس میں چھیڑ چھاڑ کے امکانات کم ہوتے ہیں۔
اس کا تکنیکی معیار (timestamps، GPS coordinates وغیرہ) عدالت کو اصل واقعہ سمجھنے میں مدد دیتا ہے۔
7. چیلنجز اور دفاع
مخالف وکیل ایسے شواہد کو چیلنج کر سکتا ہے:
ماخذ پر سوال اٹھا کر۔
چھیڑ چھاڑ کا دعویٰ کر کے۔
صداقت اور مواد کے حاصل کرنے کے طریقے کو غیر قانونی قرار دے کر۔
نتیجہ
قانون شہادت کے مطابق، پنجاب سیف سٹی اتھارٹی سے حاصل کردہ آڈیو، ویڈیو، یا تصاویر کو قابل قبول مانا جا سکتا ہے، بشرطیکہ:

ان کی صداقت کو ثابت کیا جائے۔
قانونی تقاضے (چین آف کسٹڈی، تکنیکی سرٹیفکیٹ) پورے کیے جائیں۔
مواد براہ راست مقدمے سے متعلق ہو۔
عدالت اس بات کا فیصلہ کرے گی کہ آیا پیش کیے گئے شواہد اصل، مستند، اور انصاف کے تقاضوں کے مطابق ہیں یا نہیں۔

Nine guiding principles about Last Seen evidence discussed

 	 
2017 SCMR 2036

Right of private defence of the body and property extending to causing death of trespasser---Scope---Law gave right to the occupant of any property to expel any intruder/trespasser and if the trespasser had made a trespass for illicit matters then, the right of self-defence of property and person was further fortified even to the extent of causing death of trespasser if he did not retreat after having been told or warned to retreat.--- in many cases of such nature the police deliberately avoid requesting the Medico-legal Officer to examine the private parts and clothes of the deceased/injured or the accused connected with the crime after getting swabs from their private parts for chemical examination; that such an opinion was important to facilitate the courts in reaching a just and proper conclusion.
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
 	 
PLD 2016 SC 17

The real question involved was as to whether or not a person could be said to be justified in killing another person on his own on the basis of an unverified impression or an unestablished perception that such other person had committed blasphemy…----Extra-judicial actions---Law did not permit an individual to arrogate unto himself the roles of a complainant, prosecutor, judge and executioner

 	 
PLD 2016 SC 55

Orders passed either under S.203, Cr.P.C. whereby a direct complaint was dismissed or under S.204, Cr.P.C. whereby the Court had taken cognizance of an offence complained of and issued warrants or summons for causing the accused to be brought or produced before the Court were judicial orders…. Exercise of jurisdiction under S.561-A, Cr.P.C. by the High Court was akin to the exercise of jurisdiction under Art.199 of the Constitution… Remedy under S.561-A, Cr.P.C was not an alternate and or substitute for an express remedy as provided under the law in terms of S.435 to 439, Cr.P.C and or Ss.249-A or 265-K, Cr.P.C, as the case may be… Two courts having co-extensive or concurrent jurisdiction---Propriety demanded that jurisdiction of court of the lower grade was to be invoked in the first instance

 	 
2021 P Cr. L J 1558

Further Cross Examination Deprecated

 	 
2016 SCMR 116

Partial compromise may not have any bearing upon conviction of an accused person in a case of Ta'zir but it may have, in the circumstances of a given case, some relevance to the question of sentence in such a case

 	 
2016 SCMR 274

Confession was recorded by magistrate on oath---violated the law and rendered it in-admissible—

 	 
2016 SCMR 291

Art. 185(3) ---Leave granting order by Supreme Court---Such order had no binding effect against the settled propositions on an issue. Waiver or compounding of offence---Scope---Conviction and death sentence recorded under S. 302(b), P.P.C. and S. 7(a) of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997---Offence under S. 7(a) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 was an independent one, which was non-compoundable, thus the sentence awarded under said provision of law was independent to other sentences under S. 302(b), P.P.C. etc., which may be compoundable in nature---In view of the bar contained in S. 345(7), Cr.P.C., conviction of an accused under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 would remain intact despite compromise in other sentences in compoundable offence.

 	 
2016 SCMR 467

Sentences passed against accused in more than one trial---Power of court to order concurrent running of such sentences---Court, while analyzing the facts and circumstances of every case, was competent to direct that sentences in two different trials (of an accused) would run concurrently---Provision of S. 397, Cr.P.C. conferred wide discretion on the Court to extend such benefit to the accused in a case of peculiar nature.

 	 
2016 SCMR 787

Section 196 of Cr.P.C barred the Court from taking cognizance of an offence under section 295-A of P.P.C., without requisite sanction/approval/permission (of the Government) and failure to obtain such mandatory permission rendered the proceedings to that extent a nullity in law. However, bar of taking cognizance provided under section 196, Cr.P.C would not apply to the proceedings before the Anti-Terrorism Courts in view of the combined effect of sections 12, 19, 30 and 32 and the overriding effect of section 32 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, being proceedings under
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
 	 
2016 SCMR 1144

Extra-judicial confession, reliance upon---Scope---Such confession could be concocted easily therefore, it was always looked at with doubt and suspicion---Extra-judicial confession could be taken as corroborative of the charge if it, in the first instance, rang true and then found support from other evidence of unimpeachable character---If the other evidence lacked such attribute, such confession had to be excluded from consideration… Recovery evidence, reliance upon---Scope---Recovery evidence at its best could be taken as corroborative rather than evidence of the charge---Such evidence per se did not name or nominate any accused, nor did it prove or point to his guilt; it simply supplemented the other evidence on the record, if it in its own right, inspired confidence…---Circumstantial evidence could form basis of conviction if it was incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt.

 	 
2016 SCMR 1190

Ss. 345, 367(2) & (3)---Penal Code (XLV of 1860), Ss. 302(b), 34 & 404---Anti-Terrorism Act (XXVII of 1997), S. 7(a)---Accused charged with both compoundable and non-compoundable offences---Legal error committed by Trial Court in not recording separate conviction and sentence for the non-compoundable offence---High Court also failing to notice such error---Compromise between parties for the compoundable offence---Effect---Conviction and sentence for the non-compoundable offence had to be recorded separately and could not be implied---Matter of conviction and sentence for the non-compoundable offence had become a past and closed transaction---Compromise between the parties for the compoundable offence should not have been rejected in such circumstances.

 	 
2016 SCMR 2084

S. 539-B---Power of local inspection---Scope---Section 539-B, Cr.P.C. gave power to a trial Judge or a Magistrate to visit and inspect the place of occurrence or any other place after due notice to the parties, if necessary for properly appreciating the evidence given during the trial---Such power could not be delegated by the trial Judge to any other subordinate or even a subordinate judicial officer to visit the place of occurrence as a Commission. Power under section 539-B, Cr.P.C. could not be a substitute for collection of evidence. Power of inspection under section 539-B, Cr.P.C could not be interchanged for investigation… Art. 164---Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage---Evidentiary value---Mere producing of CCTV footage as a piece of evidence in court was not sufficient to rely upon the same unless and until it was proved to be genuine---In order to prove the genuineness of such footage

PLD 2015 SC 77

Judgment on Compromise in Qisas as well as Tazir cases

 	 
PLD 2015 SC 66

Ss. 497 & 200 ---Bail, grant of---Scope---Private complaint and challan case---Accused was granted bail by High Court on the ground that a private complaint had already been filed by the complainant against accused regarding the same incident and, thus, further detention of accused in the challan case had become illegal---Legality---High Court had referred to no provision of law for declaring continued custody of accused in jail in connection with the challan case as "illegal"---Bail granted to accused was set aside in circumstances.

 	 
PLD 2015 SC 307

S. 537---Sentence when reversible by reason of error or omission in charge or other proceedings---Scope---Sentence could be reversed and altered provided it had occasioned a failure of justice.

 	 
2015 SCMR 258

Arts. 13 & 185---Double jeopardy---Death sentence, award of---Convict awarded death sentence undergoing a period of custody equal to more than a full term imprisonment for life during pendency of his legal remedy against his death sentence---Question was as to whether maintaining of death sentence by the Supreme Court would amount to double punishment---Held, when the conviction or acquittal of a person was under challenge in appeal or revision, the proceedings were neither fresh prosecution nor there was any question of second conviction or double jeopardy

2014 SCMR 474

S. 173---Police Order (22 of 2002), Art. 18---Re-investigation of case by police after filing of final Challan in Trial Court---Not barred---Exception stated. There is no bar to the reinvestigation of a criminal case, and the police authorities are at liberty to file a supplementary Challan even after submission of the final report under section 173, Cr.P.C. However, this cannot be done after the case has been disposed by the Trial Court…Police Order (22 of 2002), Art. 18(6)---Re-investigation of case after Trial Court upheld deletion of S. 308, P.P.C. from F.I.R. by Investigation Officer---Scope---Charge under S. 308, P.P.C. could be framed against accused in case sufficient material was brought on record to prove commission of such offence and convinced Trial Court to do so

S. 154---F.I.R.---Evidentiary value and relevance---F.I.R. was not a substantive piece of evidence, but simply an information about the occurrence laid before the law enforcing agency to set the law into motion for the purpose of investigation---F.I.R. could not be given weight as substantive piece of evidence for the simple reason that its contents were neither recorded on oath nor it could be subjected to the test of cross-examination through some other prosecution witness, so as to be considered a substantive piece of evidence worth any credence---Narration of facts in the F.I.R. could not be made basis for getting contradictions in the prosecution case or discarding ocular testimony on such premise--- At best F.I.R. could be considered as a piece of document to which the complainant, when he appeared in the witness box, could be confronted with its contents.

Sentence, reduction in---Death sentence reduced to imprisonment for life---Motive not proved--Failure of prosecution to prove the motive set up may have a bearing upon the question of sentence and in an appropriate case such
failure may result in reduction of a death sentence to that of imprisonment for life for safe administration of justic

High Court convicted the accused under S.311, P.P.C. despite the compromise effected between the parties---Validity---Section 311, P.P.C. was attracted in cases punishable with "Qisas" and not to cases punishable under "Ta'azir" No clear evidence was available to constitute the offence involving the element/mischief of fasad-fil-arz, thus the High Court was not justified in law to convert the punishment of the accused to one under S. 311, P.P.C instead of acquitting them on the basis of compromise---High Court had committed a legal error in convicting and sentencing the accused for crime under S. 311, P.P.C., which caused serious miscarriage of justice-

[1/7/26, 5:17:48 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: ڈسٹری بیوٹرز پر منیمم ٹیکس سے متعلق اہم عدالتی فیصلہ

لاہور ہائی کورٹ نے ڈسٹری بیوٹرز پر منیمم ٹیکس (سیکشن 113، انکم ٹیکس آرڈیننس 2001) کے اطلاق سے متعلق ایک انتہائی اہم اور وضاحتی فیصلہ جاری کرتے ہوئے واضح کر دیا ہے کہ ڈسٹری بیوٹر کی گراس رسیٹس سے مراد صرف اس کا اصل مارجن / کمیشن ہے، نہ کہ کمپنی کی جانب سے فراہم کی جانے والی اشیاء کی مکمل سیلز ویلیو۔
یہ فیصلہ Commissioner of Income Tax بنام M/s Allied Marketing (Pvt.) Ltd
(ITR No. 377/2015) کے مقدمہ میں سنایا گیا۔
عدالت کے روبرو ٹیکس ڈیپارٹمنٹ کا مؤقف تھا کہ ڈسٹری بیوٹر کی کل گراس سیلز پر منیمم ٹیکس عائد کیا جانا چاہیے، جبکہ ٹیکس پیئر نے مؤقف اختیار کیا کہ وہ اشیاء کا مالک نہیں بلکہ کمپنی کی جانب سے متعین مارجن پر ڈسٹری بیوشن سروس فراہم کرتا ہے، اس لیے ٹیکس صرف اسی اصل کمائی پر لاگو ہونا چاہیے۔
لاہور ہائی کورٹ نے ٹیکس پیئر کے مؤقف کو تسلیم کرتے ہوئے قرار دیا کہ:
ڈسٹری بیوٹر اشیاء اپنی ملکیت میں خرید و فروخت نہیں کرتا
اس کی آمدن صرف فکسڈ مارجن / کمیشن تک محدود ہوتی ہے
پوری سیلز ویلیو کو ٹرن اوور قرار دینا قانون اور معاشی حقیقت کے منافی ہے
مزید برآں، محکمہ ٹیکس ماضی میں بھی اسی طریقہ کار کو تسلیم کرتا رہا ہے، لہٰذا Consistency کا اصول لاگو ہوگا
عدالتی فیصلے کے مطابق ڈسٹری بیوٹرز پر منیمم ٹیکس فرضی یا کاغذی ٹرن اوور کے بجائے اصل کمائی پر ہی عائد کیا جا سکتا ہے۔
ماہرینِ ٹیکس کے مطابق یہ فیصلہ ڈسٹری بیوشن سیکٹر کے لیے ایک مضبوط قانونی تحفظ فراہم کرتا ہے اور ٹیکس نظام میں انصاف، شفافیت اور کاروباری حقیقت کے تقاضوں کو تقویت دیتا ہے۔

[1/9/26, 11:16:25 AM] ~ 🥰AB GROUPS PTV.LTD: قانونِ شہادت میں 41 سال بعد ایک لفظ کی دریافت

قانونِ شہادت آرڈر 1984 میں حالیہ ترمیم بظاہر ایک معمولی لسانی اصلاح معلوم ہوتی ہے، مگر درحقیقت یہ ترمیم کئی سنجیدہ قانونی اور فکری سوالات کو جنم دیتی ہے۔ آرٹیکل 113 میں استعمال ہونے والے الفاظ “rule or pleading” کو تبدیل کر کے “rule of pleading” کر دیا گیا ہے۔ کہا جا رہا ہے کہ اصل لفظ “or” نہیں بلکہ “of” ہونا چاہیے تھا۔
حیرت انگیز پہلو یہ ہے کہ قانون کے نفاذ کے پورے اکتالیس برس تک: نہ کسی ماتحت عدالت نے، نہ کسی ہائی کورٹ یا سپریم کورٹ نے، نہ کسی وکیل نے، اور نہ ہی کسی رپورٹ شدہ عدالتی فیصلے میں
یہ کہا گیا کہ آرٹیکل 113 کے الفاظ کسی قانونی یا عملی غلطی کا باعث بن رہے ہیں۔

یہ سوال فطری طور پر جنم لیتا ہے کہ اگر واقعی یہ ایک واضح قانونی سقم تھا تو چار دہائیوں تک یہ سقم سب کی نگاہوں سے اوجھل کیسے رہا؟ کیا یہ ممکن ہے کہ جس چیز کو آج غلطی کہا جا رہا ہے، وہ دراصل ایک قابلِ قبول اور مستحکم عدالتی تشریح کے تحت برسوں سے نافذ ہوتی رہی ہو؟

قانونی تشریح کے مسلمہ اصولوں کے مطابق، جب کوئی قانونی عبارت طویل عرصے تک بلا کسی عملی دشواری کے عدالتوں میں نافذ ہوتی رہے تو اسے عدالتی قبولیت (judicial acceptance) حاصل ہو جاتی ہے۔ ایسے میں بعد ازاں کی جانے والی تبدیلی کو محض “غلطی کی اصلاح” کہنا ہمیشہ درست نہیں ہوتا، بلکہ یہ اکثر ایک نئی تشریعی سمت (interpretative shift) کی نشاندہی کرتی ہے۔

لفظ “or” قانون میں وسعت اور متبادل کے مفہوم کا حامل ہوتا ہے، جبکہ “of” تحدید اور تخصیص کا اظہار کرتا ہے۔ اس تبدیلی کے نتیجے میں آرٹیکل 113 کے دائرۂ کار کو محدود کیا جا سکتا ہے، جو ماضی کے عدالتی اطلاق سے مختلف نتائج پیدا کر سکتا ہے۔ سوال یہ ہے کہ کیا پارلیمان کا یہ اقدام قانونی وضاحت کے لیے ہے یا قانون کے عملی مفہوم میں خاموش تبدیلی کے مترادف؟

اصل مسئلہ ایک لفظ کا نہیں، بلکہ قانونی یقین (certainty of law) کا ہے۔ اگر ہر چند دہائیوں بعد یہ احساس ہونے لگے کہ قانون میں استعمال ہونے والے الفاظ غلط تھے، تو پھر عدالتی فیصلوں کے استحکام اور قانونی تسلسل پر سوال اٹھنا ناگزیر ہے۔

ضرورت اس امر کی ہے کہ ایسی ترامیم کو عدالتیں محتاط انداز میں دیکھیں اور انہیں ماضی کے بجائے مستقبل (prospective effect) تک محدود رکھیں، تاکہ وہ عدالتی فیصلے جو برسوں سے ایک مستحکم تشریح کے تحت کیے جا چکے ہیں، غیر ضروری ابہام کا شکار نہ ہوں۔

قانون الفاظ سے بنتا ہے، مگر اس کی روح تسلسل، استحکام اور اعتماد میں پوشیدہ ہوتی ہے۔ ایک لفظ کی اصلاح اگر اس روح کو مجروح کرے، تو اس پر سوال اٹھانا نہ صرف جائز بلکہ ضروری بھی ہے۔

 Bail in Gang Rape / Sodomy Cases

(Ss. 375-A, 377 & 34 PPC read with S. 497(2) Cr.P.C)

---

Facts of Case

الزام: درخواست گزار نے شریک ملزم کے ساتھ مل کر شکایت کنندہ کے بیٹے کو اسلحہ کے زور پر اغوا کیا۔

بعد ازاں متاثرہ نے بتایا کہ دونوں نے اس کے ساتھ sodomy کی۔

Court’s Observations

1. ملزم گرفتاری کے بعد سے جیل میں ہے۔

2. S.173 Cr.P.C کے تحت چالان جمع ہو چکا ہے لیکن ٹرائل میں کوئی پیش رفت نہیں۔

3. ملزم کو غیر معینہ مدت تک جیل میں رکھنا prosecution کے مفاد میں نہیں۔

4. کیس further inquiry (S.497(2)) کے زمرے میں آتا ہے۔

Held

کیس مزید تفتیش طلب ہے۔

Post-arrest bail منظور۔

---

Part 2:  Page 1223

Facts

الزام: درخواست گزار اور ایک شریک ملزم نے شکایت کنندہ کے بیٹے کو اغوا کیا اور sodomy کا نشانہ بنایا۔

prosecution witnesses موقع پر موجود تھے۔

Court’s Observations

1. گواہوں کا رویہ غیر فطری اور مشکوک تھا:

انہوں نے نہ تو مزاحمت کی، نہ پولیس کو اطلاع دی۔

ملزم نے متاثرہ کو بینک کے قریب چھوڑا، لیکن گواہوں نے پھر بھی ملزم کو فرار ہونے دیا۔

2. ان گواہوں کا مسلسل موجود رہنا اور کچھ نہ کرنا شک و شبہ پیدا کرتا ہے۔

3. گواہوں کی گواہی مزید تفتیش کی متقاضی ہے۔

Held

کیس further inquiry کے زمرے میں آتا ہے۔

Post-arrest bail منظور۔

---

Part 3: [b] Page 1223

Facts

الزام: درخواست گزار نے شریک ملزم کے ساتھ مل کر متاثرہ کے ساتھ sodomy کی۔

Court’s Observations

1. جرم کی سنگینی (severity) ضمانت رد کرنے کی بنیاد نہیں ہو سکتی۔

2. اصول: ملزم بے گناہ ہے جب تک جرم ثابت نہ ہو (Presumption of Innocence)۔

3. S.497(2) Cr.P.C → اگر کیس further inquiry کے زمرے میں آئے → ضمانت دینی چاہیے۔

4. عدالت نے کہا کہ ضمانت سزا نہیں ہے بلکہ قانونی ریلیف ہے۔

5. Bail ایک discretionary relief ہے اور عدالت کو انصاف و قانون کے مطابق اسے استعمال کرنا ہے۔

Held

کیس مزید تفتیش طلب ہے۔

Post-arrest bail منظور۔

---

Legal Principles Derived

1. Further Inquiry (S.497(2) Cr.P.C):

اگر شواہد مشکوک ہوں، گواہوں کا کردار غیر فطری ہو، یا واقعات میں تضاد ہو → further inquiry بنتی ہے۔

2. Severity of Offence ≠ Bail Refusal:

صرف جرم سنگین ہونے کی بنیاد پر ضمانت رد نہیں ہو سکتی۔

3. Right to Liberty & Fair Trial (Art. 10-A Constitution):

ملزم کو غیر معینہ مدت تک جیل میں رکھنا بنیادی حقوق کے خلاف ہے۔

4. Conduct of Witnesses:

اگر گواہ مشکوک رویہ اختیار کریں یا واقعہ کے بعد کچھ نہ کریں تو ان کی گواہی further inquiry پیدا کرتی ہے۔

5. Discretion of Court:

ضمانت سزا نہیں ہے بلکہ قانونی حق ہے → عدالت اسے انصاف کے ساتھ استعمال کرے۔

نتیجہ (Conclusion)

تینوں فیصلوں میں عدالت نے یہ اصول وضع کیا کہ:

Ss. 375-A, 377 & 34 PPC جیسے سنگین جرائم میں بھی اگر شواہد مشکوک ہوں، گواہوں کا کردار غیر فطری ہو، ٹرائل رکا ہوا ہو، یا کیس further inquiry کا متقاضی ہو → S.497(2) Cr.P.C کے تحت ضمانت دی جا سکتی ہے۔

عدالت نے بنیادی اصول دہرا دیا: Liberty is the rule, jail is an exception until guilt is proved.

 - محمد عابد حسین بمقابلہ ریاست اور دوسرا

سپریم کورٹ آف پاکستان نے ایک بار پھر اس بات پر زور دیا کہ منشیات کے مقدمات میں بازیابی کی کارروائی کے لیے سیکشن 103 سی آر پی سی کی سختی سے پیروی کی جانی چاہیے، جس کے تحت پولیس کو تلاشی اور ضبطی کے دوران علاقے سے نجی گواہوں (آزاد گواہوں) کو جوڑنے کی ضرورت ہے۔ عدالت نے کہا کہ جب پولیس سیکشن 103 کی تعمیل کرنے میں ناکام رہتی ہے - خاص طور پر سی این ایس اے 1997 کے سیکشن 9 (سی) کے تحت سخت سزائیں دینے والے جرائم میں، سخت سزا کے معاملات میں، استغاثہ کو ملزم کا جرم ثابت کرنے کے لیے واضح، ٹھوس اور قابل اعتماد شواہد پیش کرنا ہوں گے، انہیں کم از کم ویڈیو ریکارڈنگ یا ویڈیو ریکارڈنگ کے تحت دوبارہ ریکارڈنگ کو یقینی بنانا ہوگا۔ قانون شہادت آرڈر، 1984 کا 164۔ آرٹیکل 164 جدید آلات کے ذریعے حاصل کیے گئے شواہد کے استعمال کی اجازت دیتا ہے، اور عدالت نے اس بات پر زور دیا کہ ایسے ڈیجیٹل شواہد اب اختیاری نہیں ہیں لیکن انصاف کو برقرار رکھنے، جھوٹے مضمرات کو روکنے، اور شفافیت کو یقینی بنانے کے لیے ضروری ہیں اور QSO آرٹیکل 165 دیگر تمام قوانین کو زیر کرتا ہے اور QSO 6 کے آرٹیکل 4 پر عمل کرنا ضروری ہے۔ شواہد اور آزاد گواہ، استغاثہ کا مقدمہ چھاپے میں ملوث پولیس افسران کی گواہی پر منحصر تھا، جو ثبوت کے مطلوبہ معیار پر پورا اترنے کے لیے ناکافی تھا۔

زاہد سرفراز گل بمقابلہ ریاست (2024 SCMR 934) اور منظور بمقابلہ ریاست (PLD 1972 SC 81) جیسی سابقہ ​​نظیروں پر انحصار کرتے ہوئے عدالت نے اس بات کا اعادہ کیا کہ جہاں پولیس نہ تو آزاد گواہوں کو جوڑتی ہے اور نہ ہی ڈیجیٹل ثبوت کو محفوظ رکھتی ہے، استغاثہ کا مقدمہ اس قدر شکوک و شبہات کا شکار ہو جاتا ہے کہ افسران کے بیانات پر شکوک و شبہات پیدا ہوں۔ موجودہ کیس میں، 1100 گرام ہیروئن کی برآمدگی کو نہ تو کسی نجی گواہ نے سپورٹ کیا اور نہ ہی کسی ویڈیو ریکارڈنگ نے، بار بار عدالتی ہدایات کے باوجود ثبوت اکٹھا کرنے کی جدید تکنیک اپنائی۔ یہ نوٹ کرتے ہوئے کہ کسی بے گناہ کی غلط قید سے معاوضہ نہیں لیا جا سکتا، عدالت نے ملزم کی بعد از گرفتاری ضمانت منظور کرتے ہوئے کہا کہ منشیات کے مقدمات میں شہری کو آزادی سے محروم کرنے سے پہلے سخت قانونی تعمیل اور قابل اعتماد شواہد ضروری ہیں۔

Mulla's Principles of Mohammedan Law, list certain conditions that purportedly determine a wife's entitlement to maintenance, such as obedience, cohabitation, and fulfilling of marital obligations The judicial reliance on such conditions has resulted in a subjective framework where maintenance claims are often decided based on a judge's discretion rather than consistent legal standards---Thus, there is no uniformity among scholarly consensus on whether such conditions must be met-Some jurists argue that compliance is necessary for a wife to claim maintenance, others maintain that maintenance is an unconditional right during the subsistence of marriage, and that a wife's refusal to live with her husband does not disentitle her to claim maintenance---Principles contained in Mohammedan Law could only be consulted as a reference book; they cannot be termed to be statutory law having binding effect, upon which any presumption could be drawn against a person---It was neither a statute, nor a custom or usage, therefore, the opinion of author of the book was not binding---It is settled law by now that the courts can indeed deviate from the viewpoint taken in the Mohammedan Law, especially if it is contrary to the principles of equity, good conscience and justice.

JUDGEMENT
..................---By means of instant criminal revision under Section 435/439 of Cr.P.C. read with Section 9 of Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 ('the Act'), petitioner has challenged the order dated 25.09.2024 handed down by learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Mandi Bahauddin whereby petitioner has been directed to hand over the possession of one room in the subject property to the respondent No.2/complainant.

2.    Pithily, on 04.06.2024, respondent No.2 filed a private complaint under Section 3 of the Act against the petitioner before the Court of Addl. Sessions Judge, Mandi Bahauddin maintaining that he was the owner of the property/plot No.54 and he constructed house over it. The petitioner, who is real nephew of respondent No.2, dispossessed him from the said house in the month of March, 2022.

3.    Learned trial court recorded cursory statement of the respondent No.2 as well as his witnesses on 27.06.2024 and petitioner/accused was summoned on 22.08.2024, thereafter the court summoned report from S.H.O. regarding previous and present possession over the disputed house, in pursuance of the same, detailed report was submitted on 15.09.2024. On 25.09.2024, the learned trial court passed the order/direction to the petitioner/accused to hand over the possession of one room in the subject property to respondent No.2/complainant. Feeling dismayed, petitioner brought the instant criminal revision.

4.    Mr. Khalid Pervaiz Warriach, Advocate learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that impugned order is not sustainable either in law or on facts. The police had submitted report in clear words that the possession of the subject property was with Muhammad Afzal, petitioner as well as brother of the complainant. While referring to Section 7 of the Act, further adds that possession cannot be restored to the complainant as an interim relief before trial. The Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 was enacted on 30.06.2005 and it was published in the Gazette of Pakistan on 07.07.2005. Police report clearly conveys that petitioner was in possession of the house from almost 35 years, with the strength of that report, says that petitioner was in possession of the house before enactment of the Act. The Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 is not applicable with retrospective effect.

5.    Mr. Aftab Hussain, Advocate learned counsel for the respondent No.2/complainant while opposing the said contentions and supporting the impugned order, contends that petitioner was an illegal occupant whereas the respondent No.2 was owner of the house. The petitioner was directed only to hand over possession of one room as an interim relief.

6.    Hearkened, record perused.

7.    Statutes are undoubtedly an important source of law, but their effectualness as law has a great deal to do with the way they are regarded by the judges of any country. The brute fact remains that the statutes do not interpret themselves. Their meaning, their import and their application to the concrete situation of life, must await the sanction of the court and, to borrow the felicitous phrase of Gray "it is with the meaning declared by the courts, and no other meaning, that they are imposed upon the community as Law."

8.    In the under discussion special law, power of interim relief/to put the owner or occupier, as the case may be, in possession is enshrined in Section 7 of the Act. Before attending the legality of the impugned order, it would be apposite to have a glance upon Section 7(i) of the Act which is as under:

       "7. Eviction and mode of recovery as an interim relief.- (1) If during trial the Court is satisfied that a person is found prima facie to be not in lawful possession, the Court shall, as an interim relief direct him to put the owner or occupier, as the case may be, in possession."

9.    Grant of interim relief within meaning of Section 7(1) of the Act was subject to condition "during the trial". The said stage is the condition precedent. The use of word by legislature "during the trial" in Section 7(1) of the Act is of significance importance. The expression "during the trial" is not as common sense assumes.

10.  In the latest case law reported as "Niaz Ahmed and another v. Aijaz Ahmed and others" (PLD 2024 SC 1152), in a case relating to the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005, in para 12, Hon'ble Supreme Court expounded the said section, term/expression endorsed the stage as under:-

QUOTE

       12. Present case requires determination as to what are the conditions for invocation and application of section 7 of IDA, 2005 and whether, in law, the view taken by the learned trial court and High Court is correct. For the sake of convenience, Section 7 is reproduced below:-

       7. Eviction and mode of recovery as an interim relief.---(1) If during trial the Court is satisfied that a person is found prima facie to be not in lawful possession, the Court shall, as an interim relief direct him to put the owner or occupier as the case may be, in possession.

       The intent behind section 7 ibid is to grant interim relief during the course of the trial.

       13. Bare perusal of section 7(1) of the Act reveals three principal considerations/conditions; Firstly, the jurisdiction conferred thereby is exercisable during the trial only. Thus, interim relief can be granted by the court when trial is still in progress even when the guilt of accused has not been established; Secondly, the use of expression "prima facie" indicates that court has to only form a prima facie opinion and must be satisfied that accused is "not in lawful possession" of the property. This requirement is less onerous and distinct from reaching a conclusive finding or determination that the accused has entered the property without lawful authority with intent to dispossess, grab, or control the immovable property as specified in the third and fourth elements of section 3 of the Act. The use of the expression "not in lawful possession by the Legislature appears to be a deliberate choice reflecting a less stringent criterion to enable interim relief during the trial this is because the offence under section 3 can only be proved/otherwise at the conclusion of the trial, and Finally, if the court finds that section 7 is applicable then it is duty bound to provide interim relief specified therein.

       Thus, interim order under section 7 of the Act can be passed when prima facie it is established to the satisfaction of the Court that the accused is in unlawful possession of the immoveable property and complainant is either owner or was in a lawful possession of the immoveable property before dispossession.

       14. Now what needs to be determined is whether these conditions stand fulfilled in the present case. Firstly, grant of interim relief is subject to condition "during trial". The expression "trial" has been interpreted by this Court in the case of "Haqnawaz and others v. The State and others" (2000 SCMR 785), wherein it has been held that:

       "From a review of the above provisions of the Code, it is quite clear to us that taking of cognizance of a case by a Court is not synonymous with the commencement of the trial in a case. Taking of cognizance of a case by the Court is the first step, which may or may not culminate into the trial of the accused. The trial in criminal case, therefore, does not commence with the taking of the cognizance of the case by the Court".

       Thus, use of word by the legislature "during the trial" in section 7(1) of the IDA, 2005 is of significant importance. There is no cavil to the proposition that taking of cognizance is not commencement of the trial. Trial of a case commences with the framing of the charge.

UNQUOTE

11.  Now, I would like to attend the facts/stage of this case on the yardstick/checklist of the supra law as well as interpretation of the expression. The certified copies presented by the learned counsel for the petitioner indicate that before delivery of copies to the accused and framing of charge, learned trial court passed the impugned order. Learned counsel for the respondent No.2 also not disputed, before framing of charge, the under discussion order was passed. The initial stage is quite visible even from the impugned order, which is reproduced as under:

       "Further, it is notable that the complainant, despite of the fact that he is the owner of the subject property, has been illegally dispossessed by the accused from the subject property and the accused without any title of ownership is enjoying the possession of subject property. At this initial stage, the accused is directed to hand over the possession of one (1) room in the subject property to the complainant and further matter should be decided afterwards. If the accused does not comply with the direction contained in this order, then the S.H.O. concerned is directed to affect the possession of complainant over the subject property there off.

       Now to come up for report of S.H.O. regarding delivery of possession on 03.10.2024."

12.  The procedural stage, as envisaged under the special law, was altogether disregarded prior to the issuance of the impugned order. It is a well-settled principle in the administration of justice that when the law prescribes a specific manner for performing a particular act, it must be carried out in that prescribed manner alone and not otherwise.

13.  Execution or implementation constitutes the process through which a judicial order is enforced, thereby enabling the successful party to derive the intended benefit from such order. While it is not in dispute that the complainant is the uncle of the accused, the familial relationship stands overshadowed by the severity of the disputes, which were of such a grave nature that they could not be resolved within the family or the local community, ultimately necessitating judicial intervention. Significantly, the complainant/respondent had explicitly alleged in the complaint that the accused/petitioner had extended threats of murder.

14.  A careful and meticulous perusal of the complaint, however, does not reveal how many rooms exists in the house in question, nor whether any room has an independent or direct access to the street. The police report is also silent on these critical particulars. Likewise, the cursory evidence adduced by respondent No. 2 does not specify either the number of rooms or the existence of any room with a direct approach to the passage.

15.  In this context, the direction to hand over possession of "one room" in the subject property appears inconsistent with both the legal framework and the factual assertions made in the private complaint as well as the cursory evidence on record. Furthermore, the impugned order states that, in the event of non-compliance by the petitioner/accused, the concerned Station House Officer (SHO) shall effect possession in favour of the complainant, however, in the absence of a precise identification of the room in question, such a direction effectively delegates to the law enforcement agency the judicial function of specifying which room is to be handed over-an action which is legally impermissible.

16.  Accordingly, the directive to implement the handing over of possession becomes incapable of execution due to lack of specificity and judicial certainty. This portion of the impugned order, being devoid of essential judicial safeguards and precision, is liable to be set aside even on this singular ground.

17.  In light of the above discussion, this criminal revision is allowed with the observation that the impugned order dated 25.09.2024 suffers from material illegality and procedural irregularity, rendering it unsustainable in the eye of law and the same is accordingly set aside.

JUDGENT.
.................
.---Through this criminal revision petition filed under section 439 read with section 561-A Cr.P.C., Mian Sohaib ul Rehman (petitioner) seeks setting aside the order dated 29.01.2019 passed by the Mr. Muhammad Naeem Sheikh, Learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Lahore who was pleased to dismiss the application for restoration of possession of plot filed by the petitioner.

2.    Arguments heard and record perused.

3.    Perusal of record reveals that Muhammad Bashir along with Fakir Muhammad filed complaint on 13.12.2005 under section 3 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 and during the proceedings of the complaint, he also filed an application under section 7 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 on 12.06.2006 for the restoration of possession of property. The said application was accepted vide order dated 21.07.2006 and bailiff handed over the vacant possession of the plot to Muhammad Bashir in compliance of the court order. The report of bailiff is very much relevant in this regard as nowhere bailiff mentioned in his report that plot in dispute was owned and possessed by present petitioner Mian Sohaib ur Rehman rather the proceedings were smoothly conducted and possession was handed over to Muhammad Bashir without any resistance or counter claim agitated at the spot. The petitioner on 29.07.2006 filed application under section 203 Cr.P.C. and he made a prayer that the complaint filed by Muhammad Bashir (respondent No.1) be dismissed and order dated 21.07.2006 whereby the order for the restoration of possession was made be suspended till the final decision of the application whereas bailiff on the day of filing of application had already handed over the vacant possession to the complainant of the plot at the spot. The complaint ultimately met with the fate of acquittal of accused vide judgment dated 20.07.2011 and till that day, neither said application was decided which had become infructuous because compliance of the court order was made nor it was agitated to be decided in accordance with law and after the acquittal made on 20.07.2011, the petitioner with the delay of almost three months on 05.10.2011 filed application for the restoration of possession with the claim that he was in fact in possession of land and bailiff wrongly handed over the possession to complainants but petitioner has failed to justify his stance through relevant provision of law before the court because inspite of query, the learned counsel for the petitioner has miserably failed to mention any provision of law under which the petitioner was empowered to file petition for the decision of application which was not decided during the pendency of complaint filed under section 3 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005.

4.    Furthermore, during the course of arguments, learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon document No.7116, Book No.1, Volume No.403 dated 27.07.2004 on the basis of which he is claiming himself to be owner of the land in dispute which was never in possession of Mian Maqsood Ahmed (respondent/accused in complaint) but it is crystal clear from record that Mst. Almas Fakhra, etc. being the legal heirs of Mian Muhammad Azam have filed suit regarding cancellation of said sale deed which is pending since 2007 against petitioner and Mian Maqsood Ahmad who is real brother of present petitioner. Both were impleaded as defendants in the titled suit in which present petitioner Mian Shoaib ur Rehman through filing of written statement mentioned that he has sold 10 marlas land to someone else and handed over vacant possession to that person. During the pendency of suit for cancellation of document the petitioner was not entitled to ask criminal court for the restoration of possession and once complaint was decided which resulted into acquittal vide order dated 20.07.2011 the trial court become functus officio and was not empowered to decide the grievance of the petitioner who get his application decided in the year 2019 and approached this Court with the considerable delay. Reference in this regard can be made to the case reported as Ali Kuli Amin Ud Din v. Muhammad Zafar and others (2012 PCr.LJ 1136) wherein hon'ble court held as under

       S.369. Court not to alter judgment. Scope. Court becomes functus officio after it passes and signs any order. No court including High Court can review its order passed in criminal jurisdiction.

       Similar view was taken in the case reported as Iqbal v. The State and another (2001 PCr.LJ 1634). The relevant portion is reproduced below for reference sake:-

       No Court when it had signed its judgment, would alter or review the same, except to correct a clerical error. High Court could not review its own order passed in the criminal jurisdiction as the Court would become functus officio after it had passed and signed the order.

5.    In view of above discussion, instant criminal revision being devoid of any force is hereby dismissed.

ORDER
...........
.---Through the instant petition, under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the legality and validity of the impugned order dated 12.12.2023 passed by Judicial Magistrate Section-30, District Courts, Lahore, have been challenged, whereby the accused/respondent No.5 was discharged from the case for insufficient incriminating material regarding the accused's implication.

2.    Heard. Record perused.

3.    Bare facts and perusal of the impugned order show that the investigating officer, through the application, requested for further physical remand of respondent No. 5. The physical remand of respondent No.5 was asked for by the police as some document had to be recovered from him for completion of the investigation. The Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Lahore, while discharging the accused (respondent No. 5), turned down the request for further physical remand of the accused (respondent No. 5). The accused (respondent No. 5) was discharged on the following grounds:-

       "I.O through this application requested for further physical remand of the accused person.

       The record shows the accused as nominated in FIR for preparing a false and forged agreement to sell belonging to the property of Naziran Bibi (late), the mother of complainant. Previously seven days physical remand was accorded for the completion of investigation and recovery of alleged document. Presently, the matter is sub-judice between the parties on civil side, where the alleged document is used for obtaining stay orders. The court is the competent forum to proceed under section 195 Cr.P.C., if the document is found to be false and fictitious. A private person is barred by section 195, Cr.P.C. make any complaint in this regard.

       So far as facts are concerned, during the investigation conducted till so far no forgery is established on part of present accused. As per report by ADC (R) license in the name of Muhammad Sharif (Stamp Vendor) is found to be valid from 1974 to 23.01.2015 (when cancelled). However, Stamp vending register for 2013-14 was not deposited by said Stamp Vendor but it could not be termed that stamp papers issued during this period are fake and fictitious. Nothing is recovered from the possession of present accused despite of 07 days physical remand. In such circumstances, I do not find any incriminating material on record and turn down the request of I.O for physical remand. The accused is discharged from this case FIR and be released, if not required in any other case."

       Coming to the contention of the learned counsel for respondent No. 5 that an effort should be made to avoid conflict of findings between the civil and criminal courts, it is necessary to point out that the standard of proof required in the two proceedings is entirely different. Civil cases are decided based on preponderance of evidence, while in a criminal case, the entire burden lies on the prosecution, and proof beyond reasonable doubt has to be given. There is neither any statutory provision nor any legal principle that the findings recorded in one proceeding may be treated as final or binding in the other, as both cases have to be decided based on the evidence adduced therein. Section 195, Cr.P.C. would be attracted only when the offenses enumerated in the said provision have been committed concerning a document after it has been produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any court. The existence of the document is not denied. The learned counsel for respondent No. 5 admitted that the document had not been produced or given in evidence. Findings of the Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Lahore, are perverse and against the law. The findings of the Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Lahore, are perverse and result from misreading and non-reading the oral and documentary evidence on the record and file. The order dated 12.12.2023 passed by the Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Lahore, is set aside. The matter is referred to the learned District and Sessions Judge, Lahore, to entrust the case to any other Judicial Magistrate Section-30 to decide the matter afresh after issuing notice to all the concerned parties and allowing them to be heard by the law.

4.    With the above observations, the instant petition stands disposed of.

Rape, kidnapping---Appreciation of evidence---Ocular account supported by medical evidence---Accused was charged for kidnapping the daughter of complainant and committing rape with her---Record showed that the prosecution witness/victim, was cross-examined by the defence but her evidence relating to the fact of her being raped by the appellant had not been shaken at all---Moreover, it had been fully established by the statement of the prosecution witness/victim that the appellant raped her---Report of Forensic Science Agency, according to which the DNA Profile of the appellant was found present on the shalwar of victim, also lent support to the charge of rape against the appellant---Evidence of Medical Officer also fully supported the statement of victim that she was raped by the appellant---Circumstances established that the prosecution had proved its case against the accused to the extent of committing rape with the victim, however due to mitigating circumstances, the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to the appellant under S.376(1), P.P.C. was reduced to that of rigorous imprisonment of ten years---

-Discrepancies and improvements in the statement of witnesses---Scope---In all criminal cases, normal discrepancies are bound to occur in the depositions of witnesses due to normal errors of observation, namely, errors of memory due to lapse of time or due to mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence---Where the omissions amount to a contradiction, creating serious doubt about the truthfulness of the witness and other witnesses also make material improvement while deposing in the court, such evidence cannot be safe to rely upon---However, minor contradictions, inconsistencies, embellishments or improvements on trivial matters which do not affect the core of the prosecution case, should not be made a ground on which the evidence can be rejected in its entirety.

Abduction of the victim not established---Accused was charged for kidnapping the daughter of complainant and committing rape with her---Prosecution witness/victim had successfully evidenced her credibility, therefore the trial Court was quite justified to rely on her while finding the appellant guilty---Intention of the accused was the basis and the gravamen of an offence under S.376, P.P.C.---Consequently, there was no hesitation in holding that the trial Court rightly convicted the appellant for the offence punishable under S.376(1), P.P.C.---With regard to the conviction of the appellant under S.365-B P.P.C., the prosecution could not prove the said charge against the appellant---Trial Court itself rejected the statement of the prosecution witness who had stated that on 23.10.2014 at about 08.00 a.m. he had seen the appellant abducting, the victim---According to the statement of victim, when she was abducted by the appellant, said witness was not present at the said time and place---Furthermore, said witness, though being very closely related to victim, made no effort either to stop the abduction of victim or even to follow the appellant who was taking away the victim---No one from the locality supported the said charge of abduction levelled against the appellant---Trial Court also observed that complainant was not a witness of the said abduction---With regard to the part of the statement of victim that she was abducted by the appellant, the same was doubtful and contradictory to the attending circumstances---Therefore, the appellant could not have been convicted for the offence punishable under S.365-B, P.P.C.---Circumstances established that the prosecution had proved its case against the accused to the extent of committing rape with the victim, however due to mitigating circumstances, the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to the appellant under S.376(1), P.P.C. was reduced to that of rigorous imprisonment of ten years---

Sentence, reduction in---Mitigating circumstances---Accused was charged for kidnapping the daughter of complainant and committing rape with her---Record showed that the appellant suffered the rigours of a protracted trial and it had also been observed that it seemed likely that the appellant would have mended his conduct in those years---Counsel for the appellant on appellant's instructions, had earnestly and humbly prayed that the appellant may be given a chance to rehabilitate---Appellant was the sole earner in his family and his incarceration for an extended period would result in cutting off the lifeline available to his family---No proof was available that the appellant was a man of means---As such, the case of the appellant called for a lenient view in the matter of the quantum of sentence awarded to him under S.376(1), P.P.C.---Consequently, while maintaining the conviction of the appellant under S.376(1), P.P.C., the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to the appellant under S.376(1), P.P.C. was reduced to that of rigorous imprisonment of ten years---

Judgment
.---Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh (convict) was tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kehror Pacca in case FIR No.587 of 2014, dated 24.10.2014, registered at Police Station City Kehror Pacca, District Lodhran in respect of offences under sections 376 and 363 of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860. The learned trial court vide judgment dated 12.01.2017 convicted Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh (convict) and sentenced him as infra:-

       Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh:

       1) Imprisonment for life under section 376(1) of the Pakistan Penal Code,1860 and directed to pay fine of Rs.200,000/-, and in case of default of payment of fine, the convict was directed to undergo, simple Imprisonment of two years further.

       2) Imprisonment for life under section 365-B of the Pakistan Penal Code,1860 and directed to pay fine of Rs.200, 000/-, and in case of default of payment of fine, the convict was directed to undergo simple Imprisonment of two years further.

       The convict was extended benefit available under Section 382-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 1898 by the learned trial court. Both the sentences awarded to the convict were ordered to run concurrently by the learned trial court .

2.    Feeling aggrieved, Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh (convict) lodged the instant Criminal Appeal No.576-J-LD of 2017 assailing his conviction and sentence.

3.    The brief facts of the prosecution case, as stated by Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), the victim of the case, in her statement before the learned trial court, are as under:-

       "On 23.10.2014 at about 8:00 AM I was going to school when I reached near Nagina Cinema accused Allah Wadhaya armed with pistol with an unknown person came and took me forcibly to an unknown place on motorcycle. After some time that unknown person alighted from motorcycle. Accused Allah Wadhaya forcibly committed rape with me. After four days I escaped from that unknown place and came to my home. My parents took me to P.S and then to Hospital. My statement was recorded in P.S. My medical examination was got conducted."

4.    After the formal investigation of the case report under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted before the learned trial court and the accused was sent to face trial. The learned trial court framed the charge against the accused on 04.02.2015 to which the accused pleaded not guilty and the learned trial court proceeded to examine the prosecution witnesses.

5.    The prosecution in order to prove its case got recorded statements of as many as nine witnesses. Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), the prosecutrix narrated the facts of the occurrence. Muhammad Murad (PW-1) stated that on 24.10.2014, he submitted the written application (Exh.PA) for the registration of the case in respect of abduction of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2). Zafar Iqbal (PW-3) stated that on 23.10.2014, he had witnessed the appellant abducting Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2). Abdul Hameed, SI (PW-9) investigated the case from 24.10.2014 till 01.11.2014, arrested the appellant on 29.10.2014 and detailed the facts discovered during the investigation of the case in his statement before the learned trial court.

6.    The prosecution also got Dr. Mumtaz Kamal (PW-4) examined, who on 27.10.2014 was posted as a Woman Medical Officer at THQ hospital Kehror Pacca and on the same day, conducted the medical examination of the victim namely Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2). Dr. Mumtaz Kamal (PW-4), after examining Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), observed as under:-

       "Local examination.

       Locally found blackish flaps of labia admit two fingers loose. minora and vagina

       ..........

       Opinion.

       My opinion is that there was penetration occurred completely. Those swabs do not match with the findings of local examination. After medical examination I issued MLC the carbon copy of which is Ex.PD that is in my hand and bear my signature. I also attested injury statement of Ex.PD/1."

       The prosecution also got Dr. Ihsan Ali (PW-5) examined who stated that he had examined the appellant on 01.11.2014 and found him capable of having sexual intercourse.

7.    On 25.04.2016, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor tendered in evidence the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PJ) and other documents (Exh.PK and Exh.PL).On 26.05.2016, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor closed the prosecution evidence after tendering, in evidence the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PM)

8.    After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined the appellant Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh, under section 342, Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question why this case against you and why the PWs have deposed against you, he stated that he had been falsely involved in the case. The appellant opted to get himself examined under section 340(2), Cr.P.C and did not adduce any evidence in his defence.

9.    On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kehror Pacca, convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to above.

10.  The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant precisely was that with regard to the abduction of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), there was not sufficient evidence, however, with regard to the conviction of the appellant under section 376(1), P.P.C., the learned counsel for the appellant sought a reduction in the quantum of imprisonment awarded to the appellant.

11.  On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General contended that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a shadow of doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General further submitted that it was a heinous offence and exploited the victim's future by the appellant at the expense of his lust: that it could not be expected from the victim to put her future at stake for any reason to falsely implicate the appellant in this case for nothing; that delay in reporting the matter to the police had no adverse effect on the fate of the prosecution case because in the cases where family honour was involved, immediate rushing to the police station for lodging the crime report and putting the honour at stake, was always difficult for anybody; that the medical evidence provided further corroboration to the Ocular account; that the impugned judgment entailing the conviction and sentence of the appellant did not warrant interference by this Court. Lastly, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General prayed for the rejection of the appeal.

12.  I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General and with their assistance perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial carefully. .

13.  Although the learned counsel for the appellant has not opted to assail the conviction recorded by the learned trial Court against the appellant under section 376(1), P.P.C., still I have gone through the evidence on the record. This Court finds that the prosecution has undoubtedly established the charge of rape by producing relevant, admissible and dependable evidence during the course of the trial. The prosecution witness namely Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) was cross-examined by the learned Counsel for the appellant, but her evidence relating to the fact of her being raped by the appellant has not been shaken at all. It is fully established by the statement of the prosecution witness namely Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) that the appellant raped her. The report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PM) according to which the DNA Profile of the appellant was found present on the shalwar of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) also lends support to the charge of rape against the appellant. The evidence of Dr. Mumtaz Kamal (PW-4) also fully supports the statement of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) that she was raped by the appellant. In all criminal cases, normal discrepancies are bound to occur in the depositions of witnesses due to normal errors of observation, namely, errors of memory due to lapse of time or due to mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence. Where the omissions amount to a contradiction, creating serious doubt about the truthfulness of the witness and other witnesses also make material improvement while deposing in the court, such evidence cannot be safe to rely upon. However, minor contradictions, inconsistencies, embellishments or improvements on trivial matters which do not affect the core of the prosecution case, should not be made a ground on which the evidence can be rejected in its entirety. The court has to form its opinion about the credibility of the witness and record a finding as to whether his deposition inspires confidence. Exaggerations per se do not render the evidence brittle. But it can be one of the factors to test the credibility of the prosecution version when the entire evidence is put in a crucible for being tested on the touchstone of credibility. Therefore, mere marginal variations in the statements of a witness cannot be dubbed as improvements as the same may be elaborations of the statement made by the witness earlier. The omissions which amount to contradictions in material particulars i.e. go to the root of the case/materially affect the trial or core of the prosecution's case, render the testimony of the witness liable to be discredited but not otherwise. In the instant case, this Court finds that the prosecution witness namely Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) has successfully evidenced her credibility, therefore, the learned trial court was quite justified to rely on her while finding the appellant guilty. The intention of the accused is the basis and the gravamen of an offence under section 376, P.P.C. Consequently, I have no hesitation in holding that the learned trial court rightly convicted the appellant for the offence punishable under section 376(1), P.P.C.

14.  With regard to the conviction of the appellant under section 365-B, P.P.C., this Court has come to the conclusion that the prosecution could not prove the said charge against the appellant. The learned trial court itself rejected the statement of the prosecution witness namely Zafar Iqbal (PW-3) who had stated that on 23.10.2014 at about 08.00 a.m he had seen the appellant abducting Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2). According to the statement of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), when she was abducted by the appellant, Zafar Iqbal (PW-3) was not present at the said time, at the said place. Furthermore, Zafar lqbal (PW-3), though being very closely related to Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2), made no effort either to fail the abduction or Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) or even to follow the appellant who was taking away Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) with him. None from the locality supported the said charge of abduction levelled against the appellant. The learned trial court also observed that Muhammad Murad (PW-1) was not a witness of the said abduction. With regard to the part of the statement of Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) that she was abducted by the appellant, the same is doubtful as is contradictory to the attending circumstances. Therefore, this Court has arrived at an irresistible conclusion that the appellant could not have been convicted for the offence made punishable under section 365-B, P.P.C.

15.  For what has been discussed above, this Court has come to an irresistible and clear conclusion the prosecution has proved beyond any shadow of doubt, through inspiring and truthful evidence, that the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh raped Mst. Maria Murad (PW-2) . In view of the conclusions drawn by this Court, the instant Criminal Appeal No. 5764-J/LD of 2017 as lodged by the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh is partly allowed and the conviction and sentence of the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh for the offence made punishable under section 365-B, P.P.C. is set-aside, however, the conviction of the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh son of Muhammad Siddique under section 376(1), P.P.C. is upheld and maintained, however, I have observed that the appellant suffered the rigours of a protracted trial. I have also observed that it seems likely that the appellant would have mended, his conduct in these years. Learned counsel for the appellant on appellant's instructions, has earnestly and humbly prayed that the appellant may be given a chance to rehabilitate. The appellant was the sole earner in his Family and his incarceration for an extended period would result in cutting off the lifeline available to his family. There is no proof that the appellant is a man of means. As such, the case of the appellant calls for a lenient view in the matter of the quantum of sentence awarded to him under section 376(1), P.P.C. Reliance is placed on the cases of "Naseem Khan v. The State" (2021 SCMR 1771), "Mst. Sughran v. State (2021 SCMR 109) "Niaz ud Din v. The State" (2007 SCMR 206), "Shaukat Ali alias Billa v. The State" (2015 SCMR 308) and "State through the Deputy Director (Law), Regional Directorate, Anti-Narcotics Force v. Mujahid Naseem Lodhi" (PLD 2017 SC 671). Consequently, while maintaining the conviction of the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh under section 376(1), P.P.C. but taking into consideration the above-mentioned mitigating circumstances, the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to the appellant namely Allah Wadhaya son of Ahmad Bakhsh under section 376(1), P.P.C. is reduced to that of rigorous imprisonment of ten years. The punishment of payment of fine of Rs.200,000/-, and in case of default of payment of fine, to undergo simple Imprisonment of two years further awarded to the appellant is upheld and maintained.

Allah Wadhaya Versus The State--
[1/9/26, 6:29:03 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2025 P Cr. L J 589

Ss. 365-B & 376---Abducting or inducing woman to compel for marriage, rape---Appreciation of evidence---Ocular account furnished by victim---Victim sole eyewitness of the occurrence---Sufficient for conviction---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Ocular account was furnished by victim/complainant alone, whereas, statement of father of the victim was about post occurrence events---In her examination-in-chief the victim reiterated the story as had been set out in the complaint/FIR and deposed about step by step events in the same sequence---Complainant was subjected to cross-examination at sufficient length but nothing damaging to the prosecution or favourable to the defence could be elicited from her mouth---By tenor of cross-examination the defence tried to bring on record that at one point of time the victim and the accused/appellant were residing in the same village and parents of the accused/appellant as well as victim had friendly relations, thus they both i.e. accused/appellant and the victim, were known to each other---Instead of lending any support to the defence, the admission of the victim on above aspects went on to strengthen the prosecution's stance as it was the case of prosecution itself that because of such friendly relations the accused/appellant used to visit the house of the victim's parents along with co-accused, with whom the victim also developed relations and out of such linkage she left the house along with co-accused to make some purchases and fell prey to nefarious activity by the accused/appellant---Since the statement of the victim, had been found to be worthy of credence, confidence inspiring, credible and irrefutable, therefore, even if she was a sole witness, her statement could safely be made basis to record conviction---

Nude pictures---Legal requirements for using such pictures as evidence for convicting accused---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Audio/video clip including snaps/ photographs as evidence maintained a dual character in the law of evidence; it is termed as document as well as a material thing (physical evidence), also known as real evidence---Snaps/ photographs do carry information that includes expression, gestures, voice and video, therefore, such clips/snaps are sought to be produced before the Court to prove the 'information' contained in it as evidence of facts recorded therein and oral account of which is to be spoken by a witness and not by the document alone---While as material thing it is to be produced for the inspection of Court---Principles of evidence relating to admissibility of documents are fully applicable on such type of evidence---Permission and sanction of law to bring on record evidence if it is in the form of document is regulated under Art.139 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Said Article in the light of illustration therein authorizes the Court to ask, when any witness is making statement about a fact, to support his contention with any document if such fact is incorporated therein---Room for such discretion of Court is obviously reflective of farsighted wisdom of legislature to cater to the requirement of an emerging need of evidence in a particular situation for the purpose of corroboration to fortify or strengthen the deposition---Documentary evidence runs over or defeats the oral evidence under the maxim "res ipsa loquitor"---Second status of such evidence is of material thing (physical evidence) or oral evidence which is produced for the inspection of Court as ordained in second proviso to Art. 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---In the present case pictures were put to the accused/appellant during his statement under S.342, Cr.P.C., for seeking his explanation but neither he challenged such pictures in any manner during cross-examination nor gave any explanation in his statement under S.342, Cr.P.C.---Silence of the accused/appellant over such an important factor connoted that there was nothing to defend against such nude pictures, thus the requirement of law for using these snaps/pictures was completed and those could safely be used as evidence---

Delay of one and half month in lodging the FIR---Inconsequential---Victim trying to protect her honour and reputation and that of her family---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---In this case, undoubtedly, the FIR was registered after almost one and half month of the crime having been committed---However, such delay in reporting the matter to the police was immaterial in the sense that throughout it had been the stance of the victim that her nude pictures were taken by the accused/appellant, she was blackmailed and she fell victim number of times during her captivity under such pressure and fear, therefore, she kept mum in order to save her and the family honour---When nude pictures of victim were thrown in her house and the matter stood disclosed to family members, she narrated the whole occurrence---Thus, victim being an educated lady with qualification of MA English had definitely been thinking about her family honour as well as her social and practical life before reporting the matter to police---Even otherwise, the fact that the modesty of a virgin girl was violated by sexual assault explained the apprehension of the victim and her family in approaching the police immediately---Delay in reporting the crime to the police in respect of an offence involving a person's honour and reputation which society may view unsympathetically could play on the minds of a victim and her family and deter them to go to the police---

Medical officer not cross-examined---Effect---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Though the medical evidence did not contain any fact that sexual act was committed with the victim by force but it was clear from the statement of victim that she was under the effect of intoxication as well as fear of nude pictures, therefore, in either of the situations, she could not resist the act of rape---Otherwise, of course the said act of intercourse was against the will and consent of victim, which was the requirement of S.375, P.P.C---During medical examination Woman Medical Officer also found hymen of victim as old torn, though she was unmarried but Medical Officer was not even cross-examined by the defence about any fact contained in Medico-Legal Report---Moreover, it was in the evidence that delayed Medico-Legal Examination was due to the reason that victim was terrified---Prosecution had also produced Medical Officer who had examined the accused/appellant and found him potent to perform sexual act; his observations in that respect were recorded in Medico-Legal Report, therefore, such examination was also a relevant fact showing ability of accused/appellant to commit rape with the victim---

Bad character of accused---Scope---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Bad character of accused in criminal cases was not relevant under Art.68 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Perusal of evidence showed that defence itself conceded the involvement of the appellant in offence of dacoity while putting question upon the victim during her cross-examination, which turned attention to Art.27 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 dealing with relevancy of facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body or bodily feeling---In the evidence of that case facts were brought on record that the appellant had affiliation with victim since her childhood and also wanted to marry her, therefore what he had done could not be regarded as innocent mistake rather his state of mind and bodily feeling made him to commit such a heinous offence---Thus, inclination and attraction of accused towards victim was a relevant fact in the case which could safely be read against him for his intention to commit act of rape and preparation of nude pictures---

Judgment
.--- Abdul Basit, hereinafter to be called as "accused/appellant" faced trial before learned Additional Sessions Judge/GBV, Multan in case FIR No.354 dated 24.05.2018 under sections 365-B/376 P.P.C Police Station New Multan and on conclusion of trial vide judgment dated 23.07.2022 he was convicted under section 365-B P.P.C and sentenced to imprisonment for life with fine of Rs.50,000/-, in case of default to further undergo six month's simple imprisonment. He was also convicted under section 376(i) P.P.C and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for fifteen years with fine of Rs.50,000/-, in case of default to further suffer simple imprisonment for six months; both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently and benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended, hence the instant appeal.

2.    According to the prosecution case as reflected from FIR Ex.PA/2 lodged on the complaint of Nadia Shaheen (victim), she was unmarried and living with her parents, the accused/appellant and Mst. Haseena Bibi (since PO) used to visit her parents, thus she developed friendship with Mst. Haseena Bibi. On 09.04.2018 at 5.00 p.m. Mst. Haseena Bibi came to her house and took her along for making some purchases from Gulshan Market. On their way near Chowk Kumharanawala the accused/appellant, already known to the victim came on a car and offered them a drive; the victim refused but Mst. Haseena forced, whereupon she sat in the car. At Vehari Chowk when the car stopped, the victim reminded Mst. Haseena Bibi to go for Gulshan Market, whereupon, Mst. Haseena pretended an urgent work there. After a while, the accused/appellant and Mst. Haseena brought sandwich and after eating it the victim became unconscious; both of them took her to the house of Mst. Haseena where accused/appellant committed rape with her with the help of Mst. Haseena and also prepared her nude pictures. On returning to senses the victim raised the voice, whereupon, both the accused while showing her nude pictures threatened to upload the same on internet. The accused/appellant continued committing rape with her and transferred her pictures to his mobile phone for the purpose of blackmailing. After two days when her health condition got worst, both the accused left her at Nishtar Hospital, Multan, where from her father and brother took her to the house. Because of intensive mental stress she did not tell anything to them, whereas, accused/appellant constantly threatened her to marry with him. She further narrated that as per her knowledge the pictures which the accused/appellant had shared with her, were still available in the mobile phone of the accused/appellant; ultimately the victim disclosed the entire facts to her parents and along with her complaint she also produced the pictures which the accused/appellant had thrown in her house.

3.    After registration of FIR and completion of investigation finally report under section 173 Cr.P.C was submitted against the accused/appellant. When charge sheeted, the accused/appellant denied the charges and claimed to be tried, whereupon, the prosecution examined Mst. Nadia Shaheen (victim) as PW-1; Ghulam Akbar, father of the victim appeared in the dock as PW-2; Shakeela 944/LC (PW-3) who took the victim to hospital for her medical examination; Zafar Iqbal Sub-Inspector (PW-5) and Ghulam Mustafa (PW-7) had investigated the case; Dr. Nasir Javed (PW-6) conducted potency test of the accused/appellant; Waseem Akram Sub-Inspector (PW-9) got issued non-warrants of arrest of the accused following by proclamation and Dr. Nighat Noureen (PW-10) medically examined the victim and rest of the witnesses appeared and made statements about the roles performed by them during the course of investigation. The accused neither opted to appear in the witness box as required by section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in defence and the trial ended in his conviction and sentence, as detailed above.

4.    Learned counsel for the appellant seeks acquittal on the grounds of delay in FIR, delayed medicolegal examination of victim, un-supporting medical evidence without DNA, sole testimony of victim without corroboration with regard to act of rape. Learned District Public Prosecutor assisted by counsel for the complainant supported the impugned judgment due to trust worthy and confidence inspiring statement of victim, supported by res gestae evidence of her father, medicolegal opinion of old torn hymen being unmarried lady and nude pictures of victim prepared by the appellant wherein he is also visible.

5.    Arguments heard. Record perused.

6.    Here in the instant case, the prosecution intended to establish the charge against the accused/appellant through the ocular account, medical evidence and the nude pictures of the victim P-1 to P-5, which were allegedly thrown into the house of victim and those which were produced on behalf of the accused/appellant i.e., P-6 to P-10. The ocular account was furnished by Mst. Nadia Shaheen victim/complainant (PW-1) alone, whereas, statements of Ghulam Akbar (PW-2) father of the victim is about post occurrence events, including recovery of nude pictures P-1 to P5 produced before the police and P-6 to P-10 on the information of accused/appellant from his house. Conscious of the fact that the victim/complainant was the solitary witness of the occurrence, we have thoroughly and carefully gone through her statement to dig out that she may have falsely involved the accused/appellant in this case in order to wreck vengeance or it may have been a motivated attempt on the part of the prosecution to level some score against the accused/appellant, but in her examination-in-chief the victim reiterated the story as had been set out in the complaint/FIR and deposed about step by step events in the same sequence. She was subjected to cross-examination at sufficient length but nothing damaging to the prosecution or favourable to the defence could be elicited from her mouth. By tenor of cross-examination the defence tried to bring on record that at one point of time the victim and the accused/appellant were residing in the same village and parents of the accused/appellant as well as victim had friendly relations, thus they both i.e. accused/appellant and the victim, were known to each other. Instead of lending any support to the defence, the admission of the victim on above aspects goes on to strengthen the prosecution's stance as it was the case of prosecution itself that because of such friendly relations the accused/appellant used to visit the house of the victim's parents along with Mst. Haseena Bibi, with whom the victim also developed relations and out of such linkage she left the house along with Mst. Haseena Bibi to make some purchases and fell prey to nefarious activity by the accused/appellant.

7.    Since the statement of the victim, direct evidence, has been found to be worthy of credence, confidence inspiring, credible and irrefutable, therefore, even if there is a sole witness, her statement can safely be made basis to record conviction. As to the number of witnesses required to establish a charge, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as "Muhammad Mansha v. The State" (2001 SCMR 199) with reference to Article 17(1)(b) of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 held that:-

       "7. A bare perusal would reveal that the language as employed in the 'said Article 17(1) (b) is free from any ambiguity and no scholarly interpretation is required. The provisions as reproduced hereinabove of the said Article would make it abundant clear that particular number of witnesses shall not be required for the proof of any fact meaning thereby that a fact can be proved only by a single witness "it is not seldom that a crime has been committed in the presence of only one witness, leaving aside those cases which are not of uncommon occurrence, where determination of guilt depends entirely on circumstantial evidence. If the Legislature were to insist upon plurality witnesses, case where the testimony of a single witness only could be available in proof of the crime, would go unpunished. It is here that the discretion of the Presiding Judge comes into play. The matter thus must depend upon the circumstances of each case and the quality of the evidence of the single witness whose testimony has to be either accepted or rejected. If such a testimony is found by the Court to be entirely reliable, there is no legal impediment to the conviction of the accused person on such proof. Even as the guilt of an accused person may be proved by the testimony of a single witness, the innocence of an accused person may be established on the testimony of a single witness, even though considerable number of witnesses may be forthcoming to testify to the truth of the case, for the prosecution. The Court is concerned with the quality and not with the quantity of the evidence necessary for proving or disproving a fact". (Principles and Digest of the Law of Evidence by M. Monir, page 1458).

       The Supreme Court further held that:-

       "……..no yardstick can be fixed as to whether statement of a solitary witness must or must not be relied upon for the simple reason that each case has its own peculiar circumstances which shall play a significant role and is motivating factor to determine the reliability of a solitary witness as the said aspect of the matter is to be dilated upon in the light of surrounding circumstances which may be taken into consideration or otherwise. We may mention here that such circumstances also cannot be confined within a limited sphere of any definition because the same may be infinitely diversified by the situation and conduct of the parties concerned. "The only general rule that can be laid down is that the circumstances must be such as would lead the guarded decision of a reasonable and just man to the conclusion".

       Thus, the well-recognized maxim remains that 'evidence has to be weighed and not counted' and here in this case as discussed above the ocular testimony though coming through one witness i.e. victim, yet the same is consistent, unimpeachable and confidence inspiring, therefore, is held to be sufficient to establish the charge. Reference may be made to the case reported as "Muhammad Ehsan v. The State" (2006 SCMR 1857). It has been held by Supreme Court in case reported as "Atif Zareef and others v. The State" (PLD 2021 SC 550) that rape victim stands on a high pedestal than an injured witness, because an injured witness gets the injury on physical form while rape victim suffers psychologically and emotionally, and single testimony is sufficient to uphold the conviction.

8.    Ghulam Akbar PW-2 father of victim deposed res gestae evidence about condition of victim when he and his son Shahbaz met her in Nishtar Hospital, Multan. PW-2 narrated the situation as under;

       "After two days, my daughter Nadia made a call on phone and informed us that she was present in Nishtar Hospital and her condition was bad. I along with my son Shahbaz went to Nishtar Hospital wherefrom, we brought back Mst. Nadia to our home. We kept on asking what had happened with her but she did not tell us anything and used to weep."

       Similarly, during cross-examination he responded as under;

       "When we had been asking our daughter Mst. Nadia where she was for two days but she started to weep and remained silent. My wife had also been asking about the reason of her weeping but she said nothing to her."

       He has also stated the fact of collection of nude pictures from his house allegedly thrown by the appellant, which has a support to prosecution case. He deposed in his examination in chief that we had family relation with accused Abdul Basit and Haseena Bibi co-accused (since PO). He had no axe to grind against the accused/appellant, nor anything was spoken against him by the defence. His support to save her family honour is reflected from the fact that he is pursuing the case and is present before us even in this appeal proceedings.

9.    In addition to the above, five nude pictures allegedly thrown by the accused/appellant in the house of the victim, were also produced before the Investigating Officer at the time of registration of case, however, were taken into possession after three days through recovery memo P-1 to P-5 (Ex.PC) and accused also produced similar pictures before the police P-6 to P-10 (Ex.PD) on call from his house. Though no evidence is available that who had produced such pictures from the accused side, likewise it has been admitted by the victim during cross-examination that no one knew that who had thrown the pictures (P-1 to P-5) in her house, but the pictures produced by the complainant party clearly show that first part of the prosecution story stands proved which was to the effect that accused after making nude pictures of the victim started blackmailing for commission of rape with her.

10.  We have observed that in one of the nude pictures P-1 to P-5 and P-6 to P-10, the accused/appellant is also visible while sitting with the side of the victim who fell unconscious. The information contained in the picture clearly speaks about the story of the victim that in a condition of unconsciousness her nude pictures were prepared by the accused/appellant, therefore, the question before us is as to whether such pictures could be used as evidence in support of prosecution case. It is trite that an audio/video clip including snaps/photographs as evidence maintains a dual character in the law of evidence; it is termed as document as well as a material thing (physical evidence), also known as real evidence. It does carry information that includes expression, gestures, voice and video; therefore, such clips/snaps are sought to be produced before the Court to prove the 'information' contained in it as evidence of facts recorded therein and oral account of which is to be spoken by a witness and not the document alone. While as material thing it is to be produced for the inspection of court. Principles of evidence relating to admissibility of documents are fully applicable on such type of evidence; permission and sanction of law to bring on record evidence if it is in the form of document is regulated under Article 139 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (the Order). This Article in the light of illustration therein authorizes the Court to ask, when any witness is making statement about a fact, to support his contention with any document if such fact is incorporated therein. The room for such discretion of Court is obviously reflective of farsighted wisdom of legislature to cater to the requirement of an emerging need of evidence in a particular situation for the purpose of corroboration to fortify or strengthen the deposition; even otherwise best evidence rule says that documentary evidence runs over or defeats the oral evidence under the maxim "res ipsa liquitor". The second status of such evidence is of material thing (physical evidence) or real evidence which is produced for the inspection of Court as ordained in second proviso to Article 71 of The Order: -

       "Provided further that, if oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of any material thing other than a document, the Court may, if it thinks fit, require the production of such material thing for its inspection"

       Articles 139 and 71 of the Order in detail in this context have been discussed and explained in a case reported as "Numan alias Nomi and others v. The STATE" (2023 P Cr. L J 1394).

11.  In a book "THE MODERN LAW OF EVIDENCE (Third edition) by Adrian Keane published by Butterworths (1994), the author while referring to a verdict of Sir Jocelyn Smith P, passed in a case reported as "The Statue of Liberty" [1968] 1 WLR 739 mentions as under;

       "It is tempting, on the basis of these words of Sir Jocelyn Smith P, to conclude that photographs and films, the relevance of which can be established by the testimony of someone with personal knowledge of the circumstance in which the photographs or films was taken or made, are admissible items of real evidence and can never give rise to problems of a hearsay nature. If the evidence of a witness to certain events is admissible, it may be reasoned, then photographs or films recording those same events should be no less admissible."

       In R v. Cook [1987] 1 All ER 1049 (CA) at page 1054, Watkins LJ has gone so far as to state that photograph, together with the sketch and photofit, are in a class of evidence of their own to which neither the rule against hearsay nor rule against previous consistent or self-serving statements applies.

       In R v. Williams (1984) 79 Cr App Rep 220 (CA), the Court of Appeal entertained no doubt that photographs taken by security cameras installed at a building society office at which an armed robbery was attempted, were admissible in evidence, being relevant to the issue of both whether an offence was committed and, if so, who committed it. It seems that it is not necessary to prove that the photographic material is original or an authentic copy; proof that the material relates to the events in question will suffice. Case reported as "The Road We're Travelling On, v. Treacy" [1989] New Law Journal (NLJ) 1079 is referred. In the attending circumstance and on the strength of above case laws, pictures P-1 to P5 can validly be used against the accused/appellant. In the case reported as "Muhammad Zaman v. The State and others" (2014 SCMR 749), the Supreme Court of Pakistan apart from other evidence relied on the pictures produced in evidence during trial and converted acquittal of the accused into their conviction.

12.  We have noted that such pictures were put to the accused/appellant during his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. for seeking his explanation but neither he challenged such pictures in any manner during cross-examination nor gave any explanation in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. Silence of the accused/appellant over such an important factor connotes that there was nothing to defend against such nude pictures, thus the requirement of law for using these snaps/pictures is complete as highlighted above and these can safely be used as evidence.

13.  Here in this case, undoubtedly, the FIR was registered after almost one and half month of the crime having been committed but such delay in reporting the matter to the police is immaterial in the sense that throughout it has been stance of the victim that her nude pictures were taken by the accused/appellant, she was blackmailed and she fell victim number of times during her captivity under such pressure and fear, therefore, she kept mum in order to save her and the family honour but when her nude pictures were thrown in her house and the matter stood disclosed to family members, she narrated the whole occurrence. Delay in reporting the matter was responded by her during cross examination as under:-

       "It is correct that I remained silent for about one and half month after the occurrence and did not get the case registered against the accused. There were thoughts in my mind for reporting the matter to police but due to intimidation of the accused, I abstained."

       Another reason for delay in registration of FIR was also deposed by PW-2 in following words:-

       "I took my daughter with me to P.S., New Multan and the police of said police station sent us to women police center. For few days, the police had been putting off and ultimately on 21.05.2018, they received application from me which is Exh. P-A."

       Thus, victim being an educated lady with qualification of MA English had definitely been thinking hundred times about her family honour as well as her social and practical life before reporting the matter to police. Even otherwise, the fact that the modesty of a virgin girl was violated by sexual assault makes understandable the apprehension of the victim and her family in approaching the police immediately. Delay in reporting the crime to the police in respect of an offence involving a person's honour and reputation which society may view unsympathetically could prey on the minds of a victim and her family and deter them to go to the police. Reliance in this respect is palced on case reported as "Hamid Khan v. The State" (1981 SCMR 448).

14.  Though the medical evidence does not contain any fact that sexual act was committed with the victim by force but it is clear from the statement of victim that she was under the effect of intoxication as well as fear of nude pictures, therefore, in either of the situation she could not resist the act of rape, but otherwise, of course the said act of intercourse was against her will and consent, which is the requirement of section 375 P.P.C. During medical examination Dr. Nighat Noureen PW-10 also found hymen of victim as old torn, though she was unmarried but doctor was not even cross examined by the defence about any fact contained in MLR. It is in the evidence that delayed medicolegal examination was due to the reason victim was terrified and this fact she has disclosed, while responding to questions during cross examination, as under;

       "My father and my brother had asked me to take me to the doctor but I refused and insisted to take me to home. My parents were insisting me for my medical treatment but I was scared and terrified that I refused and I said that I would not get out of the room."

15.  Prosecution has also produced Dr. Nasir Javed PW-6 who had examined the accused/appellant on 14/10/2020 and found him potent to perform sexual act; his observations in this respect are recorded in MLR, Ex.PP; therefore, such examination is also a relevant fact showing ability of accused/appellant to commit rape with the victim.

16.  Learned counsel for the complainant tried to show the Bench some FIRs registered against the appellant for his involvement in offences of murder and dacoity to assert his bad character. We are afraid such course is not permissible under the law, and even otherwise bad character of accused in criminal cases is not relevant under Article 68 of the Order; but perusal of evidence shows that defence itself conceded the involvement of the appellant in offence of dacoity while putting question upon the victim during her cross examination, which turned our attention to Article 27 of the Order dealing with relevancy of facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body or bodily feeling. In the evidence of this case facts were brought on record that the appellant has affiliation with victim since her childhood and also wanted to marry her, therefore what he has done cannot be regarded as innocent mistake rather his state of mind and bodily feeling roasted her to commit such a heinous offence. Thus, his inclination and attraction towards victim is a relevant fact in this case which can safely be read against him for his intention to commit act of rape and preparation of nude pictures.

17.  For what has been discussed above, it is evident that prosecution has proved the case against the appellant beyond shadow of reasonable doubt, a standard requisite to sustain a criminal charge. There is no legitimate exception to findings arrived at by the learned trial court with respect to conviction and quantum of sentence awarded to the accused/appellant. The instant appeal, therefore, being devoid of merit, is dismissed. The case property, if any, shall be dealt with as ordered by the learned trial court and the record of the learned trial court be sent back immediately.

Order
---Through this application, the Petitioner seeks pre-arrest bail in case FIR No.1546/2024 dated 3.7.2024 registered at Police Station Peoples Colony, Faisalabad, for an offence under section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 (P.P.C).

2.    According to the FIR, the prosecution's case is that the Petitioner owns a fabric shop in Tata Bazar near the ice factory in Faisalabad. He became acquainted with the Complainant through her frequent visits to purchase cloth. Over time, they developed a rapport, and the Complainant occasionally shared her domestic issues with him. The Complainant alleged that the Petitioner proposed that she run a boutique from her home. He offered to provide fabric worth Rs. 500,000/- on loan, with the agreement that she would repay Rs. 100,000/- every 15 days. He suggested that the arrangement would mutually benefit both parties.

3.    The Complainant asserted that on 2.7.2024, around 11:00 a.m., the Petitioner invited her to Chen-One Road to visit a cloth warehouse. The Petitioner and an unknown person were already present when she reached there. The Complainant claimed that the Petitioner inappropriately touched her while the co-accused pointed a pistol at her, and then the Petitioner raped her. She further alleged that certain objectionable pictures and videos were taken, and the Petitioner and his co-accused threatened to leak the material if she disclose the incident.

4.    The Complainant told Muhammad Ashfaq and Sarfraz Ali about the occurrence, who supported her in obtaining a medical examination through court orders. Subsequently, FIR No. 1546/2024 was registered.

5.    The Petitioner applied for pre-arrest bail in the Sessions Court which was declined. He has now approached this Court seeking the same relief.

6.    The Petitioner's counsel, Barrister Momin Malik, contended that the Complainant has falsely implicated the Petitioner with ulterior motives. He argued that the prosecution's narrative, particularly the alleged financial arrangement, is inherently implausible. Mr. Malik further contended that the Complainant acted in collusion with her counsel's clerk, Muhammad Ashfaq, who is a key prosecution witness. Additionally, he pointed out discrepancies in the medical examination record and the variance between the Complainant's FIR and her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., arguing these inconsistencies warrant further inquiry. Mr. Malik submitted that the Petitioner is entitled to pre-arrest bail in the given circumstances.

7.    The Deputy Prosecutor General, assisted by the Complainant's counsel, vehemently opposed this application. He contended that the Petitioner was nominated in the FIR with a specific allegation. The Complainant has recorded her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., implicating the Petitioner in the case, and her account is corroborated by medical evidence and a positive forensic report. The Deputy Prosecutor General refuted the claim of any discrepancy between the FIR and the Complainant's statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., adding that even if such a discrepancy existed, it was trivial and inconsequential. He, therefore, prayed for the dismissal of this application.

8.    Hina Imdad/SI investigated this case. She concluded that the incident involved fornication rather than rape. Her findings were primarily based on CCTV footage, photographs, and WhatsApp messages exchanged between the Petitioner and the Complainant.

9.    Encouraged by the Investigating Officer's findings, Mr. Malik raised an alternative plea that the alleged offence falls under section 496-B P.P.C rather than section 376 P.P.C. He pointed out that section 203-C Cr.P.C. prescribes a special procedure for prosecuting an offence under section 496-B P.P.C, and an action can only be initiated through a complaint filed in a court of competent jurisdiction. He argued that the offence under section 496-B P.P.C is non-cognizable so an FIR could not be registered. Furthermore, the said offence is bailable.

       Discussion

10.  Rape is universally recognized as one of the most heinous crimes, representing a profound violation of personal dignity, bodily autonomy, and fundamental human rights. It is not merely a physical assault but an act of violence and domination that strikes at the very core of a person's sense of self. Beyond its immediate physical impact, rape is an extremely traumatic event with lasting emotional, psychological, and social consequences. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, while a rapist degrades their very soul.

11.  Legal systems worldwide criminalize rape, with varying definitions and evidentiary requirements. However, the fundamental principle remains the same: it is a crime of violence, coercion, and domination. It is not merely an offence against an individual but against the entire society.

12.  Article 14 of our Constitution mandates that dignity shall be inviolable. This is an absolute right and is not subject to law. "Dignity means human worth: simply put, every person matters. No life is dispensable, disposable, or demeanable. Every person has a right to live, and the right to live means right to live with dignity." Our courts have consistently held that a woman, regardless of her sexual character or reputation, is entitled to equal protection of the law. No one has the right to invade her person or violate her privacy based on her alleged immoral character. In rape cases, the victim's prior sexual history and character is irrelevant; the critical issue is whether the accused committed the act.

13.  The Pakistan Penal Code criminalizes rape under section 375. It defines the offence comprehensively, encompassing acts beyond traditional notions of penile penetration, such as the insertion of any object or body part (other than the penis) into the vagina, urethra, or anus and oral acts performed on or by the victim. The definition also covers situations where a perpetrator manipulates any part of the victim's body to cause penetration into the vagina, urethra, anus, or any other part of the victim's body or compels the victim to perform such acts with the accused or another person. Section 376 P.P.C prescribes the punishment for rape, while section 375A P.P.C specifically addresses gang rape, imposing severe penalties for such crimes.

14.  Rape must be distinguished from fornication. Rape is a non-consensual act and, as adumbrated, rooted in violence, coercion, and domination, where the perpetrator disregards the victim's autonomy and consent. In contrast, fornication refers to consensual sexual relations between individuals who are not married to each other. The Pakistan Penal Code addresses fornication in section 496-B. It is punishable as a Ta'zir by up to five years' imprisonment and a fine not exceeding ten thousand rupees.

15.  Section 203-C Cr.P.C. prescribes a special procedure for prosecuting the offence of fornication. Most importantly, it mandates that no court shall take cognizance of such an offence except upon a complaint filed in a court of competent jurisdiction.

16.  Since consent is pivotal in determining the offence of rape, we need to examine it in more detail. Section 375 P.P.C outlines seven specific circumstances under which the law deems there is no consent if a perpetrator commits any of the acts specified in clauses (a) to (d) of the section. These include, firstly, when these acts are committed against the victim's will and, secondly, when they are done without the victim's consent.

17.  In Muhammad Ashraf v. The State (1997 PCr.LJ 1351), the Federal Shariat Court, while interpreting section 6 of the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hadood) Ordinance 1979, clarified the distinction between "against the will" and "without consent," holding that both scenarios constitute Zina-bil-Jabar (rape). The Court referred to Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary, and noted that the term "will," refers to the "power or faculty of choosing or determining, act of using this power; volition, choice; determination." In contrast, "consent" signifies "to be of the same mind; to agree to give assent; to yield; to comply." The Court explained that consent necessarily implies agreement as a free agent, with the presence of a free mind and free will. Therefore, when an individual (victim) is subjected to an act that they would not have consented to or permitted had they been free to make a genuine choice, such an act is deemed to have been done against their will. In other words, the key question is whether the individual would have acted in the same manner if they had a real choice to act differently. If the availability of choice was illusory or rendered redundant by the circumstances, the act in question is considered to have been carried out against the individual's will. The Court further stated that the absence of a genuine choice or the ability to exercise free will may arise from various factors, such as the position of dominance or authority held by the perpetrator, fiduciary obligations, supervisory control, or the victim's dependence on the perpetrator. The Court observed that Muslim jurists have discussed the subject of Jabar under the head of Ikrah and referring to the celebrated treatise of Dr. Abdul Karim Zaidan, Professor of Fiqah Islami, University of Baghdad, Iraq, concluded:

       "'Ikrah' may be inferred from the very situation in which a victim may find herself unable to protest or where the faculty to determine her course of action is so affected that she had no control over the action or the event or she would not have acted that way if left to make a choice. The very force of circumstances may constitute Jabr (Ikrah).

18.  The third situation is where the victim's consent is obtained by putting them or any person in whom they are interested in fear of death or hurt. The fourth circumstance pertains to consent obtained through deception. If the perpetrator deceives the victim into believing they are lawfully married when they are not, and the victim consents based on this belief, the law considers such consent invalid. The fifth circumstance is when the victim is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the act due to unsoundness of mind, intoxication, or the administration of stupefying substances. Consent given under these conditions is considered invalid, as the victim lacks the capacity to make an informed decision. The sixth circumstance involves victims under the age of sixteen. The law categorically states that any sexual act involving a minor, whether or not consent is given, constitutes rape. This provision protects minors, recognizing their inability to provide valid consent due to their immaturity. The seventh circumstance arises when the victim is unable to communicate consent. This includes situations where the victim is unconscious, paralyzed, or otherwise physically or mentally incapacitated, leaving them unable to express agreement. The inability to communicate consent negates any presumption of its presence, ensuring that vulnerable individuals are safeguarded under the law.

19.  Section 375 P.P.C includes several explanations that provide further clarity. Explanation 1 expands the definition of the term "vagina" to include the labia majora, ensuring comprehensive anatomical coverage. Explanation 2 elaborates on the concept of consent, emphasizing that it must be an unequivocal voluntary agreement to participate in a specific sexual act. Explanation 3 broadens the scope of the law by defining a "person" to include males, females, and transgender individuals, ensuring inclusivity in its application. Explanation 4 explicitly excludes bona fide medical procedures or interventions from the definition of rape, preventing the misuse of the provision.

20.  The principles underlying section 375 P.P.C are further reinforced by section 90 P.P.C, which provides a general framework for determining the validity of consent in the broader context of criminal law.

21.  The expressions "unequivocal voluntary agreement" and "specific sexual act" in Explanation 2 of section 375 P.P.C are significant. Consent must be an affirmative and conscious decision, clearly communicated through words, gestures, or other verbal or non-verbal forms of expression. It must be given freely, without pressure or coercion. Silence, passivity, or lack of resistance cannot be deemed consent. Moreover, consent is not a blanket authorization but is confined to what is explicitly agreed. If a victim initially consents to a particular act but later withdraws that consent, or if the accused continues the act despite the withdrawal or engages in a different act for which consent was not given, the law unequivocally classifies the act as non-consensual, thereby constituting rape.

22.  The determination of consent in rape cases is often complex and fact-specific. The burden of proving the absence of consent initially lies with the prosecution, which can be discharged by presenting credible evidence, typically including the victim's testimony, medical examination reports, and forensic evidence. Since the offence of rape generally occurs in private, finding independent witnesses is challenging. Consequently, the victim's solitary statement can suffice to secure a conviction in a rape case, provided that it is trustworthy, consistent, and reliable.

23.  In cases where direct evidence is unavailable, circumstantial evidence plays a pivotal role in guiding judicial reasoning and determining the presence of consent. This includes factors such as the victim's physical condition, injuries suggesting resistance, forensic findings like DNA evidence linking the accused to the crime, the timing and sequence of events, or communication records such as messages or calls between the parties. However, it is essential to emphasize that the absence of injuries on the victim's body or signs of physical resistance does not automatically indicate consent. As discussed, Explanation 2 of section 375 P.P.C explicitly provides that physical resistance is not a prerequisite for establishing non-consensual intercourse.

24.  In Muhammad Imran v. The State and another (Criminal Petition No. 725/2023, decided on 26.06.2024), Justice Ayesha A. Malik stated that there is no assumption, either in law or practice, that a woman gave her consent simply because there are no marks of resistance. She observed that the offence of rape deeply affects the victim, both physically and psychologically. According to expert psychiatrists, victims of trauma, particularly sexual violence, may exhibit "fight, flight, or freeze" responses, with the freeze response often rendering them incapable of taking protective action. This reflexive reaction to fear or threat is highly subjective and varies from individual to individual. Moreover, the use of force, intimidation, and the trauma of the act itself can result in responses that are unpredictable and unique to each victim. Consequently, there is no universal or predictable behaviour for victims of rape, nor can their response - or lack thereof - be used as conclusive evidence against them.

25.  Once the prosecution has discharged its initial burden, the burden of proof shifts to the accused to substantiate claims of consent. Under Articles 117 and 119 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, the accused bears the onus to provide credible evidence of consent. This may include evidence of a pre-existing consensual relationship, communications suggesting mutual agreement, or an alternative explanation for the prosecution's evidence. The accused is not required to prove consent beyond a reasonable doubt but must raise a credible and plausible defence sufficient to create reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case. Failure to do so can result in a finding of guilt.

26.  The court's role is critical in balancing these shifting burdens. It must rigorously scrutinize the prosecution's evidence to ensure it meets the high threshold of proving the absence of consent beyond a reasonable doubt. At the same time, the court must evaluate the accused's evidence or defence to assess its plausibility and credibility.

27.  Let's now turn to the case at hand. The Complainant has nominated the Petitioner in the FIR, alleging that he exploited their interactions and raped her. She has also accused him of threatening her and taking objectionable pictures to coerce her into silence. She reiterated these allegations in her statement recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C. Medical and forensic evidence confirm that sexual intercourse occurred on the relevant day.

28.  During the investigation, the police concluded that the case involved fornication rather than rape. These findings are essentially based on CCTV footage, pictures, and WhatsApp messages exchanged between the parties. While this evidence suggests a close relationship, possibly closer than the Complainant acknowledges, it does not definitively establish whether the act was consensual. This critical determination requires thorough scrutiny of all the evidence during the trial.

29.  As previously discussed, under section 375 P.P.C, threats, intimidation, or coercion invalidate consent. Therefore, if proven, the allegations of pointing a pistol and threatening to release objectionable content would render any apparent consent irrelevant. The trial court is the appropriate forum to evaluate the evidence, including the CCTV footage, WhatsApp messages, and other material, to determine the nature of the offence.

30.  Pre-arrest bail is an extraordinary remedy reserved for cases where the accused can demonstrate that the FIR was lodged with mala fide intent, personal animosity, or the like. The Petitioner has failed to satisfy this requirement. Claims of inconsistencies in the prosecution's evidence, such as discrepancies between the FIR and the Complainant's statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., necessitate detailed scrutiny alongside other evidence. Such an evaluation is beyond the purview of a pre-arrest bail application.

31.  Considering the seriousness of the allegations and the absence of any exceptional circumstances justifying pre-arrest bail, this application is dismissed.

Ss. 500 & 502-A---Defamation---Private complaint---Petitioner filed private complaint against the respondent with the contention that he levelled false allegation of zina upon her---Complaint was dismissed by the Trial Court---Validity---Admittedly, the accusation of zina/illicit terms with "RM" against the petitioner was imputed by the respondent in divorce deed dated 07.06.2020, which he repeatedly made in the pleadings of the suits and family matters, which he also reiterated and reaffirmed in presence of the Court and in public, in union council office, and judicial/non-judicial proceedings, even after severing marital bond with the petitioner and no longer remaining her husband---This prima facie fell within the definition of Qazf and there was no question of applicability of the provisions of S.14 of the Offence of Qazf (Enforcement of Hadd) Ordinance, 1979 regarding the li'an in this case---Trial judge very conveniently overlooked such aspects of the case and dismissed the subject complaint, being not maintainable, holding that the respondent, who was the husband of the petitioner, had made the accusation of zina/ illicit relations against the petitioner during subsistence of the marriage, therefore, the provisions of S.14 of the Qazf Ordinance, 1979, were attracted to the case of the petitioner---Petitioner had supported the contents of her complaint by cursory evidence and she had also been supported by the witnesses in their respective cursory statements recorded before the Judicial Magistrate, who after conducting preliminary enquiry under S.202, Cr.P.C, and recording the statements of petitioner's witnesses submitted his enquiry report dated 16.01.2023, in affirmative, which had also been completely ignored by the trial judge while passing the impugned order---Said material brought on the record had to be considered to determine whether a prima facie case was made out or not and no deeper appreciation was required at the initial stage---

2022 SCMR 2130
A will can therefore be considered as a formal document drawn up by a natural person wherein he expresses his wish as to how he would want his estate to be distributed after their death. By virtue of the fact that wills operate after the death of the donor, they are considered testamentary instruments i.e. instruments that come into effect after the death of the donor/testator. A will, therefore, ceases to be a will if it is executed and acted upon during the lifetime of the testator. Instead, a will executed in the lifetime of a donor takes on the guise of an inter-vivos instrument i.e. an instrument which is executed within the lifetime of a person which can take the form of a gift which has its own requirements and different standards of proof. It is not the case of any of the parties that the instruments in question were gift deeds. It is admitted in the pleadings of the brothers that the wills were executed and acted upon during the lifetimes of the late Abdul Salam Khan and Jameela Begum. This facturn alone brings into question the validity of the wills in light of Section 2(h) of the Succession Act, 1925. However, the veracity of the wills have not been questioned in the light of their legality per se but have instead been challenged with respect to their incongruity in light of Sharia.
2022 SCMR 2130
The sons have been given the lion's share in the inheritable pool of properties especially with respect to lucrative revenue-generating properties/ businesses to the complete exclusion of the daughters. A shariacompliant will would not act as an ex-ante instrument which regulates the inheritable shares of any and all legal heirs before the actual opening of the testator's estate. This would be the case even where the ultimate value received by all the legal heirs is equivalent to what would have been their receivable Quranic share at the time of the opening of the estate. The daughters were just as entitled as their brothers to a share in their fathers businesses and other properties at the time the estate would have opened up. They were denied that opportunity to become shareholders by virtue of their Quranic rights of inheritance in the suit properties by virtue of the wills in question. The wills had, in essence, ex-ante deprived Quranic inheritors of their shares in properties which they would have received at the time of the opening of the estate for inheritance.
2022 SCMR 2130
There are four ingredients that need to be present before the benefit of the equitable doctrine of bona fide purchaser without notice can be claimed. In the present case, the question whether the sons were ostensible owners is answered in the affirmative for the reason that the mutations in their name had been sanctioned pursuant to unchallenged wills. Since the wills had not been challenged by Zakia Begum or the other legal heirs at the time of the purchase, the wills could reasonably have been construed as valid and titleconferring documents. Since the wills were not challenged and the Sons were the only ostensible owner(s) of the purchased suit properties, it was not required of the Purchasers to inquire into whether all the legal heirs of the suit properties had consented to the purchase between purchasers and the sons. Only the express consent and/or acquiescence of the sons was required at the time of sale. The transfers were made for consideration, satisfying the third ingredient. The final ingredient i.e. acting in good faith and taking reasonable care before entering into a transaction would have required the purchasers to do due diligence when purchasing properties from the Sons. No doubt when the Purchasers exercised due diligence by approaching the revenue records for ascertaining title of the properties being the record would have shown that the sons were the owners of the properties and had become owners by virtue of the unchallenged wills. We therefore have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that Section 41 of the TPA 1882 applies to case of the Purchasers and that they were entitled to the equitable protection available to them under Section 41 of the TPA 1882.

Abdul Basit Versus.The State and others-

--Ss. 365-B & 376---Abducting or inducing woman to compel for marriage, rape---Appreciation of evidence---Ocular account furnished by victim---Victim sole eyewitness of the occurrence---Sufficient for conviction---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Ocular account was furnished by victim/complainant alone, whereas, statement of father of the victim was about post occurrence events---In her examination-in-chief the victim reiterated the story as had been set out in the complaint/FIR and deposed about step by step events in the same sequence---Complainant was subjected to cross-examination at sufficient length but nothing damaging to the prosecution or favourable to the defence could be elicited from her mouth---By tenor of cross-examination the defence tried to bring on record that at one point of time the victim and the accused/appellant were residing in the same village and parents of the accused/appellant as well as victim had friendly relations, thus they both i.e. accused/appellant and the victim, were known to each other---Instead of lending any support to the defence, the admission of the victim on above aspects went on to strengthen the prosecution's stance as it was the case of prosecution itself that because of such friendly relations the accused/appellant used to visit the house of the victim's parents along with co-accused, with whom the victim also developed relations and out of such linkage she left the house along with co-accused to make some purchases and fell prey to nefarious activity by the accused/appellant---Since the statement of the victim, had been found to be worthy of credence, confidence inspiring, credible and irrefutable, therefore, even if she was a sole witness, her statement could safely be made basis to record conviction---Circumstances established that prosecution had proved the case against the appellant beyond shadow of reasonable doubt---

Nude pictures---Legal requirements for using such pictures as evidence for convicting accused---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Audio/video clip including snaps/ photographs as evidence maintained a dual character in the law of evidence; it is termed as document as well as a material thing (physical evidence), also known as real evidence---Snaps/ photographs do carry information that includes expression, gestures, voice and video, therefore, such clips/snaps are sought to be produced before the Court to prove the 'information' contained in it as evidence of facts recorded therein and oral account of which is to be spoken by a witness and not by the document alone---While as material thing it is to be produced for the inspection of Court---Principles of evidence relating to admissibility of documents are fully applicable on such type of evidence---Permission and sanction of law to bring on record evidence if it is in the form of document is regulated under Art.139 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Said Article in the light of illustration therein authorizes the Court to ask, when any witness is making statement about a fact, to support his contention with any document if such fact is incorporated therein---Room for such discretion of Court is obviously reflective of farsighted wisdom of legislature to cater to the requirement of an emerging need of evidence in a particular situation for the purpose of corroboration to fortify or strengthen the deposition---Documentary evidence runs over or defeats the oral evidence under the maxim "res ipsa loquitor"---Second status of such evidence is of material thing (physical evidence) or oral evidence which is produced for the inspection of Court as ordained in second proviso to Art. 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---In the present case pictures were put to the accused/appellant during his statement under S.342, Cr.P.C., for seeking his explanation but neither he challenged such pictures in any manner during cross-examination nor gave any explanation in his statement under S.342, Cr.P.C.---Silence of the accused/appellant over such an important factor connoted that there was nothing to defend against such nude pictures, thus the requirement of law for using these snaps/pictures was completed and those could safely be used as evidence---

Delay of one and half month in lodging the FIR---Inconsequential---Victim trying to protect her honour and reputation and that of her family---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---In this case, undoubtedly, the FIR was registered after almost one and half month of the crime having been committed---However, such delay in reporting the matter to the police was immaterial in the sense that throughout it had been the stance of the victim that her nude pictures were taken by the accused/appellant, she was blackmailed and she fell victim number of times during her captivity under such pressure and fear, therefore, she kept mum in order to save her and the family honour---When nude pictures of victim were thrown in her house and the matter stood disclosed to family members, she narrated the whole occurrence---Thus, victim being an educated lady with qualification of MA English had definitely been thinking about her family honour as well as her social and practical life before reporting the matter to police---Even otherwise, the fact that the modesty of a virgin girl was violated by sexual assault explained the apprehension of the victim and her family in approaching the police immediately---Delay in reporting the crime to the police in respect of an offence involving a person's honour and reputation which society may view unsympathetically could play on the minds of a victim and her family and deter them to go to the police---

Medical evidence---Medical officer not cross-examined---Effect---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Though the medical evidence did not contain any fact that sexual act was committed with the victim by force but it was clear from the statement of victim that she was under the effect of intoxication as well as fear of nude pictures, therefore, in either of the situations, she could not resist the act of rape---Otherwise, of course the said act of intercourse was against the will and consent of victim, which was the requirement of S.375, P.P.C---During medical examination Woman Medical Officer also found hymen of victim as old torn, though she was unmarried but Medical Officer was not even cross-examined by the defence about any fact contained in Medico-Legal Report---Moreover, it was in the evidence that delayed Medico-Legal Examination was due to the reason that victim was terrified---Prosecution had also produced Medical Officer who had examined the accused/appellant and found him potent to perform sexual act; his observations in that respect were recorded in Medico-Legal Report, therefore, such examination was also a relevant fact showing ability of accused/appellant to commit rape with the victim---

Qanun-e-Shahadat  Arts. 27 & 68---Abducting or inducing woman to compel for marriage, rape---Appreciation of evidence---Bad character of accused---Scope---Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused kidnapped the complainant and raped her, and accused also prepared her nude pictures for blackmailing---Bad character of accused in criminal cases was not relevant under Art.68 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Perusal of evidence showed that defence itself conceded the involvement of the appellant in offence of dacoity while putting question upon the victim during her cross-examination, which turned attention to Art.27 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 dealing with relevancy of facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body or bodily feeling---In the evidence of that case facts were brought on record that the appellant had affiliation with victim since her childhood and also wanted to marry her, therefore what he had done could not be regarded as innocent mistake rather his state of mind and bodily feeling made him to commit such a heinous offence---Thus, inclination and attraction of accused towards victim was a relevant fact in the case which could safely be read against him for his intention to commit act of rape and preparation of nude pictures---

Judgment
.--- Abdul Basit, hereinafter to be called as "accused/appellant" faced trial before learned Additional Sessions Judge/GBV, Multan in case FIR No.354 dated 24.05.2018 under sections 365-B/376 P.P.C Police Station New Multan and on conclusion of trial vide judgment dated 23.07.2022 he was convicted under section 365-B P.P.C and sentenced to imprisonment for life with fine of Rs.50,000/-, in case of default to further undergo six month's simple imprisonment. He was also convicted under section 376(i) P.P.C and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for fifteen years with fine of Rs.50,000/-, in case of default to further suffer simple imprisonment for six months; both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently and benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended, hence the instant appeal.

2.    According to the prosecution case as reflected from FIR Ex.PA/2 lodged on the complaint of Nadia Shaheen (victim), she was unmarried and living with her parents, the accused/appellant and Mst. Haseena Bibi (since PO) used to visit her parents, thus she developed friendship with Mst. Haseena Bibi. On 09.04.2018 at 5.00 p.m. Mst. Haseena Bibi came to her house and took her along for making some purchases from Gulshan Market. On their way near Chowk Kumharanawala the accused/appellant, already known to the victim came on a car and offered them a drive; the victim refused but Mst. Haseena forced, whereupon she sat in the car. At Vehari Chowk when the car stopped, the victim reminded Mst. Haseena Bibi to go for Gulshan Market, whereupon, Mst. Haseena pretended an urgent work there. After a while, the accused/appellant and Mst. Haseena brought sandwich and after eating it the victim became unconscious; both of them took her to the house of Mst. Haseena where accused/appellant committed rape with her with the help of Mst. Haseena and also prepared her nude pictures. On returning to senses the victim raised the voice, whereupon, both the accused while showing her nude pictures threatened to upload the same on internet. The accused/appellant continued committing rape with her and transferred her pictures to his mobile phone for the purpose of blackmailing. After two days when her health condition got worst, both the accused left her at Nishtar Hospital, Multan, where from her father and brother took her to the house. Because of intensive mental stress she did not tell anything to them, whereas, accused/appellant constantly threatened her to marry with him. She further narrated that as per her knowledge the pictures which the accused/appellant had shared with her, were still available in the mobile phone of the accused/appellant; ultimately the victim disclosed the entire facts to her parents and along with her complaint she also produced the pictures which the accused/appellant had thrown in her house.

3.    After registration of FIR and completion of investigation finally report under section 173 Cr.P.C was submitted against the accused/appellant. When charge sheeted, the accused/appellant denied the charges and claimed to be tried, whereupon, the prosecution examined Mst. Nadia Shaheen (victim) as PW-1; Ghulam Akbar, father of the victim appeared in the dock as PW-2; Shakeela 944/LC (PW-3) who took the victim to hospital for her medical examination; Zafar Iqbal Sub-Inspector (PW-5) and Ghulam Mustafa (PW-7) had investigated the case; Dr. Nasir Javed (PW-6) conducted potency test of the accused/appellant; Waseem Akram Sub-Inspector (PW-9) got issued non-warrants of arrest of the accused following by proclamation and Dr. Nighat Noureen (PW-10) medically examined the victim and rest of the witnesses appeared and made statements about the roles performed by them during the course of investigation. The accused neither opted to appear in the witness box as required by section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in defence and the trial ended in his conviction and sentence, as detailed above.

4.    Learned counsel for the appellant seeks acquittal on the grounds of delay in FIR, delayed medicolegal examination of victim, un-supporting medical evidence without DNA, sole testimony of victim without corroboration with regard to act of rape. Learned District Public Prosecutor assisted by counsel for the complainant supported the impugned judgment due to trust worthy and confidence inspiring statement of victim, supported by res gestae evidence of her father, medicolegal opinion of old torn hymen being unmarried lady and nude pictures of victim prepared by the appellant wherein he is also visible.

5.    Arguments heard. Record perused.

6.    Here in the instant case, the prosecution intended to establish the charge against the accused/appellant through the ocular account, medical evidence and the nude pictures of the victim P-1 to P-5, which were allegedly thrown into the house of victim and those which were produced on behalf of the accused/appellant i.e., P-6 to P-10. The ocular account was furnished by Mst. Nadia Shaheen victim/complainant (PW-1) alone, whereas, statements of Ghulam Akbar (PW-2) father of the victim is about post occurrence events, including recovery of nude pictures P-1 to P5 produced before the police and P-6 to P-10 on the information of accused/appellant from his house. Conscious of the fact that the victim/complainant was the solitary witness of the occurrence, we have thoroughly and carefully gone through her statement to dig out that she may have falsely involved the accused/appellant in this case in order to wreck vengeance or it may have been a motivated attempt on the part of the prosecution to level some score against the accused/appellant, but in her examination-in-chief the victim reiterated the story as had been set out in the complaint/FIR and deposed about step by step events in the same sequence. She was subjected to cross-examination at sufficient length but nothing damaging to the prosecution or favourable to the defence could be elicited from her mouth. By tenor of cross-examination the defence tried to bring on record that at one point of time the victim and the accused/appellant were residing in the same village and parents of the accused/appellant as well as victim had friendly relations, thus they both i.e. accused/appellant and the victim, were known to each other. Instead of lending any support to the defence, the admission of the victim on above aspects goes on to strengthen the prosecution's stance as it was the case of prosecution itself that because of such friendly relations the accused/appellant used to visit the house of the victim's parents along with Mst. Haseena Bibi, with whom the victim also developed relations and out of such linkage she left the house along with Mst. Haseena Bibi to make some purchases and fell prey to nefarious activity by the accused/appellant.

7.    Since the statement of the victim, direct evidence, has been found to be worthy of credence, confidence inspiring, credible and irrefutable, therefore, even if there is a sole witness, her statement can safely be made basis to record conviction. As to the number of witnesses required to establish a charge, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as "Muhammad Mansha v. The State" (2001 SCMR 199) with reference to Article 17(1)(b) of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 held that:-

       "7. A bare perusal would reveal that the language as employed in the 'said Article 17(1) (b) is free from any ambiguity and no scholarly interpretation is required. The provisions as reproduced hereinabove of the said Article would make it abundant clear that particular number of witnesses shall not be required for the proof of any fact meaning thereby that a fact can be proved only by a single witness "it is not seldom that a crime has been committed in the presence of only one witness, leaving aside those cases which are not of uncommon occurrence, where determination of guilt depends entirely on circumstantial evidence. If the Legislature were to insist upon plurality witnesses, case where the testimony of a single witness only could be available in proof of the crime, would go unpunished. It is here that the discretion of the Presiding Judge comes into play. The matter thus must depend upon the circumstances of each case and the quality of the evidence of the single witness whose testimony has to be either accepted or rejected. If such a testimony is found by the Court to be entirely reliable, there is no legal impediment to the conviction of the accused person on such proof. Even as the guilt of an accused person may be proved by the testimony of a single witness, the innocence of an accused person may be established on the testimony of a single witness, even though considerable number of witnesses may be forthcoming to testify to the truth of the case, for the prosecution. The Court is concerned with the quality and not with the quantity of the evidence necessary for proving or disproving a fact". (Principles and Digest of the Law of Evidence by M. Monir, page 1458).

       The Supreme Court further held that:-

       "……..no yardstick can be fixed as to whether statement of a solitary witness must or must not be relied upon for the simple reason that each case has its own peculiar circumstances which shall play a significant role and is motivating factor to determine the reliability of a solitary witness as the said aspect of the matter is to be dilated upon in the light of surrounding circumstances which may be taken into consideration or otherwise. We may mention here that such circumstances also cannot be confined within a limited sphere of any definition because the same may be infinitely diversified by the situation and conduct of the parties concerned. "The only general rule that can be laid down is that the circumstances must be such as would lead the guarded decision of a reasonable and just man to the conclusion".

       Thus, the well-recognized maxim remains that 'evidence has to be weighed and not counted' and here in this case as discussed above the ocular testimony though coming through one witness i.e. victim, yet the same is consistent, unimpeachable and confidence inspiring, therefore, is held to be sufficient to establish the charge. Reference may be made to the case reported as "Muhammad Ehsan v. The State" (2006 SCMR 1857). It has been held by Supreme Court in case reported as "Atif Zareef and others v. The State" (PLD 2021 SC 550) that rape victim stands on a high pedestal than an injured witness, because an injured witness gets the injury on physical form while rape victim suffers psychologically and emotionally, and single testimony is sufficient to uphold the conviction.

8.    Ghulam Akbar PW-2 father of victim deposed res gestae evidence about condition of victim when he and his son Shahbaz met her in Nishtar Hospital, Multan. PW-2 narrated the situation as under;

       "After two days, my daughter Nadia made a call on phone and informed us that she was present in Nishtar Hospital and her condition was bad. I along with my son Shahbaz went to Nishtar Hospital wherefrom, we brought back Mst. Nadia to our home. We kept on asking what had happened with her but she did not tell us anything and used to weep."

       Similarly, during cross-examination he responded as under;

       "When we had been asking our daughter Mst. Nadia where she was for two days but she started to weep and remained silent. My wife had also been asking about the reason of her weeping but she said nothing to her."

       He has also stated the fact of collection of nude pictures from his house allegedly thrown by the appellant, which has a support to prosecution case. He deposed in his examination in chief that we had family relation with accused Abdul Basit and Haseena Bibi co-accused (since PO). He had no axe to grind against the accused/appellant, nor anything was spoken against him by the defence. His support to save her family honour is reflected from the fact that he is pursuing the case and is present before us even in this appeal proceedings.

9.    In addition to the above, five nude pictures allegedly thrown by the accused/appellant in the house of the victim, were also produced before the Investigating Officer at the time of registration of case, however, were taken into possession after three days through recovery memo P-1 to P-5 (Ex.PC) and accused also produced similar pictures before the police P-6 to P-10 (Ex.PD) on call from his house. Though no evidence is available that who had produced such pictures from the accused side, likewise it has been admitted by the victim during cross-examination that no one knew that who had thrown the pictures (P-1 to P-5) in her house, but the pictures produced by the complainant party clearly show that first part of the prosecution story stands proved which was to the effect that accused after making nude pictures of the victim started blackmailing for commission of rape with her.

10.  We have observed that in one of the nude pictures P-1 to P-5 and P-6 to P-10, the accused/appellant is also visible while sitting with the side of the victim who fell unconscious. The information contained in the picture clearly speaks about the story of the victim that in a condition of unconsciousness her nude pictures were prepared by the accused/appellant, therefore, the question before us is as to whether such pictures could be used as evidence in support of prosecution case. It is trite that an audio/video clip including snaps/photographs as evidence maintains a dual character in the law of evidence; it is termed as document as well as a material thing (physical evidence), also known as real evidence. It does carry information that includes expression, gestures, voice and video; therefore, such clips/snaps are sought to be produced before the Court to prove the 'information' contained in it as evidence of facts recorded therein and oral account of which is to be spoken by a witness and not the document alone. While as material thing it is to be produced for the inspection of court. Principles of evidence relating to admissibility of documents are fully applicable on such type of evidence; permission and sanction of law to bring on record evidence if it is in the form of document is regulated under Article 139 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (the Order). This Article in the light of illustration therein authorizes the Court to ask, when any witness is making statement about a fact, to support his contention with any document if such fact is incorporated therein. The room for such discretion of Court is obviously reflective of farsighted wisdom of legislature to cater to the requirement of an emerging need of evidence in a particular situation for the purpose of corroboration to fortify or strengthen the deposition; even otherwise best evidence rule says that documentary evidence runs over or defeats the oral evidence under the maxim "res ipsa liquitor". The second status of such evidence is of material thing (physical evidence) or real evidence which is produced for the inspection of Court as ordained in second proviso to Article 71 of The Order: -

       "Provided further that, if oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of any material thing other than a document, the Court may, if it thinks fit, require the production of such material thing for its inspection"

       Articles 139 and 71 of the Order in detail in this context have been discussed and explained in a case reported as "Numan alias Nomi and others v. The STATE" (2023 P Cr. L J 1394).

11.  In a book "THE MODERN LAW OF EVIDENCE (Third edition) by Adrian Keane published by Butterworths (1994), the author while referring to a verdict of Sir Jocelyn Smith P, passed in a case reported as "The Statue of Liberty" [1968] 1 WLR 739 mentions as under;

       "It is tempting, on the basis of these words of Sir Jocelyn Smith P, to conclude that photographs and films, the relevance of which can be established by the testimony of someone with personal knowledge of the circumstance in which the photographs or films was taken or made, are admissible items of real evidence and can never give rise to problems of a hearsay nature. If the evidence of a witness to certain events is admissible, it may be reasoned, then photographs or films recording those same events should be no less admissible."

       In R v. Cook [1987] 1 All ER 1049 (CA) at page 1054, Watkins LJ has gone so far as to state that photograph, together with the sketch and photofit, are in a class of evidence of their own to which neither the rule against hearsay nor rule against previous consistent or self-serving statements applies.

       In R v. Williams (1984) 79 Cr App Rep 220 (CA), the Court of Appeal entertained no doubt that photographs taken by security cameras installed at a building society office at which an armed robbery was attempted, were admissible in evidence, being relevant to the issue of both whether an offence was committed and, if so, who committed it. It seems that it is not necessary to prove that the photographic material is original or an authentic copy; proof that the material relates to the events in question will suffice. Case reported as "The Road We're Travelling On, v. Treacy" [1989] New Law Journal (NLJ) 1079 is referred. In the attending circumstance and on the strength of above case laws, pictures P-1 to P5 can validly be used against the accused/appellant. In the case reported as "Muhammad Zaman v. The State and others" (2014 SCMR 749), the Supreme Court of Pakistan apart from other evidence relied on the pictures produced in evidence during trial and converted acquittal of the accused into their conviction.

12.  We have noted that such pictures were put to the accused/appellant during his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. for seeking his explanation but neither he challenged such pictures in any manner during cross-examination nor gave any explanation in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. Silence of the accused/appellant over such an important factor connotes that there was nothing to defend against such nude pictures, thus the requirement of law for using these snaps/pictures is complete as highlighted above and these can safely be used as evidence.

13.  Here in this case, undoubtedly, the FIR was registered after almost one and half month of the crime having been committed but such delay in reporting the matter to the police is immaterial in the sense that throughout it has been stance of the victim that her nude pictures were taken by the accused/appellant, she was blackmailed and she fell victim number of times during her captivity under such pressure and fear, therefore, she kept mum in order to save her and the family honour but when her nude pictures were thrown in her house and the matter stood disclosed to family members, she narrated the whole occurrence. Delay in reporting the matter was responded by her during cross examination as under:-

       "It is correct that I remained silent for about one and half month after the occurrence and did not get the case registered against the accused. There were thoughts in my mind for reporting the matter to police but due to intimidation of the accused, I abstained."

       Another reason for delay in registration of FIR was also deposed by PW-2 in following words:-

       "I took my daughter with me to P.S., New Multan and the police of said police station sent us to women police center. For few days, the police had been putting off and ultimately on 21.05.2018, they received application from me which is Exh. P-A."

       Thus, victim being an educated lady with qualification of MA English had definitely been thinking hundred times about her family honour as well as her social and practical life before reporting the matter to police. Even otherwise, the fact that the modesty of a virgin girl was violated by sexual assault makes understandable the apprehension of the victim and her family in approaching the police immediately. Delay in reporting the crime to the police in respect of an offence involving a person's honour and reputation which society may view unsympathetically could prey on the minds of a victim and her family and deter them to go to the police. Reliance in this respect is palced on case reported as "Hamid Khan v. The State" (1981 SCMR 448).

14.  Though the medical evidence does not contain any fact that sexual act was committed with the victim by force but it is clear from the statement of victim that she was under the effect of intoxication as well as fear of nude pictures, therefore, in either of the situation she could not resist the act of rape, but otherwise, of course the said act of intercourse was against her will and consent, which is the requirement of section 375 P.P.C. During medical examination Dr. Nighat Noureen PW-10 also found hymen of victim as old torn, though she was unmarried but doctor was not even cross examined by the defence about any fact contained in MLR. It is in the evidence that delayed medicolegal examination was due to the reason victim was terrified and this fact she has disclosed, while responding to questions during cross examination, as under;

       "My father and my brother had asked me to take me to the doctor but I refused and insisted to take me to home. My parents were insisting me for my medical treatment but I was scared and terrified that I refused and I said that I would not get out of the room."

15.  Prosecution has also produced Dr. Nasir Javed PW-6 who had examined the accused/appellant on 14/10/2020 and found him potent to perform sexual act; his observations in this respect are recorded in MLR, Ex.PP; therefore, such examination is also a relevant fact showing ability of accused/appellant to commit rape with the victim.

16.  Learned counsel for the complainant tried to show the Bench some FIRs registered against the appellant for his involvement in offences of murder and dacoity to assert his bad character. We are afraid such course is not permissible under the law, and even otherwise bad character of accused in criminal cases is not relevant under Article 68 of the Order; but perusal of evidence shows that defence itself conceded the involvement of the appellant in offence of dacoity while putting question upon the victim during her cross examination, which turned our attention to Article 27 of the Order dealing with relevancy of facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body or bodily feeling. In the evidence of this case facts were brought on record that the appellant has affiliation with victim since her childhood and also wanted to marry her, therefore what he has done cannot be regarded as innocent mistake rather his state of mind and bodily feeling roasted her to commit such a heinous offence. Thus, his inclination and attraction towards victim is a relevant fact in this case which can safely be read against him for his intention to commit act of rape and preparation of nude pictures.

17.  For what has been discussed above, it is evident that prosecution has proved the case against the appellant beyond shadow of reasonable doubt, a standard requisite to sustain a criminal charge. There is no legitimate exception to findings arrived at by the learned trial court with respect to conviction and quantum of sentence awarded to the accused/appellant. The instant appeal, therefore, being devoid of merit, is dismissed. The case property, if any, shall be dealt with as ordered by the learned trial court and the record of the learned trial court be sent back immediately.

[1/11/26, 12:46:07 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: حکومتِ پنجاب نے صوبے میں پرتشدد مظاہروں، ہنگامہ آرائی اور غیر قانونی اجتماعات پر مؤثر قابو پانے کے لیے پنجاب پولیس آرڈر 2002 میں بڑی اور فیصلہ کن ترمیم نافذ کر دی ہے۔ یہ ترمیم Police Order (Second Amendment) Act 2025 کے تحت کی گئی، جسے صوبائی اسمبلی سے منظوری کے بعد گورنر پنجاب نے 5 جنوری 2026 کو توثیق دی، اور اسے 6 جنوری 2026 کو پنجاب گزٹ (Extraordinary) میں شائع کر دیا گیا۔
ترمیم شدہ قانون کے تحت پرتشدد ہجوم (Riot / Unlawful Assembly) کا رویہ اب ناقابلِ ضمانت اور قابلِ دست اندازی جرم قرار دے دیا گیا ہے، جس کا ٹرائل سیشن کورٹ میں ہوگا۔ قانون میں سزاؤں کو غیر معمولی طور پر سخت کر دیا گیا ہے، جن میں دس سال تک قید اور ایک سے پانچ لاکھ روپے تک جرمانہ شامل ہے۔ 
*M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE 03336287215*
ترمیم کے ذریعے پولیس آرڈر میں نئی قانونی اصطلاحات شامل کی گئی ہیں، جن میں Riot، Unlawful Assembly، Incident Commander، Riot Management Unit اور Riot Zone شامل ہیں۔ اب کسی بھی علاقے میں اگر پرتشدد مظاہرہ یا غیر قانونی اجتماع ہو تو ڈپٹی کمشنر اور ضلعی پولیس افسر مشترکہ طور پر اسے “Riot Zone” قرار دے سکیں گے، جس کے بعد سڑکوں کی بندش، علاقے کا گھیراؤ اور عوام کو وہاں سے نکلنے کے احکامات دیے جا سکیں گے۔
قانون میں پہلی مرتبہ Riot Management Unit کے قیام کو باقاعدہ قانونی حیثیت دی گئی ہے، جو صوبے بھر میں فسادات اور ہنگاموں سے نمٹنے کی ذمہ دار ہوگی۔ اس یونٹ کی سربراہی ایڈیشنل انسپکٹر جنرل پولیس کے رینک کا افسر کرے گا، جبکہ یونٹ کو جدید تربیت اور سازوسامان فراہم کیا جائے گا۔

نئی دفعات کے تحت Incident Commander کو غیر قانونی اجتماع منتشر کرنے، وارننگ جاری کرنے، افراد کو حراست میں لینے اور مختلف اداروں کے درمیان رابطہ کاری کے وسیع اختیارات دے دیے گئے ہیں۔ تاہم یہ بھی واضح کیا گیا ہے کہ کارروائی ضابطہ فوجداری کی دفعات 127 اور 128 کے مطابق کی جائے گی۔
اہم بات یہ ہے کہ ترمیم شدہ قانون کے تحت Riot Management Unit کے افسران کو “Good Faith” میں کی گئی کارروائیوں پر قانونی تحفظ حاصل ہوگا، یعنی فرائض کی انجام دہی کے دوران کیے گئے اقدامات پر انہیں فوجداری یا دیوانی کارروائی کا سامنا نہیں کرنا پڑے گا، جب تک بدنیتی ثابت نہ ہو۔

[1/11/26, 12:46:09 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Limitation is not a mere technical plea but a substantive bar affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. Where a suit is demonstrably timebarred on the face of the record, the Court lacks the legal authority to proceed further, and all ancillary questions, including impleadment of parties or recording of evidence, become academic. A time-barred suit cannot be revived through procedural rectification, nor can the bar of limitation be diluted by directing a remand for fresh trial. Courts are not expected to prolong litigation where the outcome is legally foreclosed. On the admitted facts, therefore, the suit was ex facie barred by limitation at the time of its institution.

Presence of a witness at some place, proving / disproving of --- Call Data / Detail Record ('CDR') produced without being forensically analyzed---Effect---Trial Court declined application for production of CDR in the trial of criminal case for proving or disproving the presence of a witness at a particular place(' witness-in-question') --- Validity --- The Call Data / Detail Record ('CDR') is the record generated by telecommunication companies for every call made or received on its network including SIM/phone numbers involved, date, time and duration of the call as well as detail of telecommunication/cellular tower however pertinently , the range of cellular tower comprises (only) of sizeable area ---So if witness is owner of the SIM which is operational/functional having made / received phone call through said SIM and his forensically analyzed voice record transcript/end to end audio or video recording is also available, then availability of said SIM and its use at that particular time i.e. of making/receiving phone call in territorial range of cellular tower of said company can be assessed and ascertained, however, even then exact point/locale of availability of the SIM and person using the same in the territorial range of said cellular tower, which range usually comprises of considerable area, cannot be ascertained through CDR---Thus, in absence of forensically analysed voice record transcript/ end to end audio or video recording, mere production of CDR is of no avail/help to establish presence of any person even in territorial area/range of cellular tower and the same cannot be made basis for summoning the CDR as it would be of no help for just decision of the case --- Since in the present case forensically analyzed voice record transcript / end-to-end audio or video recording of the call made or received by the witness was not available , therefore, CDR was not conclusive piece of evidence , hence, could not be considered as necessary for just decision of the case

-Evidence, summoning/examining of---Scope---Application of the petitioner for providing him with copy of Call Data Record (CDR) comprising of 117 pages mentioned in the recovery memo was declined---Validity---In this case, CDR of accused persons was collected by Investigating Officer through recovery memo dated 30.11.2020 but such CDR and a recovery memo were not appended with the report under S.173 of Cr.P.C.---Such evidence would be used against the accused if unfavourable to him; therefore, he could not be embarrassed with surprise evidence without giving him time and opportunity to prepare his defence on this evidence---Due process as guaranteed under Article 10-A of the Constitution, 1973, required that all the processes supplemented by the legal provisions must be followed by providing a fair opportunity to the accused---In this case if CDR was unfavourable to the accused, then he could not opt to skip its production before the Court, if prosecution demanded---Article 160 of Qanun-e-Shahdat, 1984 provides that if the prosecution does not produce CDR before the Court on the notice of accused, then it cannot use such CDR as evidence during the trial except with the consent of accused or the Court---Thus, right of the accused for seeking the data of CDR should not be infringed otherwise this evidence could also not be used by the prosecution during the trial---Any material was to be provided to the accused if it was essential to adhere to fundamental right of due process and fair trial---Only exception to this material is the 'diary of proceedings in investigation' which is privileged under S.172 of Cr.P.C.

-Allegations against the accused-petitioners were that they committed murder of the brother of complainant by firing---First and foremost fact in the case was the absence of the petitioners on the day of occurrence from cement company---Report so furnished by the company was confusing, however separate sheets attached with report reflected that "SA" petitioner was employee and was in attendance in the company office from 7.58 am to 15.58 pm on fateful day, whereas "R" petitioner being employee was absent on that day---Stance of the company was that though attendance of "SA" petitioner was marked in the record yet he was not physically present in the company, but such stance was not supported by any material, documentary or forensic---Role of driving motorcycle was assigned to "R" petitioner, whereas role of firing was assigned to "SA" petitioner but from the circumstances on the record, it became evident that he was in cement company at the time of occurrence, casting a doubt on his involvement in commission of murder---Though Call Data Record was claimed to show connection of "SA" and "MR" near the place of occurrence, but this was without any voice message/transcript---Thus, it did not connect the petitioners with the commission of offence until and unless such Call Data Record was formalized in accordance with law---Once prosecution opted to make it a case of ocular account, then circumstances highlighted by counsel (s) for the petitioners including press clipping apparently made the case against the petitioners doubtful---While considering material at bail stage, Court always acts inquisitorially to search for avenues of further inquiry into the guilt of accused and thus, could consider any material, that could be transformed into admissible format at a later stage, in order to grant or decline bail to the accused---Press clippings showed that if author or reporter of press clipping appeared in the dock, it could become admissible evidence; however, cogency thereof rested upon the intrinsic value of information, its reliability and source authentication which of course would be determined after recording of all the evidence in the case---Thus, Court could consider such piece of evidence at present stage as well---At present, facts highlighted by counsel for the petitioners clearly showed that implication of present petitioners in this case rested on frail pillars---Said situation provided a premium to the petitioners to seek bail on the touchstone of further inquiry which was very much available in this case---Thus, petitioners had made out a case for further inquiry---Petitioners were behind the bars since 17.10.2024; investigation was complete and persons of the petitioners were not required for further investigation---Keeping the petitioners behind the bars for indefinite period would not serve any useful purpose to the prosecution---

Accused not nominated in original crime report---Conflicting versions of prosecution---Allegation against the petitioner/ accused was that he along with his co-accused murdered the father of the complainant by inflicting firearm injuries---Held: Petitioner is not nominated in the FIR and the same is lodged by the complainant against two accused persons by naming them, along with two unidentified individuals---However, during the course of investigation, it came to light that the occurrence in question allegedly occurred at the instigation of the nominated accused persons, who are said to have hired the services of the petitioner and another accused person to commit the offence---Notably, the petitioner is the real brother of one of the nominated accused persons---Subsequently, the petitioner was arrested in connection with the case under S.54, Cr.P.C. and sent to judicial lock up for test identification parade, which was later conducted---Pertinently, the original crime report did not attribute any specific injury inflicted upon the deceased to the unknown accused persons, however, during the said identification parade, the petitioner was surprisingly identified by the complainant and the eye-witness with the role of having fired gunshots at the deceased---Thus, the prosecution's case against the petitioner appeared to be based on two conflicting versions, one presented in the crime report and the other emerging from the investigation conducted by the investigating agency---Case of the petitioner is one of further inquiry falling within the ambit of S.497 (2), Cr.P.C.---The guilt of the petitioner and recovery of weapon of offence on his pointing out would be determined by the Trial Court after recording of evidence---Bail was granted to petitioner, in circumstances

S. 497 ---Bail---Conduct of the accused---Scope---Conduct of an accused, whether previous or subsequent to the current offence, is always relevant under Art.21 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Such conduct rendered valuable help to the Courts to ascertain the intention of the accused with which he committed the offence and to determine as to whether he shall repeat the offence or not

It was noticed that a CCTV footage was part of the record which factum had been confirmed by the Investigating Officer, who apprised that in CCTV footage three accused persons including the petitioner were visible while coming to the crime scene but only one person was carrying the firearm weapon whereas, the petitioner and his co-accused were not armed with any weapon---During the course of investigation, nothing incriminating had been recovered from possession of petitioner---Other co-accused had already been allowed post-arrest bail by the Court of first instance.
Bail allowed

CCTV footage---Contents of CD not proved---Accused were charged for committing murder of the brother of the complainant---Prosecution produced evidence before the Court in respect of identification of the accused/appellants in the form of footage contained in a CD and photographs retrieved from CCTV s installed by Punjab Safe City Authority---Complainant talked about handing over of CD and photographs by the Expert/Incharge of Safe City Project to Investigating Officer but Investigating Officer deposed about handing over of CD only---No certificate of an expert was available nor he or any other witness appeared in the dock to depose about making of video or preparation of photographs from CCTV footage---Investigating Officer conceded that he did not submit application to SP investigation seeking permission to see CCTV footage at the office of Safe City Project---Investigating Officer also did not tender in evidence the copy of application made by him before said Incharge nor he recorded his statement---Claimed by Investigating Officer that though he examined the private CCTV as well which were installed at the place of occurrence, yet did not record the statement of any person in that respect nor took into possession the DVR etc.---Thus, it remained a missing fact that who prepared the CD and photographs---Photographs could be used as evidence yet it was essential to prove its source---No certificate of expert was tendered in evidence nor an expert appeared in the witness box to verify the sanctity/genuineness of the video---It was incumbent to get a photogrammetry test of accused/appellants from Forensic Science Agency in order to provide evidence that they were the person visible in video retrieved from CCTV footage---Moreover, neither the Court had examined such CD while playing it in the Court nor it was shown to any witness during his statement who could have identified the assailants in the video---Thus, Trial Court had not met the requirement of Arts. 71 & 139 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, because CCTV footage could be used either as the documentary evidence or the real evidence---When it was being used as documentary evidence it must be shown to the witness while recording his statement and when it was used as real evidence then Court must inspect it with some observations and mere marking it as "P" did not fulfill the requirement---Thus, prosecution had failed to prove the contents of CD in accordance with the principles of evidence
[1/11/26, 12:46:15 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2024 YLR 762
petitioner was declared innocent on the basis of visuals of incident captured in CCTV camera installed adjacent to the crime scene---Said visuals were also forwarded to Forensic Science Agency and it was reported that the clips were free from editing and tampering---Needless to mention here that such video clips had legal admissibility in consonance with Arts. 46-A & 164 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, thus could be taken into consideration even at bail stage---According to the police opinion based on these visuals, in fact the complainant-side mounted an aggression to take the life of petitioner who got married earlier in the day but unfortunately two brothers became victims of that attack, though none out of them had any concern with the ongoing enmity of the two families-
[1/11/26, 12:46:16 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2024  PCrLJ  1764
CCTV footage---Forensic expert not summoned as a witness---Effect---Accused was charged for committing murder of the father of complainant---Record showed that the actual homicide incident remained un-witnessed and till the registration of FIR, the identity of the culprit was unknown and for that reason no one was nominated therein even as a suspect---According to the prosecution case, the police acquired knowledge about the culprit from the visuals captured in the CCTV camera installed at the outer gate of the adjacent house belonging to neighborer of deceased---DVR of the CCTV camera was taken into possession by Investigating Officer through recovery memo---However, it was noticed that though the DVR was statedly taken from the possession of neighborer of deceased but he was not the witness of its recovery memo and even otherwise the DVR was not exhibited in his statement---Such omission gave rise to the query that how it could be ascertained that the DVR exhibited in the statement of Investigating Officer was the same which was installed in the house of neighborer of deceased---From the said visuals complainant identified accused as the person who had been rendered services as servant with the deceased---Such visuals were forwarded to Forensic Science Agency along with accused who after in-depth analysis gave his opinion through his report that forensic facial comparison analysis of accused with the person seen in videos of incident was inconclusive due to minimal facial feature information of suspect---Forensic Science Agency Report, admittedly, did not support the case of prosecution but still it was tendered in evidence---Report through necessary implication of S.9(3) of the Forensic Science Agency Act, 2007, was per se admissible but since it was not in favour of prosecution thus the expert could still be summoned as Court Witness to remove ambiguity arising out of it---Strangely, no effort whatsoever was made by the prosecution to do the needful of summoning the expert from the Forensic Science Agency as witness in the case---Another remedy was available to the prosecution under S.12 of the Forensic Science Agency Act, 2007, but no step even in that regard was taken---In the site plan, neither the house of neighbour of deceased was shown nor the point, where the CCTV camera was installed, was highlighted---For satisfying the legality of the impugned judgment, the DVR was requisitioned and despite best efforts it could not be de-codified to examine the visuals, thus, there was no option but to discard it in accordance with the Forensic Science Agency Report
[1/11/26, 12:46:17 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2023 YLR 1691

CCTV footage, evidence not sent to Forensic Laboratory--- Effect--- Accused was charged that he along with his co-accused committed murder of the son of complainant by firing due to non-payment of Bhatta and also made indiscriminate firing, causing damage to the mirrors, screens etc. of a vehicle, which created a sense of terror and panic in the area---In the present case, another piece of evidence which could have been beneficial to the prosecution's case, comprising of CCTV footage i.e. CD and USB, obtained from the Manager of the Bank, seized by the Investigating Officer through recovery memo. and attested by witnesses, had already been discarded by the Trial Court being inconsequential as the Investigating Officer did not send the said recovered items to the Forensic Science Agency for getting expert opinion about their authenticity---Circumstances established that the prosecution had badly failed to prove its case against the accused
[1/11/26, 12:46:17 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2023 YLR NOTE 82
To substantiate that aspect of the case the prosecution produced CCTV footage taken from the camera of a Petrol Pump---However, admittedly the owner of said Petrol Pump or any other person who produced CCTV footage to the Investigating Officer was not joined into investigation nor produced during the course of trial to prove that aspect---Furthermore, during the course of trial when statements of the complainant and witnesses were recorded, footage was not played in the court room in order to get the accused identified by those witnesses--- Although CCTV footage was sent for forensic analysis for identification of the accused but according to report of Forensic Science Agency, the forensic facial comparison of the pictures of deceased and accused persons with footage in USB was inconclusive due to minimal facial feature information of the persons---In such background, CCTV footage being inconclusive was of no avail to the prosecution case
[1/11/26, 12:46:18 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2023 PCrLJ NOTE 8

Prosecution witness in whose shop CCTV camera was installed categorically stated during his cross-examination that he did not join the investigation in police station---On the other hand, Investigating Officer of the case had stated that he along with other Police Officials and the complainant reached at the shop of said witness and watched the recording of CCTV cameras which were installed at the said shop---Investigating Officer further stated that CD recording of CCTV cameras was handed over to him by said witness and as such, there were glaring contradictions in the prosecution case regarding the recovery and safe custody of CD of CCTV cameras---According to the evidence of Investigating Officer, the complainant had seen the recording of CCTV cameras of the shop of said witness and with the help of said recording, the complainant identified the accused in the company of his minor daughter on the relevant date and time but complainant did not utter a single word in his statement recorded by the Trial Court that he had seen the recording of CCTV cameras of the shop of said witness through which he identified the accused in the company of his daughter on the relevant date and time---Complainant did not state that he ever visited the shop of said witness or recording of CCTV cameras of said shop was seen by him and the same was taken into possession by Investigating Officer in his presence---

Deaf and dumb accused able to understand court proceedings---Scope---Accused were charged for committing murder of the daughter of complainant by firing---In the present case, Trial Court thought that the principal accused, though not insane, could not be made to understand the proceedings---Validity---Before referring to the reference, the Trial Court did not go through the record, as an enquiry was conducted on the application of principal accused for declaring him a lunatic under Ss. 465 & 466, Cr.P.C---Medical board unanimously opined that there was no active psychiatric morbidity at present and the Trial Court dismissed the application for declaring the accused a lunatic, and after that charge was framed against him---Trial Court observed that the said accused could not speak or listen---However, the Court did not note whether the accused could understand the gestures made to him---It was notable that a joint trial was conducted against the accused and his brother/co-accused---Said accused persons were represented and defended adequately by the advocate of their choice---Proper cross-examination of the witnesses was also carried out on behalf of defence---In such situation, the trial was conducted fairly and a sufficient opportunity to present the case was also afforded to the accused persons, including the principal accused---Trial Court was obliged to ascertain whether the accused could be made to understand the proceedings with the help of his relatives or friends or through technical assistance---If the Trial Court doubted the accused's physical and mental capacities, the procedure prescribed under S. 341, Cr.P.C., should be followed---If the trial proceeds in the ordinary way, the Court can pass a sentence if the accused is found guilty and convicted---However, if it is found that the accused cannot understand the proceedings and trial resulted in conviction, the Trial Court is required to forward the proceedings to the High Court, if the evidence warranted so, but it cannot pass a sentence against him---Trial Court must forward the proceedings to the High Court to pass such orders as the High Court think fit---Unless the accused is insane, the Trial Court can proceed with the trial even though the accused cannot understand the proceedings---Given the circumstances, the Trial Court submitted a reference without complying with the spirit provided under S. 341, Cr.P.C.---Therefore, the matter was remanded to the trial Court to proceed as per the law
[1/11/26, 12:46:19 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: PLD 2025 Lahore 641
Mentally impaired victim---Competency to testify---Alternative means to record testimony---Accused were charged for committing rape with the mentally impaired daughter of the complainant after her abduction---During the trial, Female Medical Officer testified that victim was deaf and dump and unable to speak; that she was mentally retarded and unable to tell about previous such incidents or give relevant gynecological history---Prosecution submitted an application before the Trial Court to determine whether victim was competent to testify---Consequently, the Court summoned victim, conducted a voir dire test and found her unable to testify---However, Trial Court failed to explore whether victim's testimony could have been recorded through alternative means, which declared her incompetent to testify under Arts. 3 & 17 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, without seeking the opinion of a qualified psychiatric or psychological expert---Absence of expert evaluation constituted a serious procedural lapse, as mental incapacity did not automatically preclude a witness from providing testimony---Law did not rigidly assume that persons with disabilities were wholly incapable of expressing themselves---In criminal cases involving victims with cognitive or intellectual disabilities, their testimony should not be rejected outright due to their condition---Instead, appropriate procedural accommodations must be made to facilitate their meaningful participation in the legal process---Trial Court should have summoned an expert to assess whether victim communicated her experiences through alternative means before declaring her incompetent to testify---Thus, matter was remanded to the Trial Court with the direction to summon a forensic psychologist or psychiatrist to assess victim's capacity to communicate and the feasibility of recording her testimony through alternative means---Appeal was disposed of in the above terms.

اس صورت میں مقتولہ کے ہاتھوں کا gunshot residue (GSR) ٹیسٹ کرایا جانا ضروری تھا

VVVVI. MUDT READ JUDGEMENT. 

Woman can commit suicide with gunshot.

A stellate (star-shaped) gunshot wound on the forehead can be either suicidal, as the shape is often caused by gases expanding from the firearm's muzzle, which is common in contact wounds, a method used in suicides. The key factors to determine if it was a suicide or not, solely the wound's appearance is not sufficient but also its location, such as the forehead, which is a common suicide site, along with the presence of a weapon, ballistic evidence, and the victim's own history or circumstances. As per literature available on the subject, a stellate wound often suggests that the firearm was in direct contact or very (naeem)close proximity to the skin when fired. The gases produced by the firing weapon escape through the skin, creating a star-like pattern around the entry point. While not definitive, the forehead is a common site for suicidal gunshot wounds, which is a factor to consider in the overall assessment. This pattern is generally not seen with other types of gunshot wounds, such as distant or accidental ones. Forensic analysis of the wound can help determine the distance between the muzzle and the skin. The finding of a firearm near the victim is a crucial piece of evidence. A close examination of the skin may reveal an imprint of the firearm's muzzle. The trajectory of the bullet can also help indicate whether the wound was self-inflicted or inflicted by another person. The circumstances and history of the individual are also critical in assessing the possibility of suicide. In short, a stellate wound on the forehead is significant but requires a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine if it was a suicide. 


  In this case when the accused/appellant dared to inform the doctor as well as the investigator, then both were obliged to examine the dead body thoroughly and first duty was to examine the hands of deceased lady so as to find (naeem)out any gunshot residue (GSR) in the form of soot over it. Not examining the hands by Doctor , investigator and the doctor who later conducted postmortem examination is a criminal negligence and thereby truth was altared at the cost of slackness or deliberate askance. It was the duty to be discharged even in terms if such GSR was not on the hands of deceased, it could then help to rule out the possibility of suicide to some extent. Place of occurrence was also required to be examined keenly, so as to track any other evidence available at the site, but prosecution agency was not serious to dig out such fact. Thus, it remained an unanswered theory whether, it was a suicide or homicide which creates a doubt in prosecution story and benefit of doubt always leans in favour of accused. 


Another aspect of the case was argued by the prosecution in favour of murder theory that doctor has not observed any exit wound on the body of the deceased which shows that it was not a wound with dominant hand by the deceased, but with a fire from a little distance made by the accused/appellant. Firstly, had it been a fire from a little distance it would not have been with description of satellite wound and if such injury had been caused by the accused/appellant surely with(naeem) tight hand firmly then there was every possibility that bullet would have exited from the back of skull, but when fire is made with friendly hand, its loose control gets penetration of bullet obliquely which causes the bullet to spin in cranial cavity due to ricochet effect and in such situation it will not be exited from the skull.

---Rejection of plaint owing to decision in the earlier suit on the basis of compromise---Res judicata, principle of---Scope---Application for rejection of plaint on the basis of res judicata filed by the petitioners along with their written statement in the latter suit for declaration, possession and partition instituted by the respondents was accepted by the Trial Court, however, the appellate court reversed the finding of Trial Court for the reason that the decision in the earlier suit was not conclusive having been taken on a compromise and not on merits---Validity---Principle of res judicata is based on the consideration that the same cause should not be tried for the second time between the same parties and there must be an end to the litigation between the parties---Mere observation on a question of fact without proper adjudication in absence of evidence, would not operate as res judicata--- Besides, other grounds, the condition of a final decision on the merits of a dispute between the parties is of paramount importance---When litigation ended on the basis of a statement of parties, without conclusive determination of the disputed question of fact on merits between the parties, the same could at best be termed a decision on the basis of a compromise/settlement and under such circumstances the principle of res judicata would not attract to subsequent litigation---Doctrine of res judicata could only be applied when the previous lis/application or proceeding had directly or substantially decided the controversy between the parties on merits after recording their evidence---Except one of the respondents, none of the parties in the case remained parties in the earlier lis, thus, provision of O. XI, Rr. 2 & 3, C.P.C. was not attracted to that proceedings.

Family Courts Rules, 1965, R.6---Suit for recovery of dower, maintenance allowance, dowry articles, and gold ornaments was instituted by wife/respondent after being divorced by the husband/petitioner---During pendency of suit both the parties file miscellaneous applications---Application for summoning Nikah Khawan filed by the respondent was accepted, whereas applications filed by the petitioner for return of pictures, correction in the examination-in-chief of PW.1 and cross-examination of PW.2 and return of plaint for want of jurisdiction were dismissed---Validity---Marriage was solemnized at Abbotabad and after its dissolution respondent was living with her parents at Abbotabad---Rule 6 of the Family Courts Rules, 1965, is limited to suits for dissolution of marriage or dower and enables the estranged wife to bring a family suit in a court within the local limits of which she ordinarily resides, thus, the finding of the family court as to territorial jurisdiction was not erroneous or without lawful authority---No prohibition exists in the Family Courts Act, 1964 for calling or production of witnesses even if his name is not mentioned in the list of witnesses---Respondent had not committed a legal error by calling Nikah Khawan as a witness for examination in the Family Court whose name was already available in the list of witnesses, thus, contention of the petitioner was based on misconception---Statements of PW.1 in examination-in-chief and PW.2 in cross-examination were recorded in open court in presence of parties and their counsel, however, the application for correction therein was filed by the petitioner after signing the statements by the Presiding Officer, thus, the correction was rightly disallowed---Pictures had become part and parcel of judicial record, thus, application for return of the same was rightly declined---Application of the petitioner qua medical examination of the respondent was also held to be unwarranted for the reason that after Rukhsati, the respondent remained with the petitioner for sufficient time and performed her marital obligations and the matrimonial ties between the parties had already been broken after consummation--

-Suit for recovery of damages---Audio and video evidence---Forensic examination---Scope---Application of the petitioner, filed after closure of evidence, for sending the video for forensic report/expert opinion regarding its originality was dismissed by the Trial Court---Validity---By now, it is possible with the advancement of science and technology to get a forensic examination, audit or test conducted through an appropriate laboratory, so as to get it ascertained as to whether a video or tape is genuine or not and such examination, audit or test can also reasonably establish, if such video has been edited, doctored or tampered with or not---Any party could make a request for forensic examination of an audio tape or video through an appropriate laboratory, so as to get it ascertained as to whether the audio tape or video is genuine or not through moving a proper application to the concerned court---Trial Court had totally overlooked the fact that the petitioner was seeking expert opinion of the video regarding its originality or otherwise and production of additional evidence in light thereof---Trial Court also failed to appreciate that by virtue of O. XVIII, R. 17, C.P.C., the additional evidence could be allowed at any stage---Even if one or the other party had failed to produce all the material documents and/or failed to request for proper examination of the disputed documents/ signatures/video, the court had ample power to do the needful so as to advance justice rather than injustice---Trial was at the verge of conclusion, but in order to ascertain as to whether the video in question was genuine or not, there was no harm, even at such stage, to accept the request of the petitioner qua sending the video for forensic report regarding its originality and genuineness in the larger interest of the justice---Civil revision was allowed, in circumstances, while accepting the application of the petitioner for sending video for forensic report/expert opinion

Section 540-A, Cr.P.C., mandated and allowed a Court to dispense with personal attendance of an accused if he was represented by a pleader and there were multiple accused, or if the accused was incapable of appearing before Court---In view of said provisions of law, Trial Court was justified to make an order in respect of acquittal of said accused/respondent in absentia, when otherwise, on the available record, no prima facie case was made-out against him, even if he would have been forced to face a full-fledged trial before Trial Court---More particularly, when on the same set of evidence, other nominated accused/respondents had earned a honourable acquittal during trial proceedings.

-Mode of execution of money decree---Payment in instalments in cash---Dilatory tactics of petitioner/judgment-debtor in executing a long-standing money decree in a family dispute---Judgment-debtor deposited cross-cheque instead of payment in cash owing to his apprehension of misuse of amount for personal benefit of attorney of decree-holder, who objected to such mode of payment---Executing court ordered payment in cash and upon appeal by the judgment-debtor Appellate Court concurred with the order of executing court---Validity---Judgment-debtor had no right to object to the alleged conduct of the attorney of decree-holder as he was delaying the execution of the decree on flimsy and irrational grounds, which tantamount to depriving the decree-holder of the benefits of the same by all means, which was certainly neither permissible nor desirable under the law---Increasing trend of false and frivolous litigation was held to be an abuse of the court process and an unnecessary burden on the judicial system, as easy access to justice does not bestow a right on a litigant to settle his affairs in a manner as he desires, which is certainly against the spirit of law and not permissible to be misused as a license to file misconceived or frivolous petitions

-Victim mentioned in the FIR that the assailants were armed with "Aslaha Atisheen", without specifying the name of the firearms, let alone their bores, even though the firing was made at the complainant party from a short distance of about 20 paces, that too, in a broad daylight---Though, the eye-witness endorsed the report and conceded in his cross-examination that he could differentiate between pistols and guns, however, he too failed to specify the names of the weapons used in perpetrating the offence---Omission, in the attending circumstances, to explicitly mention the specific names of the weapons as pistols, rather than the vague term "Aslaha Atisheen" casted doubt on the victim's ability to speak and the eye-witness's presence at the crime scene---Said discrepancy was detrimental to the prosecution case
[1/11/26, 12:46:27 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Appreciation of evidence---Timelines mentioned in FIR, the injury sheet and inquest report not coinciding---Report lodged after preliminary investigation---Accused were charged for committing murder of the complainant, then injured, and his companion by firing---Claim of the prosecution was that the victim/complainant was sent to the Medical Officer after his injury sheet was prepared, followed by taking down his report---As per the FIR, the report was made at 05:45 pm---According to the scribe, it took some twenty minutes to prepare the injury sheet and take down the report, and it was only after carrying out that process, that the victim was sent to the Medical Officer for medical treatment---If stance of the prosecution was accepted as correct, then the time of examination of the victim must be at least after 05:45 pm---However, the Medico-Legal Certificate revealed that the victim was brought before the Medical Officer and examined at 05:20 p.m., a time which was even prior to the time of the report---Moreover, the examination of the victim before taking down his report suggested that the report was lodged after preliminary investigation, a procedural misstep that had consistently been deemed detrimental to the prosecution case

Entries in Revenue record---Wajib-ul-Arz---Correction sought---Limitation---Claim of the plaintiffs (two in number) was concurrently dismissed --- Petitioners through the present suit had challenged the entries of Wajib-ul-Arz for the year 1965/1966 by filing a suit for declaration in the year 2000 which made the suit of the plaintiffs/petitioners hopelessly time barred--- Petitioners failed to point out any illegality or irregularity in the impugned findings of the Courts below warranting interference of the High Court in limited revisional jurisdiction ---

Wajib-ul-Arz---Correction sought---Scope---Claim of the plaintiffs (two in number) was concurrently dismissed --- Validity --- Wajib-ul-Arz carries presumption of truth because Wajib-ul-Arz is part of the Record of Rights, and strong, unimpeachable evidence is required to counter and rebut such entries---Grazing rights of the inhabitants of the locality were duly embodied in the Wajib-ul-Arz and no evidence had been provided from either side suggesting any changes in the consistent entries of Wajib-ul-Arz--- Petitioners / plaintiffs failed to point out any illegality or irregularity in the impugned findings of the Courts below warranting interference of the High Court in limited revisional jurisdiction
[1/11/26, 12:46:29 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2025 YLR 632

-Accused were charged for committing murder of three brothers of the complainant by firing---Record showed that the medical evidence was in conflict with the ocular account---Had the deceased received firearm injuries in the main gate of the house, the deceased would have received the maximum number of injuries on their chest with its' exit on their back, but the medical evidence and the post mortem report told another story---When the firing was made soon after the gate was opened, then question was how the deceased received maximum number of injuries on their back and why the deceased did not receive injuries on the left, as left side of the bodies of the deceased exposed to the set of accused who were present to the west of the house---Time between injury and death was another circumstance which did not support the eye-witness account, as according to the complainant the deceased breathed their last when they reached near the hospital, whereas the doctor confirmed the death as immediate---Medical evidence was confirmatory in nature and in presence of trustworthy and confidence inspiring eye-witness account, the same played little role, but once the witnesses failed to convince their presence on the spot and once the credibility of the witnesses was shattered, then in such eventuality the conflict between the two would be a factor to be taken into consideration in favor of the accused and the present case was no exception---
[1/11/26, 12:46:29 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Concealment of facts---Accused were charged for committing murder of the complainant then injured and his companion by firing---Record showed that on the same date, at 04:30 pm, the accused (since dead) had also lodged a report regarding the injuries he allegedly sustained in the incident---Said report was initially reduced into the shape of Daily Diary, which subsequently led to the registration of FIR, under Ss.324/34, P.P.C, at the same police station---Medico-Legal Certificate of injured accused revealed that the nature of his injuries was firearm---Eye-witness also admitted that the said accused was injured and that it was he who charged the complainant party for the injuries he sustained in the incident---Taking into consideration the contents of the FIR of injured accused, his Medico-Legal Certificate, and the admission of the eye-witness, even for a limited purpose, in juxtaposition with the said factual background of the case, it could be safely concluded that the complainant party of the case concealed the real facts, and that, in fact, it was a case of open gunfight between the parties---Notably, the injured accused also concealed in his report the fatal wounds sustained by complainant, then injured, and deceased---Therefore, it had been established that both the parties attributed the role of assault to the adversarial party while concealing the real facts and attempting to cover up their own role in causing injuries to members of the rival party---Moreover, the case indeed was of cross version---However, the question fundamental to the fate of the case as to which party was the aggressor and which was aggressed upon remained unanswered, as the factum of sustaining the firearm injuries by both sides was concealed---Effect of concealing the real facts pertaining to the injuries sustained by the adversarial party had, on numerous occasions, been considered in favour of the accused--
2025 YLR 1284
[1/11/26, 12:46:30 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: -Presence of the eye-witness at the time and place of occurrence not proved---Accused were charged for committing murder of the complainant then injured and his companion by firing---Eye-witness stated that he had no relationship with either of the deceased, as they were merely his neighbours---If that was the case, the question remained as to why the culprits spared the eye-witness and killed both the deceased, a question that the prosecution had failed to answer convincingly---Notably, the eye-witness was all alone and at the mercy of three armed assailants, yet he did not receive a single injury despite being simultaneously fired at by three assailants from a short distance of about 28 paces---Eye-witness stated that he remained standing in his place and did not seek shelter---Eye-witness's escape unhurt, in the attending circumstances, raised reasonable doubts qua his presence at the spot, especially when three shots were fired at him from a 12mm bore pistol---Eye-witness stated that while deceased was being taken to the hospital, blood was oozing from his wounds, adding that his clothes were also smeared with that blood---Yet, neither did the witness take pain to hand over those clothes to the Investigating Officer, nor did the Investigating Officer brought such fact on the record, let alone taking into possession those clothes and dispatching them to the Forensic Science Laboratory for chemical analysis---Eye-witness failed to establish his presence at the spot at the fateful time---Therefore, when the eye-witness failed to establish his presence at the fateful time, and when the collected evidence was also not of the standard that could reasonably link the appellant to the commission of the offence, the benefit accrued would go in favour of the appellant---
2025 YLR 1284
[1/11/26, 12:46:30 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: -Statement of complainant and site plan---Confliction---Accused were charged for committing murder of two persons of the complainant party and also causing firearm injuries to three persons---Site plan was prepared on the pointation of a witness but astonishingly the said witness was not produced, so the evidentiary value of that witness had lost its utility---Admittedly, the complainant in his report charged the accused for indiscriminate firing and no specific role was given---In the site plan every accused was charged for a specific injury caused and every accused was shown duly armed---So when the site plan, that too, verified from the complainant was juxtaposed with the report of the complainant, no ambiguity was left that they were in conflict---Once the complainant verified the prepared site plan, he admitted the same as correct, so the conflict between the site plan and the report questioned the integrity and reliability of such witness--

[1/11/26, 12:46:31 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: -Counter version---Real facts of occurrence suppressed---Accused were charged for committing murder of two persons of the complainant party and also causing firearm injuries to three persons---Record showed that one of the accused persons was injured then died---Moot question for determination was that how the deceased received the firearm injury and at whose hands---Counter version in the shape of Daily Diaryhad removed the ambiguity, as it was the deceased then injured who reported the matter and for the injury caused to him, two accused i.e., the deceased and the acquitted accused were charged---Site plan depicted that the deceased accused was present at point No. 11 and from his place, the Investigating Officer also collected blood stained earth---As accused received a firearm injury in the same episode, so he was hurriedly shifted to the hospital where he reported the matter---Said accused/ deceased was present on the spot at the stated time and received a firearm injury in the same transaction---In the site plan, the injury caused to the deceased was attributed to the deceased accused, likewise the injuries to deceased were attributed to the absconding co-accused, so the approach of the Trial Court qua involvement of the appellants was based on misreading of evidence---Report of the deceased/accused had clarified the circumstances and it told that both the parties concealed material facts---Court was confident in holding that the real facts had been suppressed---When the place of occurrence was the same, when people died from both the sides and when the motive was common to the parties, then the counter version could be and should have been taken into consideration---Moreover, it was the uncertainty of events which led to the tragic incident and it was the concealment of facts which overshadowed the prosecution case, so if the accused could earn benefit of the same in Daily Diary, then the same benefit should have been extended to the appellants charged in the instant case---

[1/11/26, 12:46:32 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Injured not produced for evidence---Accused were charged for committing murder of two persons of the complainant party and also causing firearm injuries to three persons---Prosecution got examined only two witnesses out of the injured, but interestingly the Trial Court convicted and sentenced the appellants for the injuries caused to all the injured whether examined or not examined---Trial Court committed an illegality while convicting the appellants for the injuries caused to the injured who did not appear before the Trial Court and that by doing so, the appellants had not been treated in accordance with law---As the injuries of the injured were attributed to specific accused, so under those circumstances the Trial Court should have dealt with the matter in accordance with the allegations levelled and in accordance with the role played by each accused---Once an injured witness did not appear before the Trial Court in support of his claim, then no conviction could be awarded for the injury caused to him

2025 YLR 1702
[1/11/26, 12:46:33 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Defective investigation---DNA test not conducted---Accused were charged for committing murder of the deceased by firing and also causing firearm injuries to the complainant---Statement of the eye-witness was shown recorded under S.161, Cr.P.C where she narrated the incident in a different manner by disclosing that the accused tried to kidnap/take away the deceased but the deceased was not willing, so the deceased grappled with the accused and the accused fired at the deceased---If such statement was taken into consideration, then the Court was to see that why the human hair found in possession of the deceased, collected by the Medical Officer, handed over to the Investigating Officer, was not sent for DNA, knowing the fact that it was the best evidence, in possession of the prosecution for establishing the identity of the accused---Reluctance on the part of the Investigating Officer to transmit the same to the laboratory for DNA was a factor which the Court could not ignore and the Investigating Officer did not send the same apprehending that the same would exclude the involvement of the appellant and that his miseries, to investigate further, would increase---As admittedly, human hair was found in possession of the deceased, the same was collected by the Medical Officer and received by the Investigating Officer, so under all circumstances, it was essential for the Investigation Officer to have asked for conducting of DNA, but knowing the fact that the same would lead to the actual culprit, the evidence was disrespected and dishonored---

[1/11/26, 12:46:33 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Site plan, preparation of---Doubts and inconsistencies---Accused were charged for committing murder of the deceased by firing and also causing firearm injuries to the complainant---Complainant claimed to have pointed out the spot to the Investigating Officer, on the next day of the incident, whereas the Investigating Officer claimed to have prepared the site plan on the pointation of the female eye-witness---As the eye-witness was not produced, so that aspect of the case could not be appreciated while referring to her statement---Site plan was shown prepared on the pointation of the eye-witness, but the complainant denied the same---Marginal witness disclosed that he along with the Investigating Officer visited the spot on the day of occurrence at 08:30 PM---Site plan was prepared on the pointation of the complainant and the Investigating Officer spent 45 minutes on the spot---Investigating Officer stated that the site plan was prepared on the pointation of the eye-witness---Investigating Officer further explained that he visited the spot on 19.02.2020, and prepared the site plan on the pointation of the eye-witness---Self-stated that as it was 12 O'clock, so some proceedings were carried out on 19.02.2020 whereas the remaining on 20.02.2020 as the day changed, so the date---When the statement of Investigating Officer was read in juxtaposition with that of the marginal witness, both were in conflict and even the complainant denied their statements qua pointation by the eye-witness---Right from the beginning till the end, the prosecution witnesses made dishonest improvements, trying to make the case a success, but instead they damaged the case beyond repair---Neither the complainant could tell that who prepared the site plan, and on whose pointation nor the Investigating Officer---Such inconsistency between these witnesses showered mist over the place of occurrence and even the witnesses could not confirm the venue, where the unfortunate incident occurred--
2025 YLR 1752
[1/11/26, 12:46:34 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Medical evidence in conflict with the ocular account---Scope---Accused were charged for committing murder of the deceased by firing and also causing fire arm injuries to the complainant---As the deceased received multiple firearm injuries, so it excluded the possibility that she was fired at in the stated manner---Complainant in his Court statement made dishonest improvements regarding the manner in which the deceased was fired at and regarding the accused who fired at the deceased---If there was a struggling between the assailant and the deceased, then the medical evidence would have supported the same, but neither marks of violence were found on the dead body of the deceased nor any entry was caused from a close range---As on one hand the eye-witness failed to convince that the incident occurred in the stated manner, whereas on the other, the medical evidence did not support the case of the prosecution, so the conflict between the two had damaged the case of the prosecution beyond repair-

2025 YLR 1752
[1/11/26, 12:46:35 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Dishonest improvements made by complainant in his statement---Accused were charged for committing murder of the deceased by firing and also causing firearm injuries to the complainant---Complainant while reporting the matter charged the accused for firing at them, but in his Court statement, he made improvements and explained the circumstances in a different manner---Report told that on reaching to the spot, the accused stopped the motorcar, they de-boarded and were fired at, but in his examination-in-chief he explained that he was first targeted thereafter the deceased was fired at---Said witness maintained silence in respect of the firing over the female eye-witness, so the same was in conflict with what was reported---Improvement was not only conscious, but dishonest as well, that too, with the only attempt to establish presence of injured on the spot---In his Court statement, the complainant disclosed that after receiving firearm injury, he with help of the eye-witness, shifted the deceased then injured to the motorcar and thereafter, he drove the motorcar towards the hospital where he reported the matter, but the report lacked the explanation---Said facts were introduced after the lapse of time, that too, when the trial commenced---Injured received a firearm injury on his chest, whether after receiving such an injury, the complainant was able to drive and was capable to shift the deceased from spot to the motorcar---Once injured confirmed that due to severe injury, he failed to notice that what injuries were caused to the deceased, then with the same injury, how did he shift the deceased to the motorcar and how he managed to drive to the hospital and reported the incident---No denial to that fact that the complainant claimed to have received a firearm injury in the same episode, but at the same time, the improvements he made had questioned his truthfulness, so the stamp of injury on his body would hardly be a circumstance to be pressed into service for holding the appellant responsible for the tragic murder of the deceased---Stamp of injuries alone could tell the presence of a witness, but it by itself was not sufficient for convincing that what the witness told was the whole truth--

[1/11/26, 12:46:35 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: Mitigating circumstances---Sentence, quantum of---Accused was charged for committing murder of his wife/sister of the complainant---It was reflected from the evidence that the appellant was a poor labourer, having 10 children and perhaps no house of his own---In the absence of any specific reason, cruel conduct of appellant might be a matter of personal deposition either in addition to, or over and above his economic hardship---In this age of distressing inflation when even the middle class of our society is fighting hard to earn two-time meals for their children, let alone other necessities such as health and education the head of a large family like the present one remained always in the grip of mental stress to make ends meet---Day of the unfortunate occurrence was the second day of the family having shifted to their one-room house where the house-hold articles were lying scattered---Such a situation was a potential source of disturbance and mental stress---Late arrival of son of appellant and deceased at home on the day of occurrence that led to the happening of the unfortunate occurrence, definitely demonstrated a sudden heat of passion rather than a pre-meditated design of appellant to kill his wife---In such situations, imprisonment for life might serve the ends of justice---Circumstances established that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellant, however, due to extraneous circumstances, the death sentence was altered to sentence for life imprisonment---Appeal was dismissed with said modification in sentence

2025 YLR 2065
[1/11/26, 12:46:37 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: True that the deceased received an entry on right of his neck with its exit to the left but equally true that it alone could not determine the presence of the appellant and the presence of the deceased at the stated time---An attempt was made to convince that in case the deceased was proceeding towards the appellant, then he would have received an injury from his left with its exit on his right, but the defence ignored that the deceased received three firearm injuries and apart from the injury on the neck, he received another injury on his shoulder which travelled from left to right---As the defence could not convince that what injury was received by the deceased at the earliest and which of the injury thereafter, so that Court could presume that after receiving the injury on his shoulder, the deceased changed his direction and it was in that eventuality that he received an injury on the right of his neck with its exit on the left---Fact cannot be ignored that man is not a statue, rather every individual reacts differently in particular circumstance of each particular case---Possibility could not be excluded that after receiving firearm injury on his shoulder, the deceased wanted to rescue himself and, while struggling so, he received an injury on his neck---Medical evidence fully supported the ocular account---Medical evidence was confirmative in nature and in absence of trustworthy eye-witnesses account, the same could hardly be a circumstance for holding the accused responsible---However, as in this particular case, the witnesses remained consistent, so the medical evidence could be taken into consideration---Circumstances

(Cross-Examination) کی 3 مخصوص ٹرکس
صفی الدین اعوان ایڈوکیٹ 
وکیل جرح کے دوران گواہوں سے اپنی مرضی کی بات نکلوانے کے لیے کچھ خاص تکنیک استعمال کرتے ہیں۔ ذیل میں ایسی 3 طاقتور ٹرکس کی وضاحت دی گئی ہے:
1. واضح "ہاں" والی تکنیک (The Obvious "Yes" Technique)
اس تکنیک میں آپ گواہ سے ایسے عمومی سوالات پوچھتے ہیں جن کا جواب لازمی طور پر "ہاں" ہوتا ہے۔ جب وہ مسلسل تین چار بار "ہاں" کہہ دیتا ہے، تو ایک نفسیاتی بہاؤ بن جاتا ہے، جس کے بعد آپ اپنا اصل سوال پیش کرتے ہیں۔
 *مثال: کار حادثے کے کیس میں اگر گواہ ایک ہاتھ سے گاڑی چلا رہا تھا، تو وکیل براہ راست یہ نہیں پوچھے گا کہ "کیا دو ہاتھوں سے گاڑی چلانا بہتر نہیں تھا؟"
  اس کے بجائے وہ مرحلہ وار پوچھے گا:
    کیا آپ مانتے ہیں کہ گاڑی احتیاط سے چلانی چاہیے؟ (جواب: جی ہاں)
    کیا آپ مانتے ہیں کہ ڈرائیور کو اردگرد کے ماحول سے باخبر رہنا چاہیے؟ (جواب: جی ہاں)
    کیا آپ مانتے ہیں کہ اپنی اور دوسروں کی حفاظت کے لیے ہر ممکن کوشش کرنی چاہیے؟ (جواب: جی ہاں)
    اصل سوال: تو کیا آپ اتفاق نہیں کریں گے کہ حادثے کے وقت ایک کے بجائے دو ہاتھوں سے اسٹیئرنگ پکڑنا زیادہ محفوظ ہوتا؟
2. ناگوار خاموشی کی تکنیک (The Uncomfortable Silence Technique)
انسان فطرتی طور پر خاموشی کو ناپسند کرتا ہے اور اسے کسی نہ کسی بات سے پر کرنے کی کوشش کرتا ہے۔ وکیل گواہ سے سوال پوچھتا ہے، گواہ مختصر جواب دیتا ہے، لیکن وکیل فوراً اگلا سوال پوچھنے کے بجائے خاموش ہو کر گواہ کی طرف دیکھتا رہتا ہے جیسے وہ مزید کچھ سننے کا منتظر ہو۔
  مثال: وکیل پوچھتا ہے: "آپ حادثے کے وقت ایک ہاتھ سے گاڑی کیوں چلا رہے تھے؟"
 گواہ: "مجھے ٹھیک سے یاد نہیں۔"
  خاموشی: وکیل کچھ نہیں بولتا اور صرف دیکھتا رہتا ہے۔
  گواہ (خاموشی توڑنے کے لیے): "ویسے... میری دائیں بازو میں تھوڑی تکلیف تھی، شاید اس لیے۔"
3. تشبیہ یا اینالوجی کی تکنیک (The Analogy Technique)
اس میں آپ گواہ کو ایک ایسی صورتحال (Context) میں کسی بات پر قائل کرتے ہیں جو آپ کے کیس سے ملتی جلتی ہو لیکن اس کا براہ راست کیس سے تعلق نہ ہو، اور پھر اسے کیس کی طرف موڑ دیتے ہیں۔
 مثال: وکیل گواہ سے پستول چلانے کے بارے میں پوچھتا ہے:
   کیا پستول ایک ہاتھ سے چلائی جا سکتی ہے؟ (جواب: جی ہاں)
   کیا دو ہاتھوں سے نشانہ زیادہ بہتر ہوتا ہے؟ (جواب: بالکل)
    کیا دو ہاتھوں سے پستول پکڑنا زیادہ محفوظ نہیں ہے؟ (جواب: جی ہاں، محفوظ ہے)
   * کیس کی طرف موڑنا: تو کیا آپ اتفاق نہیں کریں گے کہ اسی طرح گاڑی چلاتے وقت بھی ایک کے بجائے دو ہاتھ استعمال کرنا زیادہ محفوظ تھا؟
عملی مشق: جرح (Cross-Examination Exercise)
کیس کا منظرنامہ:
ایک شخص (مسٹر "الف") پر الزام ہے کہ وہ سیڑھیوں سے گرنے کی وجہ سے زخمی ہوا، اور اس نے کمپنی پر کیس کیا ہے کہ سیڑھیاں گیلی تھیں اور وہاں کوئی "احتیاطی بورڈ" نہیں تھا۔ لیکن حقیقت یہ ہے کہ مسٹر "الف" گرنے کے وقت اپنے موبائل فون پر میسج کر رہے تھے۔
طلبہ کے لیے ٹاسک:
آپ کو مسٹر "الف" (گواہ) سے جرح کرنی ہے اور اوپر بیان کی گئی تینوں تکنیکوں کا استعمال کرتے ہوئے یہ ثابت کرنا ہے کہ حادثہ ان کی اپنی غفلت کی وجہ سے ہوا۔
حصہ اول: واضح "ہاں" والی تکنیک (The Obvious "Yes")
ہدایت: ایسے سوالات لکھیں جن کا جواب گواہ صرف "ہاں" میں دے سکے:
 م سوال 1: کیا آپ مانتے ہیں کہ کسی بھی دفتر میں چلتے وقت احتیاط لازمی ہے؟
 سوال 2: کیا آپ اتفاق کریں گے کہ سیڑھیوں کا استعمال کرتے وقت نظریں سامنے ہونی چاہئیں؟
  سوال 3: کیا آپ مانتے ہیں کہ کام کے دوران اپنی حفاظت کی ذمہ داری ملازم پر بھی ہوتی ہے؟
  حتمی سوال: تو کیا آپ اتفاق کریں گے کہ سیڑھیوں پر چلتے وقت موبائل فون استعمال کرنا ایک غیر ذمہ دارانہ عمل ہے؟
حصہ دوم: ناگوار خاموشی کی تکنیک (The Uncomfortable Silence)
ہدایت: نیچے دیے گئے مکالمے کو مکمل کریں:
  وکیل: مسٹر الف، آپ نے گرنے سے ٹھیک 10 سیکنڈ پہلے کس کو میسج بھیجا تھا؟
  گواہ: میں نے تو کوئی میسج نہیں بھیجا۔
  (خاموشی): وکیل خاموشی سے گواہ کی آنکھوں میں دیکھتا رہتا ہے اور 10 سیکنڈ تک کچھ نہیں بولتا۔
 گواہ (خاموشی سے گھبرا کر): ............................................................................
حصہ سوم: تشبیہ یا اینالوجی کی تکنیک (The Analogy)
ہدایت: اصول کو لاگو کریں:
 وکیل: کیا آپ سڑک پار کرتے وقت اپنی آنکھوں پر پٹی باندھ کر چلیں گے؟
 گواہ: بالکل نہیں، یہ تو خودکشی کے برابر ہے۔
 وکیل: کیوں؟
 گواہ: کیونکہ سڑک پار کرتے وقت سامنے دیکھنا ضروری ہے تاکہ حادثہ نہ ہو۔
 وکیل (اینالوجی کا استعمال): اگر سڑک پر سامنے دیکھنا لازمی ہے، تو کیا سیڑھیوں پر چلتے ہوئے فون پر دیکھنا اتنا ہی خطرناک نہیں جتنا پٹی باندھ کر سڑک پار کرنا؟

JUDGMENT
----Through this Writ Petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the Petitioner, who applied for the post of Stenographer in Police Department (BS-15), has invoked jurisdiction of this Court by seeking indulgence against Order dated 26.09.2024 passed by the Respondent No.2, Additional Inspector General, Punjab (Admin and Security) on behalf of Respondent No.1, Inspector General of Police, Punjab rejecting representation of the Petitioner for his consideration for the subject matter post.

2.    It has been argued before this Court by learned counsel that the Petitioner applied for the subject matter post and cleared all tests including short-hand, typing test, interview and was successfully recommended by Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC). Thereafter, he was offered appointment through letter dated 30.01.2023, pursuant whereto the Petitioner himself disclosed that FIR bearing No. 849/2017 dated 27.12.2017 under sections 353, 186, 506 and 427, P.P.C. was lodged against him, however, vide Order dated 20.03.2019 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, I Class, Sahiwal, his application under section 249-A GOR.C was allowed and he was acquitted of the charge.

3.    Thereafter, the police department proceeded with the matter and issued transfer/posting orders to other successful candidates, but the Petitioner was ousted from the contest due to his previous involvement in the aforesaid criminal case Being aggrieved, the Petitioner approached this Court through Constitutional Petition bearing No.32020 of 2023, which was disposed of vide Order dated 16.05.2023 directing Respondent No.1 to decide the Petitioner's application pending before him in this behalf.

4.    Pursuant to Order dated 16.05.2023, his application was dismissed vide Order dated 23.10.2023. The Petitioner again approached this Court through Writ Petition No. 18597/2024 against the said Order and the Petition was disposed of by setting aside the Order dated 23.10.2023 and matter was remitted to the Respondent No.2 vide Order dated 21.05.2024 with a direction to provide hearing to the Petitioner as well as department and pass a speaking order justifying the points of law already determined by this Court. Finally, pursuant to Order dated 21.05.2024 passed by this Court, the Respondent No.2, through impugned Order dated 26.09.2024 has again rejected Application / representation of the Petitioner considering it devoid of any merit.

5.    According to learned counsel, there is no allegation against the Petitioner that he ever concealed or withheld any material from the department and since the Petitioner much before the initiation of process of fresh recruitment for the subject matter post stood acquitted, therefore, he could not have been denied his fundamental right for consideration of his name for the subject matter post, especially when he was meritorious and was recommended by the PPSC. Adds that there is no other allegation against the Petitioner forming basis for his non-consideration for the subject matter post.

6.    Conversely, learned Assistant Advocate General has entered appearance and relied upon Judgment passed in C.P No.4709/2019 titled "Zeeshan Ahmad v. Government of the Punjab through Inspector General of Police, Punjab Lahore and others" by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan. wherein it was declared that subsequent acquittal and findings in respect thereof are not binding upon Police Department and a candidate can still be declared unfit for the subject matter post. Learned A.A.G has also relied upon Judgment dated 08.04.2025 passed by this Court in Writ Petition No.5215/2021 titled "Hafiz Ali Raza v. Inspector General of Police and others" dismissing the petition and all connected matters relating to similar facts and circumstances. By relying upon Standing Order No.6 of 2015, learned A.A.G submits that it is a policy introduced by the department that the candidates who during the course of verification have been found involved in criminal cases either under trial or acquitted on multiple grounds shall not be appointed as Constable in Police Department, therefore, by supporting the Impugned Order. learned A.A.G argues that the instant Petition is meritless and same is liable to be rejected.

7.    After hearing respective contentions of the parties. record has been perused and there appears to be a consensus as far as the factual aspect of the controversy is involved i.e. status of the Petitioner from the submission of application till his recommendation by PPSC. The sole controversy leading to solicit opinion of the Court is that once a candidate has been acquitted from that charge and there is no allegation of concealment of facts or withholding of information against him, can he still be declared debarred from his induction/recruitment in the Police Department on account of FIR from which, he stood acquitted? This question must be addressed in light of settled legal principles, including the presumption of innocence and the legal consequence of an acquittal as it is a fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that once an individual is acquitted, particularly through a clean acquittal based on merits rather than benefit of doubt then no stigma can be attached to his person. In the absence of a conviction or a finding of moral turpitude, and where no suppression of material facts is established, refusal of appointment solely on the basis of a past FIR would amount to denial of fundamental rights as mere registration of an FIR, followed by acquittal, does not per se constitute a valid ground to deny public employment. Legally speaking. unless there is a conviction, or unless the acquittal was based on compromise or technical grounds involving moral turpitude, the candidate's eligibility cannot be denied on such basis as an acquittal on merit restores the presumption of innocence and disqualifying a candidate without legal basis would amount to arbitrariness as it violates inviolable Constitutional rights protected by Articles 4, 9 and 18 of the Constitution.

8.    A glance at the following policy, reflected through Standing Order bearing No.6 of 2015 is equally interesting for this Court to assess the legal position:

       "III) All those candidates who during character verification have been found involved in criminal cases (either under trial or acquitted on multiple grounds) shall not be appointed in Police Department as constable, in the light of instructions issued vide this Office Order No.SE-IV/7317-70/11, dated 26.06.2014.

       IV) All the candidates submit an affidavit for non-involvement in criminal cases at the time of submission of application form and if the case is registered against an applicant after the last date of submission of application form, but the applicant is not challaned and declared innocent; then that would not be ground for rejection of an applicant. However, DPO must examine that case is not cancelled or accused declared innocent due to compromise between parties in the light of para 23 of Standing Order No.06/2015 amended vide No.SE-III/1105-60/XV dated 01.06.2018."

[Emphasis provided

9.    It is noteworthy that questions of law reflected through. instant Petition also stand determined by this Court through Judgment dated 12.09.2023 passed in Writ Petition bearing No.50582/2022 titled "Syed Ali Hassan Naqvi v. Senior Superintendent of Police and others" and Judgment dated 17.10.2023 passed in 2024 PLC (C.S.) 826 titled "Syed Ali Raza Naqvi and others v. Chairman PPSC and others". The Judgment in the case of Syed Ali Hassan Naqvi supra stands upheld through Order dated 20.11.2023 passed by the learned Division Bench of this Court in I.C.A. No.75536 of 2023 titled "Province of Punjab and others v. Syed Ali Hassan Naqvi".

10.  In the instant case, the FIR was lodged against accused persons including present Petitioner and report under section 9/7 of the Prosecution Act, 2006 reflected assessment that there were lesser chances of punishment in the case. The Magistrate, 1st Class through Order dated 20.03.2019 recorded reasons for acquittal of Petitioner by noticing that complainant of FIR namely, Shahid Mehmood ASI had already lodged a fake FIR against the deceased father of the accused and during departmental inquiry it appeared that the complainant Shahid Mehmood, ASI, malafidely, got the FIR lodged against the accused persons including the Petitioner and consequently, learned Magistrate recorded reasons for acquittal of the accused in the following terms:

       "Thus, the mala fide intention of the complainant towards the accused party is proved at departmental level, So, when the story of prosecution as narrated in the FIR is doubtful and malafide intentions of the complainant towards accused party is proved before the court from the documents submitted by the learned counsel for the Petitioners/accused during the arguments then there is no probability of the conviction of the accused persons in this case. Section 249-A, Cr.P.C empowers the Court to acquit the accused at any stage of the proceedings even before framing of charge if there is no probability of conviction of accused for the alleged offence. However, it is incumbent upon the Magistrate to afford opportunity to the prosecutor as well as accused persons to argue the merits of the case on the basis of material available with the prosecution and recording of prosecution evidence is not mandatory condition while passing the acquittal order under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. The wisdom and scheme provided under section 249-A, Cr.P.C is to save an innocent person from lengthy trial for the charges which are groundless and ultimately accused will be acquitted. Therefore, this court by keeping in mind the above said observation is of this opinion that there is no probability for the conviction of accused, hence, application under section 249-A, Cr.P.C is accepted and accused persons namely Muhammad Yaqub, Muhammad Mehboob. Shafqat Rasool, Mst. Sidra Bibi, Mst. Nida Bibi and Mst. Mehreen are hereby acquitted of the charge against them under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. They are on bail, therefore, sureties of the accused persons are discharged from their liabilities. Case property be dealt with in accordance with law. The file be consigned to the Record Room after its due completion/compilation."

[Emphasis provided]

11.  In such circumstances, the acquittal of the Petitioner was purely on merits as the Police being complainant had involved him malafidely. Under the law, the acquittal of an accused in a criminal case leaves no stigma on him especially when it stands proved that lodging of FIR was malicious and tainted. Clause IV of Standing Order clearly reflects that a candidate must submit an affidavit of his non-involvement in a criminal case at the time of submission of Application Form. In the instant case the Petitioner had submitted his affidavit that at the time of submission of Application Form, he was not involved in any criminal case and that deposition also contained the factum of acquittal from previous FIR.

12.  The second ingredient contained in Standing Order is equally important i.e. if applicant has not been challaned and declared innocent then that would not be a ground for rejection of his application and DPO concerned must examine that the case is not cancelled or accused has not been declared innocent due to compromise between the parties. In the instant case, the Petitioner was acquitted on merits of the case and therefore, his case clearly fell within the ambit and scope of Judgment passed in Syed Ali Hassan Naqvi case supra.

13.  As to the reliance placed by learned A.A.G. on Zeeshan Ahmad (supra), suffice is to observe that the facts of that case are completely distinct and materially inapposite. In the said case, the candidate had deliberately failed to disclose his involvement in a pending criminal case while submitting his application, leading the Hon'ble Supreme Court to hold that such non-disclosure amounted to a concealment of material facts, rendering him ipso facto, unfit for consideration by the Police Department. Here, by contrast, no concealment or misrepresentation of material facts is pleaded, nor is any allegation of fraudulent intent advanced. The learned A.A.G.'s reliance on the said precedent is, therefore, inapposite. The case of Zeeshan Ahmad turns on deliberate non-disclosure in an official application, a circumstance entirely absent in the present proceedings. Hence, the rationale and outcome of Zeeshan Ahmad cannot be extended to undermine the petition.

14.  In the present case it was patently unsafe and legally unjust for the impugned Order to subject the Petitioner to the wriggles of Standing Order. The impugned Order suffers from a glaring misapplication of law and a failure to appreciate the factual matrix of the case, It was wholly unsafe, arbitrary, and legally untenable to subject the Petitioner to the adverse consequences under the garb of Standing Order, particularly when his acquittal under Section 249-A, Cr.P.C. had already attained finality. The categorical view taken by the learned Magistrate, who found the case against the Petitioner to be devoid of substance, ought to have been given due judicial and administrative weight. It is a settled principle that policies must be applied with reference to the facts of each individual case, and cannot override judicial determinations of acquittal. especially when based on merit. The instant case is a classic example where mechanical application of policy has led to manifest injustice. The FIR registered against the Petitioner was not only based on false allegations but also promptly discredited during departmental proceedings. It stood established on record that the complainant of the FIR, namely Shahid Mehmood, ASI, had maliciously and recklessly attributed false allegations against the Petitioner and others in an attempt to falsely implicate them. The departmental inquiry conducted thereafter confirmed the misconduct and mala fides on part of the said complainant. In view of the above, the acquittal of the Petitioner under Section 249-A, Cr.P.C. was not a mere technical discharge, but a judicial finding based on a complete lack of evidence and false implication, meriting full exoneration. Consequently, the rejection of the Petitioner's representation by relying upon a policy, without any application of mind to the exonerating circumstances and judicial record, is not only arbitrary and discriminatory, but also violative of settled principles of administrative justice and fairness. Such action, being inconsistent with the dictates of due process, is not sustainable in the eyes of law.

Writ Petition No.4903 of 2025
MUHAMMAD MEHBOOB HAYAT Versus INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE, PUNJAB and others
M FAROOQ KHILJI ADVOCATE
[1/16/26, 7:00:26 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: The High Court‟s power of judicial review under Article 199 of the Constitution is an original jurisdiction. It is, however, subject to the Constitution and inter alia the condition that no other adequate remedy is provided by law. Further, in respect of the matters mentioned in Article 199(1)(a), the High Court must be moved by an aggrieved party, while any person may approach it for an order under Article 199(1)(b). As for the matters falling within the ambit of Article 199(1)(c), it can exercise jurisdiction only on the application of an aggrieved person. Determining whether a party meets this threshold is a mixed question of law and fact governed by settled principles and not left to judicial discretion. 

The word “right” in the context of Article 199 is not used in its strict juristic sense. It suffices if the person claiming to be aggrieved “had a personal interest in the performance of the legal duty which, if not performed or if performed in a manner not permitted by law, would result in the loss of some personal benefit or advantage or the curtailment of a privilege or liberty or franchise.”4 However, where a department of the government acts in its official capacity, courts generally require that the grievance be grounded in a concrete legal injury rather than a procedural or institutional inconvenience. This proposition is, however, subject to certain exceptions. Where a statute expressly authorizes a department or statutory body to initiate legal proceedings, or where the entity performs adjudicatory or commercial functions akin to a private litigant, a limited but justiciable interest may suffice.  

It is trite that the High Court‟s jurisdiction under Article 199 is discretionary.5 The finding on locus standi in paragraph 24 addresses only the threshold question of competency to invoke this jurisdiction. Whether the Court should exercise that jurisdiction is a separate inquiry guided by considerations of institutional comity, proportionality, and the availability of executive remedies. Rule 8(2) of the Rules of Business is not a mere formality but an institutional safeguard that reinforces the doctrine of separation of powers and preserves internal administrative discipline. While Rule 8(2) does not impose a jurisdictional bar, it reflects a constitutional commitment to executive coordination and the principle of institutional comity, which discourages judicial interference where executive remedies are available and adequate. Judicial review under Article 199 is not designed to serve as an internal arbitration forum for the executive, especially in the absence of a cognizable legal grievance. There is nothing on record to show that the consultative process mandated by Rule 8(2) was initiated, let alone exhausted. In the circumstances, judicial intervention at this stage is not warranted.

Additional evidence---Principle---Filling in lacuna---Failure to provide copies of evidence to accused---Complainant, after close of prosecution evidence and recording of statements of accused persons filed application to summon doctor and an official who arrested accused---Trial Court dismissed the application---Validity---Trial Court had unfettered power in matter of summoning a witness, though not cited as a witness in calendar of witnesses, in case, Trial Court arrived thereof to the conclusion in the light of peculiar circumstances of a case that examination of such person as a witness was essential for just and fair dispensation of justice---Such power could not be exercised when examination of such a proposed witness introduced later on by any party to the case for the purpose of vexation or delay or defeating ends of justice---Powers conferred upon Trial Court under S.540, Cr.P.C. could be used to find out the truth but could not be exercised for filling gaps and lacuna left by either party---When no copy of statement of witnesses and documents to be exhibited by such witnesses were provided to accused at commencement of trial and before framing of charge, at such belated stage complainant could not be permitted to examine and place on record any document in shape of second medical report and card of arrest, though proposed witnesses, whose names and description were neither mentioned in calendar of witnesses nor Trial Court was apprised of them when prosecution was called out to lead its evidence---To allow such applications at such belated stage would serve no useful purpose but to increase agonies of accused party albeit they had already suffered since year, 2012---High Court declined to interfere in order passed by Trial Court---

Second statement of accused under S.342, Cr.P.C.---Legality---Scope---Accused was charged for committing murder of the son of complainant by inflicting churri blow---Prosecution case primarily rested on the evidence of three eye-witnesses who according to their evidence all saw the accused (appellant) stabbing the deceased to death---Question of the murder by the appellant in respect of evidence of eye-witnesses that they had seen the appellant stabbing the deceased was put to the appellant in his first S. 342 Cr.P.C statement---Thereafter, the prosecution moved an application to call two further witnesses being the MLO in respect of the medical evidence and the Judicial Magistrate in respect of S. 164 Cr.P.C statement which he recorded---Such application was allowed and the two said witnesses gave evidence---Thereafter the trial Court recorded a second further statement of accused under S. 342, Cr.P.C---All the parties were in agreement that after recording two new witnesses the first S. 342 Cr.P.C statement was of no legal effect and a second fresh S. 342 Cr.P.C statement had to be recorded---Record showed that the Trial Court had tried to record a further statement under S. 342, Cr.P.C apparently in continuation of the first S. 342 Cr.P.C statement of the appellant, however, there was no provision in law/concept which allowed a further S. 342 Cr.P.C statement to be made in continuation of the first S. 342 Cr.P.C which was limited to new witnesses which had been recorded and after the evidence of two witnesses had been recorded in between the two separate S. 342 Cr.P.C statements---S. 342 Cr.P.C statement must be recorded afresh, if it had not already been recorded, at the completion of the prosecution case which would lead to there being one final S. 342 Cr.P.C statement encompassing each piece of evidence which the prosecution intended to rely on to convict the accused---After recording the two additional witnesses pursuant to the prosecution application under S. 540 , Cr.P.C the first S. 342 Cr.P.C statement fell away entirely and the S. 342 Cr.P.C statement of the appellant had to be recorded afresh putting to him any question which tended to implicate him in the offence and gave him the opportunity to explain each and every question before it could be relied upon to convict the appellant---Thus, only the second S. 342 Cr.P.C statement could be relied upon in the case---Question that was not put to the appellant when his S. 342 Cr.P.C statement was re-recorded went to the heart of the prosecution case i.e. that the appellant stabbed the deceased and thereby committed his murder, had to be put to the appellant for his explanation---Fact remained that it was not done meaning that such piece of eye-witness evidence stood excluded from consideration which led to the conclusion that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt---

Application for discarding previously recorded evidence --- During the trial of a criminal case, on 01.01.2025, applicant got recorded his examination-in-chief, exhibited a sale agreement and WhatsApp chats but during cross-examination on 07.01.2025, it was discovered that the original examination-in-chief including the sale agreement had been removed from the Court file and replaced with a tampered version with the WhatsApp chats incorrectly marked---The applicant had taken pictures of the original examination-in-chief on 01.01.2025, confirming the tampering, and the Court admitted altering the record---Applicant filed a transfer application before the High Court, which transferred the case on 11.02.2025 without addressing the tampering allegations---Validity---In the present case, there was no record indicating that the applicant raised any objections or denied any part of the evidence when it was read back to him---Furthermore, the applicant did not submit any application before the Trial Court seeking correction of any portion of the evidence---Upon careful review of the record, it appeared that the applicant's evidence was incompletely recorded---Examination-in-chief was conducted on 01-01-2025 and partial cross-examination was recorded on 07-01-2025---As such, the Trial Court retained the authority to re-examine the applicant under S.540 ,Cr.P.C., provided he filed an application meeting the conditions outlined in that provision---Additionally, the applicant had the option of re-examination, subject to fulfilling the requirements under Arts.132(3) and 133(3) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Given the existence of comprehensive legal provisions, such as S.540 ,Cr.P.C, and Arts.152(2) & 133(3) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, the present Criminal Miscellaneous Application was not maintainable before the High Court under ordinary circumstances---Moreover, the applicant had failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances that would warrant discarding the previously recorded evidence by invoking the powers under S.561-A, Cr.P.C., in the ongoing proceedings

USB as a modern device---Evidentiary value---Scope---Application under S.540 , Cr.P.C for bringing evidence on record---Powers of Trial Court---Scope---Trial Court rejected application of accused seeking a USB to be exhibited in evidence---USB is a modern device generated through an automated system, hence the same can be exhibited in evidence as provided in Articles 46-A and 164 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 ('the Order 1984')---Article 164 of the Order 1984provides wide powers to the Courts to make use of evidence generated by modern devices and techniques---Arts.46-A and 78-A of the Order, 1984 as well as provisions of Electronic Transactions Ordinance have smoothened the procedure to receive such evidence subject to certain restrictions / limitations---If USB is allowed to be exhibited in evidence , the respondent has a right to cross-examination as a litmus test of the truthfulness of what is deposed on oath in examination-in-chief---Court should not summarily dismiss an application under S.540 , Cr. P.C. merely on the ground that it is found just to fulfill a lacuna in the case or that it was a belated application---Courts are duty bound to decide the case on merits after affording an opportunity to the parties to place on record all available evidence with them---Section 540 , Cr.P.C. empowers a Court to summon all relevant evidence and place it on record at any stage of the trial if it is necessary to decide the controversy between the parties---Trial Court was not justified in declining the request of the applicant for bringing on record the USB as an evidence while dismissing application under S.540 , Cr.P.C---High Court set-aside impugned order and allowed the application filed under S.540 , Cr.P.C, for bringing on record the USB as an evidence---"

Interpretation of S. 265-f , Cr.P.C.---In terms of S. 265-f (2), Cr.P.C., the court, having ascertained from the Public Prosecutor or from the complainant the names of any persons likely to be acquainted with the facts of the case and to be able to give evidence for the prosecution, would summon such person to give evidence before it---Section 265-f (7), Cr.P.C. even granted a right to the accused to apply for summoning any witness and production of documents---Section 265-f , Cr.P.C. had been added in the Code in order to ensure the concept of a fair trial and to achieve that purpose, equal opportunity had been provided to both, the accused and the prosecution for summoning the evidence---Section 265-f , Cr.P.C. did not provide specifically that only those witnesses could be examined whose statements had been recorded under S. 161, Cr.P.C or their names had been mentioned in the challan in the column of witnesses---Under S. 265-f , Cr.P.C., the Trial Court was not bound to record the statements of only those witnesses who had been listed in the calendar of witnesses---Trial Court, in terms of S. 540, Cr.P.C., on the other hand, could summon a material witness even if his/her name did not appear in the column of witnesses of the challan, provided their evidence was deemed essential by the court for the right decision of the case---In the present case, dispute over a woman had been alleged to be the motive behind the incident, and said women, who had been summoned as a witness on the application of the complainant, was the wife of the complainant and sister of the accused---Name of said woman/witness although was not mentioned in the column of witnesses of the challan, but keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances, particularly the motive part, she was a material witness and had been rightly summoned as such---Examination of said witness would not prejudice the defence, as equal opportunity of cross-examination would be provided to the defence---Impugned order, being well reasoned and based on law on the subject, was not open to any interference by the High Court in its revisional jurisdiction---
[1/16/26, 7:01:06 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: 2016  PCrLJ  1124     
Under S. 265-f (1), Cr.P.C., if a witness, who is acquainted with the facts of the case and who has not been produced by prosecution in the first instance, is desired to be summoned through court, the same is subject to permission of the court---In view of S. 265-f (3), Cr.P.C., court may refuse to summon any such witness mentioned in S. 265-f (2), Cr.P.C., if the court is of the opinion that the witness is being called for purpose of vexation or delay or defeating the ends of justice---Court, however, has no such choice to refuse to examine any witness produced by prosecution under S. 265-f (1), Cr.P.C.
 Section 265-f (1), Cr.P.C. makes it mandatory for trial court to take all such evidence as may be produced in support of prosecution case---No restriction exists for prosecution to produce evidence of its choice or to apply for permission of the court in this regard.
 Examination of witnesses by police---Supply of statement and documents to accused---No embargo on examination of a person during course of trial, either in favour of prosecution or accused, who had not recorded his statement under S. 161, Cr.P.C.---Court had ample power to examine any person as witness in the case, irrespective of the fact whether his statement under S. 161, Cr.P.C. was recorded during the course of investigation or not---Person, who had been well cited as a witness both in the FIR and the report under S. 173, Cr.P.C., but his statement was not recorded under S. 161, Cr.P.C. could not be equated with a person who was neither cited as witness nor his statement was recorded during course of investigation---If witnesses' names appeared in the list of witnesses annexed with the report under S. 173, Cr.P.C. submitted before the trial court and once the prosecution was allowed to lead evidence, no special permission was required thereafter from the trial court for producing each and every witness---However, if prosecution or the court, in view of S. 265-f (2), Cr.P.C., desired to produce a person not cited as a witness in the calendar of witnesses, then the permission in that regard from the Trial Court became necessary---Provision of S. 265-f (2), Cr.P.C. was in addition to S. 265-f (1), Cr.P.C.---Name of the proposed prosecution witness was not only mentioned in calendar of witnesses but he had also been cited as an injured person in the FIR---Provisions of both Ss. 265-f (2) & 540, Cr.P.C. were, therefore, not applicable to the case-
Section 540, Cr.P.C. is more exhaustive and confers vast jurisdiction upon the court even to examine a witness not summoned in the case or to examine any person in attendance if his evidence appears to be essential for just decision.

Declaration of a witness as Hostile ---Powers of the Trial Court---Scope---Trial Court dismissed an application moved by the petitioner/complainant for declaring one of prosecution witnesses as a Hostile witness---Contention of the petitioner/complainant was that the replies given by the said prosecution witness (police official) to a few questions, having been put to him during his cross-examination, would favour the defence---Held, that the witness could be declared as a Hostile witness by the Court under Art. 150 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 ('the Order 1984'), however, the same (Article) had conferred discretion upon the Trial Court in said regard---Trial Court was to permit the person who had called a witness to put any question to him (witness), which actually was to be put in cross-examination by the adverse party---Only controversy, in the present case, was that at what stage of the proceedings said mandate of the Trial Court was to be attracted---Record revealed that the witness-in-question recorded his examination-in-chief prima facie supporting the version of the prosecution and thereafter the defense started cross-examination of the said witness; and it was in the middle of his cross-examination when the petitioner/complainant made a request to declare him a Hostile witness which request was turned down---Party could ask the Court to declare a witness as Hostile when it was its witness, however, once the witness had completed the process of examination-in-chief and the moment when the opposite party had started cross-examination then such witness did not remain the party's witness; and thus at such stage (i.e. cross-examination) it could not ask the Court to declare him as a Hostile witness---Party could ask for declaring the witness as Hostile when the opposite party had not started the cross-examination but once cross-examination had commenced then such request could not be entertained as after putting the first question in the cross-examination the said witness did not remain the witness of the prosecution/ complainant---Trial Court had rightly turned down the request/ application of the petitioner/ complainant for declaring the prosecution witness as Hostile.

Accused was acquitted in absentia---Validity---Section 540-A, Cr.P.C., mandated and allowed a Court to dispense with personal attendance of an accused if he was represented by a pleader and there were multiple accused, or if the accused was incapable of appearing before Court---In view of said provisions of law, Trial Court was justified to make an order in respect of acquittal of said accused/respondent in absentia, when otherwise, on the available record, no prima facie case was made-out against him, even if he would have been forced to face a full-fledged trial before Trial Court---More particularly, when on the same set of evidence, other nominated accused/respondents had earned a honourable acquittal during trial proceedings---Appeal being bereft of any merits was dismissed, in limine.

Hostile witness---Scope---Discretion of Court---Application of the petitioners to declare the defence witnesses as hostile witnesses was declined---Validity---Petitioners moved an application under S.540 , Cr.P.C for summoning the defence witnesses, which was allowed, resultantly, they appeared as DWs 3 to 4---However, during recording of examination in chief of said witnesses, defence counsel requested the Trial Court to declare them as hostile, but his request was turned down---In a situation, where at the time of recording evidence, the integrity of a witness was shaken up to such an extent that he was causing damage to the case of the party, who produced him, then, in such eventuality, the provisions of S.150 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat O.1984, would come into play, according to which, the Court may, in its discretion, permit the person who called a witness to put any questions to him which might be put in cross-examination by the adverse party---It was true that the provisions of the Article conferred powers on Court to permit a party who called a witness to put any question, which may be put in cross-examination, but it was equally true that such discretion must be exercised with due care, keeping in view the interests of both the parties so that no one would be prejudiced from the order of the Court---Statements of the DWs were perused and according to their statements, though, they had signed/thumb impressed the affidavits, however, they did not read its contents---Nothing was observed in their statement that either they had made any deviation from their earlier statements or attempted to conceal material facts as the record told that during investigation of the case one of the petitioners submitted an application to the District Police Officer concerned, which was marked to Police Officer/witness---Said witness during cross-examination stated that during inquiry, the accused party produced three witnesses in defence and they submitted their affidavits, which he placed on record---Said witness further admitted that the statements of the said deponents were not recorded by him under S.161, Cr.P.C as they (deponents) were not ready to record their statements, and when their statements were not recorded previously, then how they could be declared hostile on the ground that they were telling a lie or concealing material facts---In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, the discretion exercised by the Trial Court was in accordance with law which needed no inteference by the High Court---

Summoning of witnesses for re-examination--- Application of the prosecution for summoning the witnesses for re-examination was allowed---Scope---As per S. 540 , Cr.P.C., the Trial Court had ample power to summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance though not summoned as a witness or re-call and re-examine any person already examined if his evidence appeared to it essential to the just decision of the case---Intent of the legislature was very much clear from the language of the entire Section that the Court could examine any person who was acquainted with the facts of the case, therefore, the Court was not bound to record the statements of only those witnesses who were listed in the calendar of witnesses only, but in order to arrive at a just conclusion, the Court could call any person likely to be acquainted with the facts of the case after ascertaining it from the Public Prosecutor or the complainant subject to the general provisions that summoning of any such witness did not cause delay or defeat the ends of justice---Prosecution had filed application for summoning Constable/witness on the ground that he had taken samples to the Forensic Science Laboratory from the Police Station---Statement of said witness was recorded under S. 161, Cr.P.C. but inadvertently, his name was not mentioned in the column of challan---Similar was the case of two other witnesses, who had registered FIR and submitted challan but inadvertently, their names had not been mentioned in the column of witnesses---Another witness had been examined, but the prosecution was seeking his re-examination to the extent that he had taken Murasila to the Police Station and to that extent he had not been examined---Reasons furnished by the prosecution were plausible and convincing, therefore, the Trial Court was justified to allow the applications of prosecution---

Exemption from personal appearance---Scope---Accused assailed the dismissal of his application for exemption from personal appearance before the Court---Conduct of the accused and his father (who had appeared before the Court in his absence) showed that they had due regard for the Court and law---No doubt, twice accused had left the country without getting any permission from the Court but such non-appearance could not be taken like that of an absconder because he had left the country through legal means when he was on bail and had attended the Court for some time---Non-appearance of accused should have been condoned by granting him exemption from his personal appearance before particularly when not only his father was appearing before the Court but he was also represented before the Court by his counsel---
S.540 -A---Provision for inquiries and trial being held in the absence of accused in certain cases---Exemption from personal appearance---Single accused---Scope---Exemption under S. 540 -A, Cr.P.C., from personal appearance can be granted only when there are two or more than two accused in the case and where the accused physically appears before the Court and claims exemption but in suitable cases exemption can be granted when there is single accused before the Court and even when he is not physically present before the Court at the time of claiming exemption.

Reliance on Hostile witness by Court---Scope---Accused was charged for committing murder of his wife/mother of complainant---Record revealed that the prosecution had requested the trial Court to declare eye-witnesses as Hostile witnesses during the cross-examination of one of the eye-witnesses when cross-examination on the complainant had already been completed---Witness could not be declared Hostile during cross-examination---Thus, not only the decision of the Trial Court while declaring eye-witnesses as Hostile witnesses was against the law but its reliance on their testimony, being of doubtful nature, was also against the settled principles---Criminal jurisprudence mandated that any reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused must be resolved in favor of the accused---In the present case, the unreliable nature of the testimony of both the eye-witnesses created a significant gap in the evidentiary chain---Trial Court's reliance on a Hostile witness, whose account underwent material alterations, constituted a misapprehension of the weight to be accorded to such evidence---Circumstances established that the prosecution had not discharged its legal burden to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond shadow of doubt---

'Hostile witness' and 'unfavourable witness'---Distinction---Hostile witness is the one who, from the manner in which he gives his evidence, shows that he is not telling the truth and resiles from his earlier statement in order to damage the case of the calling party---While an unfavourable witness is one who, without any Hostile intention, gives evidence which is contrary to the interest of the party.
Hostile witness---Scope---Discretion of Court---Application of the petitioners to declare the defence witnesses as Hostile witnesses was declined---Validity---Petitioners moved an application under S.540, Cr.P.C for summoning the defence witnesses, which was allowed, resultantly, they appeared as DWs 3 to 4---However, during recording of examination in chief of said witnesses, defence counsel requested the Trial Court to declare them as Hostile , but his request was turned down---In a situation, where at the time of recording evidence, the integrity of a witness was shaken up to such an extent that he was causing damage to the case of the party, who produced him, then, in such eventuality, the provisions of S.150 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat O.1984, would come into play, according to which, the Court may, in its discretion, permit the person who called a witness to put any questions to him which might be put in cross-examination by the adverse party---It was true that the provisions of the Article conferred powers on Court to permit a party who called a witness to put any question, which may be put in cross-examination, but it was equally true that such discretion must be exercised with due care, keeping in view the interests of both the parties so that no one would be prejudiced from the order of the Court---Statements of the DWs were perused and according to their statements, though, they had signed/thumb impressed the affidavits, however, they did not read its contents---Nothing was observed in their statement that either they had made any deviation from their earlier statements or attempted to conceal material facts as the record told that during investigation of the case one of the petitioners submitted an application to the District Police Officer concerned, which was marked to Police Officer/witness---Said witness during cross-examination stated that during inquiry, the accused party produced three witnesses in defence and they submitted their affidavits, which he placed on record---Said witness further admitted that the statements of the said deponents were not recorded by him under S.161, Cr.P.C as they (deponents) were not ready to record their statements, and when their statements were not recorded previously, then how they could be declared Hostile on the ground that they were telling a lie or concealing material facts---In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, the discretion exercised by the Trial Court was in accordance with law which needed no inteference by the High Court---

Record depicted that one of the daughters of female deceased had been abandoned by the prosecution, whereas, other aged 32 years had been produced in the witness box but she in her very examination-in-chief stated that she did not want to record statement against her uncle/the appellant---In view of her statement, said witness was declared as Hostile witness and the prosecution was allowed to cross-examine her---However, said cross-examination was inadmissible as had been confronted therein with her statement recorded under S.161, Cr.P.C., by the Police Officer during investigation of the case---
In the present case, the daughter of the female deceased was declared Hostile ---If the testimony of said witness was taken into consideration, the same would reveal that though in the cross-examination conducted by the prosecution, she had admitted her statement recorded under S.161, Cr.P.C., wherein she had furnished ocular account of the occurrence, but from her cross-examination conducted by the defence, her presence at the spot at the time of occurrence became doubtful, particularly, taking into consideration her unnatural behavior such as not reporting the incident to police, not informing his father after murder of her mother, not accompanying the dead body of her mother to the hospital and not giving any information of the incident to complainant, who was her maternal uncle---Said witness had also admitted that from the date of her marriage she was residing in the house of her husband situated in District M-(Mardan)---Occurrence had taken place inside the house of her father, situated in village---Though, she had alleged that she had visited the house of her father as a guest, but an iota of evidence had not been brought on record to substantiate her said stance---No independent person from the locality/village had been examined by the prosecution to depose at least to the extent that said witness had visited the house of her parents and was present in the house at the time of occurrence---Escape or let off of said witness by the appellant was also beyond the comprehension of a prudent mind---Moreover, it did not appeal to a prudent mind that the appellant who was mentally ready to do three deceased away at one and the same time but let off said witness to stand eye-witness against him---Prosecution had not brought on record the actual reasons of her resile from her earlier alleged version recorded under S.161, Cr.P.C., therefore, in view of her testimony a safe inference would be that she had not witnessed the occurrence as alleged by the prosecution---

 کی روح کی عکاسی کرتا ہے اور لاہور ہائی کورٹ کی مستقل نظیر کے مطابق ہے کہ ہر عدالتی حکم ریویژن کے دائرہ میں نہیں آتا، بلکہ صرف وہی حکم قابلِ ریویژن ہوتا ہے جو:

کسی حق کا تعین کرے،

فریقین کے درمیان کسی اہم تنازعہ کو ختم کرے، یا

مقدمہ کو کسی سمت میں حتمی طور پر متاثر کرے۔

Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabbir کا یہ آبزرویشن اسی قانونی معیار کو واضح کرتا ہے:

“For Revision to be maintainable, the impugned order should have finality attached to the same…”

یعنی
ریویژن دائر کرنے کے لیے ضروری ہے کہ چیلنج کیا گیا حکم ایسا ہو جس میں حتمیت (Finality) پائی جاتی ہو۔ اگر وہ حکم محض:

طریقۂ کار (Procedural) سے متعلق ہو،

عدالت کے صوابدیدی اختیار (Discretion) کے تحت ہو،

عبوری نوعیت کا ہو (Interlocutory Order)،

اور مقدمہ کے اصل حقوق کا فیصلہ نہ کرتا ہو،

تو وہ حکم

“Case Decided” کے زمرے میں نہیں آتا،
اور اس پر ریویژن دائر کرنا قانوناً ناقابلِ سماعت ہوگا۔

“Case Decided”
 کا مفہوم
پاکستانی عدالتی نظائر کے مطابق

“Case Decided” سے مراد ایسا عدالتی حکم ہے جو:

کسی فریق کے حق کو ختم یا تسلیم کرے، یا

کسی بنیادی سوال کو ہمیشہ کے لیے طے کر دے، یا

مقدمہ کی سمت کو ناقابلِ واپسی طور پر بدل دے۔

جبکہ درج ذیل احکامات عام طور پر 
Interlocutory / Procedural 
تصور ہوتے ہیں

گواہ طلب کرنے یا نہ کرنے کا حکم

دستاویز ریکارڈ پر لینے یا نہ لینے کا حکم

تاریخ دینے کا حکم

جرح محدود کرنے کا حکم

التواء کی درخواست مسترد کرنا

کسی درخواست کو “بعد میں سنے جانے” کا حکم

ایسے احکامات میں کوئی حتمی فیصلہ نہیں ہوتا بلکہ مقدمہ اپنی اصل حالت میں چلتا رہتا ہے، اس لیے ان کے خلاف ریویژن قابلِ سماعت نہیں ہوتی۔

عملی قانونی اثر (Practical Impact)
یہ اصول عدالتی نظام کو:

غیر ضروری ریویژنز سے بچاتا ہے،

مقدمات کو بلاوجہ طول دینے سے روکتا ہے،

اور ٹرائل کورٹ کی صوابدیدی کارروائی میں غیر ضروری مداخلت کو محدود کرتا ہے۔

اگر ہر عبوری حکم کے خلاف ریویژن قابلِ سماعت مان لی جائے تو:

ہر تاریخ،

ہر گواہ،

ہر دستاویز
پر علیحدہ علیحدہ ریویژن دائر ہو سکتی ہے، جس سے انصاف کا نظام مفلوج ہو جائے گا۔

اسی لیے ہائی کورٹس نے یہ اصول وضع کیا کہ

Only an order having attributes of finality and determining rights of parties can be termed as “case decided” for the purpose of Section 115 CPC.

یہ فیصلہ خاص طور پر ٹرائل اسٹیج پر دیے گئے عبوری احکامات کے خلاف دائر کی جانے والی ریویژنز کے لیے ایک مضبوط قانونی بنیاد فراہم کرتا ہے اور ماتحت عدالتوں کے اختیارات کے تحفظ کا ذریعہ بنتا ہے۔

[1/16/26, 7:01:34 PM] ~ insaf sab k liey: فیملی مقدمات میں غیر ضروری اور طویل جرح پر لاہور ہائیکورٹ کا انتہائی سخت ردعمل۔
The law is settled that a witness when subjected to unduly lengthy cross-examination, which also consists of many irrelevant and misdirected questions, the contradiction, if any, can lose its significance. Such type of cross-examination is repeatedly discouraged. 
The purpose of cross-examination is to assist the Court in bringing the truth to light by disclosing or clarifying matters which witnesses may wish to conceal or confuse from motives of partisanship…Effective cross-examination could be confined within a narrow compass. The question must not go beyond reasonable limits.

The procedure of recording evidence is given in section 11 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act-1964 (the ‘Family Court Act’). The second proviso of section 11 of the Family Court Act clearly provides that the Family Court may forbid any question which it regards as indecent, scandalous or frivolous or which appears to it to be intended to insult or annoy or be needlessly offensive in form.  

 Not merely indecent and scandalous questions are prohibited but at the same time frivolous, insulting, annoying and offensive questions can also be forbidden by the learned Family Court.  The Family Court is also empowered under section 11(3-A) of the Family Court Act by itself to put questions to witnesses for the purposes of elucidation of any point which it considers material in the case. These specific provisions of law are intended to ensure that the cases arising out of the family disputes or for the guardianship of the minors should be settled while remaining within certain limits. Even otherwise, the law of evidence restricts the litigants or their pleaders from exposing the witnesses to undignified treatment and the witnesses must not suffer from humiliation or intimidation at the hands of the learned advocates for parties. The Courts, when so required, must interfere, which possess ample powers to provide protection to the witnesses when they are facing such situation. 

At this stage, I would also like to highlight growing tendency, in the cases emanating out of the family jurisdiction and related matters amongst the parties of unduly prolonging the cases by (i) deviating from the law of pleadings, (ii) introducing the witnesses and evidence having no relevance and (iii) lengthening the examination, like in the present one. This as a result is defeating the very object and purpose of promulgating the statutes on these subjects. The Family Court Act is intended to establish the Courts for expeditious settlement and resolution of disputes relating to marriage, family affairs and for the matters connected therewith. The learned Family Courts are expected by legislature to resolve the disputes within six months from the date of institution. Guidelines have been given by the legislature for every step of the proceedings, starting from the pleadings.  

The word “material” has been inserted in section 7(2) of the Family Court Act through the West Pakistan Ordinance No. X of 1966 dated 04.04.1966. Sub-section 2 of section 7 of the Family Court Act reads that the plaint shall contain all material facts relating to the dispute and shall contain a Schedule giving the number of witnesses intended to be produced in support of the plaint, the names and addresses of the witnesses and brief summary of the facts to which they would depose. Likewise, Order VI-Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure-1908 provides that every pleading shall contain, and contain only; a statement in a concise form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved, and shall when necessary, be divided into paragraphs, numbered consecutively.  

Somehow, it is becoming more common that the disputants in such matter and their pleaders are going beyond the material facts and deviating from the real disputes on the basis of which the parties do want to rest their claim(s) and they want to seek relief or deny it on the other hand. It is a principle of law that in pleadings each and every detail is not required to be mentioned. It is evidence which proves the pleadings. Mere mentioning of material facts in the pleadings is sufficient regarding which the parties are required to produce their evidence at the trial stage.

It is observed that the Family Court Act being the special law requires firm adherence, otherwise the essence and effectiveness of the law will be frustrated. The learned Family / Guardian Courts, therefore, are required to actively curb the undesireable delays instead of becoming silent spectators and permitting the parties or their pleader to frustrate very purpose of special enactment(s).
