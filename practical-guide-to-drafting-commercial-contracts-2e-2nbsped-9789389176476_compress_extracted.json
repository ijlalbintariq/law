  "Foreword to the Second Edition  “The heights of great men reached and kept, were not attained by sudden flight, but they, whilst their companions slept, were toiling upward in the night”.  These words of the American poet Henry Longfellow very aptly apply to Bhumesh Verma. For Bhumesh, with his busy legal practice, to have published 400 articles and written the book you are now holding, he no doubt will have toiled into the night to share his knowledge and experience. When I started my law firm in London in the early eighties, our principal work was handling maritime arbitration disputes. In those days, shipbrokers met daily at the Baltic Exchange to agree charter party contracts orally for their principals, who were vessel owners or charterers. They operated on the Baltic Exchange’s principle that “ my word is my bond ”. Subsequently, if a dispute arose as to the meaning or true construction of a term in the charter party contract, the parties would ask the shipbrokers to submit the point to a senior shipbroker at the Baltic Exchange to give his decision, which would be honoured. But the world economy has now changed, and with that change has also come a new breed of both businessmen and lawyers all over the world ready to exploit a contractual ambiguity to obtain a commercially advantageous outcome. This modern approach ignores the maxim “ Law is for justice and not justice for law ”, a principle which was historically applicable particularly to commercial cases. As a result, disputes arising from commercial contracts today can be long drawn out and expensive undertakings, whether the parties seek to resolve them before a court or by arbitration. As Bhumesh rightly points out in his preface, in the modern connected world the lay client now has plenty, if not perhaps too much, information freely available on the internet to download, ‘cut and paste’, edit or draft a commercial contract. However, this can be no substitute for the application of the experienced drafter’s skill and expertise. A slip of the pen, or even a missing or misplaced comma, can cost a party very dearly indeed. These times therefore call more than ever for a book like the one Bhumesh has written, to guide those who draft contracts, and the parties who agree to them, how best to achieve validly enforceable contracts that will be performed according to the parties’ mutual intention. It is easy to lose sight of the many considerations that go into making a valid contract, quite apart from the basic terms. There are, of course, essential requirements for an enforceable contract such as offer and acceptance, consent, consideration, and the like. Even the most carefully drafted bargain can be undone through inattention to those details. An example of how a contract can be rendered ineffective is the case of  PEC Limited   v   Asia Golden Rice Company Limited   [2014] EWHC 1583 (Comm). In this case PEC, a Delhi based Indian Government company, had entered into a contract with a Thai company, Asia Golden Rice. The contract which was signed on",
  "Indian soil provided for disputes to be settled by a Grain and Feed Trade Association (GAFTA) arbitration Tribunal in London, with English law to apply. Asia Golden had a substantial claim against PEC which it referred to the GAFTA arbitration Tribunal. Under GAFTA Rules, lawyers are not permitted to appear for a party. After hearing both parties’ submissions, the GAFTA Tribunal both in the first instance and then before the GAFTA appeal board decided the Claim in favour of Asia Golden. PEC successfully challenged the validity of the award in the English Court on the ground that the underlying sale of goods contract was invalid and non-existent because, as an Indian Government company, the requisite requirements of the rules had not been complied with, and PEC had therefore neither entered into the contract, nor made a valid arbitration agreement related to it. From the perspective of a commercial litigator, it is easy to appreciate the importance of the work that goes into drafting a contract. In the common law, when contract disputes throw up ambiguities and rival interpretations, the court seeks to determine the objective meaning of the language that the parties have used to express their agreement. As Lord Hodge explained in his judgment in the House of Lords in   Wood  v   Capita Insurance Services Ltd   [2017] UKSC 24, the approach is not purely textual: “ ... the court must consider the contract as a whole and, depending on the nature, formality and quality of drafting of the contract, give more or less weight to elements of the wider context in reaching its view as to that objective meaning .” On the shoulders of the drafter rests the burden of fairly recording what the parties have agreed. In some instances, this may be complicated by the fact that the parties will have arrived at a particular contract term only through negotiation and compromise, resulting in a term that may not fully suit either of them. Successive drafts may have passed backwards and forwards with additions and deletions. However, ultimately the contract drafter’s duty remains the same, whether the contract has been freely negotiated from scratch, or is an adaptation of a template, an industry standard form, or forms part of a complex suite of agreements in a large multi-jurisdictional or multi-party transaction. As the law reports bear witness, even the most sophisticated contracts are not immune from disputes. The more care and attention that is paid to the drafting process, the greater the prospect of an easy resolution to subsequent differences of interpretation. Bhumesh’s new book on contract drafting skill explains in a very lucid manner the essential skills which need to be adopted to draft a commercial contract. It would be a good essential guide not only for in-house counsel and transactional lawyers, but also for commercial businessmen. I can confidently say that anyone who deals with contracts in any capacity will benefit from the practical guidance compendiously included in this book.

  "Foreword to the Second Edition  “— Hey, wait, wait. What does this say here, this thing here? — Oh, that? Oh, that’s the usual clause that’s in every contract. That just says, uh, it says, if any of the parties participating in this contract are shown not to be in their right mind, the entire agreement is automatically nullified. — Well, I don’t know... — It’s all right. That’s in every contract. That’s what they call a sanity clause. — Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! You can’t fool me. There ain’t no Sanity Clause!”  (dialogue from “A Night at the Opera”, 1935, a Marx Brothers’ film, directed by Sam Wood). Oftentimes, over the course of my career as a commercial lawyer, it occurred to me that I could use a “sanity clause”. Inconsequential provisions, grammatical errors, obscure recitals, legal and logical loopholes. And - when it comes to international contracts - poor or even extravagant translations into another language, of concepts privy to a specific legal tradition. As a civil lawyer, I can resort to the Civil Code’s safety net, to cover for forgetfulness or fill out inadvertent gaps, and simplify the document’s structure. Or, at least, I can do so in purely domestic deals. But in international transactions - where the use of English as a “service” language is almost mandatory - you also need to adopt an adequate drafting style, which is customary to common law lawyers, and hence switch from a “synthetic” to an “analytic” mode. The agreement needs to provide in detail for all possible occurrences of the relationship that it is predicated to govern. From its birth, throughout its life and up to its death. The drafter must, therefore, obey an overarching requirement for comprehensiveness, while not foregoing clarity. Alas, drafting is hardly a scholastic subject. Law schools and academic treatises focus on the teaching of important, yet mainly theoretical aspects, drawing from scholarly interpretations and judicial precedents. Equally important fundamentals of the practice of law are often neglected and left to professional experience. Mastering the techniques of good legal writing, and especially so, contract writing, is an invaluable instrument of a lawyer’s toolbox. Practical experience is king, but a didactic framework can only improve the outcome, and, ideally, spare self-taught mannerisms and mistakes.",
  "And here comes the importance of works such as Bhumesh’s volume, which brings order into chaos, and provides a fundamental pilot book to those who adventure into the sea of contract drafting. So, rather than a “sanity clause”, Bhumesh’s “Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts” is a prophylaxis for sanity, one that every commercial lawyer should strictly adhere to, for the benefit of his clients and for the sake of the legal profession.

  "Praise for the Book  “Bhumesh Verma’s   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   is indeed a brilliant piece of work to understand the basics of drafting. The book provides a bird’s eye view of the wide range of prerequisites and trends in drafting of commercial contracts; encompassing both the traditional as well as the nascent issues in the field. This book comes at an opportune time and provides the reader the much-needed comprehensive understanding in regard to the drafting skills. My good wishes for his current work and upcoming projects.”  Prof. (Dr) Vivek Khare Registrar & Dean, Jagran Lakecity University  “This wonderful outline on drafting of the commercial contracts written by Bhumesh is a supreme work in its class. A book that showcases and covers all the minute details and has been written in a format well suited to all the audiences ranging from students to the professionals. This book surely is a must prescribed work for the new entrants in the legal field. The book has covered all the basic concepts and has clarified the concept in a very simple yet exhaustive manner. I wish Mr. Verma all the best in his endeavour and pretty sure that this book is going to be a huge success and will receive wide accolades across the legal and financial platforms.”  Prof. (Dr) Mona Purohit Head of the Department, Department of Legal Studies & Research Barkatullah University  “This excellent book by Bhumesh covers nearly all aspects of drafting commercial agreements - everything from spell check and grammar check to page numbering and headings, to more technical matters about dispute resolution and limitation of liability.”  Nick Gould Partner, Gunnercooke LLP, London  “Drafting is an art and that every artist has her own way of doing it. This book gives law students and practitioners the tools to make their drafting an actual piece of art. The world has changed and written agreements are part of everybody’s life. This book is written in a very simple and plain language that makes a pleasure reading it and it could have been written only by an experienced practitioner like Bhumesh. I recommend every lawyer (whether experienced or not) to read this book which gives suggestions and tips also to the most experienced practitioners. Example clauses are extremely useful and helpful to draft an agreement in plain and simple words.”  Giuseppe Broccoli Partner, Mora & Associati Studio Legale, Milan",
  "“Bhumesh Verma’s book on Drafting Commercial Agreements is a little gem. In simple language, his book teaches you the nuances of drafting agreements. This book will help you master the “craft of the draft”. I recommend this book to all involved with drafting, vetting or litigating contracts.”  Hasit Seth Counsel, High Court of Bombay  “In today’s world, every commercial transaction needs to be backed by an agreement. This book teaches valuable fundamentals to enable you to independently draft and negotiate agreements of all complexity. It is certainly a precious possession in the hands of students and young professionals. Highly recommended for law, finance and management professionals.”  Dinesh Jotwani Co Managing Partner, Jotwani Associates  Praise for the Book  x",
  "Preface to the Second Edition  The primary objective of this book is to make the reader (you) understand what is drafting, why is it needed in today’s business world and what are the basic points to be kept in mind while drafting a commercial agreement. You may or may not be a lawyer. However, today even non-lawyers (who could be senior officials in corporate houses) have to negotiate, peruse or review commercial agreements. This book is written with the perspective of its usefulness for lawyers as well as non-lawyers. Therefore, you would find very few references to legal provisions. For lawyers, this book attempts to supplement the theoretical knowledge attained in law colleges with practical knowledge of the author. The book does not intend to provide legal opinion on any issue, just practical guidance for drafting. Therefore, nothing in the book should be read as legal opinion. Specific legal advice should be sought on an issue, whenever in doubt. Although the book features some sample clauses and agreements, every draft is far from perfect. Examples are just, you know, examples. You have to modify it to suit the circumstances of the assignment in hand and draft as per the guidelines provided in the book. The first edition of this book received amazing response from academicians, students and professionals alike from India and abroad. This book now adorns most of the premier law and management institutes in India and even abroad. I have also been inundated with numerous requests from educational institutions, corporates and professional organisations to conduct workshops on the subject. Even the National Productivity Council (Govt. of India) has invited us to provide practical training on the subject to students and professionals to enhance their productivity. I wish to thank the fraternity for their response and suggestions for the second edition of the book. Based on these suggestions, we have added new chapters on Damages, E-contracts, Negotiation and Intellectual Property Rights. Special thanks to my research team - Baswanth Mohan and Shayonee Dasgupta in particular. Many young entrepreneurs from online legal education platforms in India have provided good suggestions for the book, be it, Ashwin Madhavan, Abhyuday Aggarwal, Tanuj Kalia or Ramanuj Mukherjee. Some of my best friends and contemporary legends of corporate practice have been kind enough to write the Foreword to this book - Sarosh Zaiwalla and Giampaolo Salsi, for this edition, and Anand Desai, for the first edition of the book. I would like to share that I have always interacted with Anand on the opposite side of corporate transactions and negotiating contracts, but we share immense mutual",
  "respect. Review comments received from friends have been published on the back cover - their inputs are no less important. I also thank Massimo Zamorani, Nick Gould and Giuseppe Broccoli for being encouraging and supportive of my writing endeavours through the years. The list is endless, actually, I could go on ... Vikesh Dhyani, Shreesh Chandra and Priyanka Srivastava from Oakbridge team deserve kudos for their continuous engagement and support in bringing out this reader friendly book. Priyanka in particular has been chasing me for the last 6 months, coming up with new ideas and suggestions every now and then. No goal is achievable without family support. My family has been very encouraging in all my efforts, be it practice, writing, workshops and so on; always allowing me time and space to pursue some of my passions, even if it were to reduce family time sometimes. Love you all - parents, Alka, Harshita and Parth. Happy reading!  Bhumesh Verma  New Delhi  Preface to the Second Edition  xii",
  "Foreword to the First Edition  The pen is mightier than the sword... confusion in an agreement can be confounding... and result in unforeseeable consequences... surely that cannot be the intent while drafting a commercial agreement! Legal drafting is an art, and not a mere skill. Effective legal drafting entails understanding how the transaction will actually work, familiarity with applicable laws and their implications on the transaction and the commercial agreements, knowledge and command over language, application of common sense, and the ability to concisely articulate these in a document, or a set of documents. Ideally, the draftsman should also be able to take into account how the applicable laws have evolved, and may continue to evolve during the life of the commercial arrangements. Agreements must reflect the intent of the parties as clearly as possible, including the implications of delay in performance or non-performance by any party to the transaction. They must also reflect the possibility and consequences of any change in law or circumstances beyond the control of the parties to the transaction. Thus, commercial agreements need to be drafted in a disciplined manner, and care needs to be taken that repetitive or contradictory provisions are avoided. The draft should be as precise, and comprehensive, as the draftsman can make it. In the course of negotiation, the implications of any change in any part of the agreement must be thought through, and any other provision of the agreement that needs to be correspondingly changed must also be addressed. Agreements should also provide for the consequential rights and responsibilities of parties if the contractual relationship breaks down or when the contractual term expires. With the advent of computers, the tendency to “ cut copy paste ” clauses without examining their applicability and effect upon the agreement has become too common. Using precedents from a time prior to changes in law and regulation is again something one sees too often. An example in documentation and structuring an FDI transaction could be that the draftsman is not aware that optionally convertible debt instruments, or securities issued with a fixed return assured to the non-resident subscriber by a resident of India are currently not permitted. Contradictory provisions in an agreement or in a set of agreements that comprise the “transaction” have resulted in much litigation and case law, delay in performance, pain and expense for the parties. For example, using the word “ notwithstanding any other provision ” would mean that the clause containing such expression would override other provisions in the agreement.",
  "Provisions such as “ good faith ” and those which are popularly known as “ boilerplate clauses ” also need to be appropriately drafted and not forgotten about, since usually these are only discussed and finalised at the end of protracted negotiations. These are largely legal matters, and clients are unlikely to provide much input on these. That increases the responsibility of the lawyer while drafting these provisions. Finally, a good draftsman is one who is able to anticipate how an agreement is likely to be interpreted by a Court, and try and ensure that the Court will decide as per the clear intent of the parties which must be easily found in the agreement. Bhumesh has captured the essential requirements for drafting a commercial agreement in a lucid and reader-friendly style. Applying his extensive experience, he has covered a wide range of relevant aspects that go into making an effective agreement. I am sure readers will find this book very interesting and useful.

  "Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts  PART 1  WHAT",
  "CHAPTER 1  DRAFTING—THE DESIRED TRAITS OF A DRAFTSMAN  “To me, a lawyer is basically the person that knows the rules of the country. We’re all throwing the dice, playing the game, moving our pieces around the board, but if there is a problem the lawyer is the only person who has read the inside of the top of the box.”  —Jerry Seinfeld  Part 1—What Chapter 1 To put it in simple words, drafting skill is one’s ability to express one’s thought process in writing. No other profession in the world probably demands this ability more than the legal profession. A good lawyer is one who can express his client’s case most effectively by way of spoken or written words. Legal knowledge and acumen to translate that knowledge into words are a lawyer’s greatest assets. Metaphorically speaking, every case or a transaction is like a new canvas for a lawyer. A lawyer is supposed to paint his client’s case on the canvas. The painter must be clear in his thoughts, artistic and the meaning of the painting must be conveyed to those who see it. On a practical note, the language and tone of every commercial agreement must be clear and unambiguous. As a draftsman, one should bear in mind that an agreement is never drafted for the academic pleasure of its author. An agreement is a living thing (almost)—it has to live and face the scrutiny of several interested parties (the   client,   other   party,   other   party’s   lawyers,   adjudicating   authorities,   etc.). Therefore, it has to be carefully crafted so as to protect your client’s interest to the utmost, be legally compliant and legible to all who come across the document. A lawyer must choose his words relating to his work with great care, be it drafting a legal document, simply writing a response to an inquiry, sending a legal notice or anything else. A lawyer must write in a clear and concise manner. A lawyer has to be an excellent wordsmith and storyteller. My friend, Avinash Ganatra, a seasoned lawyer in New York, sums it up very well—“Every word should deserve its place in your sentence.” Not a word more, not a word less. If a lawyer’s writing is loose, incorrect, ambiguous or vague, it can lead to multiple interpretations, which is a kind of self-goal for his client. I remember a petition ending with “The Petitioner undertakes to avoid any orders issued by this Hon’ble Court.” “Avoid” was used instead of “abide by”!",
  "4   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  The difference for the client due to such an error could be as drastic as jail or bail. Writing skills play a major role in the drafting of commercial agreements— negotiating skills are no less important but if you can articulate and draft well, it leaves little scope for the other party to come up with any objections or anything to counter your position. Nothing should be taken lightly as the contents of an agreement are legally binding between the parties. Apart from the significant monetary aspect, commercial agreements may even affect the business and reputation of the parties. For these and other cogent reasons, people prefer to engage experienced lawyers to draft high stake agreements. A lot of time, money and energy goes into negotiating and then drafting or the other way round. Therefore, a draftsman carries a big burden of work as well as expectations from the client. However, drafting a document is not only about precise and correct language or formatting and sequencing skills. A draftsman also needs,   inter alia : (i) Legal knowledge; (ii) Knowledge about the client; (iii) Knowledge about the client’s business; (iv) Client’s expectations from the proposed transaction; (v) Business acumen; (vi) Analytical skills; (vii) Eye for details; (viii) Ability to read between the lines; (ix) Improvisation skills; (x) Reasonableness; (xi) Ability to put himself in any party’s shoes and think accordingly; and (xii) Foresightedness. In legal language, we can say, the above list is only indicative and not exhaustive! Rome was not built in a day. Drafting is something which can be learnt, cultivated and improved with practice. Like sportspersons or other artisans, your drafting skills can also improve with time and experience. Once   you   have   experience   of   drafting   or   negotiating   different   kinds   of transactions, you can avoid a lot of undesirable flaws / lacunae at the drafting stage itself   and   create   a   mutually   acceptable   and   beneficial   agreement.   However, experience takes time. Till then, keep working on it. Someone has said for lawyers: “You win some and you lose some, but you get paid for all of them.” However, it is not moneymaking alone that makes a lawyer successful, reputation is as important.",
  "PART 2  WHY  Part 2—Why",
  "CHAPTER 1  BENEFITS OF WRITTEN AGREEMENTS  Chapter 1  “A lawyer is a person who writes a 10,000-word document and calls it a “brief.”  —Franz Kafka  Before getting into the drafting mode, one needs to understand the need of such an exercise. A small legal angle here - all contracts are agreements but not all agreements are contracts. An offer from a party which is accepted by the other party is an agreement. However, when such an agreement is in accordance with law (and not opposed to public policy and couple of other legal considerations), it becomes a contract. Throughout this book, we shall use the word “agreement” instead of a contract because we assume that the parties entering into a commercial agreement intend to be legally bound by it. We confine our discussion to legally enforceable agreements ( i.e. , contracts) only. All of us would have read in text books about the good old times. Many would have learnt from their elders about the good value system then.We learn that there used to be a time when people and their lives were very simple. Things (all or most of them) didn’t have a price tag on them. Since there was no fixed price for anything, there was no money to be paid or exchanged. There was barter system— people used to exchange their respective goods and services. Apart from the barter system, people were mostly honest and innocent. It goes to the extent that it is said (metaphorically, I suppose) that the Indian society was so just and fair that even a lion and a goat could have water from the same pool. People were not scared or apprehensive of each other generally, nor were there any apprehensions of being cheated or taken advantage of. People did not lock their drawers, almirahs and doors, as there were not many tangible assets, nor thieves. Sounds far- fetched? Well, I can vouch for some of it. We were not used to locking the outermost door of our house in my New Delhi locality till about 40 years back. A mere latch would suffice as nothing untoward happened. Similarly, in business circles, there was a time when business deals could be struck with a simple handshake or over a cup of coffee or a mug of beer (depending on the choice of beverage and the time or setting of the meeting). One used to get what one was promised.",
  "8   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  ‘A gentleman’s promise’ was an oft-quoted cliché. One was not sold counterfeit goods. One would honour one’s word—even if it was cumbersome, financially or otherwise. Indian scriptures are full of incidents wherein the hero (including Gods) would undergo innumerable hardships but never ever budge on a promise. “Raghukul reeti sada chali aayi ...”, remember? However, all good things come to an end at some point of time. The world is not the same world any more,neither socially nor business-wise. There is an ever-rising risk in the society and in business deals. Now people lock their drawers, almirahs, doors, laptops, mobile phones, vehicles, all valuables, install security cameras at their homes, near their cars, etc. Security, privacy,   lack   of   commitment   or   fairness   :   apprehensions   galore.   Even   the government and police who are responsible for public safety and security, ask us to be safe by adopting these measures. Therefore, one cannot depend entirely on the government or the police to secure / defend us nor on the goodness of the people one is doing business with. Business deals are now being documented by and large. Why? The reasons are too many, actually. Times change, memories fade, rules of the game change, people change, people lie; all sorts of reasonsare there. Unless you document an understanding between two or more parties, it’s your word vs my word, if there is a dispute. Whom should the people or the court believe, if approached in such a case to mediate or adjudicate? The first thing a lawyer asks a potential litigant is, “Do you have anything in writing?” But why do disputes arise in the first place? Let us examine few reasons. People change. The change has two dimensions—change of people or change in people. Change of people. Professionals working on a commercial relationship change with lapse of time. A professional’s average tenure with an employer has come to about 3-5 years at the most. Their successors do not know nor bother to understand what was the original understanding or reason behind it or whether there was an understanding at all and so on. They do not know what bargaining chips were used and why a seemingly unfair deal to their organisation was entered into. They go only by   what   is   apparent   to   them   and   don’t   care   about   past   commitments   and understandings. Sometimes, the party which is at receiving end of such treatment feels cheated and disputes ensue.",
  "Chapter 1]   Part 2—Why   9  Change in people. Even if same people continue to work on an assignment and project, over a long period, their nature, mindset, pressure from within their own organisation or new owners, or other internal and external circumstances may change expectations and requirements from the other party. This may disturb the equilibrium between the parties, which may have been a result of lengthy discussions and negotiations. Times change. Changes in the society cause people’s behaviour to change. Sometimes, people stop caring about their reputation or commitments, become short-sighted and immediate monetary or material benefit is more attractive. If there is a likelihood of making a kill in one deal by ditching an old collaborator, many would not care about the prospect of losing out on a time-tested, reliable, reasonably remunerative arrangement. Law changes—what was legal yesterday may not be legal any more. New laws are enacted, ordinances are issued, old laws are getting amended and repealed more than ever before. So the business model or economic understanding between the parties may not be in accordance with new laws. Economic scenarios, costs and benefits also change. Memory fades. What was mutually agreed between the original parties may not be remembered or understood by their respective successors, assignees, transferees, etc.   Successive   generations   tend   to   be   more   practical,   business-minded   and materialistic. As and when the old guard passes into oblivion, the new generation recalibrates its working style, business modeland restructures lots of things. Relationships change. Relationships between individuals, companies, groups, States, countries, regional blocks change over time. Therefore, no relationship can be eternal. There are commercial and political reasons behind change in parties’ stand on various issues. To top it all, the promoters or stakeholders, while negotiating a deal, may not know, understand or care for the implications, nitty gritty, sequence and timing of their business deal. They are only interested in striking a deal on a macro level. If there are 50 fundamental issues that need to be discussed and taken care of in respect of a deal, the promoters may not have the knowledge or time to discuss, let alone finalise even 10% of them. Often, over a cup of coffee, they discuss the business scenario and the proposed deal in its barest shell form, shake hands and say, “we have a deal on our hands”. Thereafter, all the legwork, detailed negotiations and finalisation of agreements is left to their colleagues and / or consultants. While they only agree to enter into an agreement with a handshake, the real burden is on their professional teams! Mostly, the parties to a business deal engage lawyers and / or accountants to help them out with due diligence, negotiation from a micro standpoint, drafting and finalising a deal. It is the job of the professionals to discuss and finalise the finer details of the deal and flag any unfavourable issues and bring them to the notice of their clients.",
  "10   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  Since the professionals examine the many aspects of a deal from sensivity, commercial and legal enforceability angles, they may take time to mull over their clients’ interests, so the professionals are sometimes seen as obstructionists to a deal. However, they are the facilitators. Interestingly, sometimes there is more intense discussion and bargaining on the professional’s fees than on the business deal. For an example, the marketing people in any company are driven by their periodic targets and want the deal they are after to be clinched at the earliest. The accounting / legal / compliance teams (if there are any within the company or outside consultants engaged for this purpose) query them on the various aspects of the deal. The marketing team complains of other teams’ obstructionist nature and blames them for losing out on time or sometimes for losing out on the deal itself. The point which the marketing team is missing here is that it is better to have no deal than having a deal which has the potential of causing considerable financial or reputational damage to the company. The professional advisers have to take a holistic view keeping in mind the compliance, legalities, risk assessment and other such factors. Indeed, if the parties draft and discuss a commercial agreement with the help of professionals, they are bound to take longer to close their discussion and get on with the   proposed   business.   However,   while   negotiating   an   agreement,   they   will understand the same thing in the same spirit, which may be missing in a simple handshake   or   moving   ahead   with   a   transaction   without   contemplating   the pitfalls involved. So, how does a written agreement help? Although an agreement does not necessarily have to be in writing, oral contracts are very difficult to enforce because there is no clear evidence of the respective understanding of the parties, the offer, acceptance, consideration and so on. Whose version of understanding or events should the adjudicating authorities believe in such cases:it becomes ‘his words against mine’. The idea underlying a written document is to strike a balance between different parties’ rights and obligations and to ensure an efficient enforcement thereof, if need be, before an appropriate redressal forum. This reduces the scope for gaps in each party’s respective understanding on the important issues that are not contemplated or discussed in a simple handshake or broad discussions. The professionals review every deal from a micro level and their inputs also bring in certain new elements for discussion, which the parties even in their wildest imagination, may not have bothered about or contemplated. Besides having a document to support one’s claim during litigation, there are many other reasons to have a written contract. A written contract ensures that all of the terms of the agreement are documented. If a disagreement arises, then there will be a document that the parties can refer to in order to get their contractual relationship back on track. In short, a solid written contract can save money and strengthen a business relationship by avoiding litigation altogether.",
  "Chapter 1]   Part 2—Why   11  For a contract to serve the above-mentioned purposes, it must contain sufficient details covering all possible points of dispute which may arise at a later stage. For example, the respective rights and obligations of each party should be clearly demarcated, leaving no scope for ambiguity or diverse interpretations. Similarly, details such as the timelines for parties’ performance, terms and timing of payments under the contemplated transaction, termination or remedial rights, rights of the non-defaulting parties upon default by the other party, etc, should also be clearly stipulated. Incorporating detailed, clear and specific terms in an agreement serves two purposes— firstly, they help guide performance and secondly, they limit ambiguity in the event of a dispute. In fact, whether a deal which can be documented is reached can be ascertained during the negotiations itself.. The questions that oral contracts often leave unanswered may sometimes result in a situation, wherein the parties   begin   performance   under   an   “agreement”   and   after   having   spent   a considerable amount of time and resources, discover that there exist major areas of disagreement between them. Negotiation over the terms of the contract would have unearthed these issues in time without wastage of resources. In other words “the devil is in the details”. Some agreements involve multiple parties and complex relationships among them. Owing to the presence of many parties in the agreement and competition in the market, each party is under immense pressure to extract maximum value and at the same time provide most services for least consideration. In such circumstances, it is very important that each party understands its respective role and responsibilities under the agreement. The primary function of a contract is to record these understandings. The negotiation and drafting process involves discussion on the scope of the goods / services to be delivered under an agreement, compensation, schedule and terms and conditions whereunder the parties would operate and this requires the parties to communicate their respective views on such issues. It is important for each party to understand the other parties’ intentions and motives. The process of contract drafting and negotiation provides an opportunity to assess the other parties and to decide if it is worthwhile to work with them. Sometimes, the true colours of a party are out during negotiations itself. The process affords each party a chance to assess whether other parties are reasonable, business- like, experienced and honest. The parties should exercise due diligence in selecting their business partners; this is the best way to prevent loss. Better understandings promote a better relationship. Many potential commercial relationships break down during the course of negotiations itself, as the most critical issues, deal breakers or roadblocks are identified during this process. It is aptly said that if you cannot survive negotiations, your business relationship isn’t likely to sustain the pressures of working together. The earlier such a relationship terminates, the better it is.",
  "12   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  The parties can set rules and regulations to suit and govern their relationship under the agreement. In the absence of any written rules in this regard, in the event of any dispute between them either party can seek court intervention through litigation. However, parties cannot stipulate anything in the agreement that is illegal or against public policy. Contact drafting process also provides an opportunity to the parties to discuss the risk involved in the contemplated transaction. Well-informed parties are more likely to arrive at a reasonable allocation of liabilities among themselves. Sometimes, parties continue to engage with each   other on the basis of a handshake. Some service providers hesitate in insisting on a written contract with a good or sizeable client for the fear of losing them. They feel that asking for a contract will offend the client and undermine their long-standing relationship. On the contrary, parties with good and old relations should not shy away from taking steps to safeguard their own interests and also defining the rights and duties of all parties. In the event differences or disputes arise between the parties it is much easier to just refer to the document, locate the remedy and resolve the matter simply, expeditiously and professionally, without any hassle or cost of litigation. A party without a written agreement in hand and relying only on a handshake is at risk. In such a case, the party is left with little choice but to depend on the memory, sincerity, honesty and integrity of its counterparties. Some parties execute written agreements only when the stakes are high. They would rather avoid the cost in respect of relatively smaller transactions or projects where the return is small. However, the cost and effort involved in a written agreement may be very small compared to the liability that may arise if it is taking more than it can handle commercially (for example a prospect of unlimited liability), and something goes wrong under the informal arrangement. It is the party’s reputation which is at stake and there is a huge risk which it is undertakes in the absence of a written agreement. Frequently, we come to know of disputes between co-promoters of companies and startups. Many ventures start small, mostly among friends or family members, who do not feel the need to execute a formal arrangement or agreement. In fact, in the initial stages of their venture, even a suggestion to formalise their relationship sounds quite offensive to them. This is simply due to the reason that they cannot fathom how big (or ugly) things can get if not taken into account from the initial stage. With one big order or one big client or one big funding round, the whole scenario can change overnight beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. Disagreements or power struggles may emerge and if the business is doing well everyone wants his pound of flesh (or more) but when the business is goes down then everyone wants to disown it. Every day, we come across close friends or siblings or even parents / children fighting ugly courtroom battles, sometimes despite having agreements. The plight of those without formal written agreements isn’t hard to imagine in similar situations. A negotiated and well-crafted agreement may come to the rescue of parties in such events.",
  "Chapter 1]   Part 2—Why   13  To make the enforceability stronger and to avoid ambiguity, many statutes make it mandatory for an agreement to be in writing. However, even if not legally required, the parties are well advised to execute all commercial agreements in writing. A good corporate house makes it a matter of practice to enter into well drafted written agreements with all parties it wants to do business with, be it customers, vendors, sub-contractors and so on. Drafting   and   negotiating   alone   do   not   make   a   contract   enforceable.   It   is important to engage a person who is well versed with this craft so that a balanced draft is in place and no party has a feeling of having given up its fair share of the deal.   All   parties   should   come   out   happy   after   negotiating   and   executing   an agreement. All in all, shaking hands in agreement is good, but not enough. However, shaking hands and announcing, ‘We have a deal’ should be supplemented by ‘Get it in writing’.",

  "CHAPTER 1  AVENUES FOR LEARNING DRAFTING SKILLS IN INDIA  “The minute you read something that you can’t understand, you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer.”  —Will Rogers Chapter 1 Mostly, only academic and theoretical knowledge is imparted at Indian law colleges. Students are left to fend for themselves as far as practical skills are concerned and are expected to learn drafting and other practical skills on the job itself. Many, or should I say most, law colleges in India still do not have a specific module / credit / paper for teaching drafting skills. My discussions with today’s faculty and students indicate that the situation has not improved during the last 3 decades and may last a few more! Students who are lucky and get internship with good litigation or corporate professionals learn basic drafting skills during internships. Some students learn these skills from their parents or close relatives who are lawyers. However, students who are first generation lawyers or those who do not get such internship opportunity, have to learn it on the job only. It is like a chicken and egg story. You do not possess a skill; you do not get your desired job. If you get a job but not the skills to fulfil your employer’s / client’s expectations, you cannot succeed. In India, till about mid - 1990s, before the telecom and internet revolutions, there were not many computers in Indian law offices. Drafting took place by means of handwritten notes or shorthand dictation. All law offices had steno / secretaries. Even the stand-alone typists outside every court premises used to have fair amount of court pleadings and agreements. So, how the whole process worked was - stenos / junior lawyers would first take dictation from the senior partner and then type it (in case of stenos) or get it typewritten by typists in the court premises / office. The draft was then proof-read, re-read and re-typed several times. The corrections / mark-ups took place on actual paper copies. Several rounds of reading of such drafts used to result in considerable on-the-job legal education as well as development of drafting skills for law trainees and freshly qualified lawyers. They learnt virtually everything from their seniors’ drafts— applications, complaints, pleadings, agreements and so on.",
  "18   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  Even while recycling the used papers for printing or working on the other side, sometimes you came across interesting drafting (sometime unrelated to your present work) on the earlier used side. It used to be so much fun to learn from these nuggets of wisdom. Once an agreement was executed, a copy thereof was kept in the office as a treasure to be taken out as and when there was a need to draft a new agreement on same / similar lines. The whole agreement was re-written / typewritten again with changing the names, particulars and some conditions of the agreement. This process was indeed very tiring, taxing and cumbersome. The worst part was, if there was no precedent readily available, one would need to refer to a drafting book and / or dictate a new agreement afresh. This system used to workwell. Almost every young lawyer of that era learnt basic drafting skills the hard way, on the job and the clients could easily distinguish good lawyers from the average ones. Then, in late 1990s came the telecom revolution in India. As with many other professions, access to computers, internet, database and precedents came as a boon. Lawyers lapped up the new facilities and information flow —be it litigation lawyers or those on the corporate advisory side. A lawyer’s life became simple, when it came to drafting. The need to work on anything from scratch or reinvent the wheel diminished drastically. Bit by bit. It started with one computer in each lawyer’s office. First few petitions, documents and agreements needed to be typed down. Thereafter, one would copy the text of an older document to work on new documents. Floppy disks were used to copy data from one computer to another. It gradually increased to one computer for each professional in the office and then extended even to secretarial and support staff. And, as they say, the rest is history. The legal world and drafting process was never the same again. Somewhere in the world, someone or the other must have worked on a draft of a document similar to the one you are supposed to draft. Using search engine or database you could find such a draft agreement and start working on it. A good percentage of Indian lawyers are now getting education at foreign law colleges, interning or working with foreign law firms and thus have access to the drafting techniques used worldwide. Further, Indian lawyers and law firms have also learnt from their interaction with foreign law firms on international transactions. One also has access to the work which office colleagues have already done. So, if a precedent is available within your office, you could go ahead and start filling in. Else, one could s ask friends working in other offices or firms for a draft..",
  "Chapter 1]   Part 3—Where   19  Today the norm (rather than exceptions) is - just pick up any draft from anywhere, cut and paste, substitute the dates, place, parties’ names and particulars, and one thinks the job is done. One believes it to be good because it is quick, easily accessible and supposedly reliable. Since the draft has already been executed (with no idea, how and where), it’s efficacy or enforceability is unfortunately not doubted or questioned. There have been instances where I have had colleagues quoting legal position as per foreign laws on a query pertaining to Indian law, or coming up with multiple definitions   of   the   same   person/party   within   one   agreement,   or   with   various definitions in a draft which are not used anywhere in the agreement, or non-existent annexures or exhibits quoted here and there. The list of such errors is very long and the reason is that these errors are a result of “cut and paste” jobs. Therefore, it is necessary to draft each agreement with careful application of mind. Each older generation is heard saying that their generation was better than the new generation. I am not too old as of now - at least I think so, being in the middle of my active practicing career. However, even I feel the process of learning drafting skills was much better in earlier years than today. In earlier times, seniors in the office sometimes actually had the time and inclination to talk to the juniors and impart some drafting skills on a one-to-one basis. Today, no one in the college or in your office has the time, energy or inclination to guide you and impart basic knowledge or skills. It is assumed that you have learnt that much in law college and internships that you are job ready and from day one you are expected to churn out agreements with the help of precedents, if any. Even firms which do not have any similar agreement in their own database expect you to draft on your own. On the other hand, your college thinks that having provided you enough academic knowledge, you should learn practical skills at your workplace. Practical skills, therefore, are nobody’s baby. Neither your college nor your office have the time and resources to teach you this elementary and one of the most important aspect of your professional skillset. I understand and acknowledge that with the advancement in technology and a considerable wealth of experience (in terms of precedents) readily available with us, we should not have to go back in time and start from scratch. We should use the existing precedents, databases and whatever other information and tools are available to us. However, all this should enable us to come out with a better product and not a poor cut-and-paste job. We must try to cut time and costs from all our professional endeavours, not cut corners. Quality of your work should actually get better because technology has made your job much easier and expeditious. You’ve got so much at the click of the mouse. With all this support at your disposal, your drafting should be world class. Technology and gadgets should be enablers and not part of the problem or the problem itself.",
  "20   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  However, experience of most professionals’ clients is to the contrary. They often complain of poor drafting standards due to oversight, poor cut-and-paste output and various other issues. Today’s students expect their institutions to ensure good internships, campus recruitment and generally make them more employable in highly competitive job market. Lack of good drafting skills seriously affects the employability and growth prospects of law students. Taking this aspect into consideration, lately some Indian educational institutions are waking up to the ground reality and taking drafting skills of their students seriously.   Some   of   them   have   started   to   collaborate   with   senior   practicing professionals and inviting them to impart fundamental practical knowledge to their students, make them aware of pitfalls and suggest practical measures to improve their drafting skills. Interaction with industry experts not only gives the students insights into drafting skills from a practical perspective but is useful from many other aspects as well. Another new phenomenon is online legal education. I consider it to be a boon for the   students   and   professionals   alike.   In   today’s   e-age,   you   can   learn   certain professional skills in addition to your regular law course in the privacy of your home or   hostel   at   any   convenient   time.   The   process   of   continued   legal   education (‘CLE’)—learning, unlearning and relearning should continue throughout one’s professional life, else you couldr become outdated. You may be interested in a particular course, particular institution or a particular coach. However, sometimes it may not be possible to pursue certain things due to lack of time, unsuitable timing, accessibility, finances and distance and many other reasons. In online education model, participants can even attend live classes at a distant place or institution or with their preferred faculty. The online education courses not only enhance your knowledge, but certificates and accreditations awarded thereunder also help you in demonstrating your skills before existing and prospective employers. Online courses may have some limitations for students who prefer live and on the spot interaction with the guide or coach so that any doubts are cleared straightaway in an interactive way. Technology may be an enabler or a supplement; however, I believe it cannot be a replacement for traditional classroom teaching in the near future. Though technological advancement is beginning to make remote interaction also possible now. All said and done, the proof lies in the taste of the pudding. There are too many fake institutions, universities, degrees, diplomas, certificates floating in the world. Therefore, it is not the number of qualifications and certificates (genuine or fake) that you accumulate, but the knowledge and skills you possess which is more important. The accumulation of credentials may help you temporarily in standing out in a crowd and getting an internship or a job. However, in the long run, your",

  "PART 4  BEFORE YOU DRAFT  Part 4—Before you Draft",
  "CHAPTER 1  NEGOTIATION  Chapter 1 Negotiation is one of the most important, yet sometimes ignored, aspects of drafting any agreement. The genesis of the word Negotiation seems to be the two Latin terms, “ negare otium ”, which literally translates into “to deny leisure”. In French and Spanish, deny leisure means “business”. In simple words, we may understand negotiation as communication between the parties with the intention to reach a mutually agreed common position. Negotiation may also be viewed as a dialogue between parties for resolution of disputes and bargain for individual or collective advantage. Examples include using negotiation techniques to resolve crisis such as hostage situations, barricading, kidnapping etc. Negotiation may also be resorted to for settling matters, as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism through Lok Adalats, etc. The need to find a common position in a contractual relationship occurs because of divergent expectations of the parties to a contract – most parties intend different outcomes   (extremely   different   at   times)   in   terms   of   consideration,   timelines, performance standards, and so on. By engaging in the negotiation process, they try to reach a commonly agreed position so that each party is satisfied. To this effect, we negotiate all the time in our lives. In fact, Indians take it to extreme points sometimes! We bargain with our vegetable vendor, in electronic showrooms, with banks (for reduced interest rates or waiving processing fee on loans), with prospective employers for better remuneration and working conditions and so on.  Importance of negotiation  Negotiation is an essential skill required to becoming a successful commercial lawyer. A lawyer with effective negotiation skills can turn around a loss into a beneficial compromise. One can overcome the challenges faced by your clients during a transaction by implementing appropriate negotiation skills, which includes a variety of other ancillary skills such as confidence, soft and hard skills, general knowledge, market research and ability to understand the position of the other party. The significance of negotiation skills cannot be exaggerated. Having said that, a draftsman should approach negotiation not as a competition, but as a compromise in which everyone leaves the table feeling happy, respected and satisfied.",
  "26   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  Elements of negotiation  Negotiation needs clarity of thought and presence of mind, at all times. While it is almost impossible to enumerate all the skills needed to be a good negotiator, the Harvard Negotiation project lists seven major elements of negotiation which are as follows:  Interests –   A skilled negotiator must be able to extract the common and individual   interests   out   of   any   fact-situation.   Understanding   the fundamental needs of the parties and prioritizing them is an important skill for a negotiator.  Legitimacy –   A negotiator cannot exploit the other parties involved in the process to benefit his or her client. A good negotiator follows a fair approach to address the concerns of all interested parties and in the process, obtains the best outcome for his client. The result should be driven by legitimate consensus and not by bulldozing the other party to accept the demands.  Relationships –   It is important to manage and maintain a healthy relationship with the opposite party, irrespective of it being a successful negotiation or not. No bridges should be broken ever.  BATNA –   BATNA is the abbreviated form of Best Alternative to a Negotiated   Agreement.   Before   negotiation   commences,   a   good negotiator must know his BATNA. This enables him or her to know when to walk away and when to stay. A skilled negotiator anticipates the situations where an alternative may be required to obtain consensus. Therefore, the ability to objectively think through BATNA helps a negotiator to carry on a transparent negotiation with all parties.  Options -   In a commercial transaction, each party involved has negotiable and non-negotiable demands. The job of the negotiator is to identify such demands, prioritize them in the order of importance. A good negotiator also needs to think of options or choices (at times out of the box solutions) that the parties should consider satisfying their demands.  Commitments –   This assumes significance at the concluding stage of the negotiation when the interested parties commit to observe and adhere to the result of the negotiation process. A negotiated position is reduced to writing through a contract.  Communication   – The art of communication determines the success of negotiation. A boisterous and rude lawyer cannot be a good negotiator. A confident and dexterous negotiator will communicate in a manner that makes the other party more comfortable. This means that the other party will be more willing to bend to the demands of the negotiator and ultimately lead to a win-win situation for all the parties.",
  "Chapter 1]   Part 4—Before you Draft   27  Possible outcomes of negotiation  The possible outcomes of negotiation are “win/win”, “win/lose”, and “lose/lose”. Any negotiation can result in any of these outcomes. The outcome also depends on the negotiation styles followed by the parties.  Win/Win Outcome  A win/win outcome occurs when both / all the parties arrive at a satisfactory result of the negotiation fulfilling   their   individual goals and expectations. Negotiations targeted towards this aspect lay greater emphasis on the development of a mutually beneficial agreement. A simplistic example would be awarding of a contract at a fair and reasonable price is in the best interest of both the contractor and the party awarding such contracts.  Win/Lose Outcome  A   win/lose   outcome   generally   occurs   when   one   party   is   perceived   as   faring significantly better at the expense of the other. Such outcomes are due to negotiators failing to anticipate situations beyond the initial transaction. A lack of motivation for the party perceiving itself to be losing out in the negotiation process to foster a long-term relationship can also result in this outcome. To illustrate, you may buy a second-hand sports bike at a very low price after negotiating hard with the seller. You realize it later that you will have to spend a fortune for its service and maintenance without any recourse to the seller.  Lose/Lose Outcome  A lose/lose outcome is the result of a deadlock between the negotiating parties. Such an outcome generally occurs when both the parties fail to reach a conclusion or mutually agree to the terms and conditions. To illustrate this, in a transaction involving equity infusion in a company, the investor wants to appoint two directors on the board of the company to exercise more control while the investee company is willing to allow the appointment of only one director. Ultimately, the transaction falls through - the investor loses the opportunity to gain financial returns and the investee loses the opportunity to receive a much-needed infusion of capital in the company. No one gains out of such an outcome and this is certainly an avoidable outcome.  Negotiation of commercial contracts  The most negotiated elements of a commercial contract are: (i) representation and warranties, and (ii) indemnities. If due diligence is conducted to facilitate a commercial transaction, some key issues / concern areas emerging out of the due diligence are listed. The party subjected to the diligence or its promoters are confronted with these issues and the party carrying out the due diligence seeks adequate representations and warranties as",
  "28   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  well as general and specific indemnities to address its concerns. Thereafter, the parties agree on the scope of representations and warranties and indemnities. The negotiation strategy adopted depends on the kind of coverage provided by the indemnity, the type of indemnity and the bargaining power of the negotiating parties. Similarly, the strategy to negotiate the representations and warranties also depend on the bargaining power of the parties and findings of the due diligence. It may be tough to lay down an exhaustive list of factors to bear in mind while negotiating a commercial contract. However, here are some pointers:  Use of language   – As mentioned at multiple places in this book, you must always use business language while drafting a contract. Avoid unnecessary jargons and Latin terms. Using simple to comprehend language also allows the parties to fully understand the implications of any provision. Only if you understand a provision comprehensively, can you negotiate to reach the desirable position.  Use facts, not feelings   - Negotiation is an emotionally draining process. Having said that, it is important to dissociate your feelings from the facts. A successful negotiator avoids letting an unpleasant personality drag down the negotiations. It is also important to view negotiation as a means to achieve common goals and not a warfare technique.  Use an ‘offer-concession’ strategy   - You need to negotiate in a manner that leaves the other party feeling that they have made a good deal. Do not start negotiations by revealing your BATNA. When you make the other party feel that they have won something, it is much easier to reach your desired outcome.  Prioritize   - A contract may have innumerable aspects that could be subject to negotiation. However, such an approach does not work in reality. It is important to identify the key asks of your client and negotiate accordingly. There is no point to lose sleep over minor points which do not substantially change your position. Keep your eye on the prize - the absolute non-negotiables and better forget minor issues.  Industry standards are easy to negotiate   - If you are negotiating an agreement and you have considerable industry knowledge / experience, it is much easier for you to justify your position pointing out that these are in line with the market practice. It shifts the burden on the other party to convince you as to why an exception should be made in the present case. Therefore, you must know your position and your audience before you decide on the negotiation strategy.  Commonly negotiated clauses in some of the key agreements  Set out below are the commonly negotiated clauses in some of the key commercial agreements that you may come across.",

  "CHAPTER 2  STARTING UP  Chapter 2 Before one enters into an agreement, the parties to a proposed transaction must decide who will draft the agreement. Usually, parties avoid this discussion. It is assumed that the party having a bigger stake or upper hand or simply, the bigger party (older and more established) will issue the first draft and the other(s) will provide their inputs or suggestions, if any. If your client has an upper hand and leverage in the transaction, you will be asked to draft the agreement. Customs and practice also play a role in such matters. Often, the   party   which   has   the   financial   muscle   power   or   whose   money,   property, technology, etc. are at stake would like to keep the control over the draft of the agreement and let the other party/parties only make comments on the draft. For example, you may have noticed that: (i) the employer always issues the employment letter / agreement; (ii) the bankers always provide a draft of the loan agreement; (iii) in a technology license agreement, the licensor will provide the draft; (iv) all the software licence agreements are drafted by the service providers; (v) the landlord invariably sends a draft lease agreement; (vi) the acquirer sends a draft acquisition agreement to the target company; (vii) online shopping websites draft the agreements for letting sellers sell on their website. The above are only a few examples. The rationale given in most of the above cases is that one party has more experience of such deals than the other and has a template used in earlier transactions and it would save time and cost. If, however, there is an option for your client to take responsibility for drafting an agreement, you should advise your client to take it. If drafted and negotiated properly, your client is likely to get the first mover advantage. This way, your client not only gets a clean slate or a big canvas to incorporate the provisions which have already been discussed and agreed, but also incorporate issues that are important but may not have been discussed so far. You could keep your clients’ concerns and interest in mind and draft the terms in a way that brings advantages to your client without changing the basic terms of the ‘handshake’ deal.",
  "32   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 2  As said earlier, you have a clean slate, so you can include such terms and conditions that are more favourable for your client. If you have drafted comprehensively, incorporating all the points in the interest of your client, the other party or their lawyer may or may not question all of them. For the ones where questions are raised, the other party has to give a reason for their objections and negotiate deletion or dilution thereof. Even if negotiation results in some deletions or dilutions, your client would be in a good position. Compare this with the other scenario. If the other party sends you a draft, you have to discuss it with you client, find gaps or issues which are missing and negotiate addition of such issues which are in the interest of your client. Out of the two, which situation is better? A great cricket legend once said, “If you do not know the ground conditions, how the pitch will behave, etc. and you win the toss, always opt for batting.” It is the same with drafting. Given an option, you should draft, rather than vet the other party’s draft. You must make a laundry list of the information that is absolutely necessary for you to know to draft an agreement. This should,   inter alia , include: (i) Particulars of parties; (ii) Description of the transaction; (iii) Reason why the parties are entering the transaction; (iii) Consideration—Money and Services involved; (iv) Duration of the Agreement, Renewal or Extension; (v) Termination situations and consequences; (vi) Exit options for parties; (vii) Most critical time lines; and (viii) Dispute Resolution process, if things go wrong. You should ask your client to provide you basic information regarding the above as soon as you are approached to draft a particular agreement. Before processing the information, you should understand the fact that your first and foremost focal point has to be your client. An agreement is never created in vacuum—it   has   to   be   formulated   around   the   client,   his   requirements   and expectations. Therefore, you should first make the client comfortable enough to share all that is necessary for you to know and his own insights and expectations—else you will bake something on half-truths or incomplete information. You must try to assess the following:  (i)   what   are   the   client’s   goals   and   standards   of   expectation   from   the transaction;",
  "Chapter 2]   Part 4—Before you Draft   33  (ii)   how critical is the transaction for the client—is it a one-off project, one of several projects the client is undertaking or is it the most ambitious project the client has envisaged so far;  (iii)   what are the absolute deal breakers for the client;  (iv)   what tolerance limits the client can live with. Additionally, an agreement does not affect only your client, but the other party as well as third party beneficiaries (sometimes even general public as consumer of certain products / services) in some cases. You must, therefore, be cognizant of their concerns as well. It is good to visualize yourself in the other parties’ shoes. You will be able to draft much better with this approach and avoid inclusion of terms that will clearly not be acceptable to other stakeholders. If   the   parties   have   executed   any   document,   be   it   Heads   of   Agreement, Memorandum   of   Understanding   (“MOU”),   Letter   of   Intent   (“LOI”),   Non- Disclosure Agreement (“NDA”), etc. (let us say a preliminary document for ease of reference here), ask for a copy thereof. The final version of the agreement must incorporate all substantial and relevant provisions of any preliminary document. The preliminary documents are generally non- binding till execution of a definitive agreement, barring exclusivity, confidentiality, governing law, etc. and there is always scope for negotiation and discussion. If   the   parties   wish   to   deviate   from   any   understanding   in   the   preliminary document, they have to inform you regarding the change. You should not assume or incorporate any changes without instructions from your client.. However, you can suggest changes if something incorporated in the preliminary document is not legal, feasible, practical or has become redundant. Sometimes, the legal or business position undergoes a change due to changed circumstances between execution of a preliminary document and the definitive agreement. e.g: (i) a legislation is repealed or amended; (ii) a party’s business is restructured into different entities; (iii) due diligence brings certain new aspects to the fore. You should weigh the implications, apprise the clients of such changes, and suggest suitable alteration in the agreed position of the parties on the subject matter. When you start incorporating this information in the draft, many questions would arise in your mind about the parties’ expectations and viewpoint on certain items not discussed so far between them as well. Enlist them and seek clarity / information / confirmation from your client.",
  "34   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 2  Ideally, you should try not to bother your client for supplementary information more than twice or thrice before sending the first draft. Some professionals send multiple queries to the client while working on the draft or as and when they have a thought in their mind. You have to appreciate that the client may have other considerable business as well to take care of and may feel irritated with frequent messages in this regard. Keeping track of your queries and the client’s response may also become a challenge in case of excess requests for information. Draft a first cut (whether afresh or using a precedent) on the basis of preliminary information provided by the client. In case any information is not provided by the client in the first instance or which comes to your mind while drafting the agreement, draft suitable clauses and leave blanks indicating therelevantparties to fill in. The first cut itself should be drafted with a view that this agreement should be an efficient mechanism to work properly during its term and dynamic enough to be fairly amended or terminated, if need be, as and when required to take care of the changed facts and circumstances without any leaving scope for allegations of foul play. You may also fill in any missing information on the basis of legal requirements, market practice or your experience on similar agreements by suggesting the same and specifically highlight such suggestions and ask the client for approval in this regard. The final decision in this regard should be of the client, unless it is illegal or impractical!",
  "CHAPTER 3  LEGALITY OF THE OBJECT  Chapter 3 To start with, while drafting an agreement, you must check whether the objective (purpose) of the agreement is lawful. After all, you can legally enforce only legal things, right? To be legally enforceable, an agreement has to be in compliance with the law of the land and public policy. In case the parties are entering into an agreement for an unlawful objective, the agreement will be void   ab initio   under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. For example, A and B enter into an agreement where under A agrees to pay a certain sum to B for kidnapping or murdering C. Since the objective of the agreement is to perform a criminal act (illegal), the agreement is bad in law and not enforceable. For commercial agreements too, you should see whether the transaction the parties   wish   to   undertake   is   legally   viable.   For   example,   any   agreement   for facilitating insider trading or passing on official secrets of the government or a corporate house would be illegal and thus, not legally enforceable by any of the parties. Similarly, accepting deposits from general public and offering them very high (seemingly impossible) returns is another example—there are strict provisions under Company law to prevent such illegal activity. The Government and the Reserve Bank of India have separate regimes and mechanisms to supervise and control such businesses. You need to check whether the proposed activities / transactions pass the muster on these parameters. You should also bear in mind that if an agreement is to be enforced by a party in India, such enforcement of the agreement (even partial) will not be possible in case the agreement or its object is in violation of any statutory provision in India. The invoking party may try to rely on a guarantee, indemnity, undertaking or the like provided in the agreement or related documents. However, any such action isn’t likely to succeed if the purpose of the agreement violates any applicable statue. The simple reason is that a party cannot consent to an agreement which is against the law. Therefore, in case any Indian law is violated, any such guarantee, indemnity and undertaking will not be a ground for any action or defence, for any action in India, available to the party claiming relief.",
  "36   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 3  If the transaction is questionable in your opinion, you must examine the legal position very carefully (even without being asked to) and apprise the parties regarding the legality of the object. More often than not, when caught with irregularities   or illegal operations,   the parties   to   these questionable deals   and transactions say—‘we were being advised by best of lawyers’ and try to put the blame on their advisors. You   should   not   knowingly   become   a   conduit   in   facilitating   an   unlawful transaction and put a blot on your credibility. It will not be taken into account that the client insisted on an illegal transaction despite advice to the contrary by the lawyers; everyone looking at the draft would squarely put the blame on the latter, saying—what did the lawyers check/how could the lawyers approve an unlawful transaction? Be vigilant.",
  "CHAPTER 4  COMPETENCE OF THE PARTIES  Chapter 4 After checking the legality of purpose, you should check if the parties are competent to enter into a valid agreement. If they are, only then can they commit and be held responsible to fulfil their obligations under the agreement. By competent parties, one means those persons (real persons or legal entities) who are legally and mentally capable of entering into agreements that are enforceable by law. Certain categories of persons, such as minors, undischarged insolvents, mentally ill persons or persons under the influence of alcohol or drugs may not be competent to execute a binding agreement. Confirm the status of the parties before drafting an agreement and check whether the person briefing you on the transaction has the legal capacity to negotiate and / or execute the proposed agreement. As per Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, every person is competent to contract who is (i) of age of majority according to the law to which he is subject; and (ii) of sound mind; and (iii) not disqualified from entering a contract by any law to which he is subject Let us discuss these issues briefly.  Minority  As per section 3 of the Indian Majority Act of 1875, every person in India is a minor if he has not attained the age of 18 years. The age should be 21 years, in case of a minor of whose person or property or both, a guardian has been appointed under the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 or Whose property is under the superintendence of any court of wards till he attains the age of 18 years. Some aspects of an agreement with a minor and effects thereof are listed hereunder. (i) An agreement with a minor is void   ab-initio.  (ii) A minor can always plead his minority despite earlier misrepresenting to be a major. In other words, he cannot be held liable for an agreement on the ground that earlier he had portrayed or claimed that he had attained majority.",
  "38   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 4  (iii) Doctrine of Restitution does not apply against a minor   i.e. , obligation of person enjoying benefit of non-gratuitous act does not apply in case of a minor. (iv) A minor cannot ratify (confirm) an agreement made by him during minority on attaining majority. If he wants to ratify the agreement, a fresh agreement and fresh consideration for the new agreement is required. (v) A minor is entitled to enforce a contract which is of some benefit to him. Minority is a personal privilege and a minor can take advantage of it and bind other parties. (vi) A minor can be appointed an agent, but he is not personally liable for any of his acts.  Sound Mind  Under Section 12 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a person is said to be of sound mind for the purposes of entering into a contract if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests. A person, who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, may make a contract when he is of sound mind. A person, who is usually of sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a contract when he is of unsound mind. It, thus appears that legally, a person is of a sound mind if he: (i) is capable of understanding the contract; and (ii) is capable of forming a rational judgment about the effects of such contract on his interest. A person not satisfying any of these two conditions shall not be treated as a person of sound mind.  Other Disqualified Persons  There are categories of persons who are disqualified from entering into a contract due to certain other reasons such as their legal status, political status or corporate status. Some such categories of persons are:  Alien Enemy : An agreement with an Alien Enemy is void.  Convict :   A   convict   cannot   enter   into   a   contract   while   he   is   undergoing imprisonment.  Foreign Sovereign and Ambassadors : Foreign sovereigns and their representatives enjoy certain privileges and immunities in every country. They cannot enter into contract except through their agents residing in India.",
  "Chapter 4]   Part 4—Before you Draft   39  Insolvents:   A person who is unable to discharge his liabilities and therefore has applied for being declared insolvent by the court or such proceedings have been initiated by any of his creditors cannot enter into any contract relating to his property.  Company or Statutory bodies:   A contract entered into by a corporate body or statutory body will be valid only to the extent it is within its powers enlisted in its Memorandum of Association ( intra vires ). Individuals / entities expressly barred by Securities & Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’) for violating any SEBI regulations.",
  "CHAPTER 5  CONSIDERATION  Chapter 5 According to Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act,1872, consideration is defined as: “When at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or abstain from doing something, such act or abstinence or promise is called consideration for the promise”. In simple words, consideration means something in return of a promise which may either be benefit gained by one party or something lost by the other. In contract law, consideration is meant to be the exchange of one thing of value for another. It is one of the important elements that must be present for a contract to be legally enforceable. Section 10 of the Contract Act mandates (I am sure the situation would be the same in other countries too) a lawful consideration among other requirements to constitute a valid contract.  It broadly means what the parties are doing or not doing on their part under an agreement.   For   anything   done   by   a   party   under   the   agreement,   there   is   a corresponding benefit to the other party. The agreement must clearly demarcate why the parties are getting into an agreement—which party is going to give / receive what benefit under the agreement. Without the element of consideration flowing from each party, an agreement is void. It is also necessary to mention consideration to calculate the stamp duty payable on an agreement under Indian Stamp Act, 1899. Section 27 of this Act mandates that the consideration should be fully and truly stated in an agreement. For example, it is not sufficient to say that A is leasing or selling his property to B. It is mandatory to mention at what rent / sale price A is leasing / selling the property. This enables revenue authorities to calculate the amount of consideration and levy stamp duty thereon. In   India,   we   have   had   the   malaise   of   under-reporting   the   consideration, particularly for property related agreements. The primary reason for this practice is to evade payment of stamp duty and registration fees and the unreported portion of consideration was paid in unaccounted cash. This constituted the so called ‘black",
  "Chapter 5]   Part 4—Before you Draft   41  money’. At some point of time, the black money was estimated to be half of the official money supply in India. The fraction has come down significantly in recent years. However, all this resulted in catastrophic consequences for the parties in cases of dispute. A party could not claim the actual consideration in the event of default by the other party. The government’s tax collections were appallingly short. With the Government of India’s emphasis on better compliance, these practices are being reduced if not completely eliminated. Under tax laws, it is now mandatory to make big payments only through cheques or digital modes. The stamp duty and registration charges are being reduced. The tax authorities can also question any suspected undervalued deals. Further, not only should a consideration be there, but the consideration should be valid under law. An Illegal or immoral consideration or one that is against established public policy may not be enforceable. An agreement can contain the acknowledgement of receipt by way of a separate receipt in an annexure or in the body of the agreement itself.",
  "PART 5  DRAFTING AN AGREEMENT  Part 5—Drafting an Agreement",
  "CHAPTER 1  COVER PAGE  Chapter 1 Nowadays, there is a growing trend to add a cover page to the agreement. This page should include the following: (i) title of the Agreement; (ii) date of the Agreement; and (iii) full official names of the parties. Title page need not have definition or address of the parties. Else, the purpose of brevity and neatness may be lost. Keep in mind that the cover page should be one page only. If, however, there are too many parties to an agreement and they cannot be accommodated in one page, then you may either do away with the cover page altogether, or write just the name of the Agreement on the cover page. Some law firms put their firm name and logo on the cover page as well. Suit yourself and adopt your firm style. An example of a cover page is as follows.  Joint Venture Agreement  Dated ___________________ Between ABC Limited MNP & Co., LLP Mr. Chandra Prakash Mrs. Aruna Gupta And Mr. Arvind Chopra",
  "CHAPTER 2  TITLE OF THE AGREEMENT  Chapter 2 The title of the agreement should clearly state the nature of business / transaction(s) the parties intend to undertake under the agreement. Merely mentioning “Agreement” doesn’t help a reader understand as to what the agreement is about. The reader in such a case will have to go through the agreement to understand the nature of the transaction(s) contemplated under the agreement and relationship of the parties. For example, you may have observed that the term “partnership” is construed very loosely in India. People call any commercial arrangement, be it agency, license, distributorship, franchise or anything—to be a partnership. If left to the clients (the so-called partners), the title of every agreement would be a partnership agreement. However,   you   have   to   examine   the   contemplated   transaction(s)   and   exact relationship between the parties and be sure whether the so-called partnership is actually an agency, licensing, collaboration, joint venture, franchising, leasing or something else and provide a suitable title to their agreement. You should go through the essence of the transaction(s) contemplated under an agreement and then give an appropriate title to the agreement. If there are several transactions under the same agreement, you could include two most important aspects in the title of the agreement. For example, if the parties are entering into a joint venture and enlist their rights and obligations as shareholders of the joint venture vehicle, you could name the agreement as “Joint Venture and Shareholders’ Agreement”. Similarly, an agreement could be “Share Purchase and Shareholders’ Agreement” and so on. Please note that while interpreting an agreement, a court or other enforcement agency may not strictly go only by the title of the agreement, but the essence or content thereof. Therefore, if the title of an agreement is a misnomer, it does not vary the nature of the agreement nor does it have an impression in the eyes of a court or enforcement agency that cannot change upon detailed study of the Agreement.",
  "CHAPTER 3  DESCRIBE DRAFT VERSION OF THE AGREEMENT  Chapter 3 A draft normally undergoes review by different parties and their professionals and several changes are suggested or made by these people. As a result, there are different versions of the draft with professionals. To discuss and move further on a draft, it is advisable to keep marking the drafts appropriately so that the parties are discussing the same version of the draft at a time. Therefore, whenever you circulate or amend a draft, mark it on the top of first page (if not header of all pages) appropriately. First draft could be marked as under: “Preliminary draft for discussion 10 March, 2017 / ABC Associates” After the client’s further inputs, the second draft could be marked as under: “Revised draft 12 March, 2017 /ABC Associates” If there are several rounds of discussion and the draft is being amended very frequently (sometimes, different versions floating on the same day), you could mark the drafts as under: “Revised draft 10 March, 2017 / ABC Associates Version 7”",
  "CHAPTER 4  PREAMBLE  Chapter 4 The first sentence of an agreement is its preamble. The preamble   inter alia , states the following: (i) name (title) of the agreement; (ii) abbreviation of the title of the agreement, if any; (iii) date of execution; and (iv) place of execution.  Example : This Master   Service   Agreement (“MSA”) is executed on   this   11th day   of September 2017 at New Delhi. There could be some variations in the above clause, as discussed in next chapters.",
  "CHAPTER 5  EXECUTION PLACE  Chapter 5 Invariably, after the title of an agreement is mentioned, the preamble reads as under:  This Agreement is executed on this ___ day of _______ (month and year) at ________ (place) by:  Unless all the parties are executing an agreement at the same place or are located in the same city, the place of execution may be different for different parties. If this is the case, you should delete the word “at ______” from the above quoted text.  Example : This Partnership Agreement is executed on this ___ day of _______ (month and year) by and between: Now, how do you indicate as to the place of execution of the agreement? If the parties are executing the agreement separately and at different places, each party should indicate the place of their respective execution at the signing page.  Example : (On execution page) ________________ Signature Name: Designation: Place:",
  "CHAPTER 6  EXECUTION DATE  Chapter 6 As mentioned previously, the preamble of an agreement typically reads as under:  This Agreement is executed on this ___ day of _______ (month and year) at ________ (place) by and between:  It is very important to mention the date of execution of any agreement and the date from which is becomes operative (we shall cover the latter part in the “Effective Date” section). Mentioning the date of execution assists in binding the parties to their respective obligations under the agreement or assert a party’s rights thereunder. No party can take refuge under any excuse after executing an agreement from a specific date, once the effective date has been identified. The date of execution is also important from the perspective of registration of any document which is compulsorily registrable under the Registration Act, 1908. Section 23 of this Act prescribes a maximum period of 4 (four) months from the date of execution for registration of a document. The date of an agreement is the date on which it is executed by the parties. It is very easy to determine such date when all the parties are executing the agreement simultaneously and at one place itself. If all the parties are executing the agreement on the same date although at different places (by facsimile or executing different copies of the same agreement), even then determination of this date is not an issue. However, if different parties to an agreement execute it on different dates, the question arises as to which date should be presumed to be the date of execution. The normal practice in such a case is to consider the date on which the last party executes the agreement as the date of execution of the agreement. However, this may not hold good in all the cases. Under some agreements, some parties execute the agreement for the sake of formality, just to take note of the contents thereof as confirming parties—in such cases, agreement may be valid and operative in the absence of their execution as well. Therefore, in a case like this, the date(s) on which confirming party(ies) execute the agreement may not be taken into account. In the absence of anything to the contrary, implicitly or explicitly, the date of an agreement or effective date thereof is the date of execution. If different parties are executing the agreement separately and / or on different dates, there need not be any mention of date in the opening line and the parties may indicate the date of their respective execution at the signing page.",
  "Chapter 6]   Part 5—Drafting an Agreement   51  Further, to avoid any mistake, forgery or manipulation in date, the date may be written in words and numbers (as in case of numbers, explained later).  Examples:  1. When the parties are signing the agreement on same date: This Technical License Agreement is executed on this   Seventh (7th)   day of   October, 2016 (Two thousand sixteen)   between: 2. When the parties are executing the agreement on different dates (but at the same place), you may use the following template: This Joint Venture Agreement (“ JVA ”) is executed at ________ (place) by and among: Each party shall put its respective date of execution in the appropriate column on the signature page.  Example:  (On execution page) ________________ Signature Name: Designation: Date: 3. When the parties are executing the agreement on different dates and different places, you could use the following phrase: This Agency Agreement is executed by and between: If the place and date of execution are not the same for all parties, each party can indicate its respective place and date of signing on the signature page.  Example:  (On execution page) For _______________ (party name) ________________ Signature Name: Designation: Date: Place:  Another standpoint  A mismatch in the date of execution must be avoided at all costs as it can leave a scope for allegations of fraud, mischief, misrepresentation, etc.. For example, if a particular date is mentioned in the preamble of an agreement as the execution date",
  "52   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 6  without specifying the exact date of execution by parties signing on different dates, a party may give an alibi that it wasn’t available for signature on the purported day of execution, etc. Therefore, a day of execution may also be mentioned in the signature column to avoid any confusion even if the preamble clause specifies the date.",
  "CHAPTER 7  DESCRIPTION AND AUTHENTICATION OF PARTIES  Chapter 7 Once you have given a title to the agreement and incorporated the date and place of execution, now comes the part where you list the parties to the agreement. The cover page and / or the first page of the agreement should provide the title and date of the agreement as well as the parties to the agreement, so that the reader knows what is the subject matter of the agreement and who are the parties concerned. In this regard, the parties’ description should provide adequate details of the parties, so that each party’s status is clear, and their identification is not an issue. This is very important, particularly when the parties get into a dispute related to an agreement, it could become difficult to identify / trace the parties. A party may change its name, shift from the address provided in the agreement (particularly so, if it is a leased space), remarry, undergo a sex change or there could be other circumstances due to which many identification details provided in description of a party may not remain the same after a while. In some cases, once disputes arise between the parties, a party which may have dishonest intentions fails to perform its obligations under the agreement and / or is otherwise untraceable. In such case, requisite notices under the agreement or Court summons are required to be served on such party and it becomes difficult to serve notices and bring the party to discussion or proceedings, as the case may be. Therefore, it is important to obtain true and verified identity and address details about the parties as far as possible and incorporate the same in the description of the parties under the agreement. Indian registration authorities have dealt with the problem of impersonation of parties for a long time. Anyone could execute any document pretending to be someone else. The supposed signatory was not even aware of such execution and would then deny any liability on account of the document being fake. This   impersonation   could   have   multiple   objectives—to   make   a   killing   by deceiving one or more parties to the transaction. Consequently, sometimes it resulted in a loss to the person in whose name the execution was done and he would challenge the authenticity of the transaction upon becoming aware of it. On the",
  "54   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 7  other hand, the beneficiary was always at risk of a challenge by the intended original party, if the transaction was entered to deceive both the beneficiary and the original party. Now, all registration and other government authorities insist on photographs of the signatories to the agreements and thumb impressions to be taken on the spot and not rely on the stock photographs supplied by such parties. This process puts a check on the practice of impersonation or purported execution of documents on behalf of someone who might even be unaware of the transaction. It is also useful to retain self-certified copies of the identification documents of parties involved in any transaction for future verification / insistence / enforcement purposes. What are the details to be obtained-  In case of individuals  Complete name matching with official identification documents (no abbreviations or nicknames) Father’s name (for males) Father’s or spouse name (for females) Postal Address (with some proof): Passport / Utility Bills / Election Commission card / Aadhar card Permanent Account Number (PAN) / Goods & Services Tax (GST) registration / Passport / Aadhar Card Directors Identification Number (DIN) Bank Account Number (for processing any payments under the agreement) in the operative clauses. Out of the above, Passport number undergoes a change on renewal. However, one cannot change a PAN, Aadhar or DIN. With these details, the individual should be largely identifiable and traceable. If a party to the agreement is a minor, and acting through a natural guardian or guardian appointed by a Will or other an instrument or appointed or declared by the court, such fact must be reflected in the description of such party.  Examples : 1. ABC, a minor, acting through XYZ who is her father and natural guardian. 2. The Seller is a minor and therefore, acting through XYZ who is her guardian vide an order number ________, dated ________ (description) of the District Judge of _______. Similarly, if trustees are entering into an agreement on behalf of a trust, the fact should be mentioned as under:",

Partner of a partnership firm may enter into commercial agreements on behalf of the partnership firm in ordinary course of business under the implied authority on any partner under Section 19 of the Partnership Act, 1932. However, if the other parties insist, either all the partners should execute the agreement or a specific POA should be provided in favour of the signatory.  In case of company / LLP / Firm / other entities  Complete Name Registered Office / Corporate Office Postal Address (with some proof) Email id Bank Account Number (for processing any payments under the agreement) in the operative clauses Permanent Account Number (PAN) Corporate Identification Number (CIN - for companies and LLPs) Registration Number (Firms) GST registration number A corporate entity may change its name or registered office, but it cannot tinker with the PAN, CIN or tax registration numbers.",
  "CHAPTER 8  NUMBERING OF PARTIES  Chapter 8 An agreement would require at least two parties to the agreement. If there are only two parties to an agreement, you may mention the parties as under:  1.   Mr. ABC, son of Mr. XYZ, residing at No. __, Cunningham Road, Bangalore 560052, having Permanent Account Number __________ and Aadhar number ______________, (hereinafter referred to as the  “Lessor”   which term shall where the context so admits be deemed to include his heirs, successors and assigns); and  2.   Alpha Beta Gama India Private Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and having its registered office at XYZ Building, Nariman Point, Mumbai-400021, CIN ________________ and Permanent Account Number _________ (hereinafter referred to as the   “Lessee”   which expression shall, unless repugnant to the context, mean and include its successors and permitted assigns). While defining a party by its status under the agreement, you can either define a party by its status simply, as “Lessor” or “Lessee” or add “the” before it, “the Lessor” or “the Lessee”. Some draftsmen discard use of “the” before definition of the parties altogether. Whatever nomenclature you select, with or without “the”, you should be consistent with it throughout the agreement. If there are more than two parties to an agreement, you may have to put a number before their respective names, to give an idea to the reader as to how many parties are there in total and how many in different capacities. For example, there may be (i) two Lessors (joint owners) and one Lessee in a Lease Agreement; or (ii) 5 Shareholders   and 1 Target company in an Investment Agreement; or (iii) 1 Company and 3 Employees in a Settlement Agreement. Earlier, it was customary to define the parties in the sequence of their appearance in the parties list. Please see the following example, This agreement is executed between: Mr. ABC, _________________ (party of the First part); Ms. DEF, _________________ (party of the Second part);",
  "Chapter 8]   Part 5—Drafting an Agreement   57  GHI Global Network Services Private Limited, _________________ (party of the Third part) and so on .... In case of two parties, it is also customary to describe the first party as “Party of one part” and the second one as “Party of the other part”. If these defined terms are to be used throughout the agreement, it is cumbersome and against brevity. The reader cannot be reasonably expected to remember who is the party of which part. Mid-way through the agreement, if he reads an obligation of Party of the fifth part, he may have to go back to the parties’ description clause to recall who the concerned party is. He may have to do it multiple times, if different parties have different rights and obligations under the agreement (which is very much expected!). Every time there is a reference to party of __th part, he will have to look up to the first page of the agreement to recollect which party is the agreement referring to. Another problem of identifying parties by a number could be as under. What if there are 15 parties to an original agreement and parties number 6, 8 and 11 cease to be parties to the agreement after some time? Will the other parties’ definition   undergo   a   change   to   reflect   the   new   numbers   allotted   to   them respectively? On the other hand, if the parties’ numbering continues to be the same, it would be misleading in terms of actual number of parties left to continue with the agreement (there would be only 12 parties remaining in the agreement, so why reference to parties number 13, 14 and 15?)! In the alternative, should the parties have to execute a fresh agreement or amend the agreement whenever there is an addition or deletion of a party to the agreement to reflect the new number scheme? Isn’t it better to avoid this confusion? A simple and straightforward solution which comes to mind is that in all agreements, the parties should either be defined by their name (or abbreviated name) or by their status / role under the agreement ( e.g. , Lessor, Lessee, Licensor, Licensee, Principal, Agent, Employer, Employee, etc.). In the above example, the 3 parties may be defined as ABC, DEF and GHI respectively. Apart from a partnership or cooperation agreement or a membership agreement (where the status, rights and obligations of all parties may be same in some cases), the status, rights and obligations of the parties are different from each other in the agreement. Therefore, the parties should be defined by their respective positions or status under the agreement (for example, seller, buyer, distributor, agent, employer, employee, franchisor, franchisee, service provider, licensor, licensee, contractor, service provider, consultant, etc.). In the above example, if the first and second parties agree to have a joint venture in the form of the third party, the first two parties may be defined by their respective names individually and the third party may be defined as the Joint Venture Company or JVC.",
  "58   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 8  If more than one parties to an agreement have the same status,   e.g. , investors, buyers, sellers, franchisees, licensees, members, etc., they should be individually defined with their respective names or status ( e.g. , Investor 1) and collectively as the respective status holders ( e.g. , Investors). If we are defining parties by names or titles, it is preferable to assign each party an abbreviated name or title, else it becomes difficult to remember its full name and description throughout the agreement. Once such name or title is assigned, the concerned party should be addressed with it throughout the agreement. While defining a party in the description section itself, you may simply put the party definition in parenthesis after the party’s name without using terms like “Hereinafter referred to as ________”. These words actually do not add any value to the context.  1. Mr. ABC , son of Mr. XYZ, residing at No. __, Cunningham Road Bangalore 560052, having Permanent Account Number __________ and Aadhar number ______________ (“ the Lessor ”); and  2. Alpha Beta Gama India Private Limited,   a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and having its registered office at XYZ Building, Nariman Point, Mumbai-400021, CIN _______________ and Permanent Account Number _________ (“ the   Lessee ”). The addition of those who can act on behalf of the party like heirs, successors, permitted assignees, etc. are only a matter of practice. Such mention is not strictly required to be added in the definition. The fact that the defined term includes heirs, successors, assigns, etc. can be clarified or included later   in the agreement, if need be. For example, if no assignment is allowed to one or more parties under the agreement, the question of a permitted assignee does not arise in relation to such party / parties.",
  "CHAPTER 9  WHEREAS CLAUSES / RECITALS  Chapter 9 Every agreement has a   story   behind it. While explaining the nature of recitals, my favourite quote is: “Recitals are The story so far.” It rhymes well, doesn’t it? Besides explaining the subject, that is. Recitals play the role of a narrator of an agreement. The story played out in the recital clause is about introduction of the parties to each   other,   their   contemplating   a   commercial   relationship,   the   subsequent discussions between them, any interim understandings and documents executed and the parties ultimately arriving at an understanding to do business with each other. Recitation of this story in an agreement is carried out through what are called the Whereas / Introduction / Background / Recital clauses. After the title of the agreement and parties’ description / definition, invariably there are the introduction clauses. Recitals are broadly of two kinds: (i) Narrative; and (ii) Introductory. The narrative recitals capture the history of the parties, their businesses and their previous discussions. The introductory recitals explain the reason for the present agreement. These two kind of recitals are so entwined at times that you may not be able to separate the two. Recitals are an important part of any agreement, in the sense that they provide the background and summary of the story till the execution of the agreement. It is like a narrator giving you the background before the actual movie starts. Only after reading the recitals can a reader make sense of a long, detailed and complicated agreement. Sometimes, the operative part of an agreement only narrates the transaction and not the intent behind it. In the absence of recitals, an agreement would appear to be very mechanical and difficult to comprehend.",
  "60   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 9  These clauses, among other things: (i) Introduce the parties; (ii) Mention their respective businesses; (iii) Mention the subject matter of the agreement; (iv) Highlight offer and acceptance,   i.e. , which party has offered what to the other and if / how the recipient party has accepted such offer; (v) Mention the crux of their discussion so far and any previous document executed by the parties (MOU, NDA, LOI, etc.); and (vi) Mention the parties’ intention to incorporate their understanding in the form of the present agreement. Thus these clauses are a handy tool for a reader to capture as to who the parties are and how have they reached the stage of execution of this Agreement. The recitals also explain as to what is the parties’ common goal. For example, in a Sale Deed, it is necessary to mention as to how the Seller has derived the title to a property,   e.g. , by purchase, grant, inheritance, partition and so on. If the Seller is not the first or sole owner, the recitals should narrate as to how has he derived the extent of his title in the subject property. If the person executing the Sale deed is acting under a Power of Attorney or acting as guardian of a minor, the facts and circumstances pertaining to his powers must be explained. Similarly, in a Joint Venture Agreement, the recitals should describe the parties, their respective businesses, their intention to join hands to pursue a new venture and the fact of an MOU executed between them in this regard. There should be a good narrative in the successive recitals and the reader should be able to understand as to who the parties are and how have they reached an understanding to pursue the contemplated business transaction. If   there   are   a   considerably   high   number   of   recitals,   they   should   flow   in chronological order so that the reader can understand sequentially. The recitals need not incorporate the detailed terms and conditions of the agreement,   they   should   describe   the   journey   till   the   parties   come   to   the understanding narrated in the operative clauses. The draftsman should let the operative part of the agreement narrate how the parties intend to achieve the proposed objective. While drafting these clauses, the draftsman should bear in her mind that he has the entire agreement to explain the transaction, the consideration, timelines, closing requirements and all other terms of the agreement. The mistake some people commit is to incorporate too much information in whereas clauses, including the representations and warranties (I reviewed such a draft agreement from one of the biggest Indian e-platform companies recently). You",
  "Chapter 9]   Part 5—Drafting an Agreement   61  need not put all information in whereas clauses since the reader has to go through the entire agreement. It is advisable to avoid repetition and reduce the chances of inconsistency. One should be very careful while incorporating recitals. Unless used judiciously, recitals may control or conflict with the operative part of an agreement. Recitals are handy tools in determining state of things and understanding between the parties and therefore, should be clear and unambiguous. They may be used as admissions under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, if the operative part of an agreement is clear and unambiguous on an issue, nothing contained in the recitals may be able to limit or control it. Therefore,   the   draftsman   should   avoid   going   overboard   with   recitals   and incorporating unnecessary details therein. The recitals should be correct, relevant and brief. There are multiple forms of writing recitals. Under the first form, “Whereas” is written in the first clause and subsequent clauses begin with “And Whereas”. An alternative way is to write “Whereas” once, follow it with “:” and begin the clauses down numbered numerically or alphabetically. Another way is to write “Information” or “Background” or “Introduction” and thereafter, provide the background information in clauses numbered numerically or alphabetically. If you are numbering the Whereas clauses, it is easy to identify and mention in any correspondence or reference. In the absence of number or alphabets to identify, you may have to read all the recital clauses to understand which clause is being referred to, particularly if there are numerous recitals.  Examples : Whereas: A. ABC has experience in the business of manufacturing, distributing and selling in Europe and South America. B. XYZ is engaged in the business of _________________ in India. C. The Parties are desirous of establishing a joint venture company in India (“JVC”) with equal shareholding for carrying out the Business (as defined hereinafter). D. The Parties have agreed to execute this Agreement to record their understanding as to how affairs and management of the JVC shall be conducted and to grant to each other certain rights and obligations in relation to the ownership and operations of the JVC. Or",
  "62   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 9  Whereas ABC has experience in the business of manufacturing, distributing and selling ____________ in Europe and South America; And Whereas XYZ is engaged in the business of _________________ in India; And Whereas the Parties are desirous of establishing a joint venture company in India (“JVC”) with equal shareholding for carrying out the Business (as defined hereinafter); And Whereas the Parties have agreed to execute this Agreement to record their understanding as to how affairs and management of the JVC shall be conducted and to grant to each other certain rights and obligations in relation to the ownership and operations of the JVC.  No recitals  However, certain agreements may not need recital clauses. For example, in a Loan Agreement, the parties are defined as Lender and Borrower and after description of the parties, the operative clauses can start mentioning the amount, purpose, tenure and terms of the loan being granted to the Borrower. If one party is a Bank or a Financial Institution and the other party is a company, it is understood that the latter is obtaining loans/ facilities from the former and operative clauses can begin straightaway. Similarly, in case of agreements executed in form of letters, there may be no recital clauses and the operative clauses may start straightaway. Example of an Appointment Letter: Dear Ms. ______, Subject: Appointment as a Field Officer Further to your successful interview with us for the above position, we are pleased to appoint you on the following terms and conditions: Even the term “Whereas” is not mandatory. The recital clause can be named as Introduction or Background and appear as follows: 1. ABC has experience in the business of manufacturing, distributing and selling ______in Europe and South America. 2. XYZ is engaged in the business of _________________ in India. 3. The Parties are desirous of establishing a joint venture company in India (“JVC”) with equal shareholding for carrying out the Business (as defined hereinafter). 4. The Parties have agreed to enter into this Agreement to record their understanding as to how affairs and management of the JVC shall be conducted and to grant to each other certain rights and obligations in relation to the ownership and operations of the JVC.",
  "CHAPTER 10  EFFECTIVE DATE  Chapter 11 Chapter 10 The agreement must clearly indicate as to when the agreement comes into effect. An agreement may come into effect: (i) simultaneously with execution; (ii) with retrospective effect; or (iii) from a date later than the execution date. In the absence of a definition of Effective Date of the agreement, the agreement would be assumed to be effective from the execution date. Under the contract law, it is not mandatory to have a written agreement for a commercial relationship to exist. Therefore, sometimes, the parties may have a commercial relationship even prior to execution of any definitive documents (while they are undergoing the negotiation process). This hurry to get on with business may be due to their comfort with each other or in cases of commercial urgency, so as to not lose out on good business opportunities (sometimes urgent or seasonal) for the duration of the negotiation and drafting process. In such a case, once they agree on final details of their relationship, they can execute the agreement and provide an earlier date as the effective date. On the other hand, an employment agreement may be executed and may provide the effective date of the provisions thereof to be the date when the employee joins the organisation. A Joint Venture Agreement may be effective from the date of capital infusion by the parties in the joint venture entity. If there is no capital infusion, the relationship between the purported joint venture partners does not get consummated. An Acquisition Agreement may be effective only from the date of Closing when the subject asset is transferred to the Purchaser. Sometimes all the provisions of an agreement may not be effective from the same date. For example, an employment agreement may provide for a probation period before   confirmation.   In   such   a   case,   the   notice   period   and   many   applicable",
  "64   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 10  conditions would be different under the probation period and after confirmation. The concerned provisions would be applicable at the different stages.  Examples : 1. This Agreement shall come into force on April 1, 2017. 2. This Agreement shall become effective on the date this Agreement is executed   by   the   authorised   representative   of   the   last   signing   Party (“Effective Date”). 3. This Agreement shall become effective on the date this Agreement is executed by the last signing Party (“Effective Date”). However, this Agreement shall become null and void if the Agreement is not executed on behalf of all the Parties within 15 (fifteen) days of execution by a Party. 4. The effective date of this Agreement (“Effective Date”) shall be the date first   written   above.   The   term   of   the   Agent’s   engagement   with   the Company under this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue till it is terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.",
  "CHAPTER 11  NOMENCLATURE OF OPERATIVE PROVISIONS - ARTICLE, CLAUSE OR SECTION  Chapter 11 Different nomenclature is used for referring to the operative provision of an agreement - Article, Clause or Section. The choice is more of style than substance. Different   professionals   and   firms   within   the   same   country   or   from   different countries use different terminologies. A draftsman has to be clear and consistent as to what he wishes to call the operative provisions of the agreement. According to me, the British prefer “Clause”, the Americans prefer “Article” and “Section” is somewhere in between. However, there may be an overlap of terms if your agreement refers to bye-laws of an Indian company, which are termed as the Articles of Association (‘AOA’). Invariably, AOA too are called Articles in general use and reference to a specific Article of AOA may be referred to as Article in the agreement. To overcome such an eventuality (if there are many references to AOA of a company), you may refer to provisions of the agreement as Clauses and AOA as Articles. Alternatively, use Articles for provisions of the agreement and whenever referring to AOA mention ‘Article __ of AOA’, wherever the need arises. Similarly, the provisions of the Indian Constitution are termed “Articles”. The operative clauses of most international treaties are also terms as “Articles”. Therefore, it appears that an Article refers to a term which is very important. A section on the other hand, is a provision of a legislative enactment. For example, Section 10 of the Companies Act, 2013 and so on. This may cause confusion, unless a distinction is made out clearly. Therefore, in the definitions or interpretation section, clarify whether a Clause, Article or Section refers to a Clause, Article or Section of the same agreement or that of some other. Whichever nomenclature you choose in your agreement, be consistent with it throughout the agreement. Once you have decided on a particular name, you could split it further into sub-_____ or mention the entire provision as _________.  Example : (i) Sub-section 2 of Section 2; or (ii) Section 2(2) or Section 2.2. There is no particular recommendation nor a set rule on such different terms used interchangeably.",
  "CHAPTER 12  PROPER HEADING OF SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS  Chapter 13 The headings clause in contracts has a legitimate purpose. When interpreting or arguing over the meaning of a clause or provision in a contract, a party will often use the heading title as an argument for their particular interpretation of the terms of agreement within the contract. The heading could be placed on the left-hand side or in the centre. Be consistent with the style you pick throughout the agreement. Mostly,   the   title   to   articles   and   headings/sub-headings   are   used   only   for convenience   of   reference   and   do   not   serve   any   other   substantial   purpose   in interpretation of an agreement. Even if the title/headings/sub-heading serves this limited purpose, do make it a point to make such headings relevant and proper. This will enable your reader to find a section / provision he is seeking out, whether in the index or at the right place in the agreement. Once you have given a heading, include provisions related to that heading only under it. Other provisions for which you are unable to coin any heading or unsure about where they should be placed, add a clause called “Miscellaneous” or “Miscellaneous Provisions”.",
  "CHAPTER 13  NUMBER SCHEME FOR PROVISIONS  Chapter 14 How would it appear that in a clause, you are using sub-clauses (a), (b) onwards, in the next clause, the sub-clauses are numbered (i), (ii) onwards and in the next clause, sub-clauses are number (1), (2) onwards and sometimes you use (A), (B) onwards as well. Be particular and consistent about clause numbering. Referring to sub-clauses in alphabetical terms can be tricky if the sub-clauses are exhausted by sub-clause (z) representing 26th sub-clause. Similarly, sub-clauses (i), (v) or (x) could be alphabets or Roman numerals. You are never too sure. It is much better to number Articles or Clauses in Numbers 1, 2 onwards. Sub-Articles or Clauses as 1.1, 1.2 ..., 2.1, 2.2.. Going further, you can do the sub-numbering as 1.1.1, 1.2.1 ... This way the sequencing of sub-clauses will always be clear to you, not confusing whether (i), (v) or (x) are alphabets or Roman numbers. The number scheme should be consistent throughout the agreement.",
  "CHAPTER 14  DEFINITION OF TERMS USED IN THE AGREEMENT  Chapter 14 There could be several terms which are used many times throughout an agreement. When such term is introduced in the agreement it is usual to define it once. A definition serves multiple purposes. It starts from the parties to the agreement itself. For example, instead of mentioning   Mr.   Muralikrishnan   Ramaswamy   Balasundaram   Mahalingam Narayanan (By the way, I have no idea if there is a gentleman with this name. If there is, no offence, it is just an example.) or XYZ Steel Manufacturing Corporation Limited or LMN International Trading Services India Private Limited, you could merely use MRBMN, XYZ or LMN. Brevity makes it much easier to read, understand and correlate. A definition   can also   expand or restrict the simple, commonly known or dictionary meaning of any word or term to cater to a particular agreement. This means a definition may be specific to a particular transaction or agreement. A   Dollar   may   signify   different   currency   to   different   people—US   Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, etc. While using the term “Dollar” in an agreement, you need to specify as to which currency you are referring to and be consistent throughout with the usage. A definition may not only refer to a single person, event or a document but can also serve as a collective / common reference to many persons, events, documents, etc.  Examples : “Buyers” can include multiple parties. “Documents” can include multiple documents. “Transactions” can include several transactions. “Events” can include several past or future events.",
  "Chapter 14]   Part 5—Drafting an Agreement   69  Therefore, it is quite common to define parties, authorities, conditions, name of documents, business terms, mechanical processes, etc. in agreements—whatever term is long or includes multiple parties, documents, transactions, events, etc. and needs brevity and ease of reference. Similarly, definitions tend to make interpretation and reading of an agreement simpler and concise and reduce ambiguity. A defined term used anywhere in the agreement refers to the defined person, document, transaction, event, entity or process. Definitions provide consistency of reference throughout the agreement. The reader is sure of the meaning of a defined term, once he understands it. For example, if XYZ Steel Manufacturing Corporation Limited is defined as “the Company” in the definition clause, wherever the term “the Company” is used, it refers to XYZ Steel Manufacturing Corporation Limited and no other company. Similarly, a person, condition or process could also be defined. If, however, the defined term is used carelessly in the agreement, it confuses the reader and defeats the very purpose for which the term was defined. For example, if the term “Company” is defined and at several places the terms Company and the company are used, the reader cannot decipher as to which references are to the defined entity and which are not. The objective of defining the term is defeated in such a case. Let us discuss some useful aspects / tips in respect of definitions:  Define a term only if you are using it in the agreement  Do not define a term unless you use it in the agreement. It is a familiar sight (if you ever notice) that an agreement’s definition clause is flooded with too many definitions only to find that many of them are not used anywhere in the agreement. This can happen when you take the text from a template and use it without ensuring that it has a connect with the subject of the agreement. All agreements have different subject matter and the definitions in it should be specific to that particular agreement. This can also be a result of using multiple templates and assembling their definitions—and not all the clauses or defined terms are used in your draft. This can also happen if an agreement goes several rounds of negotiation and certain clauses (which may have contained the defined term) are deleted by the end of it. Therefore, while finalising an agreement, do take care to check whether all the defined terms are used in the agreement and whether all such definitions are required in the Definitions clause. If a term is not used anywhere, delete the definition.",
  "70   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 14  Define only if you use the term more than once  Do not define a term unless it appears more than once in the agreement. Unless the term is being used time and again, there is no point defining it or assigning an acronym to it. The reader will understand the term in the relevant clause if it appears only once and will not be required to recall it elsewhere in the agreement.  Don’t define simple terms  Do not define terms which are commonly understood. Else, you will have to define each word in the agreement!  Capitalise first letter  Unless there is a strong reason for not doing so, first letter of a defined term should be capital. For example, Company, Investor, Partner, Director, Target, Licensee, Landlord, Supplier, Distributor, Principal, Employer, Franchisor, Contractor and so on.  Capitalise all words, if several words  If the definition/acronym consists of several words, all words should be capitalised except sometimes for joining words (or, and, on, in, of, for, by, with, as, at, but, except, under, over, beside, etc.). Some examples could be: Articles of Association (AoA or AOA), Terms of Engagement (ToE or TOE), Power of Attorney (PoA or POA), Terms and Conditions (T&Cs), Managing Director (MD), Return on Investment (RoI or ROI), Annual General Meeting (AGM), Government of India (GoI or GOI).  Do not define in capital letters, unless you are defining something in abbreviated form  No definition should be in all capital letters. Capital letters, by and large, mean YOU ARE SHOUTING. How would it feel to see terms like BHUMESH, COMPANY, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE, DISTRIBUTOR, LICENSEE, STOREKEEPER and the like appear in the body of an agreement with other words in lowercase? It is not a pleasant sight, isn’t it? However, where the defined term is in abbreviation of, say the name of an individual (Bhumesh Verma defined as BV), a company (XYZ India Private Limited defined as XIPL), institution (All India Institute of Medical Sciences defined as AIIMS), authority (Government of India defined as GoI), a currency (United States Dollars defined as USD) or a term (Statement of Purpose defined as SoP, Letter of Intent defined as LoI), a business term (Turn Around Time as TAT, Net Asset Value as NAV), capital letters may be used in a definition.",
  "Chapter 14]   Part 5—Drafting an Agreement   71  Don’t define something as “means and includes”  Means and includes cannot be the same. If a term means something, its meaning is restricted to that alone. If it includes something it means it includes other things in addition to the “included” thing. Thus, using both “means” and “includes” together is confusing and wrong. You should use either means or includes, depending on whether the definition is restrictive or inclusive.  Other references  As a general rule and practice, any reference to Article, Clause, Section, Exhibit, Annexure, etc. in the agreement refers to the respective article, section, exhibit, annexure, etc. of that agreement only. Therefore, if a reference is to be made to an article, clause, annexure, etc. of any other document, it should be referred to with a term starting with a small letter and not a capital letter. Alternatively, specific reference to the other document should be made along with the term. For example: 1. Article 35 of the Articles of Association. 2. Clause 7 of the Technology Transfer Agreement.  Define the terms at one place  In an agreement, we tend to define the terms at various places: 1. Introduction sentence 2. Description of the parties 3. Recitals 4.   Definition clause 5. Operative clauses 6. Annexures In such a scenario, the reader has to make an effort to capture and recapture all the definitions in the agreement. Various new definitions are introduced at different places in the agreement which causes inconvenience to the reader. It is better to provide all definitions in an agreement at one place. If a defined term is to be used multiple times in one clause, an exception can be made to define that term in the concerned clause, so that the reader doesn’t have to refer to the definition section.",
  "72   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 14  Use a defined term only after definition  A defined term should preferably not be used before its definition, as much as possible. Instead of saying “the Company as defined in Article _____ “, first a definition of the Company should be introduced in the agreement. This gives the reader an idea of the defined term before he reaches the operative clauses where the term has been used. Else, the reader has to refer to the Article defining the term, and it may so happen that the referred article may have been renumbered or deleted during several rounds of negotiations.  Stay with the definition  Once you have defined a term, stick to it throughout the agreement. For example, you have defined the Board to be the Board of Directors of XYZ India Private Limited and XYZ India Private Limited has been defined as the Company. Now, wherever in the agreement, you are referring to the Board of Directors of XYZ India Private Limited, just write “Board”. Do not write “Board of Directors”, “Board of Directors of the Company” or “Board of Directors of XYZ India Private Limited”. Use of multiple terms for the same person, entity or term creates confusion and irritation.  Definitions in a Series of documents or from another source  If several transactional documents are linked to each other and are to be read together, many terms would have the same meaning in all such documents. In such a scenario, you need not define these terms separately in each agreement. Define the terms in one major agreement and the other agreement may have a statement to the effect that the defined terms will have the same meaning as in the aforesaid major agreement. Similarly, a defined term in an agreement may take its colour from a definition provided in a Statute. For example, a “Subsidiary” as defined in the Companies Act, 2013 or “Industrial Dispute” defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. This definition would be dynamic and undergo a change, if or when there is a legislative change. However, sometimes, it means that the agreement is not a stand-alone agreement and a reader has to refer to another document or Statute, making it difficult for the reader to understand the implications.  Defining another document  If your draft refers to another agreement at several places, you should define such agreement, providing adequate details regarding the full name, execution date and parties relating to such agreement.",
  "Chapter 14]   Part 5—Drafting an Agreement   73  Example : 1. “SSPA” means the Share Subscription and Purchase Agreement dated 7th July, 2017 among ABC Limited, XYZ Limited and Mr. Anuj Chopra. If the parties to the referred agreement are exactly the same as the parties to your present agreement, you may define as under: “SSPA” means the Share Subscription and Purchase Agreement dated 7th July, 2017 among the Parties.  Define alphabetically  If you incorporate a definition clause, the terms should appear in their alphabetical order, so that it is easy to locate a particular definition. You need not number the definitions. Otherwise, if there are additions and deletions of definitions pursuant to frequent amendments in the draft or even after the execution of the agreement, the numbering will be disturbed.  Keep your client in mind  In addition to other considerations, the client’s interest should be kept in mind while defining terms. For example, while defining “Confidential Information”, take into account whether your client would be the disclosing party or the recipient party and decide whether you want a limited or expanded definition. Similarly, while defining default events, consider whether your client is more likely to be the defaulting party and define in such a manner that it is in the best interest of your client.  Define well and define only once  Your definitions should be very clear and it should be easy for the parties and readers to quickly understand what a defined word means without having to go to the definitions portion time and again. Further, you should try to define a person / entity / term only once in an agreement. Having multiple definitions for same person / entity will confuse the parties. A simple example. Ms. A is the majority shareholder of the Company XYZ Private Limited. Ms. A is also the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the said company. She is the authorised signatory in respect of the bank accounts of the company and represents the company before all statutory authorities. Ms. A agrees to sell her entire shareholding in XYZ Private Limited to Mr. B. To   carry   out   this   transaction,   the   parties   will   execute   a   Share   Purchase Agreement. The parties also agree that along with the sale of her shares in the",
  "74   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 14  company X, Ms. A will also resign as a director of the company. Once she resigns from directorship, she will cease to be a Managing Director. She will also resign from the Chief Executive Officer position. Ms. A will also cease to be authorised signatory on behalf of the company. While drafting the Share Purchase Agreement and in order to incorporate the above terms, an over-zealous draftsman may define Ms. A as the Seller, the Old / Outgoing Director, the Old / Outgoing Managing Director, the Old authorised Signatory and Mr. B as the Buyer, New / Incoming Director, the New / Incoming Managing Director, the New / Incoming Authorised Signatory, and so on. (I have actually seen this happen in some of the drafts) This must be avoided. The parties should be defined by their names (or abbreviations thereof) if they are wearing multiple hats in an agreement, as in the case cited above. It is simple and easy to understand for reader.",
  "CHAPTER 15  USE CAPITALISED TERMS JUDICIOUSLY  Chapter 15 Normally, if a term is used in an agreement with a capital letter in the beginning, we tend to correlate it with a specific term or item. Unless the term itself is too clear or is the name of a party itself, we expect it to be defined in the agreement. Once you have defined a term in the agreement, say “Company”, “Target”, “Party”, then use it judiciously throughout the agreement keeping in mind the defined meaning and not otherwise. For example, if you have defined “the Company” to mean ABC Private Limited in the agreement, wherever you write the words “the Company”, it should mean and imply only ABC Private Limited and no other entity. Therefore, throughout the agreement, the term “the Company” or “The Company” should not be used to indicate any entity other than ABC Private Limited. Similarly, reference to a “Party” in the agreement should be restricted either to any party which is a signatory to the agreement or any particular party amongst the signatories, as may be defined under the agreement. Reference to any third party should be as “party” and not as “Party”.",
  "CHAPTER 16  INTERPRETATION  Chapter 16 This clause is a bit different from the definition clause and it explains the general rules   of   construction   of   various   references   in   the   agreement.   This   need   not necessarily refer to interpretation of the defined terms.  Example : In this Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise, (i) clause and chapter headings are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not have any legal effect; (ii) where a word or phrase is defined, its other grammatical forms have a corresponding meaning; (iii) reference to a gender shall include all genders; (iv) references to this Agreement or any other document shall be construed as references to this Agreement or that document as in force for the time being and as amended, varied, substituted, supplemented, restated or novated in accordance with the terms thereof; (v) a reference to a document includes all amendments or supplements to, or replacements or novation of, that document; (vi) a reference to a party includes that party’s successors and permitted substitutes (including persons taking by novation) and assigns; (vii) words importing the singular shall include the plural and vice versa; (viii) references to clauses, articles, sections, exhibits and schedules are to be construed as references to respective clauses, articles, sections of and exhibits and schedules to, this Agreement; (ix) reference to this Agreement shall include its annexures, exhibits and schedules; (x) a deed, representation or warranty in favour of two or more persons is for the benefit of them jointly and each of them individually; (xi) references to a person shall be construed as including references to an individual, partnership firm, a limited liability partnership, consortium, company, corporation, incorporated or unincorporated body of persons or any State or any agency thereof;",
  "Chapter 16]   Part 5—Drafting an Agreement   77  (xii) reference to a day shall mean a calendar day; (xiii) the meaning of terms is not limited by specific examples introduced by expressions “including” or “for example”, or similar expressions; and (xiv) references to any legal provisions shall be construed as references to those provisions as replaced, amended or re-enacted from time to time. You should clarify by way of an interpretation clause that reference to a provision or document or a position should be construed as the original provision, document or position respectively as well as a change therein. Otherwise, you have to repeat such averments at many places in the agreement and if you miss it somewhere, it may not be construed in the same spirit and argued that wherever you wanted the changes to be included, you had specifically indicated it. To avoid such a situation, an interpretation clause like the one above helps.",
  "Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts  PART 6  OPERATIVE CLAUSES",
  "CHAPTER 1  DO NOT FORGET TO MENTION THE TRANSACTION  Chapter 1 Part 6—Operative Clauses  An agreement is about a transaction between the parties. Isn’t it? Should the transaction be mentioned in the agreement? Yes, why not? A few months back, I came across a Conveyance Deed drafted by a senior partner of one of the top Indian law firms, in respect of sale of a property. The consideration was worth a few million dollars, the draft had hundreds of covenants, terms and conditions, undertakings, representations and warranties. However, there was no mention of the words “Sale” or “Purchase” in the agreement except the description of the property in the recitals. Even the parties were not defined as Seller and Purchaser (remember first party, second party?). There was no operative clause mentioning that the parties were selling and buying the subject matter of the agreement i.e. the property. This happens with us sometimes in other spheres of life as well. You may have observed that sometimes in quiz shows or an interview for cookery, for example, when one is asked to list ingredients for ‘Dal Makhani’ or ‘Chicken Biryani’, one may get so engrossed in listing the maximum number of and most exotic ingredients for the recipe that one may miss out lentils or chicken! I have seen it happening to contestants many times. While   embellishing   an   agreement   with   multiple   provisions,   safeguards   and clauses, sometimes we either forget to put the basic aim and objective of the agreement or put it mildly or at an insignificant place, making it difficult for the reader to understand or locate it. The purpose or objective of the agreement or the essence of the transaction, by whatever name it may be called, must be mentioned at the first instance. The nature of the agreement should be mentioned in the ‘Whereas Clauses’ and thereafter, as early as possible in the ‘First Article (or Clause)’.The intention of the parties to the agreement must be clearly explained. Further, if you have already explained the nature of the transaction at one place, repetition or half-hearted mention elsewhere in the agreement, should be avoided.",
  "82   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  Sometimes, some exhibits, annexures or side letters to the main agreement may require detailed description of the transaction. In such a case, try to be precise and concise in the operative clause and refer the reader’s attention to the related attachments.  Examples:  1. The Parties hereby agree to join hands as joint venture partners to be carried by a joint venture company to manufacture steering wheels of automobiles. 2. The Seller agrees to sell the Demised Property to the Buyer and the Buyer agrees to purchase the Demised Property on the terms and conditions stipulated under this Agreement. 3. The Company hereby appoints Mr. ABC Sharma as its Chief Executive Officer and Mr. ABC Sharma accepts the said appointment. 4. XYZ Limited hereby appoints Alpha Beta Gama Private Limited as its sole selling agent in India and Alpha Beta Gama Private Limited accepts such appointment on such terms and conditions as appear hereinafter. 5. The Licensor hereby grants an exclusive license to the Licensee for manufacturing the Products in India for domestic sales as well as exports to SAARC countries.",
  "CHAPTER 2  RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES  Chapter 2 A commercial agreement is a set of promises between the parties—such promises are intended to be binding in law. These promises made by the parties define the respective rights and obligations of the parties under an agreement which are either enforced or fulfilled respectively. A contract is like a private law of the parties which allows the parties to define their relationship by demarcating the boundaries of acceptable conduct. If there is no fulfilment of obligations by a party or a party’s right is violated, the parties have to approach appropriate courts for enforcement. The courts may compel the defaulting parties to perform their respective obligations under the agreement and / or award damages for breach thereof. Contractual rights are the set of rights guaranteed to each other when parties enter into a commercial relationship. These rights invariably relate to business matters, including the provision of products and services. Few examples of contractual rights: (i) Rights to be sold products or service; (ii) Right of first refusal; (iii) Right to appoint majority directors; (iv) Right to repair and maintenance; (v) Rights to receive timely payment; (vi) Right to receive notice of any intended change in terms of the agreement; (vii) Rights to exclusivity; (viii) Right to seek compensation for non-performance; (ix) Right to terminate the agreement. These contractual rights can either be express or implied. In addition to the rights expressly incorporated in an agreement, there could also be certain implied rights, which are based on the law of contract and other legal provisions (example- consumer laws). There may not be a legal requirement to incorporate such rights in each agreement explicitly, as they are implied by specific laws on the respective subjects. These include:",
  "84   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 2  Good faith: Each party should act in good faith, must not act deceptively and should disclose all relevant information regarding the transaction. Free will, No duress: Contracts should only be formed out of the free will and informed decision of each party. A contract that is formed under duress ( i.e. , forcing one party to sign) is invalid. No misrepresentation: The parties have a right to be free from misrepresentation of information and fraudulent transaction. If a party’s contractual rights are violated, it can enforce such rights or take legal action for damages caused by the breach. The aggrieved party may also be entitled to multiple remedies, for example: (1) claim damages; (2) specific performance of the contract; (3) termination of the agreement; (4) restitution for any benefit to the breaching party. An obligation lies at the other end in the matrix of rights and obligations. One party’s right is invariably the other’s party’s obligation. The difference between rights and obligations under a contract is that the former is a benefit you derive from a contract; the other is a duty or responsibility that is cast upon a party or what a party promises to perform under the contract. Contractual obligations are those duties which a party is accountable for and responsible to perform under an agreement. These obligations can be in terms of payments, performance of certain services, supply   of   goods,   adherence   to   timelines   or   quality   standards,   cooperation   in pursuing some common objective or any other promise made to the other party. If any party fails to perform its obligations under an agreement, it is deemed a breach of contract on its part and the non-breaching party can take action against such breach. An agreement must clearly describe the respective rights and responsibilities of the parties. It should describe the activities supposed to be performed by a party towards fulfilment of its obligations, timeframes for fulfilment of the obligations, etc.   The   agreement   should   also   incorporate   terms   confirming   whether   the assignment of any obligations of a party is permitted or not. It is better to incorporate the obligations as much as possible in detail so as to set acceptable standards of fulfilment of obligations. Once the parties enter into an agreement, each party is expected to perform its obligations. Each party needs to fulfil its contractual obligations with regard to its performance for a valid discharge of the agreement. If a party fails in its obligations, the other party has multiple options to assert its rights under the contract. However, the reasons and circumstances for the failure of the defaulting party may be taken",
  "Chapter 2]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   85  into consideration. Sometimes, if an agreement has been substantially performed, then payment for any completed work done may be made with a deduction for the uncompleted work. This is the simplest way to deal with such a situation. To sum up, the provisions defining the duties and obligations are a detailed description of the duties and obligations of the parties and the deadlines for performance. The rights and obligations of the parties are determined by the terms of an agreement, subject to limits imposed by the relevant statutes. Therefore,   the   parties   must   judiciously   incorporate   respective   rights   and obligations of each party in clear and detailed terms to avoid any confusion between themselves. The process and procedure to adhere to and enforce these rights and obligations should also be clearly mentioned. The agreement should provide as to how a party will exercise its rights or seek fulfilment of the other party’s obligations within the framework of the agreement. The enforcement mechanism could either lie with the parties or a party may have to seek outside support (industry body, court, mediators, arbitration, etc.).",
  "CHAPTER 3  COVENANTS  Chapter 3 Covenant means a formal agreement (written, signed and sealed) that is legally binding. In other words, it is a promise or undertaking by a party in an agreement that certain activities will or will not be carried out. Covenants often relate to terms in a financial contract, such as a loan agreement stating the limits on end use of the loan amount and limiting the amount which the borrower can further lend to its subsidiaries. Under such covenants, a covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee. A loan covenant is a conditional clause in a commercial loan or bond agreement. Such a clause mandates that the borrower shall fulfil certain conditions, or forbids the borrower to do certain acts, or restricts certain activities to circumstances when other conditions are met. Banks   /   financial   institutions   /   VC   investors   include   covenants   in   their agreements to preserve their position and to impose restrictions on the borrower / target company / promoters to improve the likelihood that a loan will be paid back by the business owner/borrower on time, in full, and in accordance with the loan’s terms and conditions and the target company shall be run efficiently. A positive covenant is a promise to do something. A negative covenant is a promise not to do something. Loan Covenants spell out in detail what the promoter of a borrowing company agrees to do with respect to the business and capital structure of the company during the term of the loan or business line of credit. Examples of affirmative loan covenants: — pay all taxes in time; — maintain insurance policies for the business; — keep the company in good standing. Examples of negative loan covenants: — adhering to a specified debt/equity ratio; — restriction on dividends; — restriction on merger/acquisition/reorganisation. The parties to an agreement must be careful while incorporating and negotiating such covenants. In most of the cases, some or the other deviation from the covenants is bound to surface if the covenants are too many or too strict. To take care of such irregularities, steps for sound enforcement and resolution mechanism should also be provided in case the covenants are not complied with.",
  "CHAPTER 4  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT  Chapter 4 The term ‘conditions precedent’ refers to something that must happen, or a circumstance that must exist, before something else will happen. Many a times, in our day to day life, a party commits to perform its duties under the contract only after the other party has performed its part. For example, you go to buy a new TV set. The store salesman will talk to you very sweetly, show you 30 different models, offer you best deal on each one and so on. However, he will not despatch a TV set till you make the full payment (including the insurance and cartage). In this case, payment is the condition precedent for despatch of the TV set to your home / office. A condition precedent is an event or a series of events, all of which must occur, or a state of affairs that must exist, before something else will occur. In agreements which   incorporate   conditions   precedent,   a   party   is   not   obliged   to   fulfil   its obligations under the agreement, unless the stipulated conditions are met. In contract law, a   condition precedent   is an event which must occur, unless its non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due,   i.e. , before any contractual duty exists. On the other hand, a   condition subsequent   is an event or state of affairs that brings an end to something else. A   condition subsequent   is often used in a legal context as a marker bringing an end to one’s legal rights or duties. In simple words, if something is to happen before another thing, it is a condition precedent. On the other hand, if something is to happen after another, it is a condition subsequent. For example, in an acquisition agreement, the conditions precedent for closure could be: (i) Satisfactory financial and legal due diligence of the target company; (ii) Valuation report by merchant bankers; (iii) Approval by the board of acquiring company and the target company; (iv) Approval by shareholders, bankers, lenders of the target company;",
  "88   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 4  (v) Approval from any government authorities required for the proposed acquisition; and (vi) Delivery of audited financial results of the target company till the cut-off date. Only once the aforesaid fall in place, the transaction goes through. It should be noted that the obligation to fulfil different components of conditions precedent may be cast on different parties. In the above example, some obligations can be cast on the investee company, some on the investor, and some jointly on the investee company and its shareholders. Sometimes, such obligation for satisfying a condition precedent could be shared by multiple parties. For example, in a case where a foreign investor is desirous of investment in an Indian company operating in the Insurance sector where,   inter alia , the approval of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India is required for any foreign investment, the obligation of obtaining the said approval is cast jointly on all parties (investors, Indian joint venture partner and Indian Insurance company) because each party’s cooperation is required for seeking and obtaining this approval. While drafting a condition precedent clause, you must take care to identify the party on whom the obligation to fulfil a particular condition is imposed. This is vital as each party is responsible to fulfil its own obligations in relation to the conditions precedent. In M&A transactions, usually certain obligations on the target company are also cast upon its existing shareholders/promoters, as they are in control of the operations and management of the target company before the acquisition and they alone have the power to represent the target company before third parties or authorities. Another important aspect which a draftsman needs to consider is whether any of the conditions precedent can be waived. Invariably, the non-obligated party wants all conditions precedent to be met by the obligated party. However, we do not live in an ideal world where all our expectations are met. Sometimes, some conditions are not fulfilled, fully or partially. The   reasons   for   such   non-fulfilment   could   be   tight   timelines,   process, bureaucracy and others. In such situations, the parties should have the discretion and flexibility to move on and go ahead with the transaction if the conditions which are not met are not legal requirements or are not substantially material. The idea behind a party’s ability to waive any condition is to facilitate the transaction and not hold it up over small issues or delays if the parties are in sync with each other. Alternatively, the parties may extend the deadline for meeting the conditions. However, this right to waive any preconditions should be incorporated while drafting the conditions precedent provision. The draftsman has to tread very cautiously in granting this right to a party. The right to grant a waiver should lie with the non-obligated party and not on the obligated party. Otherwise, an obligated party may not be diligent in even trying to",
  "Chapter 4]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   89  fulfil its obligations to secure the condition precedent. A party not providing sufficient support or shying away from its responsibility for moving towards closure should not have the benefit of waiving any precondition. Conditions   precedent   are   private   arrangements   of   the   parties   and   their contractual rights. Therefore, the parties to an agreement may discuss and decide whether they would like to waive the conditions in part or in full. You must analyse from a legal perspective whether any such waiver is permissible and then consult your client regarding inclusion of the waiver clause.  Timeframe for meeting conditions precedent  A draftsman should always mention a date by which all the conditions precedent must be met,   i.e. , the ‘long stop date’. The idea is to ensure that the parties are aware of the deadline to fulfil the conditions and there is no delay in their performance to meeting the conditions by this date. While drafting this clause however, one must always include the following or similar words:  “Each of the Conditions Precedent mentioned in this Clause must be satisfied by _________, or any later date as may be mutually agreed by the Parties.”  A clause on the above lines gives the parties flexibility to mutually discuss, agree and extend the time for the fulfilment of the conditions. The most likely reason for a delay in fulfilment of conditions precedent is non-receipt of a government approval. If a government approval, which happens to be a condition precedent for a particular transaction is expected to take longer than originally expected by the parties, they should have the right and flexibility to extend the Closing date if they all feel the need to do so. In the absence of such a provision, if conditions precedent are not satisfied, the agreement will stand terminated and the transaction will fall through. A ‘conditions precedent’ clause should obligate the parties to ‘use all reasonable efforts’ within their control to fulfil all conditions which are their obligations. The parties must recognise that time is of the essence and the efficacy of any transaction depends on proper intent, attention and adherence to time schedules provided in the agreement. If a party is not serious enough to make efforts in respect of its obligations to fulfil the conditions precedent, its seriousness and commitment after closing will be doubtful if the party is to continue in relationship with other parties (as a partner, service provider, etc.).  Examples:  1. This Agreement shall be effective only after the Board of Directors of the Company approves this Agreement in its entirety. This Agreement shall be null and void and shall be of no force and effect if the Board does not give its approval for this Agreement for any reason whatsoever. 2. This Agreement shall not be effective until the shareholders of both the parties endorse the contents of this Agreement by way of a special",
  "90   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 4  resolution. This Agreement shall be null and void and shall be of no force and effect if the Parties fail to obtain such approvals from their respective shareholders. 3. As a condition precedent to the resignation or removal of the CEO, the Company shall pay all outstanding dues payable by the Company to the CEO pursuant to the terms of this Agreement till the effective date of resignation or removal. 4. This Agreement shall become effective as of the date first written above (the “Effective Date”) upon the satisfaction of the following conditions precedent: (a) (b) (c) .... 5. This Amendment Agreement shall   be effective subject to the following conditions: (i) approval hereof from the Boards of all the parties; (ii) confirmation from State Bank of India, ___________ branch; (iii) approval from the Ministry of Telecommunications to the proposed amendments; and (ii) the execution of this Agreement by authorised representatives of all the parties. 6. The Service Provider shall be required to perform its obligations under this Agreement only if all the outstanding dues payable to it are cleared by 30 August, 2017.",
  "CHAPTER 5  CLOSING DELIVERABLES  Chapter 5 The closing provision should specify what actions, formalities and steps would be taken up at the closing. Usually a closing meeting is held to consummate a commercial transaction particularly in investment transactions. The parties should discuss the modalities and incorporate suitable provisions. For example, in an agreement dealing with transfer / issue of shares, the parties should,  inter alia , incorporate the following in the closing clause: (i) the date for closing; (ii) the venue for closing; (iii) requirement of presence of parties’ nominees; (iv) documents to be submitted at closing; (v) documents to be executed; (vi) payments to be made; (vii) resignation of seller’s nominees from the board; (viii) appointment of the buyer’s nominees on the board; (ix) holding of board / shareholders’ meeting; (x) agenda for board / shareholders meeting; (xi) amendment of Memorandum / Articles of Association; (xii) entrusting the buyer’s nominees with authorities; (xiii) revocation of authorities to seller’s nominees; (xiv) any records to be updated; (xv) issue / endorsement of share certificates in the name of buyer. The above can be further split into separate action items to be undertaken by different / all parties. As discussed earlier in case of conditions precedent, the parties should have the leverage to extend the Closing date by mutual agreement or waive any closing formalities, if need be.",
  "CHAPTER 6  POST-CLOSING FORMALITIES  Chapter 6 Post-closing literally means after closing. It is a term for acts, deeds and things that are to take place after the closing of the agreement has taken place and the transaction is through. After the contemplated closing under the agreement, the transaction or the relationship is initiated. However, there could be certain documentation, recording, filings, intimations that are required. For example, in a share acquisition agreement, the following may be post-closing activities: (i) Issue / Allotment / Transfer of Shares; (ii) Making entries in statutory records of the target company; (iii) Intimation to bankers, creditors, shareholders, government authorities regarding change in authorised signatories; (iv) Getting registration of any definitive agreements; and (v) Filings with Ministry of Corporate Affairs in respect of change in the board of directors and other such matters. The Post-Closing formalities clause should fix the responsibility of the party(/ies) on which the onus of completing respective activities lies.  Examples:  1. The Parties undertake to diligently complete each of the post-closing obligations and/or deliver to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company all   documents,   instruments,   agreements   and   information   listed   in Clause 7.5, on or before 31st May, 2017. 2. As a material inducement to Agent and Lenders entering into and performing their respective obligations under this Agreement, Borrower hereby agrees to complete delivery and/or performance of each item set forth in Schedule 4.15 hereto on or prior to the date indicated with respect thereto in Schedule 4.15. 3. The Target shall complete, and shall cause other Parties to complete, each   of   the   post-closing   obligations   and/or   deliver   each   of   the documents, instruments, agreements and information listed in Annexure 4 (the Post-Closing Obligations), on or before the date set forth for each such item thereon (as may be extended by the intended recipient in its sole discretion), each of which shall be completed or provided in form and substance satisfactory to the concerned recipient.",
  "CHAPTER 7  PAYMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT  Chapter 7 Commercial agreements invariably include an element of money as consideration to be paid by one party to the other. It is a question of who, whom, when, where, how, in what currency, etc. The agreement should provide the frequency, timing, mode and currency for any payments, penalties, etc. to be made under the agreement. Any penal liability for delay of payment should also be quantified (in terms of interest rate or amount). The agreement should indicate whether the payments / amounts specified under the agreement are inclusive of taxes or not. If any applicable taxes, duties, out of pocket expenses, etc. are to be charged over and above the consideration mentioned in the agreement, there should be a clear indication in this regard. Adequate   scope   should   be   kept   for   deduction   of   applicable   taxes,   as   the responsibility of paying the taxes falls on the paying party under most tax laws. If there is a failure to withhold and / or deposit tax, the party responsible for it will be in deep trouble. The responsibility of withholding and depositing tax amounts with concerned government authorities should be fixed on the party responsible to do so.. Such party is also required under law to issue a certificate regarding deposit of tax to the other party. The circumstances under which a party shall be entitled to deduct or withhold a part of the amount payable to the other party should be mentioned.  Examples:  1. The Advisor shall submit a monthly invoice by 7th day of each month for his services rendered during the preceding month to the Company. The Company shall make payment in United States Dollars within 7 (seven) days of receipt of such invoice by way of an account payee cheque in favour of the Advisor. All the payments made under this Agreement shall be subject to deduction of tax at source under applicable tax laws. The Company shall provide the certificate of such deduction and deposit of tax with the authorities within the timelines stipulated under relevant laws.",

(twelve percent per annum) for the period of delay. 2. Any payments to the Licensor under this Agreement shall be made through proper banking channels within 14 (fourteen) days of every calendar month. Such payments shall be subject to withholding of applicable taxes as required under Indian laws. The Licensee shall ensure that such withheld amount is deposited with appropriate authorities at the earliest. The Licensee shall provide documentary evidence of the withholding and deposit of the subject amount with appropriate authorities within 30 (thirty) days of withholding. 3. All payments to be made under this Agreement shall be made through wire transfer in a designated bank account of the Payee in Indian Rupees. If any payment required to be made on a day that is not a Business Day, shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. 4. The Service Provider shall submit his monthly invoice for the Services to the Company along with description of services, billing period, volume and rate for different components of Services. The Company shall pay the amount within 15 (fifteen) days of receipt of the invoice, unless it raises a dispute within such period, in a bank account designated by the Service Provider in his invoice. 5. The Agent shall send his invoices on a calendar quarter basis and the Principal shall pay within 15 (fifteen) days of receipt thereof. Any late payments shall bear interest of 9% (nine percent) per annum for the period of delay.",
  "CHAPTER 8  LOCK-IN  Chapter 8 Lock-in period means to be unable to change or modify the conditions of an agreement and be bound by the terms for a certain period. When the parties agree for a term prescribing a time period within which one or more parties cannot terminate the agreement, such arrangement is called the lock-in clause. If a party terminates the agreement during the agreed lock-in period, it is required to pay compensation for the remaining duration of lock-in period irrespective of the termination and non-usage of benefits of the agreement. Any presumptive loss incurred by the non-breaching party due to premature termination gets compensated by the payment clause in this agreement. Therefore, it cannot claim any more damages or costs from the breaching party. The underlying idea behind a lock-in clause is to ensure that a party is not irrevocably bound by the clause provided it compensates the non-breaching party. Common   examples   of   lock-in   are   found   in   lease   agreements   and   service agreements. Even in share acquisition or joint venture agreements, one or more parties may be required not to sell their holding for a particular period of time. You may also have observed that you have to pay a penalty for pre-closure of any loan provided by a bank or financial institution. A lock-in could be for the entire duration of an agreement or only a part of it. This period actually depends on the respective bargaining powers of the parties. The party with better bargaining powers usually imposes its conditions on the other party. Further, the lock-in may operate against one party or some or all the parties, depending on the nature of the agreement and negotiation among the parties. A lock-in clause,   inter alia , stipulates the duration of the lock-in period as well as the remedy in case of breach of the lock-in commitment.  Examples:  1.   (a) The Parties agree that the Tenant cannot terminate the lease during the first 3 (three) years of the lease term (“the Lock-in Term”), except in case of a material breach on part of the Landlord or a force majeure event.",
  "96   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 8  (b) The Tenant shall have the right to terminate the lease at any time for a material breach or force majeure event with a prior written   notice   of   30   (thirty)   days   to   the   Landlord, notwithstanding the Lock-in Term agreed above. (c) However, if the Tenant terminates the lease during the Lock-in Term for a reason other than a material breach or force majeure event   and   citing   no   reason,   he   shall   pay   the   rent   for   the remaining portion of the Lock-in term. (d) after the expiry of the Lock-in Term, either Party shall be entitled to terminate the lease without assigning any reason with a 30 (thirty) days prior written notice to the other Party. 2. The Employee undertakes not to sell or transfer any shares of the company issued to him under the Employee Stock Option Scheme (“ESOP”) for a period of 3 (years) of such issue. 3. The Parties agree not to sell, hypothecate, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares or other security of the Joint Venture Company to a third party for a period of 2 (two) years from the date of issue thereof except Permitted Transfers under Article 7.1 of this Agreement.",
  "CHAPTER 9  REMEDIAL ACTIONS, IF PERMITTED  Chapter 9 The parties to an agreement are supposed to fulfil their respective obligations under the agreement. This is the basic premise behind every agreement, written or otherwise. However, if a party fails to do so, it amounts to a breach (or a material breach, if so defined under the agreement) and may give a right to the non-breaching party to terminate the agreement with or without serving a notice period. The agreement should clarify whether the right of the non-breaching party to terminate the agreement is absolute or is it possible: (i) for the breaching party to seek time to cure any defect, shortfall or failure, if possible; or (ii) the non-breaching party to insist on removing or rectifying the aforesaid defect, shortfall or failure. The provision should also indicate if the non-breaching party shall be entitled to reduce the consideration in view of the breach or delay in performance of the breaching party’s performance.  Example:  1. Any time during the term of the lease, if there is any release or discharge of any hazardous materials due to Lessee’s manufacturing activities at the Demised Premises which is in violation of any environmental laws, the Lessee shall be solely responsible for the legal consequences. 2. The Lessee agrees to investigate, clean up, remove or take remedial action in   respect   of   such   hazardous   materials   in   accordance   with   the requirements of: (a) applicable environmental laws; and (b) State Pollution Control Board and / or any other authority in charge of or dealing with environmental laws.",
  "CHAPTER 10  CONFIDENTIALITY  Chapter 10 Parties   to   an   agreement   share   a   lot   of   information   with   each   other   during negotiation and thereafter while drafting of the agreement. Sometimes, this disclosure is one-sided,   i.e. , only one party shares its information. For example, a Target company will be sharing a lot of information with potential suitors in a Share Acquisition transaction. On the other hand, there could be situations where both or all the parties share their respective information with each other. An example could be a potential joint venture transaction. This   information   sharing   could   potentially   encompass   highly   sensitive information about the parties’ respective business, employees, revenue streams, clients,   pricing,   technical   knowhow,   processes,   business   plans,   contemplated ventures, intellectual property rights, market sensitive information, existing and potential bids, etc. Such information is not usually available to third parties. Each   party   has   its   own   respective   history,   strengths,   strategies,   business projections,   etc.   Many   a   times,   parties   bind   their   employees,   contractors, consultants, etc. for protection of such information by executing a non-disclosure agreement with such parties. It is therefore, imperative that disclosure of such information to a third party is not in the usual course of business for the disclosing party. The disclosing party is always worried about misuse of confidential information by the receiving party and / or making unauthorised disclosures to any third parties as well. In fact, invariably, when parties start negotiating a commercial agreement which involves a high level of sensitive information sharing between the parties, first of all they execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement. Once their negotiations reach a logical conclusion, they execute the commercial agreement. A confidentiality or non-disclosure clause in an agreement binds the receiving party to ensure that information marked or defined as confidential information should remain confidential, secret and not disseminated in a manner otherwise than that agreed to in the agreement.",
  "Chapter 10]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   99  In this regard, a basic standard of care is expected from the receiving party - to be as careful with the confidential information as the receiving party is about its own confidential information. The commercial agreement should provide for tight non-disclosure norms. The idea is to protect accidental as well as intentional disclosure of sensitive information. There could even be a stand-alone Non-Disclosure Agreement, subject to mutual discussion and comfort level of the parties. The Confidentiality clause should,   inter alia , contain the following: (i) Definition of Confidential information; (ii) Duration   of   non-disclosure   (during   and   /   or   after   the   expiry   / termination of the agreement); (iii) Permitted exclusions; (iv) Process   of   discussion   with   the   disclosing   party,   if   disclosure   is   a compulsion for the receiving party, under a legal process or otherwise; (v) Remedies for breach. Most of the times, where the information disclosed is very sensitive and important, the disclosing party wants to impose a very heavy cost for any breach of the confidentiality provisions on the receiving party to make it a disincentive for the receiving party. Therefore, provisions relating to (i) availability of cumulative remedies   to   the   disclosing   party;   and   (ii)   exemplary,   punitive   and   liquidated damages imposed on the breaching party are incorporated in the agreement. You should gauge the nature, importance and sensitivity of the confidential information being exchanged in the current context and advise parties of suitable clauses in this regard accordingly.  Example:  Confidential Information  (a)   Exposure . The Agent acknowledges that in the ordinary course of his engagement with the Company, he will be exposed to Confidential Information   about   the   business   of   the   Company   and   that   of   its employees, suppliers, and customers which amounts to a trade secret, is confidential or is commercially sensitive and which may not be readily and legally available to any third parties engaged in a similar business to that of the Company or to the general public and/or which, if disclosed, would be liable to cause significant harm to the Company. (b)   Definition . In this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” shall mean and include all information and data relating to the purpose which is obtained, whether in writing, pictorially, in machine readable form, on compact disc, electronic mail, postal mail or orally in connection with or",
  "100   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 10  during the course of the agency engagement (including but without limitation, financial information, schematics, trade secrets, technology, customer   lists   (potential   or   actual),   Intellectual   Property   and   other customer-related   information,   supplier   information,   sales   statistics, market intelligence, marketing and other business strategies and other commercial information of a confidential or proprietary nature.  Provided   that   Confidential   Information   shall   not   include   any information which falls under one or more categories below: (i) is in or comes into the public domain without breach of this Agreement by the Agent; (ii) was in the possession of the Agent prior to receipt from the Company   and   was   not   acquired   by   the   Agent   from   the Company under an obligation of confidentiality or non-use; (iii) is acquired by the Agent from a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality or non-use to the Company; (iv) is approved for release or use by written authorisation from the Company; (v) is required to be disclosed by the Agent at the request of or at the express direction of any authorised Governmental or Judicial Agency. However, the burden of proving that the Confidential Information, which is disclosed is covered within one of the exceptions set forth in this clause, shall be on the Agent. In the event of a dispute between the Parties regarding the applicability of one of the exceptions set forth above, the Agent shall maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information until a final and non- appealable   arbitration   award   and/or   a   final,   non-appealable   court judgment is granted. (c) Non-Disclosure and Non-Use. Unless otherwise agreed to in advance and in writing by the Company, the Agent shall not, except as required by law or a court order, use the Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than the performance of the Services under this Agreement or disclose the Confidential Information to any third party. The Agent shall also keep secret and not at any time either during his engagement with the Company, and 2 (two) years after its termination or expiry (as the case may be), for whatever reason, use, communicate or reveal to any person for his own or another’s benefit, any Confidential Information. The Agent shall also use his best endeavours to prevent the publication or disclosure of any such information. The Agent shall not carry / take out any Confidential Information with him outside the offices of the Company, except for   bona fide   official purposes, with prior intimation to the Company.",
  "Chapter 10]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   101  (d) Protection of Confidential Information. In case the Agent comes to know   of   any   misuse   or   wrongful   disclosure   of   any   Confidential Information, he shall provide the Company with prompt written notice thereof so that the Company may seek (with the cooperation and reasonable efforts of the Agent) a protective order, injunctive relief, confidential treatment or other appropriate remedy. (e) Return of Confidential Information. At any time during the validity of the Agreement or on expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Company may require the Agent to return all Confidential Information disclosed to him. Immediately upon the request of Company, the Agent shall: (i) Return all Confidential Information including, but not limited to,   all   originals,   copies,   reproductions   and   summaries   of Confidential Information; and (ii) Destroy all copies of Confidential Information in his possession, power or control, which are present on magnetic media, optical disk or other storage device, in a manner that ensures that the Confidential Information is rendered unrecoverable. The   Agent   shall   certify   to   the   Company   that   he   has   returned   or destroyed such Confidential Information within two (2) days of such a request being made by the Company.",
  "CHAPTER 11  EXCLUSIVITY / RESTRICTIONS  Chapter 11 In many service and commercial agreements, a party may give the other an exclusive right to deal with its products / services. On the other end of the spectrum, a party may like to restrict the other from operating in same / allied field with other parties (particularly in employment agreements / joint ventures, etc.). While drafting such a clause, you should particularly check the applicability or enforceability of such a provision   vis a vis   Competition law or contract law issues.  Examples:  1. During the term of this Agreement is in effect, the Licensor shall not operate itself nor license any other party to operate a business that competes   with   the   Licensee’s   business   in   the   Territory.   However, nothing herein shall preclude or limit the Licensor from using for itself and licensing other products or services that are not covered under Products as defined in this Agreement. The Licensor shall also continue to operate itself and through other licensees outside the Territory. 2. In exchange for good and valuable data generated at its costs as a result of this Agreement, during the Term of this Agreement, the Developer requests and the Company hereby agrees not to engage in business discussions with other parties interested in the Technology in India. 3. The Parties confirm that neither of them is currently party to any other agreement which contains terms and provisions that might impede or limit their performance of any obligation under this Agreement. They also confirm that during the term of this Agreement, they waive the right to negotiate with and enter into commercial agreements or agreements of any kind with any third parties in the same or similar line of Business as contemplated under this Agreement.",
  "CHAPTER 12  NON-COMPETE  Chapter 12 A non-compete clause is an understanding between parties to an agreement. Under this provision, a party agrees not to compete with the other party in the same / allied field of business. When two or more parties engage in a commercial understanding, they want a commitment from each other that they will put all their energies and efforts into their venture and not elsewhere. This clause is relevant if parties are working together on a project and one of the parties gets involved in another project (either on its own or in collaboration with others) which results in a situation that the two projects are competitive, it will jeopardise the commercial viability of the former project. It is very common for an employer to insist on inclusion of this clause in employment agreements or engagement of very senior consultants / professionals on confidential or sensitive projects. Depending on the negotiation and requirement of the parties, the non-compete clause may be effective during the validity of an agreement or even for a stipulated period thereafter. For example, if a company hires a software engineer for developing a particular software. The company would like the engineer to concentrate his/her efforts solely towards developing the software during the term of her engagement with the company and not take up a competitive assignment with another entity or start developing a similar software on his/her own. If he/she engages with another competitor for a similar project, his/her value for the company dilutes as the company may not get the desired commercial value from the software. These clauses are more common in agreements related to employment, agency, distributorship, franchise, joint venture or technical collaborations in particular. In case of some relationships, the non-compete obligation could apply to both or all the parties, whereas in the others only one party may be subjected to it. Any agreement in restraint of trade is void under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed to safeguard the interest of the parties. The stipulations in a non-compete clause, therefore, will have to stand up to the scrutiny of the courts, if need be.",
  "104   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 12  A non-compete clause can be a pre-condition in many commercial agreements, being the most critical element in certain business deals. The   parties   may   even   execute   an   independent   and   separate   non-compete agreement instead of a non-compete clause in a definitive commercial agreement, if the exclusivity of the service provider is of foremost importance.  Examples:  1. During the course of his employment with the Company, the Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, serve as a partner,   employee,   consultant,   officer,   agent,   associate,   investor   or otherwise with any business in competition with or otherwise similar to the Company’s business. 2. During the course of his employment with the Company and for a period of 2 (two) years thereafter, the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, advice, manage or render services to any person or entity engaged in a business activity which is competitive to that of the Company. 3. The Advisor undertakes that at any time during the subsistence of the engagement with the Company and 1 (one) year thereafter, he shall not and shall cause his affiliates and representatives not to, carry on or engage in, directly or indirectly, whether as principal or director or through partnership or as a shareholder, joint venture partner, collaborator, consultant or agent or in any other manner whatsoever, whether for profit or otherwise, any business which competes directly or indirectly with the whole or any part of the business carried on by the Company or any activity related to the business carried on by the Company, whether by using the confidential information of the Company or otherwise. 4. The Designer undertakes that at any time during his engagement with the Company and for 3 (three) months thereafter, he shall not provide the same services to a competitor of the Company whether by using the confidential information of the Company or otherwise. 5. For the duration of this Agreement and for 3 (three) months after the termination or expiry thereof, for any reason, the Marketing Agent shall not work as an employee, partner, adviser, agent or in any capacity with any competitor of the Company in India.",
  "CHAPTER 13  NON-SOLICITATION  Chapter 13 Solicitation of business means to seek business from new or potential clients. Normally, a business does this by advertising and making the world aware of its products and services. However, by solicitation, a client’s attention is sought by directly asking clients to buy goods or services. This   model   is   mostly   adopted   by   freelance   professionals   and   independent businesses. They engage in approaching the potential clients directly and ask them for business. Certain professions, like legal profession in India, are barred from approaching the clients and seeking business by soliciting. Solicitation can also happen in respect of poaching employees of an organisation, if one gets access to them. Such employees can provide useful inputs to their new employer about the pricing, clients, resources, leads, business model, technical information, etc. of the old employer. Employees having access to confidential information of a successful organisation are in much demand for these reasons. The loss due to such unethical practices is immeasurable for the affected entity. To avoid losing business from their existing or potential clients or losing their employees to competition, many organisations insist on non-solicitation clause in their commercial agreements. By such a clause, they bind the other party (employee, business associate, joint venture partner) not to solicit business from their clients or entice their employees to join another entity. A company is always at risk in respect of losing its clients or star employees to an ex-employee who has access to these people. Such ex-employee may, on his own or upon an incentive by his new employer, divert the old employer’s clients or employees to the new employer. Therefore, it is quite common for a company to ask its employee to undertake that after his employment with the company comes to an end, he shall: (i) not solicit the company’s clients, for his own benefit or for a competitor’s benefit; and (ii) not engage with any other employee of the company in any capacity.  Examples:  1. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of 6 (six) months after the expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Employee agrees not to, directly or indirectly:",

During the validity of this Agreement, the Contractor shall not, either directly or indirectly, solicit, recruit, induce, encourage or attempt to solicit, recruit, induce or encourage any employee of the Company or its Affiliates who work, or at any time within 6 (six) months prior to the termination or expiry of this Agreement, worked on matters involving the Project to terminate his employment relationship with the Company or its Affiliates, as the case may be, and become employed by the Contractor or his Affiliates. However, the restriction contained herein shall not apply if such an employee is hired in usual course of the Contractor’s   business   in   response   to   an   advertisement   or   general solicitation disseminated by the Contractor. 3. From and after the Effective Date of this Agreement until one (1) year after   termination   or   expiration   of   this   Agreement   for   any   reason whatsoever, neither Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, without the other Party’s prior written consent, solicit the employment of any employee (or former employee bound by a non-competition obligation) of the other Party or its Affiliates with whom it has come in contact during the course of implementation of or in conducting activities under this Agreement. However, such restriction shall not apply to: (i) a   general   advertisement   in   normal   course   of   business   or   a solicitation program that is not specifically targeted at such persons; and (ii) the solicitation of any such employee after a lapse of 6 (six) months after such employee’s employment has been terminated by the other Party or its Affiliate for any reason whatsoever. 4.

  "CHAPTER 14  DAMAGES  Chapter 14 Contracts stipulate respective rights and obligations of the contracting parties. These rights and obligations go hand in hand – i.e., obligation of a party is the corresponding right of the other party.  Very often, we observe that unknowingly or deliberately, one or more parties to a contract do not fulfil their part of the bargain and do not fulfill the contractual terms in letter and spirit. Such breach results in violation of the rights of the non- defaulting party and, consequently, causes monetary loss.  There must be some deterrent against the breach of contractual terms. This is captured in the form of penalty clause in the agreement in form of monetary compensation payable by the defaulting party. This remedy is called Damages.   The intent is to compensate the non-defaulting party for the loss suffered on account of the breach of the terms of the agreement.  Typically, the following variants of damages are awarded in case of breach of contract: (i) Compensatory damages (ii) Restitution (iii) Liquidated damages (iv) Nominal damages  (v) Quantum Meruit  (vi) Remedies in Equity (vii) Punitive Damages Generally, damages may be classified into two categories, namely compensatory and punitive. Invariably, we understand both compensatory as well punitive damages under the broad head of ‘damages.’ However, when we refer to compensatory damages, we could also refer to it as ‘actual damages.’ These ‘actual damages’ may be subject to proof and would not include any punitive component. Compensatory damages seek to merely compensate the affected party for actual loss or injury, rather than punishing the defaulting party. Punitive damages on the other hand are used as a punishment for the defaulting party and the idea is to provide a deterrent. Sometimes, the amount of damages could be quantified in",
  "Chapter 14]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   109  terms of a multiple of a factor e.g., double rent after expiry / termination of lease, thrice the consultancy fee for any material breach, etc. Generally, damages are compensatory in nature unless the breach is established to be deliberate and wilful. It may also differ from case to case, whether monetary penalty is adequate to compensate the affected party and put it in a condition which it would have been, had the default not taken place or whether specific performance should be insisted. We will see various methods of providing remedies to an affected party in the next few chapters.",
  "CHAPTER 15  LIQUIDATED DAMAGES  Chapter 15 Non-compliance or breach of an obligation by a party causes loss to the non- breaching party. In order to encourage parties to be compliant and disincentivise any breaches, sometimes the parties pre-determine the amount of damages required to be paid in case of a default, non-compliance, breach and the like. Liquidated damages   (sometimes also referred to as   liquidated   and ascertained  damages) are damages   whose amount the parties stipulate during the negotiation of an agreement for the non-breaching or injured party to collect as compensation upon a specific breach ( e.g. , failure to perform or delayed performance). The underlying idea behind a liquidated damages clause is not to punish the defaulting party, but simply to have a disincentive for non-compliance. The sum agreed under this clause may not be astronomical or catastrophic for the breaching party, but high enough to make it see sense in complying. The underlying intention is more towards making the parties compliant, rather than penalising them for non- compliance. A liquidated damages clause can be a useful tool in a contract to reduce uncertainty on important issues and the time and resources spent on potential disputes. Liquidated damages clauses specify the amount of damages to be paid by the breaching party in the event of certain types of breach as defined in the contract by the parties. The amount of liquidated damages represents the contracting parties’ best estimate as to the amount of anticipated or actual damages that would be incurred by the non-breaching party in the event of a specified breach of the contract by the other party. There are steps you can take to determine the amount of the liquidated damages and draft your agreement in such a manner that the courts uphold the liquidated damages provision. Contracting parties typically agree to liquidated damages where the damages would otherwise be uncertain or difficult to prove or calculate. Courts will generally uphold a liquidated damages clause that is reasonable in the context of the case and will consider several factors in determining whether such clause is reasonable, including the following:        Whether the damages in question are difficult to calculate at the time of contracting due to indefiniteness or uncertainty, or are difficult to prove;",
  "Chapter 15]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   111        Whether the amount of liquidated damages is a reasonable forecast of the actual damages that would be or have been caused by the type of breach in question. While evaluating the foregoing factors, if a court finds the liquidated damages amount to be excessive or that actual damages would have been easy to calculate at the time of contracting, the related contract provision will be considered a penalty and, therefore, could be held to be void. In order to pass muster by the courts, the liquidated damages clause should specify the contracting parties’ reasoning for employing a liquidated damages provision, the reasonableness of the amount of such damages, and the provision’s relation with other damages provisions. A liquidated damages clause should,   inter alia , include the following:        What types of breaches trigger the liquidated damages provision;        Why are the parties agreeing to liquidated damages ( i.e. , why the actual damages caused by the type of breach in question would be difficult to calculate at the time of drafting, uncertain, or otherwise difficult to prove);        The   amount   of   liquidated   damages   or   a   formula   to   calculate   the liquidated damages in the event of the type of breach in question;        The intent of the parties that the liquidated damages amount be a fair estimate of the actual damages suffered in the event of the type of breach in question;        In the event of a breach that triggers the liquidated damages provision, the liquidated damages are the exclusive remedy of the non-breaching party ( i.e. , make sure that if your contract has a cumulative remedies provision, it does not apply to breaches that trigger the liquidated damages provision and associated remedy). If seen as an enforceable liquidated damages clause, the courts will not look into actual damages suffered by a party to make it entitled to claim such damages. For this reason, it is important to carefully draft liquidated damages clause in your agreements.  Examples:  1. (a) The Contractor acknowledges that its failure to complete the Project within the stipulated period shall cause the Company to incur substantial economic damages and losses. The kind and amounts of such losses may be impossible to be calculated and ascertained as a basis for recovery by the Company of actual damages and liquidated damages may represent a fair, reasonable and appropriate estimate thereof. (b) Accordingly, in lieu of actual damages for such delay, the Contractor agrees that liquidated damages may be assessed and recovered by the Company as against the Contractor, in the event of delayed completion",
  "112   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 15  and without the Company being required to present any evidence of the amount or character of actual damages sustained by reason thereof. (c) The Contractor, therefore, shall be liable to the Company for payment of liquidated damages in the amount of Rs. 5,00,000 (Rupees five lakhs only) for each day that the completion of the Project is delayed beyond the stipulated time. (d) The   stipulated   time   shall   be   subject   to   any   adjustment   for   time extensions provided under this Agreement. Such liquidated damages are intended to represent only estimated damages and are not intended as a penalty, and the Contractor shall pay them to the Company without limiting the Company’s right to terminate this agreement for default as provided under this Agreement. 2. (a) The Parties acknowledge that the actual damages likely to result from a material breach of any provision of this Agreement may be difficult to ascertain on the date of execution of this Agreement and may be difficult for the Company to calculate and prove in the event of a material breach by the Contractor. (b) Therefore, the Parties agree that the payment of liquidated damages in the amount of Rs. 50,000,000 (Rupees fifty million only) shall serve as a fair compensation to the Company for any damages sustained. (c) The aforesaid amount does not represent any penalty and the Contractor agrees to pay this amount for any material breach. 3. (a) The Parties are aware that the Company shall have an absolute right to terminate the employment of the CEO at any time during the term of this Agreement. It would be difficult to estimate the damages suffered by the CEO in case of an early termination of his employment for any reason. (b) Therefore, the Company and the CEO hereby agree that a sum of Rs 50,000,000   (Rupees   fifty   million   only)   shall   represent   a   fair compensation to the CEO for loss of his office and this payment shall be received by CEO as liquidated damages and full and final settlement of all his claims against the Company for the termination of employment and otherwise.",
  "CHAPTER 16  TERRITORY  Chapter 16 The agreement may be limited in scope of its operation in respect of a particular territory. A manufacturer may give distributorship of its products to different entities / individuals for specific territories. An Indian manufacturing company may give distribution rights for domestic sale of its goods to a distributor and retain the right to export outside India. Similarly,   a   foreign   company   may   appoint   an   Indian   company   to   be   the distributor for its products in India. A global cold drinks company may have a different joint venture partner in each country for bottling its products. The appointee in this case can operate within the defined territory and not outside. The legality or otherwise of such provisions should be checked keeping the governing law in mind and suitable provisions should be incorporated. In the absence of any jurisdictional limits in the agreement, the agreement could be assumed to have universal operation.  Example:  1. The Franchisor appoints the Franchisee as its exclusive worldwide Master Franchisee. 2. The rights granted to the Distributor under this Agreement are granted for the following geographical areas and markets: (a) (b) (c) .... 3. The Company hereby appoints the Distributor to act as the Company’s exclusive Master Distributor of the Products within the geographical territory defined as under (the “Territory”): (a)",

  "CHAPTER 17  COSTS AND EXPENSES ALLOCATION  Chapter 17 When you go out for food or drinks with friends, you should have a clear understanding as to who is footing the bill. Else, there could be disharmony of extremes, sometimes each one wanting to pay and sometimes, none coming forward to pay. Many friendships go sour on this count, if a particular person never pays up his due share. Similarly, there are always costs attached to execution of an agreement and its implementation. The agreement should specify as to which party shall pay expenses related to the agreement or transactions contemplated thereunder ( e.g. , stamp duty, professional fees, registration fees, etc.). If different parties are to pay separate heads, that must also be specified. In the alternative, the parties may share the cost proportionately. For example, generally the lessee / buyer pays all costs related to the lease / purchases   of   property.   In   acquisition   agreements,   it   is   quite   common   that transaction costs (including those of the acquirer) are loaded on the target company. Under loan agreements, the borrower is supposed to bear all the expenses. Coverage of this aspect is necessary to make the parties aware of the costs involved with the execution of the agreement and transactions and their cost sharing ratio and take a conscious call or negotiate, if need be. Certain agreements have considerable costs in terms of registration, stamp duty, etc. In the absence of this provision, sometimes each party is relaxed that the other party will take care of the expenses.  Examples:  1. Costs and expenses. The Borrower agrees to pay on demand, all costs and expenses in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this Loan Agreement, including stamp duty, registration charges, reasonable fees and out of pocket expenses of outside counsel for the Lender. 2. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including fees and other disbursements   to   its   own   accountants   and   lawyers)   incurred   in connection with the negotiation, preparation and closing under this Agreement and all incidental matters. 3. Except as may be expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, each party shall bear all costs and expenses associated with the performance of such party’s obligations hereunder. 4. Each Party shall pay its own costs and expenses in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and any other related documents and instruments to be delivered under this agreement.",
  "CHAPTER 18  INDEMNIFICATION AND EXONERATION— DIFFERENCE FROM GUARANTEE  Chapter 18 Indemnity means   s ecurity or protection against a loss or other financial burden. Exoneration   means   the   action   of   officially   absolving   someone   from   blame; vindication. Indemnification clause is a provision in an agreement under which one party (or both / all parties) commits to compensate the other (or each other) for any harm, liability, or loss arising out of the agreement. Generally, a party undertakes to indemnify the other in cases wherein the former is at fault. This clause could also be used to absolve a party from any responsibility for damage   or   other   liability   arising   from   the   commercial   transaction   under   the agreement. Sometimes, the formula   to calculate the amount of compensation towards indemnity is also incorporated in the agreement. An Indemnification clause acts as an inter-party insurance policy, shifting risk and liability between the parties. It does so by creating the obligation that one party (the   Indemnitor)   will   pay   for   losses   the   other   party   becomes   liable   for   (the Indemnitee), either for any losses related to the agreement, or for losses from certain types of claims. A separate obligation, also commonly included in the Indemnification clause, is Defence, where the Indemnitor will not only pay the losses of the Indemnitee, but will defend (by hiring a lawyer to defend) the Indemnitee against the claim in court. Indemnity can be limited not only to losses from certain types of claims, but also to certain amounts of losses. Indemnification clause varies from simple indemnification obligation for basic, low-risk, and low-money value agreements to complex indemnification clauses agreed after elaborate negotiations. There could be limits and exclusions to the indemnification obligation and indemnification procedures built in this clause. Sometimes, guarantees and indemnities are used synonymously. However, the draftsman should understand the difference between the two so that she can draft an effective and correct clause.",
  "Chapter 18]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   117  A guarantee is a promise to be responsible for a third party’s debt or default. Thus, basic components of a guarantee are third party obligations to exist and the intention of parties to secure the performance of that obligation through the guarantor. Obligations under guarantee are secondary in nature,   i.e. , a guarantee is invoked only when the original party is unable to or fails to fulfil its obligations under the agreement. However, a guarantee obtained by concealing material facts or by misrepresentation is invalid. On the other hand, obligations under an indemnity are primary and independent of any underlying obligation. Indemnities do not require a third person who is vicariously liable.  Examples:  1. XYZ shall indemnify ABC against all losses and expenses arising out of any proceeding brought by ABC or a third party arising out of XYZ’s breach of its obligations, representations, warranties, or covenants under this agreement. 2. The Consultant shall indemnify the Client against all damages caused by the Consultant’s negligent performance of Services. The Client agrees to indemnify the Consultant against all damages caused by the Client’s negligence or mishandling. However, neither Party shall be obligated to indemnify the other for the other party’s negligence. 3. Each party (as an indemnifying party) shall indemnify the other (as an indemnified   party)   against   all   losses   arising   out   of   any   proceeding brought by the indemnified party or a third party arising out of the indemnifying party’s (i) breach of its obligations or representations or warranties; or (ii) wilful misconduct; or (iii) gross negligence. Before bringing a claim for indemnification, the indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party of the indemnifiable proceedings. If the indemnified   party   fails   to   notify   the   indemnifying   party   of   the indemnifiable   proceedings,   the   latter   will   be   relieved   of   its indemnification   obligations   to   the   extent   it   was   prejudiced   by   the indemnified party’s failure to notify. The parties’ right to indemnification is the exclusive remedy available in connection   with   the   indemnifiable   proceedings   described   in   this provision.",
  "CHAPTER 19  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  Chapter 19 This is one of the most critical components of commercial agreements. While negotiating an agreement, parties make certain submissions and statements to each other as an inducement to enter into the agreement. Although   the   terms   representations   and   warranties   are   often   used interchangeably, there is a technical distinction between them. A representation is simply a statement of fact upon which another party is expected to rely. A warranty on the other hand is a party’s assurance to the other as to facts along with a commitment to indemnify, if that fact so represented turns out to be false. Most agreements club all such statements as representations and warranties. However, there is a minor difference in the meaning of the terms in certain context— particularly in the context of dealing with the available remedies. Usually, the remedy for a breach of warranty is damages. The damages aim to put the claimant back in the position it would have been in had the warranty been true. Normally, there is no automatic termination right for the buyer on a breach of warranty and only damages are recoverable. A representation is simply a statement of fact made by a party to the other. If the other party is convinced and relies on it, it brings the parties closer to executing the agreement and initiating their relationship. A warranty on the other hand is a party’s assurance as to a particular fact along with an implied obligation to indemnify the other party, if the representation is found to be false at a later stage. Invariably, every agreement has representations and warranties from each party. Each party assures the other of its ability to enter the agreement and fulfil its obligations thereunder - this is representation. Further, each party assures the other that if anything goes wrong, the former shall compensate the latter - this is warranty. A representation generally moves from the past to the present. For example, a party informs the other party of its track record, reputation, financial status, etc. (past) and induces the latter to enter into an agreement with itself. On the other hand, a warranty mostly moves from the present to the future. The party giving aforesaid representations, warrants that its products or services shall be of good quality and the former shall fix any shortcomings therein, if need be. This",
  "Chapter 19]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   119  could be in the form of repairs, replacement or compensation, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case. Warranties may be expressed or implied. Expressed warranties are incorporated in an agreement and can be insisted upon by the receiving party. Enforcing expressed warranties is easier than those which are implied. A warranty generally moves from the present to the future. The product that you are buying is warranted as being free of defects, and the company agrees to fix any defects for a specified amount of time into the future. Some products advertise that they have a lifetime warranty. As an example, if you buy a music system with lifetime warranty, then every time it needs repair, you can send it back to the seller to be fixed. The warranty casts an obligation on the seller to repair it. Warranties can be either expressed or implied. Expressed warranties mean they are written into the agreement. Implied warranties imply that the products or services should be fit for a particular purpose. Expressed warranties, however, hold up better in a court than implied warranties. Therefore, the parties should try to incorporate as much warranties as possible in the agreement itself. When an agreement clubs the terms, representations and warranties, the terms blend   the   past,   present,   and   future   together   within   terms   of   the   agreement. Representations and warranties are assurances that one party gives to another party in an agreement. These assurances are statements that the purchasing party can rely on as true facts. The expectations of the parties in respect of warranties need to be balanced while drafting an agreement. A performing or selling party does not want to give a long rope to the other party—it does not want to offer an open-ended obligation or a bottomless pit of obligations. For example, a seller does not want the buyer to keep coming back to him claiming some deficiency or the other from time to time. The Seller may have already factored the deficiencies in negotiating the price of the goods or services. On the other hand, the service recipient or buyer wants an unrestricted assurance for maximum amount and period. It is customary particularly in acquisition transactions to withhold some part of the consideration to be paid for acquisition to take care of representations and warranties for a certain period. If the representations hold good for such period and nothing untoward happens, the remaining amount is paid to the selling party, else indemnity amount is adjusted from the amount so withheld. If the indemnity amount exceeds the withheld amount, the selling party has to make good the deficient amount. Generally, the party committing to indemnify the other party wants to limit its exposure by: Limiting the time of warranty, Limiting the instances wherein indemnity clause can be invoked,",
  "120   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 19  Limiting the amount payable, Limiting the number of occasions, a claim may be brought within, Entertaining a claim above a specified benchmark only, Imposing a deductible. The above list is illustrative only. You should discuss this aspect with the parties and draft a suitable clause balancing the expectations of the parties. Among   the   various   factors   involved   in   representations   and   warranties,   the following play an important role:        the relative strength or the negotiating position of each party;        the expectations of each party, especially where one of the parties comes from overseas where market practices may be different; and        the kind of agreement and whether or not market practice leans in one direction or the other in respect of that deal type. As we have seen, what might seem to be relatively minor changes in the drafting of a contract, can have serious implications if something goes wrong later—having the right advice when taking a seat at the negotiating table is critical. Representations and warranties form the basis of due diligence for buyers. Essentially, they provide an opportunity for the seller to disclose any potential issues with the target company prior to completing the transaction. Not disclosing any material event or circumstance potentially keeps a transaction from closing or may trigger a legal dispute post-transaction. To mitigate the risk of financial loss from either party not representing something significant, purchase and sale agreements usually contain an indemnification clause. This clause protects the other party from an omitted or missed representation which may lead to a post-transaction financial loss. Therefore, it is important that both parties provide all information upfront in their representations and warranties to avoid having to enforce indemnification clauses. In case of acquisition deals, it is usual to provide representations and warranties in a Schedule rather than in a clause of the agreement. An example is given hereinafter.  Example 1:  SCHEDULE A REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  The Target and the Sellers represent and warrant to the Acquirer that the following statements are all true and correct in all respects.

  "CHAPTER 20  TERM / DURATION OF THE AGREEMENT  Chapter 20 Unless you stipulate a specific duration of an agreement or tie it up with completion of a specific project, its applicability would be perpetual and the provisions thereof shall continue forever. The agreement can be either time bound (in case of supply of good and services, employment, etc.) or can come to an end when the transaction contemplated under the agreement is completed. If the parties intend to have a specific duration for their relationship, it must be clearly stated. If only one party has the right to terminate the agreement, it may be incorporated in the terms and a termination clause may be added as well. Some examples: 1. The term of this Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall extend until the completion of the Project or 31st March, 2020, whichever is earlier, subject to prior termination as stipulated under this Agreement. 2. This Agreement shall come into force with effect from April 1, 2017 and shall continue to be effective for a term of 5 (five) years therefrom, unless terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 3. This   Agreement   shall   be   effective   from   the   date   of   Closing   as contemplated in Article 4.3 hereof and shall continue to be in force till the Parties hold more than 10% shares each in the Joint Venture Company, subject to prior termination provisions stipulated under this Agreement. 4. This Agreement shall be effective from April 15, 2017 and shall be valid for a period of 6 (six) months, that is, till October, 2017 (“the Term”), unless terminated earlier as provided in this Agreement. 5. This Agreement shall come into force from April 16, 2017 (“Effective Date”) and continue to be in force for an indefinite period, until terminated by the Parties by mutual consent or by either Party in accordance with Article 17 of this Agreement. 6. The terms of this Agreement shall be effective from April 21, 2017 and shall continue in full force and effect till it is terminated by XYZ Continental Private Limited with a 15 (fifteen) days prior written notice.",
  "CHAPTER 21  RENEWAL / EXTENSION OF THE AGREEMENT  Chapter 21 For agreements with a specific duration, if the parties wish to allow flexibility for an extension or renewal, specific provisions to this effect should be incorporated. The clause in this regard may provide for a specific process to be followed, if one or more parties intend to renew or extend the agreement. Such renewal / extension could either be on the same terms and conditions as the original agreement with an amendment agreement or a side letter. If there is a change in only a couple of terms for the renewed term, it maybe mentioned in the renewal clause itself. However, if the commercial understanding and other terms of the renewal or extension are to be very significantly different for the renewed term which entails a lot of changes to be made, it is preferable to execute a new agreement instead of an amendment to the agreement. In common parlance, the words Extension and Renewal are used interchangeably. However, if the parties are not renegotiating the terms and conditions of an agreement while extending the period of their commercial engagement, you may use the word “Extension”, and not “Renewal”.  Examples:  1. The   Parties   may   extend   this   Agreement   on   the   same   terms   and conditions by mutual agreement. Any Party intending to renew the Agreement must give a written notice to the other Party at least 3 (three) months prior to the expiry of this Agreement or the extended term, as the case may be. 2. The Parties may renew this Agreement by mutual agreement. Any Party intending to renew the Agreement must give a written notice to the other Party at least 3 (three) months prior to the expiry of this Agreement or the renewed term, as the case may be. On renewal, the Agreement shall continue to be in force with the same terms and conditions, unless otherwise indicated and agreed in writing by the Parties. 3. The Lessee shall have the right to renew the lease for a further term of 3 (three) years by giving a prior written notice to the Lessor at least 3",
  "Chapter 21]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   131  (three) months before the expiry. There shall be a 10% (ten percent) increase in the rent for such renewed term. 4. The Licensor shall have the sole right to renew the technical license for a further term of 10 (ten) years on a request made by the Licensee in this regard at least 6 (six) months before the expiry. The renewal shall also be subject to the following conditions: (a) (b) (c) .... 5. Subject to the Licensee being in compliance with all its obligations under this Agreement, the Licensor may grant a renewal of the Technology License for a further term of 3 (three) years upon receipt of a written request from the Licensee at least 30 (thirty) days before the expiry of this Agreement. The renewal shall be on mutually agreed payment and other conditions. 6. The Parties may renew this Agreement for such duration and upon such terms and conditions, as may be mutually agreed. However, there is no obligation upon or right of any Party regarding such renewal.",
  "CHAPTER 22  BEWARE OF AUTOMATIC RENEWAL CLAUSES  Chapter 22 The parties may sometimes advise you to draft either (i) a very long term agreement; or (ii) an agreement with an automatic renewal clause, that is to say, unless one or more of them wish to terminate the agreement, the agreement should continue automatically for another term. This latter clause is also known as evergreen or self-renewal clause. It virtually continues the agreement in perpetuity in the absence of a termination notice by one or more parties.  Example:  “Unless either Party giving a written notice of termination at least 30 (thirty) days prior to the expiry of the term of this Agreement, this agreement shall stand automatically renewed for a further term of 3 (three) years.” Mostly, parties choose this arrangement in long-term service agreements wherein the gestation period is long or specific projects take a long time. As long as the services and financials are in good stead under the agreement, this clause lies forgotten and unnoticed. It is only when there are problems between the parties or a better alternative is available, that the parties seek to terminate the agreement. At this stage, many a times the parties find themselves stuck in a commercial relationship which could be undesirable, dissatisfactory, unviable, not sustainable or the like. From a practical standpoint, it is always better to have a fixed term agreement, fixed by timeframe (for service agreements) or a transaction or an operational milestone. If the parties are comfortable working with each other after the expiry of fixed term, they can always discuss, negotiate and work out any amended terms for extension of their relationship. This kind of arrangement is preferable to being stuck in an unhappy situation where you do not wish to work with another party but are forced to, due to your misjudgement, overestimation of the other party’s capabilities or some other reasons. If the parties still insist on automatic renewal, you may keep the renewed term smaller than the original term.",
  "Chapter 22]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   133  Another option can be to have strong termination clauses during the term of the agreement (by any party or by mutual consent). Notwithstanding anything in the agreement, no condition in an agreement can be absolute and the parties can renegotiate the terms of the agreement. So, if a particular financial or other condition is unsuitable for a party, breeding resistance to continuation of commercial relationship, it can insist on renegotiation. It may offer a worthwhile solution to the affected party. Keeping an automatic renewal clause is fraught with risk and should be avoided as much as possible.  Examples:  1. This Agreement shall be   automatically renewed   for successive one (1) year term thereafter (each such term referred to as a “Renewed   Term”) until and unless either Party provides the other Party with 30 (thirty) days prior written notice at the end of the Initial Term or the   Renewed  Term. 2. This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for succeeding terms of 3 (three) years unless either Party gives a written notice to the other Party at least 90 (ninety) days prior to the expiry of the original or extended term of its intention of not renewing the Agreement. 3. This Agreement shall automatically renew and the term shall be extended for an additional period equal to the initial term, upon the expiration of the initial term. Each extension of the term shall be upon the same terms and conditions contained in this Agreement. If a Party does not want the term of this Agreement to renew, it shall give the other Party a written notice of non-renewal not less than 90 (ninety) days prior to the scheduled end of the term.",
  "CHAPTER 23  TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT  Chapter 23 An agreement essentially expires or terminates when all the obligations of the parties and actions required to be performed thereunder are completed. The parties should keep a record to demonstrate the fact of fulfilment of their obligations under the agreement. This comes handy in case of a dispute being raised by the other party. An agreement binds parties to one another. It requires the parties to fulfil their obligations detailed in the agreement during the term of the agreement. However, there could be instances wherein the obligations of the parties have not been fulfilled completely but one or more parties do not wish to continue the relationship or are compelled to walk out of a commercial relationship. The termination of an agreement could either be mutually agreed by all the parties or initiated by one or more parties to the agreement. An agreement invariably requires one or more parties to do something, which is called performance. For example, a company may hire an artist to create certain artwork. Once the artist creates and hands over the artwork to the company, his duty under the agreement is over, it is called performance. However, if the artist becomes incapacitated or is unable to create the artwork for any other reason, it is termed as impossibility of performance. In such a case, the company has the right to terminate the contract in the case of an impossibility of performance. Similarly,   in   cases   where a   party   to   the agreement   does   not adhere to   its commitments under the agreement, it is called a breach of agreement. This is the most forceful and common ground for termination of an agreement. A breach of agreement may occur due to a party’s failure to honour its obligations in full or in part. It is also customary to define a “material breach” under an agreement to set benchmark for an affected party to terminate the agreement. Sometimes, a party may misrepresent facts to induce the other to enter into an agreement or act illegally or make a mistake. The aggrieved party in such a case has the right to rescind the agreement. This can also happen if a party is legally not capable of entering into a valid agreement   e.g. , a minor, lunatic or an insolvent person. There could also be incidents wherein the parties can pre-agree to terminate an agreement in case of a contemplated or listed event.",
  "Chapter 23]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   135  A termination could happen due to one or more of the following events: (i) death; (ii) insolvency / bankruptcy; (iii) change of control; (iv) misrepresentation; (v) breach of a warranty: (vi) dissolution: (vii) dispute; (viii) non-performance; (ix) change of law rendering the agreement ineffective; (x) failure to get any requisite government approval; (xi) revocation of government approval; (xii) happening of a specified event; (xiii) non-fulfilment of a condition precedent; (xiv) mutual consent; (xv) deadlock. A party should give a written notice to the other(s) specifying the specific term of the agreement which gives it the right to terminate the agreement. Termination could be with immediate effect or with a notice period, as may be specified under the agreement. Providing for a notice period under the agreement is the norm. Termination without a notice period is a drastic measure and should happen in very grave situations. If the agreement is to be terminated for a reason (say, a breach), it is usual to give a notice to remedy the breach, if it can be remedied. A termination notice follows in case of the breach not being remedied. Generally, an agreement is terminated with immediate effect in very urgent and grave situations.  Examples:  1. The Parties may terminate this Agreement before the expiry of the Term by mutual consent. 2. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with or without assigning a cause by serving the other Party a 15 (fifteen) days’ prior written notice.",
  "136   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 23  3.

However, each Party shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement forthwith in the following circumstances: (a) (b) (c) ... 4. The Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving a 7 (seven) days’ prior written notice to the Seller in any of the following circumstances: (a) (b) (c) .... The Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving a 7 (seven) days’ prior written notice to the Buyer in any of the following circumstances: (a) (b) (c) ... 5. Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon a Material Breach of a provision of this Agreement after giving a 30 (thirty) days’ notice to the breaching Party to cure such breach and if such breach is being cured within the aforesaid period. 6. The Landlord shall have the right to terminate the lease at any time during the term of this Agreement by giving a 30 (thirty) days’ prior written notice to the Tenant. 7. If there is a breach of a material provision of this Agreement, the non- breaching Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement (i) after giving a 30 (thirty) days’ notice to the breaching Party to cure the breach; and (ii) the breach continues or hasn’t been cured. 8. This Agreement may be terminated by the either of the Parties, without assigning any cause and without any liability, by giving 3 (three) months’ prior written notice of such termination to the other Party or fees in lieu",
  "Chapter 23]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   137  thereof. The Company, however, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect in the event of a material breach by the Consultant. For the purpose of this clause, a “Material breach” shall include: (i) any violation of the terms of Clauses .....; (ii) any other breach that the Advisor has failed to cure within 21 (twenty one) days after receipt of written notice in this regard by the Company; and (iii) an act of gross negligence or wilful misconduct by the Advisor.",
  "CHAPTER 24  EFFECT OF EXPIRY OR TERMINATION  Chapter 24 Apart from the termination clause, there should be provisions for the consequences of termination. Providing for termination isn’t sufficient. You must indicate what will follow termination and how the parties have to conduct themselves after the termination. The obligations and process should be stipulated so that there is no ambiguity on these aspects and the parties can part ways in an amicable manner. Some of the components of this clause could be: (i) Terms and time frame for disengagement of the parties; (ii) Return of each other’s confidential information; (iii) Non-solicitation of each other’s employees or clients; (iv) Right of First Refusal for any shares or business opportunity; (v) Survival of certain clauses of the agreement; (vi) Damages for any breach; and (vii) Future restrictions from carrying out a competitive business in a specific territory or for a specific period. The above-mentioned list is just illustrative.  Examples:  1.   Upon expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, all relevant licenses and sublicenses granted by the Licensor to the Licensee shall terminate automatically with effect from the date of such termination.   The   Licensee   shall   transfer,   assign   and   convey   all   its ownership of any beneficial interest in the technical knowhow developed during the course of this Agreement to the Licensor without keeping any copies or reproductions thereof in any physical or virtual forms. 2. Upon expiration or early termination of this Agreement, all rights and obligations of the Parties shall cease to be effective. However: (i) any   obligations   that   accrued   prior   to   the   effective   date   of termination   (including,   without   limitation,   all   payment obligations) shall survive termination; and (ii) each Party shall destroy or return to the other Party all of the other’s confidential information in its possession, as directed by the other Party.",
  "Chapter 24]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   139  3. Upon termination or expiry of this Agreement, neither party shall have any further obligations hereunder except for (i) obligations which accrue till the effective date of such expiry or termination, and (ii) obligations, promises, or covenants set forth in this Agreement which have been expressly agreed to survive such expiry or termination, including, without limitation, indemnities, non-compete and non-solicitation obligations. 4. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Party for any reason: (i) any amount owed to the Licensor under this Agreement before such termination shall become immediately due and payable; (ii) all licenses granted in this Agreement will immediately cease to exist; (iii) the   Licensee   shall   immediately   discontinue   using   the Technology; (iv) the   Licensee   shall   erase   all   copies   or   reproductions   of   the drawings and designs supplied to it by the Licensor under this Agreement from its systems; and (v) the Licensee shall return to Licensor all copies of the drawings and designs provided by the Licensor in its possession or control without keeping any copies or reproductions thereof.",
  "CHAPTER 25  SURVIVAL OF CERTAIN CLAUSES  Chapter 25 Even if the agreement comes to an end by way of its expiry or termination, the parties may be particular about survival of certain provisions under the agreement. It   could   be   confidentiality   obligations,   governing   law,   dispute   resolution mechanism (as some disputes may even arise after termination,   e.g. , guarantee / warrantee, misrepresentations, etc.) or certain other provisions. For example, in acquisition deals, the seller usually provides an indemnity to the buyer for a certain period after the Closure of the transaction so that if any representation or warranty is found to be defective at a later stage, the buyer would be compensated. You should clearly demarcate the provisions (in consultation with the parties) which shall survive the expiry or termination of the agreement and the parties shall continue to be bound by them. If there are very few provisions of the agreement, which the parties intend to survive, a reference in respect thereof can be made in the operative clause itself.  Example:  “The confidentiality obligations mentioned in this Article 7 shall survive the termination or expiry of this Agreement for any reason.” If, however, there are more than 2 such provisions, this demarcation can be made either by way of stating the heading of the obligation (Confidentiality, Non- compete, Non-solicitation, Governing law, etc.) and / or with specific clause numbers of the agreement.  Examples:  1. Any provision of this Agreement that requires performance of any obligation or observance of any covenant subsequent to termination or expiry of this Agreement shall survive termination or expiry of this Agreement and continue in full force and effect. 2. Notwithstanding the termination or expiry of this Agreement for any reason, Article 4 (Confidentiality), Article 7 (Non-compete), Article 9 (Dispute Resolution) and Article 14 (Representations and Warranties)",
  "Chapter 25]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   141  shall survive such termination or expiry and continue to be binding between the Parties. 3. Articles 7 to 11 of this Agreement shall survive the termination or expiry of this Agreement for any reason and shall continue in full force and effect and binding between the Parties. 4. Notwithstanding   any   other   provision   of   this   Agreement,   the representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities of or by the Parties contained in this Agreement or in any side letter, support letter, certificate, document or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 5. The covenants and obligations set forth in Articles 7, 9, 13 and 14(2) of this   Agreement   shall   survive   the   expiry   or   termination   of   this Employment Agreement for any reason whatsoever and shall continue to be binding upon the Managing Director notwithstanding such expiry or termination. 6. The respective rights and obligations of the Parties, particularly those relating   to   recovery   of   their   outstanding   dues,   shall   survive   any termination or expiry of this Agreement to the extent necessary to the intended preservation of such rights and obligations.",
  "CHAPTER 26  UNDERLYING RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES  Chapter 26 The agreement must clarify in clear terms the nature of the relationship of the parties—whether they are independent contractors, agents, partners, representatives of each other, etc. Such specification limits the parties’ responsibilities, powers and obligations under the agreement. It is also important from taxation and other enforcement aspects. For example, in certain   cases,   taxation   authorities   scan   agreements   to   see   the   “Permanent Establishment” or “Related Party” angles to see if the transactions and consideration provided thereunder are genuine.  Examples:  1. This Agreement is not intended to and shall not create any partnership, joint   venture,   franchise,   license   or agency relationship between   the Parties. 2. The parties are independent contractors and are dealing with each other on arm’s length basis. Except otherwise expressly stipulated in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall constitute or create any partnership, joint venture or co-ownership between the parties or put any party in the status of an agent, licensee, employee or representative of the other party, or empower any party to act for, bind or otherwise create or assume any obligation on behalf of the other party. 3. The parties shall maintain the status of independent contractors and this Agreement shall not create or be interpreted or construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture, franchise or employment relationship between them. No party shall have the authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any nature whatsoever or to take any action which shall bind the other party. 4. This Agreement does not intend to establish any partnership, joint venture, employment, or other relationship between the Parties except that of independent contractors dealing on an arms’ length basis.",
  "Chapter 26]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   143  5. The Parties are independent parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to make either Party an agent, employee, franchisee, joint venture partner or legal representative of the other. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, neither Party will have nor represent itself to have any authority to bind the other Party or act on its behalf nor shall make any statements, representations or commitments on behalf of the other Party. 6. This Agreement shall not be deemed to create any partnership, joint venture, franchise or agency relationship between the parties. Each Party shall enter and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement as an   independent   contractor.   No   Party   shall   make   any   statements, representations or commitments on behalf of the other Party. 7. The relationship between the Parties shall be that of Buyer and Seller and they shall act as independent contractors. A Party or its employees, representatives or agents shall not act or give the impression of being employees, representatives or agents of the other Party.",
  "CHAPTER 27  FORCE MAJEURE  Chapter 27 Force majeure means “superior force”, “chance occurrence”, “unavoidable accident” in different languages and connotations. Sometimes, one or more parties to an agreement may be unable to fulfil their respective   obligations   thereunder   due   to   an   extraordinary   incident,   event   or circumstance. These events could vary from a war, strike, crime, riots or the like. The circumstances could even include events which are termed as “Act of God” in legal terminology,   e.g. , earthquake, flood, hurricane, tsunami, volcanos, etc. It is an event that makes it impossible or impractical for the affected party to perform its obligations under the agreement. The basic test is that the event should be beyond the control of the affected party. Therefore, force majeure does not cover events which arise out of a result of any negligence of a party or events which make it economically difficult for the affected party to perform. The force majeure clause frees the affected party from fulfilling its obligation and liability for non-compliance arising therefrom. However, such clause does not completely absolve the affected party from its obligations or performance under the agreement forever but merely suspends such obligations or performance for the duration of the force majeure event. The presence of a force majeure clause does not absolve the parties from their responsibility of taking reasonable precautions for preventing or limiting the effects of the events.   For example , a party should have suitable covered storage facility in rainy weather for its own goods. It should not leave its goods in the open and subject them to rain, merely because there is a force majeure clause in its supply agreement with buyers. If the affected party has adequate insurance coverage to make good the loss suffered by it due to the force majeure event and it is placed under the same condition financially and otherwise after the event, it cannot refuse to deliver on its obligations after being put in the same condition, unless the obligation is time sensitive and performance is no longer of any use. Further,   a   force   majeure   clause   may   also   be   limited   in   its   application   to obligations which are impossible to perform and not others.",
  "Chapter 27]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   145  The process of notification should be provided in the agreement. Generally, a time limit is set in the agreement,   i.e.   if a force majeure event persists beyond a certain time period and is unlikely to be over soon, the affected party needs to inform the other party. Only thereafter, the affected party’s obligations are to be suspended, not otherwise.  Examples:  1. A Party shall not be liable for any delay or failure on its part in performance of its obligations under the Agreement, if such delay or failure (i) is beyond its reasonable control; (ii) affects the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) was incapable of having been foreseen or provided against with reasonable effort. However, the above does not include any financial difficulty particular to the affected Party or general economic or market conditions. For the purpose of this clause, “Force Majeure Event” shall mean a single event or a series of related events, outside the reasonable control of the affected party (including but not limited to change in law, fire, flood, riots, explosion, war, terrorist attack, industrial disputes, major power breakdown, etc.). 2. If a party is affected by a Force Majeure Event resulting in a failure or delay in performance of its obligations under this Agreement (other than making payments), those obligations shall remain suspended during the continuance of the Force Majeure Event. The aforesaid suspension shall be applicable only if the party affected by the Force Majeure Event informs the other party of such event within 7 (seven) days of such event having arisen and keep the other party updated in this regard on a weekly basis thereafter. The party affected by the Force Majeure Event shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate the effects thereof. 3. The Company shall not be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement which arises out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, strikes, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications   or   computer   (software   and   hardware)   services. However, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts consistent with",
  "146   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 27  accepted practices in its industry to mitigate the effects of such event. The Company shall also endeavour to resume performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances. A comprehensive force majeure could read like the following: FORCE MAJEURE 11.1 As used in this Agreement, ‘Force Majeure Event’ means the occurrence of any of the Non-Political Events, the Political Events or the Other Events in India, set out in Clause 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4 respectively including the impact/consequence thereof which: (a)   is beyond the control of the Party claiming to be affected by such event (the “Affected Party”); (b)   prevents the Affected Party from performing or discharging its obligations under this Agreement; and (c)   the Affected Party has been unable to prevent or overcome despite exercise of due care, diligence and best efforts.  11.2.   Non-Political   Events:   Any   of   the   following   events   which prevent   the   Affected   Party   from   performing   any   of   its obligations for a continuous period of not less than 30 (thirty) days from the date of its occurrence, shall constitute a Non- Political Event: (a)   act   of   God,   extremely   adverse   weather   conditions, lightning, earthquake, cyclone, flood, volcanic eruption, chemical   or   radioactive   contamination   or   ionizing radiation, fire or explosion at its site; (b)   strikes or boycotts and not being an Other Event set forth in Clause 12.4, labour disruptions or any other industrial disturbances   not   arising   on   account   of   the   acts   or omissions of the Affected Party; (c)   any event or circumstance of a nature similar to any of the foregoing. 11.3.   Political Events:   Any of the following events shall constitute a Political Event: (a) unlawful   or   unauthorised   or   without   jurisdiction revocation of, or refusal to renew or grant without valid cause, any consent, approval, clearance, licence, permit, authorisation,   no   objection   certificate,   or   exemption required by the Affected Party to perform its obligations under   this   Agreement;   provided   that   such   delay, modification, denial, refusal or revocation did not result",
  "Chapter 27]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   147  from the Affected Party’s inability or failure to comply with any conditions relating to grant, maintenance or renewal   of   such   consent,   approval,   clearance,   licence, authorisation,   no   objection   certificate,   exemption   or permit; or (b) early determination of this Agreement by any government authority on account of public policy, national emergency, national security or the public interest. 11.4.   Other Events:   Any of the following events which prevent the Affected Party from performing any of its obligations under this Agreement for a continuous period of not less than 30 (thirty) days from the date of its occurrence, shall constitute the Other Event: (a) an act of war (whether declared or undeclared), invasion, armed conflict or act of foreign enemy, blockade, embargo, riot,   insurrection,   terrorist   or   military   action,   civil commotion or politically motivated sabotage; (b) any civil commotion, boycott or political agitation which prevents the Affected Party to conduct its business in normal course; (c) any   order   or   judgement   of   a   court   of   competent jurisdiction or statutory authority in India made against the Affected Party in any proceedings duly contested by the Affected Party; or (d) any event or circumstance of a nature similar to any of the foregoing. 11.5.   Notice of Force Majeure Event:   The process for providing the notice of a force majeure event will be as under: (a) The Affected Party shall give notice to the other Party in writing of the occurrence of any of the Force Majeure Event (the “Notice”) as soon as the same arises or as soon as   reasonably   practicable   and   in   any   event   within   30 (thirty) days after the Affected Party comes to know, or ought reasonably to have known, of its occurrence and the adverse effect it has or is likely to have on the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. (b) The Notice shall   inter-alia   include full particulars of: (i) the nature, time of occurrence and extent of the Force Majeure Event with evidence in respect thereof; (ii) description of the measures which the Affected Party has taken or proposes to take, to alleviate the",
  "148   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 27  impact of the Force Majeure Event or to mitigate the damage; (iii) the duration or estimated duration and the effect or   probable   effect   which   such   Force   Majeure Event has or will have on the Affected Party’s ability   to   perform   its   obligations   under   this Agreement; and (iv) any other relevant information. (c) For the duration of the Force Majeure Event, the Affected Party shall provide the other Party with weekly updates and written reports containing the information called for by Clause 11.5(b) above and such other information as the other Party may reasonably request. 11.6.   Period of Force Majeure:   Period of Force Majeure shall mean the period from the time of occurrence specified in the Notice given by the Affected Party in respect of a Force Majeure Event until the earlier of: (a) expiry of the period during which the Affected Party is excused from performance of its obligations in accordance with Clause 11.8; or (b) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Clause 11.10 hereof 11.7.   Resumption   of   Performance:   During   the   period   of   Force Majeure, the Affected Party shall in consultation with the other Party, make all reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event and make efforts to keep performing its obligations which are not affected by the Force Majeure Event. The   Affected   Party   shall   also   make   efforts   to   resume performance of its obligations under this Agreement as soon as possible. The Affected Party shall notify the other Party of the end of the Force Majeure Event in writing at the earliest and resume   the   performance   of   all   its   obligations   under   the Agreement immediately. 11.8.   Performance   Excused:   The   Affected   Party,   to   the   extent rendered unable to perform its obligations or part thereof under this Agreement as a result of the Force Majeure Event shall be excused from performance of the obligations. However, nothing contained   herein   shall   release   the   Affected   Party   from   any payment obligations accrued prior to the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event. Further, the excuse from performance shall be of no greater scope and of no longer duration than is reasonably warranted by the Force Majeure Event.",
  "Chapter 27]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   149  11.9.   Costs and Revised Timelines:   Each Party shall bear its costs, if any, incurred as a result of a Force Majeure Event. The Affected Party   shall   be   granted   extension   of   time   specified   in   this Agreement for the performance of any obligation by such period not exceeding the period during which the performance was affected by the Force Majeure Event. 11.10.   Termination Due to Force Majeure Event:   If the period of Force Majeure continues or is in the reasonable judgment of the Parties likely to continue beyond a period of 120 (one hundred and twenty) days, the Parties may mutually decide to terminate this Agreement or continue this Agreement on mutually agreed revised terms. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement in this regard, the Affected Party shall after the expiry of the said period of 120 (one hundred and twenty) days be entitled to terminate the Agreement.",
  "CHAPTER 28  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  Chapter 28 You may have had a look at the reverse side of your Drycleaner’s slip for the garments you have given him for laundry or dry cleaning or you may have found some terms written in very small letters on the computer-generated receipts handed to you by supermarkets. Such slips have some terms and conditions written in very small font. One of these terms is,   inter alia , to the effect that “The service provider’s liability in any eventuality shall not exceed ____________ (a particular amount).” If you give your 2-piece Armani suit (which cost you half a million Rupees) for dry cleaning, the dry cleaner charges you a small sum, say Rupees 1,000 or 2,000 for its services. What if your suit were to be damaged during the dry cleaning process? As a customer, ideally you would like a replacement of your garment with one in the same condition. Failing such a result, you would like full compensation for the loss or replacement of your suit plus the delay, mental agony, stress, loss of your dearest outfit, emotional trauma (you could be so attached to it, as it was the biggest purchase you made for yourself or a wedding gift from your wife). I know I am stretching it too far but this is how it happens in courtrooms when a party is seeking compensation. However, a demand for such compensation does not make commercial sense for the   dry   cleaner.   He   cannot   have   an   open-ended   obligation   which   is   not commensurate with his remuneration for his services. So, what your drycleaner tries to do is to limit his liability for any mishappening by providing a limit on his liability. You on the other hand, cannot insist on replacement guarantee or full indemnification from the dry cleaner, so have to give in to whatever terms he has put on the back of the slip. As we have discussed at various places, parties have their respective rights and obligations under an agreement. They are required to perform their respective sets of responsibilities according to pre-agreed terms and conditions, norms, time-frames, etc. Invariably, one or more parties are required under certain circumstances to compensate the other(s) for any failure, non-performance, breach, delay and other specified reasons.",
  "Chapter 28]   Part 6—Operative Clauses   151  A limitation of liability clause stipulates that a party will be obligated to pay to the other in such an event under the terms of an agreement. This clause limits the amount as well as the types of damages a party can recover from the other. This is an effective way to cap the liability amount undertaken by a party (usually the service provider). Invariably, this exposure is capped at the amount equivalent to the fees paid to the service provider under the agreement or an additional amount which may be more or less than the fees. This way, among other things: (i) the party limiting its liability can gauge the extent of its potential exposure under a particular agreement; (ii) its auditors can also predict the maximum exposure and contingent liabilities; and (iii) the party can take adequate insurance cover to take care of any potential liabilities. This clause is more prevalent in service agreements and normally favours the service provider who wants to limit its exposure. The underlying reason and rationale for such a clause is to protect a service provider who is undertaking a risk which may not be commensurate with the small fee that it may be charging for doing a particular assignment or handling an equipment or thing (as cited in the dry cleaner’s example above). The service provider’s profit margin on projects or assignments in many cases may not support taking unlimited risk in respect thereof. Even insurance covers come with several riders and disqualifications and insurers insist on limitation of liability clauses in agreements. Usually, the party drafting the agreement has an upper hand in this regard. It incorporates limitation of liability clause in its favour to limit its exposure from the first draft itself. However, the enforceability of limitation of liability clauses is not absolute (for example, in cases involving gross and deliberate negligence on part of the service provider) and depends on merits of each case.  Examples:  1. The Distributor shall have no liability to compensate the Company for any claim pressed by the latter under this Agreement except as expressly provided under this Agreement. 2. The Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any action taken or omitted by him in pursuance of this Agreement in good faith, except for gross negligence, bad faith or wilful misconduct adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. 3. The aggregate liability of the Agent towards the Principal in respect of any losses, costs claimed by the Client in relation to this Agreement shall",
  "152   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 28  not exceed the fees received by the Agent provided that any such claim is made not later than within 15 (fifteen) days of termination of this Agreement. 4. The aggregate liability of the Service Provider and its directors, officers, employees, agents, sub-contractors in respect of any claims, losses, costs or damages arising out of or related to this Agreement shall not exceed the fees received by the Service Provider under this Agreement or Rs. 25,000   (Rupees   twenty   five   thousand   only),   whichever   is   greater. Further, any such claim(s) must be made during the engagement period of the Service Provider or within 3 (three) months of the termination or expiry of this Agreement, as the case may be. The Service Provider’s obligation shall also be restricted only to actual and direct losses and not to any indirect, special or consequential losses. The Service Provider shall not be subjected to any punitive or exemplary damages. 5. The aggregate liability of the Service Provider in respect of any claims, losses, costs or damages arising out of or related to this Agreement shall not exceed the fees received by the Service Provider under this Agreement or Rs. 25,000 (Rupees twenty five thousand) only, whichever is less. The Client shall be entitled to press only those claims in respect of which a loss or damage exceeds Rs. 5,000. The Client shall first make efforts to recover such losses through insurance. Any amount paid by the insurance company of the Client shall also be deducted from any claim pressed by the Client. 6. No   Party   shall   have   any   liability   towards   each   other   under   this Agreement, except in the case of a material breach. Even in the case of a material breach, a Party shall only be liable to make good any actual and direct losses. The breaching party shall not bear any indirect, special or consequential losses nor be subjected to any punitive or exemplary damages.",
  "PART 7  BOILERPLATE CLAUSES  Part 7—Boilerplate Clauses",
  "154   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 28",
  "CHAPTER 1  BOILERPLATE CLAUSES  Chapter 1 At the fag-end of an agreement, you would have seen “Miscellaneous” or “General” clauses (sometimes minor individual clauses too). Normally, these clauses invite limited or no attention from the draftsman and parties. The parties and their lawyers are so tired by the time such clauses appear that these clauses go unnoticed. These clauses are called boilerplate clauses and are generally perceived as non- substantive provisions and are diverse from other transaction specific clauses which form   the   essence   of   the   agreement.   Many   of   the   boilerplate   clauses   in   the commercial agreements often go without any negotiations and modifications. These boilerplate clauses may sometimes be blindly and unnecessarily included in the agreement irrespective of the fact that they may not be relevant in the context of the transaction or an amendment in law or a court ruling may have rendered them invalid or unenforceable.. I have seen instances where a poor draftsman has inadvertently incorporated such boilerplate clauses in the first draft circulated to the counterparty even though some of these clauses may be adverse to their own client’s interests. “These are standard clauses, do not bother about them” is every lawyer’s preferred explanation while negotiating any agreement. They do not encourage reading or discussion on these clauses because they may not have spent any time on it themselves and are scared of their own client’s or the other party’s questions. Another argument in favour of not disturbing such clauses is that these have been around for ages and no issues have arisen between (same or different) parties so far on these issues. However, the devil always lies in details. The boilerplate clauses can be drafted to benefit or deprive either of the parties involved and the party providing the first draft has an advantage. Therefore, it is essential to carefully examine these clauses provided at the fag-end of the agreements before signing on the dotted lines. A blind transposition of boilerplate clauses from one agreement to another without independently considering the operational mechanics of each agreement is another element—sometimes, the draftsmen of the parties do not appreciate it and the consequences are severe.",
  "156   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  Some common boilerplate clauses generally appearing in commercial contracts are:        Entire Agreement;        Notice;        Force Majeure;        Severability;        Further Assurances;        No set-off or counterclaim;        Reliance or No reliance;        No waiver;        Governing Law and Jurisdiction. We will discuss each of these clauses in detail in subsequent chapters. The parties usually do not bother, as long as the going is good between them. However, all good things come to an end. The implications of having ignored a thorough review of boilerplate clauses become apparent when things start going wrong. The clauses that were considered inconsequential to even have merited a discussion suddenly became very important. Sometimes, clients specifically request short and to the point agreement and may find the boilerplate clauses as irritants and unnecessary. In such a case, a draftsman has to be more careful to decide which clauses to retain and which ones to disregard. Deleting any boilerplate clauses should be carefully considered with a judicious analysis of the risks and benefits.",
  "CHAPTER 2  FURTHER ASSURANCES  Chapter 2 Successful execution and implementation of an agreement requires cooperation from all parties. The parties may require a lot of support from each other in terms of information, documents, consents, support letters, guarantees, board / shareholders resolutions, etc. from time to time in pursuance of the agreement. An Assurance clause stipulates that each party to an agreement shall execute and deliver any and all additional information, documents and other support listed earlier, and shall do any and all acts and things as reasonably necessary in connection with the performance of its obligations and in pursuance of the agreement. In the absence of this clause, a party might try to escape its obligations under the agreement by partially or fully withholding requisite assistance to the other party where such assistance is either necessary or of great importance. The idea behind this clause is to exert moral pressure and seek commitment from all parties to cooperate in future. Sometimes, after the initial enthusiasm expressed during the course of negotiation and closing, the parties start lying low and some of them become indifferent towards implementation. This clause seeks to ensure their continued assistance. However, this clause should be drafted carefully and not put unnecessary burden on the parties. The requests for cooperation should strictly be need based and not frequent, unreasonable and unnecessary. Otherwise, the requested party may get a feeling of being bullied by the other who had better bargaining power in drafting the agreement.  Examples:  1. Each Party shall perform all further acts and things and execute and deliver such further documents as may be necessary or as the other Party may   reasonably   require   for   implementing   or   giving   effect   to   this Agreement. 2. Each party, on receipt of notice from the other party, shall execute or cause to be executed, all further documents and deeds, do or cause to be done, all further acts, and provide all assurances as may reasonably be necessary or desirable to give effect to the terms of this Agreement.",
  "CHAPTER 3  NO SET-OFF OR COUNTERCLAIM  Chapter 3 A no set-off or counterclaim clause is generally used in the standard loan agreements. This clause is included to protect the interest of the lender in the event the borrower tries to set off amounts due to the lending party against any amounts allegedly claimed by the borrower from the lending party. There are delays in disbursement of loans and invariably, the borrowers try to claim set offs and raise counter claims towards damages suffered by them for such delays and the adverse effects on their business operations. Such a clause provides that a borrower has no ground to withhold any payment obligation and must fulfil all its payment obligations without setting-off any amount. However, such a provision is not absolute in its operation and in case of a dispute over it, courts have the discretion to entertain the counterclaim of the borrower on merits before directing the borrower to make payment to the lender.  Examples:  1. No set-off or counterclaim.   Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Borrower shall have no right of set-off or counterclaim in respect of any claim, debt or obligation against any payment for the benefit of the Lender provided for in this Agreement.  2. No   set-off   or   counterclaim.   Except   as   may   be otherwise expressly provided under this Agreement elsewhere, the amounts / benefits payable shall not be subject to set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defence or other claim which the Borrower may have against the Lender or anyone else. Accordingly, all amounts payable by the Borrower shall be paid without any notice or demand.",
  "CHAPTER 4  RELIANCE OR NO RELIANCE  Chapter 4 Such clauses operate in their respective fields and such operation depends on the facts, circumstances and nature of the agreement. For example, in case of corporate borrowing, the borrower makes a lot of statements, representations, warranties and provides a big bunch of documents and information to convince the lender to lend. To hold the borrower to these, the Reliance clause is incorporated in the loan agreement to indicate that the lender has placed   reliance   on   the   correctness,   validity,   effectiveness   or   genuineness   of documents or any statement, representations or warranties made by the borrower or its authorized representatives.  Example:  Reliance . Each director and officer of the Company (‘Officer’) shall, in the performance of his/her duties with respect to the Company, be entitled to rely on any information, opinion, report or statement, including any financial statement or other financial data, prepared or presented by an officer or employee of the Company whom the Officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented, by a lawyer, accountant or other person, as to a matter which the Officer   reasonably   believes   to   be   within   the   person’s   professional   or   expert competence, or, with respect to a director, by a committee of the Board of Directors on which the director does not serve, as to a matter within its designated authority, if the director reasonably believes the committee to merit confidence. A ‘No reliance’ clause, on the other hand, is incorporated in an agreement in cases where the parties do not wish to bind each other towards any such information and statements. The objective of such like clause is to indicate that the parties have relied on only those of each other’s representations which have been specifically incorporated under   the   agreement   and   nothing   beyond   that.   The   parties’   disclosures   and representations are thus, deemed limited to those included in the agreement itself. On that count, a No Reliance clause is somewhat similar to the Entire agreement clause. We have discussed this clause in a separate chapter.  Examples:  1. Non-Reliance . The Parties represent to each other that in executing this Agreement they do not rely and have not relied upon any representation or",
  "160   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 4  statement not set forth herein made by the other or by any of the other’s agents, representatives or attorneys with regard to the subject matter, basis or effect of this Agreement or otherwise.  2. Non-Reliance   on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their related parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their related parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.",
  "CHAPTER 5  NOTICES  Chapter 5 To fulfil their obligations and enforce their rights under the agreement, the parties need to inform the other parties by way of notices and other intimations. An informative Notice clause is very important in this regard. This clause should provide the name, designation, address, email id and other relevant particulars of the person (if individual) or organisation to whom a party could serve a notice under the agreement. If the person holding the designation leaves the organisation, the notice could be served to his successor in the same position. The method of service of notice should also be mentioned. It is also customary to provide a clause regarding assumption of delivery after a specified period of sending the notice. If there is a change in a party’s particulars in the Notice clause (change of authorised person, address, email id, etc.), it should immediately intimate the other parties in this regard and thereafter, the notices should be served to the notifying party at new particulars.  Examples:  1. Any   notice,   intimation,   consent,   waiver   or   other   communication permitted or required under this Agreement shall be valid and effective only if it is in writing and shall be deemed received by the Party to which it is sent (i) upon delivery, when delivered by hand; (ii) 3 (three) days after being sent, if sent with all sending expenses prepaid, by an express courier   with   a   reliable   system   for   tracking   delivery;   (iii)   when transmitted; or (iv) 7 (seven) days after the date sent, if sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed as under: If to the Company: Designation: Address: Attention: email id:",

Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered as follows with notice deemed given as indicated: (a) by personal delivery, when delivered personally; (b) by overnight courier upon written verification of receipt; (c) by telecopy or facsimile transmission upon acknowledgment of receipt of electronic transmission; or (d) by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, upon verification of receipt. Notice shall be sent to Distributor at the address set forth below and to the Company at its registered office, or such other address as either party may specify to the other in writing.",
  "CHAPTER 6  PUBLICITY  Chapter 6 Commercial relationships are arrived at after a lot of discussion, negotiation, bargaining and adjustments. The reasons, objective and profit margin behind every new transaction may be different for the same party. Sometimes, a small party wants to flaunt its commercial relationship with the other party to attain mileage within its business sphere while for the bigger party, it is a routine matter and it does not wish to publicise it. For this and many other reasons, it is important that the parties discuss and determine   whether   their   relationship   and   the   terms   and   conditions   of   their relationship (particularly the remuneration or consideration part) should remain confidential or can be publicised in media or to third parties. Here, the parties should indicate whether all or only a part of the information under   the   agreement   (say,   only   the   information   classified   as   Confidential Information) is subject to non-disclosure. Sometimes, depending on the legal requirements relating to disclosure of commercial relationships, the restriction may apply to one or few parties only. Therefore, the respective obligations of the parties may differ. The exceptions to the general obligation of non-publicity should also be suitably incorporated in such provision.  Examples:  1. The Company is a listed company and as such is subject to certain reporting and disclosure requirements. Each of the Company and the Consultant agree not to disclose outside of their regulatory scope, the existence or contents of this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of the other Party except: (i) to its advisors, attorneys or auditors who have a need to know such information; (ii) to   bankers   for   effecting   payments   mentioned   under   this Agreement; (iii) as required by any law or a court order; (iv) as required in connection with the reorganisation of a Party, or its merger into any other corporation, or the sale by a Party of all or substantially all of its undertakings, properties or assets; or",
  "164   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 6  (v) as may be required to give effect to, register, implement or enforce this Agreement. 2. No publicity or information regarding the existence or contents of this Agreement shall be given or released by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as may be required under any applicable   laws   or   regulations   (inclusive   of   any   stock   exchange regulations)   or   in   connection   with   a   permitted   assignment   of   this Agreement. The Parties agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement constitute Confidential Information and, unless otherwise specifically permitted hereby, will not be the subject of any public announcement or press release by either, except as provided in this Article. The Parties acknowledge that in some events, certain aspects of this Agreement,   including   the   text   of   this   Agreement   (other   than   the commercial terms) may be required to be disclosed by applicable law. As and when such disclosure is required, the disclosing Party shall notify the non-disclosing Party of the contents of the proposed disclosure prior to such disclosure for information and record of the non-disclosing Party. The   disclosing   Party   shall,   however,   make   efforts   to   minimise   the disclosure to the extent possible.",
  "CHAPTER 7  SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS  Chapter 7 This clause is to protect the remaining terms of the agreement as a whole, if for some reason one or more provisions are invalidated for some reason (change of law, ignorance of law, unreasonableness, public policy, misunderstanding between the parties, etc.). For example, if a new law is enacted negating a particular payment arrangement (say currency of billing and payment through a particular mode) between the parties, they may agree that the whole agreement will not become invalid and ineffective. Instead, only the provisions relating to payment arrangement would be invalidated, leaving the rest of the agreement valid and enforceable. In such a case, the parties may renegotiate the invalided provision to bring it in compliance with the new legal position.  Examples:  1. Invalidity   or   unenforceability   of   one   or   more   provisions   of   this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions.   The   Parties   shall   modify   the   invalid   or   unenforceable provision to reflect the parties’ original intent, to the extent legally possible. 2. If   any   provision   of   this   Agreement   is,   or   becomes,   invalid   or unenforceable under any applicable law, it shall be deemed to have been struck off and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue to be in full force and effect. 3. The invalidity or unenforceability of one or more provisions of this Agreement shall not invalidate the remaining provisions nor make them unenforceable. Any such invalidated or unenforceable provision shall be deemed   severed   from   this   Agreement   and   the   remainder   of   this Agreement shall continue to be in full force and effect. 4. If any term of this Agreement is adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such adjudication shall not affect any other term of this Agreement. The remainder of the Agreement shall continue to be in force and the respective rights and obligations of the Parties shall be construed, enforced and adjusted",
  "166   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 7  accordingly. The Parties shall make efforts to modify the invalid term to the extent necessary to render such term valid, legal and enforceable, if possible. 5. If any term, condition or provision in this Agreement is pronounced to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such term, condition or provision shall be severed from this Agreement and become inoperative.",
  "CHAPTER 8  GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION  Chapter 8 The parties must specify the governing law for the agreement. At the outset of their commercial relationship, the parties to an agreement should agree as to which place, State or country’s laws shall govern the respective rights and obligations of the parties and which Courts and authorities would have jurisdiction over any disputes arising out of the agreement. Normally, when a dispute arises between the parties, the first battle is to find an appropriate court or forum to resolve such dispute. If the parties, therefore, agree on governing law and jurisdiction, it avoids a preliminary battle between the parties just to settle the question of a governing law or a competent court or forum for resolution of any disputes between the parties. This   clause   is   particularly   important   in   respect   of   agreements   between transnational   parties.   In   such   scenario,   the   agreement   may   be   executed   and performed in different countries. Various legal systems may be relevant and have partial or complete jurisdiction to entertain a petition filed by a party. It is, therefore, advisable to have clarity and unanimity among the parties regarding the governing law and jurisdiction. As a general principle, the parties to an agreement are free to choose the governing law. However, this choice is not unfettered. The governing law should have a connection with the agreement. Some valid considerations for choosing a specific governing law could be: (i) the place where the agreement is executed; (ii) place of performance; (iii) place of domicile, residence or business of the parties; (iii) national   character   of   companies   /   corporations   involved   in   the transaction; (iv) subject matter of agreement; and (v) other facts that help to localize the agreement. Out of the above considerations, in the absence of a specific provision to this effect, law of place of performance of the agreement would assume greatest importance.",
  "168   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 8  In case an agreement is to be performed completely at one place, the assumption is easy. However, if there are multiple places where the agreement is to be performed, it has to be main or primary place. A jurisdiction clause indicates the parties’ agreement regarding submission to the competent courts of a country or State (if the parties are from the same country). Such courts would have the right to hear any disputes between the parties arising out of their relationship under the agreement. The jurisdiction clause mostly stipulates that the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of competent courts of a particular State or country. This means that only these specified courts would have the jurisdiction to hear any disputes between the parties and none else. While choosing governing law and jurisdiction, pay attention to the fact whether the decrees awarded by a particular court will be enforceable against a party in another country. In certain cases, you may have to file a petition in the defendant’s country to enforce the decree awarded by a foreign court. The process, thus, is duplicated entailing more cost and time.  Examples:  1. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Indian laws. 2. The Parties agree to submit all their disputes in connection with this Agreement to the exclusive jurisdiction of Singapore courts. 3. This Agreement shall be construed and governed in accordance with Indian laws and all claims relating to, breach thereof and arising out of this Agreement shall also be governed by Indian laws. 4. This Agreement shall be governed by and must be construed in accordance with the laws in force in the State of West Bengal. With respect to all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of competent courts of West Bengal. 5. This   Agreement   shall   be   governed   exclusively   by   and   interpreted, enforced and construed in accordance with Indian laws, which laws shall be deemed proper laws of the Agreement. The Parties irrevocably submit to jurisdiction of the Indian courts—whether having original or appellate jurisdiction in any suits, actions or other proceedings. 6. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws of India without having regard to choice of law principles. The Parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of Indian courts. 7. This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable Indian laws, excluding its conflict of laws principles. The Parties irrevocably consent to such jurisdiction and agree to bring any legal action or proceedings arising under this Agreement exclusively before Indian courts.",
  "CHAPTER 9  WAIVER  Chapter 9 Generally, such a clause in the agreement provides that a failure or delay by a party in enforcing an obligation, or exercising a right or remedy, does not amount to a waiver of that obligation, right or remedy. Further, a waiver of a breach of a term does not amount to a waiver of a breach of any other term in the agreement. Waiver, No Waiver or Waiver and Extension clause aims to ensure that a party’s failure to enforce its contractual rights, whether intentionally or by oversight, does not result in a waiver of those rights or remedies for their breach nor does it absolve the defaulting party of further defaults. A party may decide not to strictly enforce the provisions of the contract on a particular occasion or under certain circumstances. It might, for example, accept late payments without insisting on an agreed-upon penalty, or allow the other party to send goods of a different quality on occasion. In its most basic form, the Waiver clause provides that a party does not waive its rights to insist upon strict compliance with terms of the contract in the future simply because it has deviated from the enforcement of those terms in the past. A more complex Waiver and Extension clause will also make the parties right to extend   or   waive   explicit,   provide   any   limitations   on   that   right,   obligations, conditions, or time frames that cannot be extended or waived, and how extensions and waivers are executed.  Examples:  1.   Waiver.   The waiver by the Employer of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Employee will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other subsequent breach by Employee. 2.   Affirmative Waivers.   Neither party’s failure nor neglect to enforce any of rights under this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of that party’s rights.  Written Waivers.   A waiver or extension under this Agreement shall be effective only if in writing and signed by the party granting it.  No General Waivers.   A party’s failure or neglect to enforce any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of that or any other of its rights.",
  "170   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 9  No Course of Dealing.   No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy will preclude any other or further exercise of any right or remedy. 3. Waiver. (a)   No General Waivers.   The failure of any party at any time to require performance of any provision or to resort to any remedy provided under this Agreement shall in no way affect the right of that party to require performance or to resort to a remedy at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver by any party of a breach be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach. (b)   Course of Dealing.   No course of dealing, or any failure to exercise, or any delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. (c)   Written Waivers.   No waiver of satisfaction of a condition or non-performance of an obligation under this agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver.",
  "CHAPTER 10  ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER, IF POSSIBLE  Chapter 10 It is advisable to observe the nature of the agreement and ascertain whether assignment or transfer of the parties’ rights and obligations is permissible or not. An assignment clause stipulates whether the Parties are entitled to transfer any of their rights, obligations or duties under the agreement. If such transfer is possible, conditions attached to such transfer should be specified. In case of legal process (merger, amalgamation, restructuring of the parties, etc.), it is a part of the deal and / or prerogative of the court to give a ruling in this regard. However, it could also arise out of business needs of a party. In respect of agreements wherein individualised products or services are being rendered, the recipient of such products or services is not likely to be receptive to the agreement being assigned to a third party. Say, for example, Mr. X is an established actor and he enters into an agreement with a film production company for acting in three of the company movies. After completing one movie (which happens to be a mega flop), the actor does not want to appear in any more movies of the production house. Will the company be fine if the actor wants to assign the agreement to a junior artist? Sometimes,   the   parties   may   be   comfortable   with   assigning   some   rights   or obligations to third parties, but not the remaining ones. Therefore, the possibility and limitations for assignment of an agreement should be discussed. Even if assignment is allowed, the non-assigning party insists on the assigning party to ensure that the proposed assignee shall give an undertaking to abide by all terms of the agreement. It is common to attach a draft ‘Deed of Adherence’ to be executed by the proposed assignee as an annexure to a contract. Therefore, an assignment clause could include the following: (i)   Assignment, whether permissible; (ii)   Any categories to whom assignment is not permissible; (iii)   Lock-in period within which assignment is not permissible;",
  "172   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 10  (iv)   Certain rights or obligations in respect of which assignment is not permitted; and (v)   Whether the assignee needs to execute a deed of adherence.  Examples:  1. This Agreement shall not be assigned by either Party and no Party shall be entitled to delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to a third party, except with the prior written consent of the other Party. All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding on the Parties and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns. 2. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part (except by operation of law) by either party without the prior written consent of the other party. The assigning party shall have to guarantee the assignee’s performance in case of an assignment. 3. The Service Provider shall have no right to assign, in whole or in part (except by operation of law), this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of the Company. The Company, however, shall have the discretion to assign this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part to any of its affiliates. 4. No Party shall be entitled to assign this Agreement or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to a third party, except with the prior written consent of the other Party. The assigning Party shall ensure that the assignee executes a Deed of Adherence signifying its consent to be bound by this Agreement. 5. The Distributor shall have no right to assign (except by operation of law) this Agreement or any rights, interests or obligations thereunder to any third party without the prior written consent of the Company. The Company, however, shall have the right to assign this Agreement or any rights, interests or obligations thereunder to any of its majority owned affiliates.",
  "CHAPTER 11  DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISM  Chapter 11 It   appears   like smooth sailing   when   the   parties   agree   to   have   a   commercial understanding and an agreement to put their understanding into effect. A dispute or discord is the last thing on their minds.. However, a clear dispute resolution clause is a very important part of their understanding. There is no one-size-fits-all standard solution that you can incorporate in all agreements. One should take into consideration the parties’ relationship (long standing,   individual   relatives,   related   parties,   belonging   to   different   countries, strangers), size and scale of the transaction, the limit of exposure the parties may have under the agreement, etc. The   mechanism   suggested   by   you   should   pass   the   reasonability   and proportionality tests. For example, you will not suggest international arbitration for an agreement between two Indian parties. Where the commercial agreement is of low value, you may suggest discussion or mediation. Size of arbitral tribunal may also be suggested depending on commercial and other considerations in the matter. If the agreement pertains to a high value transaction and is quite voluminous, the parties may not like to share the entire agreement with third partiesin order to invoke the dispute resolution provisions in the event of a dispute. In such a case, they may execute a stand-alone arbitration agreement while referring to the original agreement.  Examples:  1. Any dispute, difference or question arising at any time between the Parties arising out of or in respect of this Agreement or the subject matter hereof shall be referred to the arbitration of Mr. ___________. If Mr. _____________ shall be unable or unwilling to act as arbitrator in the matter, the dispute shall be referred to another mutually agreed arbitrator. If the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, Mr. _________ shall have the right to nominate a sole arbitrator. Arbitration shall be under the aegis of the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.",

The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties. 3. Any dispute, difference or question arising at any time between the Parties arising out of or in respect of this Agreement or the subject matter hereof shall be referred to a panel of 3 (three) arbitrators—each Party shall nominate 1 (one) arbitrator and the arbitrators so nominated shall jointly choose the Presiding arbitrator. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under the aegis of the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in English at Chennai. The Parties shall bear the cost of arbitration proceedings in equal proportion, unless otherwise awarded by the arbitral panel. 4. Any dispute, difference or question in respect of or relating to this Agreement   shall   first   be   referred   to   the   Chief   Executive   Officers (“CEOs”) of both Parties. The CEOs shall make efforts to resolve the dispute by discussing between them and / or by engaging other senior officials involved in the implementation of the Agreement in their discussion.

  "CHAPTER 12  COMPLETENESS  Chapter 12 An agreement should be as complete and self-sufficient as possible. One aspect of completeness is that it should cover all (as much as possible) aspects of the parties’ negotiations and agreement. It should leave no scope for the parties to have to negotiate any aspect in the near future (barring the commercial arrangement, particularly if the commercials involved are dynamic). The agreement should incorporate the entire understanding between the parties in the recital, body, annexures, exhibits and so on. Further, there should be no need to refer to any other document to know anything   regarding   the   transaction   contemplated   in   an   agreement.   If   some agreements are inter-related and there is a need to refer to a particular clause of another agreement, the entire text of the relevant clause should be quoted verbatim. However, this works if such cross-references are not too many. This clause normally goes together with the supersession of earlier agreements clause. These two provisions could be separate or together depending on the structuring of your draft.  Example   of a clause: 1. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties in respect of the subject matter of this Agreement. 2. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties   with   respect   to   the   subject   matter   of   this   Agreement   and supersedes all prior oral and written understandings, agreements and communications exchanged between the parties with respect to the aforesaid subject matter. 3. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and cancels and supersedes any prior understandings and agreements between the Parties with respect to such subject matter. No representations, warranties, terms, conditions, undertakings or collateral agreements, express, implied or statutory between Parties other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement shall be effective or binding from the date of execution of this Agreement.",
  "CHAPTER 13  SUPERSESSION OF EARLIER ARRANGEMENTS / AGREEMENTS  Chapter 13 Once an agreement is executed, it supersedes all prior understandings, arrangements, agreements, etc. between the parties. Many a times, as a first step, the parties execute Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”), Letter of Intent (“LOI”), Non-Disclosure Agreement (“NDA”), etc. Most terms of MOU and LOI are non-binding in nature and provide a time frame for execution of a definitive agreement. When the terms and conditions of a definitive agreement are crystalized between the parties, they execute the agreement and the MOU, LOI, NDA, etc. cease to be effective from the date of such execution. Therefore, after execution of the definitive agreement, the parties should forget their earlier arrangements / agreements and adhere to the stipulations of the definitive agreement. This clause usually comes at the fag-end of an agreement (usually tied with the complete agreement clause), as by then all or most of the agreed terms between the parties have been incorporated in the draft agreement and nothing more is left to be negotiated between the parties. A statement to this effect should be appropriately incorporated in the agreement to avoid any ambiguity or confusion in the minds of the parties.  Examples:  1. This Agreement supersedes and replaces any and all previous arrangements, discussions, negotiations and agreements between the Parties. 2. This Agreement supersedes and replaces all previous arrangements and agreements   between   the   Parties   including,   but   not   limited   to,   the Memorandum of Understanding dated March 12, 2017. 3. This Agreement constitutes the complete expression of the agreement and understanding between the Parties on the subject matter hereof and supersedes   and   replaces   any   prior   oral   or   written   arrangements   or agreements between the Parties. Upon execution by the duly authorised representatives of the Parties, their relationship shall be solely governed",

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties relating   to   the   subject   matter   hereof   and   supersedes   all   prior understandings, negotiations and agreements in this regard, except as may be otherwise specifically agreed among the Parties.",
  "CHAPTER 14  AMENDMENTS  Chapter 14 The agreement should clearly state the process to amend the agreement. An amendment does not replace the original agreement. Only the provision(s) which are changed by the amendment are replaced. All other provisions continue to be in force without any interruption. An amendment works if the changes are few and far between. The original and amendment agreement should be placed together to enable a reader to understand the current applicable provisions. However, if the agreement requires too many fundamental changes or has been amended a number of times and it would be difficult to make sense when the original and amendment agreements are placed together, it is better to execute a fresh document. This fresh document could be titled “Amendment and Restatement Agreement” or “Revision and Restatement Agreement” or say, “Revised and Restated Joint Venture Agreement”, depending on the nomenclature of the original agreement. In this Restated Agreement, all the provisions of the original agreement (with changed provisions) are incorporated to facilitate a one-stop reading. An agreement can only be amended by mutual consent of all the parties and by execution of the amendment agreement by all the parties or their authorised representatives. Sometimes, however, depending on the negotiating power of a party, it may have the sole right to effect certain amendments in the agreement. For example, we do not give much attention to the Most Important Terms and Conditions (“MITC”) of banks. The bank may keep changing the MITCs time and again. As long as some change is not very drastic, we never bother or challenge it and continue using the bank’s services. The same is the case with websites’ privacy or cookies policies. Do we actually read them and consciously agree to such policies? The service providers mostly retain the sole right to make amends in these cases without specific approval of the user. Unless a user objects and keeps using the services, his consent is deemed to have been given.",

  "Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts  PART 8  SIGNING AND SEALING IT",
  "CHAPTER 1  SIGNATURE PAGE  Part 8—Signing and Sealing it Chapter 1 In India, it is a practice for each party to initial each page of an agreement and sign with full official signature on the last page. The primary objective of this exercise is to ensure that no party can replace any of the pages of the agreements.  The name of each Party, the signatory, his designation (if representing his organisation), date and place of execution should be mentioned here. Regarding the authentication documents for identifying a signatory, details of which should be mentioned below the signatures of the authorised signatories, you should try to obtain a copy of a document that bears his official signatures. This will ensure that he does not sign the subject agreement any differently and allege thereafter that his signatures are not genuine. Some organisations have strict rules to affix an impression of its rubber seal / common seal to every significant agreement that they sign to ensure its commitment and authenticity. This way, it becomes difficult to replace (although not impossible in today’s world) any pages.",
  "CHAPTER 2  MINOR CORRECTIONS  Chapter 2 If any minor mistakes are detected after printing of the documents or there are some blanks (in respect of dates, any number, etc.), those can be corrected / filled with ink and all the parties should put their initials against such corrections / fillings on the side. Sometimes, names of the parties’ authorised signatories are also mentioned.",
  "CHAPTER 3  NUMBER OF COPIES  Chapter 3 Normally, each party to the Agreement wants to keep an original copy with itself. Sometimes, the lawyers of one or more parties too are provided with an original copy. If there is a substantial stamp duty on an agreement, one copy of the agreement may be printed with stamp duty payment of appropriate amount and other copies may be printed with stamp paper of a nominal amount. In such a case, if one party is responsible for payment of stamp duty, it has the right to keep the original document on which appropriate stamp duty has been paid and other parties retain copies whereupon a nominal stamp duty has been paid. However, the exact legal position should be confirmed in this regard as the position may differ in some cases. A suitable number of copies may be executed at the same time by the parties accordingly. Sometimes, when the parties are not executing at the same place, they may sign different copies of the agreement The arrangement mutually agreed by the Parties should be narrated so as to avoid any ambiguity in this regard.  Example:  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts which, taken together, shall constitute a single and the same agreement. A party may execute this Agreement and any related documents and transmit them to any other party. Such transmitted document shall be deemed to be, and utilized in all respects as, an originally executed document.",
  "CHAPTER 4  WITNESSES  Chapter 4 In India, an agreement does not compulsorily need to be witnessed to be legally effective. The position is more or less the same in several other countries too.  However, many times, things go wrong between the parties after reaching a commercial understanding and executing an agreement. Usually, the party wanting to opt out of the agreement takes a plea that it never executed the agreement and the purported signatures on the agreement on its behalf are forged or the party signed the agreement under pressure or duress and so on. For this very reason, the authorities insist on some sort of authentication in this regard by way of notarisation, legalisation, attestation, etc. for certain documents. To rely on any submission, they need to first assure themselves that the executant has actually executed the document and knows the contents of his submissions. In case of agreements, a similar way of confirming the authenticity of execution is to have some independent parties to be witness to execution of the agreement. The underlying purpose behind having execution in the presence of witnesses and having the witnesses sign the agreement in token thereof is its evidentiary value. If things go wrong between the parties as aforesaid and a party alleges that it did not sign the document, the witnesses may come to the rescue of the aggrieved party. The witness in such a case can be called upon to confirm the fact of execution. However, the usefulness of the witness is limited. The witness can merely confirm that the supposed signatory signed the agreement in his presence. The witness is not supposed to read and verify the contents of the agreement nor the reasonability or commercial sense thereof. The execution of agreement should always be done in the witness’ physical presence. The witness details must be very clear. He should sign the agreement, put his name in Capital letters, full residential address and some other identification proof (Aadhar card, PAN, etc.—passport numbers and residential address may change with time). This is to ensure that a witness can be easily traced and called upon to provide evidence, if required at a later stage. To prevent forgery, many registration authorities have started taking photographs of the executants as well as witnesses at their office and made it mandatory to attach a copy of an identification document to the concerned document. This makes the process less prone to manipulation and impersonation.",
  "CHAPTER 5  SCHEDULES AND ANNEXURES  Chapter 5 An attachment to an agreement, assumes its significance in terms of how it is dealt with in the operative clauses of the agreement, irrespective of its nomenclature. The nomenclature does not add or reduce the importance of an attachment. Generally, an annexure means something attached, added or appended to something   larger   or   more   important   document,   i.e. ,   the   agreement   in   our discussion. On the other hand, a schedule means a table, catalogue, list, etc. of relatively minor details which instead of being incorporated in the operative body of the agreement (and thereby disturbing the flow of the agreement) is attached separately. The benefit is that a reader who is more concerned with the operative provisions, can continue reading the agreement rather than going through the entire annexure or schedule. Alternatively, if he is interested in the information enlisted in the annexure or schedule, he can straightaway go to the annexure or the schedule. This helps in flow of the operative provisions of the agreement. Annexures or schedules typically incorporate the following, among others: (i) Representations and warranties; (ii) Business Plan; (iii) Remuneration details; (iv) Timelines; (v) Organisational structure; (vi) Drafts of other agreements / documents. An   Exhibit,   means   a   reproduction   of   some   other   document,   for   example,   a government approval, an executed agreement, bye-laws of a company, etc.",

  "PART 9  E CONTRACTS",
  "CHAPTER 1  E CONTRACTS  Part 9—E Contracts Chapter 1 The world around us is changing at an unprecedented pace. In particular, the last 25-30 years have brought about a communication revolution, to say the least. Our lives are technology driven today with e-mail, e-commerce, e-trade, e-contracts and so on. This is the e – way of living our lives and doing business. People’s way of working, commuting, communicating and doing business is changing rapidly. Old models of having physical stores for businesses and having to commute to eat out, shop or bank for customers are shrinking by the day. New business models like online banking, shopping, services, trading, etc. (collectively called e-commerce) are emerging. Increasingly, people carry simplest and trickiest of their day to day transactions on websites or apps. People find it more convenient and economical to carry these transactions from the comfort of their home, office, café or anywhere for that matter, which is merely a few clicks away. This kind of trade has crossed intercity, interstate and even international boundaries. There seems to be no stopping the e-commerce powertrain. Companies can use e-signatures to conduct their business. Websites that connect different businesses can also enter into enforceable contracts while requesting services or ordering supplies. The Startup culture has invaded the entire business ecosystem in the recent past and the new-age entrepreneurs have sewn technology into their scheme of business in a big way. Even the law permits and recognizes companies to conduct their business entirely online. Business houses are saving considerable money with the online business model which allows them to pass on this cost-benefit to their customers in the form of competitively priced products and services, resulting in a win-win situation for all. However, as discussed earlier in the book, all commercial relationships have to be encapsulated in a contract. In this kind of an e-world, where transactions are happening electronically by millions every day, it is virtually impossible for the parties to meet and execute elaborate contracts to govern their relationships. Thus, came about the invention of an electronic contract or simply an e-contract. Necessity is the mother of invention. Most of us execute e-contracts day in, day out, knowingly and unknowingly – be it shopping, online banking, subscription to an app and the like. Think of it, even the illiterate Indian mobile subscribers execute millions of e-contracts every day, even without knowing about it!",
  "192   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  The most common contracts are the EULA (End User License Agreement), where we click the “I agree” button while installing any software or terms/conditions/user agreement on the Website requires. The interaction between the parties in forming an e contract may be through different electronic means: e-mail, a computer program, or two electronic agents programmed to recognize the formation of the contract. An e-contract, however, is different from conventional contracts executed on paper, registered and stamped. Let us discuss some of the key aspects of e-contracts.  Legal Validity of e-contracts  In   India,   the   Indian   Contract   Act,   1872   governs   all   contracts   (i.e.,   legally enforceable agreements). The concept of online or e-contracts would not have been envisioned a century and half back, therefore we do not find any reference thereto. However, to have a valid and legally enforceable commercial relationship, even online contracts must satisfy the fundamental requisites of a contract as prescribed under the Indian Contract Act. This would include, a valid offer and acceptance, mutual agreement (consensus) between the parties, a lawful object, legal competence, valid consideration, precise terms, etc. if any of these ingredients are missing, an e-contract would not be valid and hence, unenforceable. In India, both the Indian Contract Act 1872 and the Information Technology Act 2000 should be complied with in accordance with a valid e-contract. An online contract is legally binding on the user when he/she clicks on the “I agree” button if the above essential terms are met. The provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 ( IT Act ) provide legal recognition to an electronic ( E -Contract)   particularly section 10-A of the IT Act as under:  “ Section 10-A: Validity of contracts formed through electronic means.—  Where   in   a   contract   formation,   the   communication   of   proposals,   the acceptance of proposals, the revocation of proposals and acceptances, as the case may be, are expressed in electronic form or by means of an electronic record, such contract shall not be deemed to be unenforceable solely on the ground that such electronic form or means was used for that purpose.”  The above provision was introduced by the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 after recognizing the growing dependence on electronic means to conclude commercial agreements.   This   provision   applies   where   the   drafting   of   contract, communication of the proposal and acceptance is carried out electronically.",
  "Chapter 1]   Part 9—E Contracts   193  Evidentiary Value of Electronic Records  Indian courts recognize electronic documents under Section 65-A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The procedure for furnishing electronic documents as evidence is provided under Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. As per Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 any information contained in an electronic record produced by a computer in printed, stored or copied form shall be deemed to be a document and it can be admissible as evidence in any proceeding without further proof of the original. Having said that, the admissibility is subject to various conditions prescribed under Section 65-B. It is required that the document or e-mail sought to be produced from a computer, was in regular use by a person having lawful control over the system at the time of producing it; the document or the e-mail was stored or received during the ordinary course of activities; the information was fed into the system on a regular basis; the output computer was in a proper operating condition and has not affected the accuracy of the data entered.  Kinds of e-contracts  We may categorise e-contracts into the following:  1. Shrink-wrap agreements  These are mostly license agreement for software. The terms and conditions for access to such software products are enforced by the person buying it, with the initiation of the packaging of the software product. Tightening-up agreements are simply the agreements that are accepted by users, at time of installing the software on a CD-ROM. You may also observe some additional terms and conditions while loading a software on your computer. If you disagree, you may return the software product and walk out of the agreement. The shrink-wrap agreement provides protection to the product manufacturer for any violation of copyright or intellectual property rights as soon as a buyer opens the product or its packaging for accessing the product.  2. Click-wrap agreements  Click-wrap contracts are web-based contracts. These contracts require the user’s consent by means of “I agree”, “I Accept,” or “OK” button. The user has to accept the terms of use of the particular software with such agreements. Online shopping agreements are the most common examples of such agreements. Users who disagree with the terms and conditions cannot use or purchase the product after cancellation or refusal. We see these agreements every day on almost all websites and apps. The idea is to alert the user about the terms of his engagement with the seller or other party before he gets into an agreement.",
  "194   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  3. Browse-wrap agreements  This agreement binds different contracting parties through the use of a website. The simplest example of this is browsing any website, each user of the website must accept the terms and conditions of use and other website policies for continuous use. If he does not, his access to the website is denied and he can browse no more.  4. Miscellaneous agreements  Some   other   typical   examples   of   e-contracts   are   –   non-disclosure   agreements, software   development   agreements,   software   license   agreements,   distribution agreements, escrow agreements, etc.  Formation of E-Contracts  E-contracts consisting of an offer and acceptance and other ingredients for a lawful contract are enforceable. Not only will a document executed online be considered an e-contract, but even the conduct of the concerned parties can imply a contract. Such conduct may include acceptance of a condition or terms or by simply downloading or exchanging emails on the subject. Some of the ways and means to enter into an e-contract are as under:  Email  This is the most common form of e-contracts. These days, most of the corporate correspondence is conducted over the email. A valid contract can be entered into or inferred by exchanging e-mails. Offer, acceptance, pricing (consideration) and other terms can be completely exchanged via e-mail and this may be supplemented with annexures or oral / written communication.  Website Forms  Most e-commerce portals (websites and apps) sell goods or services. The customers are supposed to submit an order form. Depending on the nature of the products and services, the delivery may be online / offline. Even clicking the “I Agree” button while using a website or app constitutes a valid contract.  EULA  The End User License Agreements also form valid contracts in which end users click “I Accept” or “I Accept the Terms.” In summary, an e-contract is very different from a traditional contract. It is paperless, and it facilitates the parties to have contracts without having to meet each other face to face. It is instant and economical. Let us discuss some aspects of e- contract.",
  "Chapter 1]   Part 9—E Contracts   195  Offer and Acceptance  Most   important   and   fundamental   aspect   of   any   contract   is   valid   offer   and acceptance. In case of e-contracts, the parties do not meet physically, and have neither the time nor the opportunity to make an offer and convey acceptance in expressive or easily identifiable form. Both the offer and acceptance have to be gathered largely by the conduct of the parties. A contract will come into being only when the offer and acceptance process is complete. The contractual relationship between the parties comes into effect thereafter. In relation to this question, e-commerce poses a major challenge. The offer and acceptance should be clearly identified as they determine the exact time and place of the agreement, and consequently the applicable jurisdiction. Often in e-commerce transactions between parties, they never meet. This fact makes it tough to decipher that the parties had a clear understanding on all the issues including a valid offer and a valid acceptance. An offer is a declaration of the terms and conditions whereby the offeror agrees to be bound; and the other party (the offeree) accepts the offer. An acceptance is an unqualified final agreement by the offeree to the terms and conditions of the offer. It is difficult to determine, in case of e-contacts, whether an offer on a website is an offer or an invitation to offer. Further acceptance of an offer becomes effective once it reaches the offeror. A website order form or e-mail is a common acceptance method in the field of e-commerce, but sometimes there is a lag between the acceptance and its receipt or non-receipt by the Offeror. In India, many transactions fail due to poor internet speed or loss of internet during the course of a transaction.  Jurisdiction and Place of Execution of a Contract  Jurisdiction is a territory or sphere of activity within which a court or other adjudicating authority’s ability to entertain a dispute between the parties resides. Simply put, it means the country or the State whose laws would apply for interpreting any provisions of the contract in case of a dispute between the contracting parties. In case of conventional contracts, the jurisdiction depends on the domicile of parties, place of execution of the contract, place of performance of the contract, place of payment, or other considerations. Parties mutually agreed on a jurisdiction normally based on these parameters. This does not hold good for e-contracts. Here, the parties connect with each other online on one party’s website or even on an independent website (which could be an aggregator only, providing a platform to introduce parties to buy / sell) and are invariably located at different places, even different countries.",
  "196   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  Therefore, determination of the jurisdiction becomes tricky as there is no “place of execution.” In case of e-contracts, the parties mutually agree to submit themselves to a particular jurisdiction – mostly, that of the business location of the supplier of goods or services.  Requirement of Signature  Signature means signing a document in one’s own name and style. The underlying feature of signing a document is to confirm the identity of the contracting parties and to express consent to the contractual terms. A person signing a contract cannot at a later date deny or dispute the fact of execution or contents of a contract. Conventionally, signatures are not an essential part for constituting a valid agreement in accordance with the Indian Contract Act. A valid contract may also be an oral agreement between parties. However, certain legislations stipulate requirements for signature, for example, a transfer certificate on an immovable property cannot be valid if the signature and/or thumb impression has not been attested to by the seller to the same. In the case of an e-contract, an electronic signature comes into play. An electronic signature is defined by Section 2(p) of the Information Technology Act (IT Act) as the authentication of any electronic record by a subscriber by means of the electronic technique specified in the second schedule and it includes a digital signature. Further, Section 5 of the IT Act provides that where any law requires that information or any other matter be authenticated by affixing a signature or any document signed by or bear the signature of any person, then such requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied. Electronic signature serves the same purpose as a handwritten signature. The Indian Evidence Act also stipulates that as far as a digital signature is concerned, the courts presume that the information provided in that certificate is true and correct. In case of online contracts, for instance an app or a website, clicking the “I agree” box would amount to conveying acceptance of the terms and conditions, and will be equivalent to signing a contract.  Requirement of Stamping  Central and State legislations on the subject of stamp duty prescribe that certain documents   whereunder   rights   are   established   or   transferred   must   be   properly stamped. A document not stamped or deficiently stamped is not permitted as evidence in a court, or even a competent authority unless the deficiency is corrected by way of a fine of 10 times the amount of the required stamp duty. However, since there is no physical document in case of an e-contract, what do you get stamped? Having said that, remember Benjamin Franklin’s words ‘only death and taxes are certain in life’. Even there, taxes come before death. Many States",
  "Chapter 1]   Part 9—E Contracts   197  are now waking up to the possibility of generating additional revenue by prescribing stamp duty and registration requirements on e-contracts. Stamp duty is already payable on securities issued in e-format. We may soon see legislative provisions in this regard.  Reasonability in Standard Form Contracts  Most online contracts are ‘Click-Wrap,’ a standard contract form in which all conditions are stated on the software webpage or installation page. All the parties are required to use a click of the button appropriate for the terms and conditions. In such standard form contracts, invariably, there is no scope for negotiation. The form is prescribed by the supplier of goods and services and the customer has no say in the drafting or negotiation of such form. In case one is dealing with big corporate houses, there are standard templates (agreements) to enroll vendors. Any party desirous of conducting business with the party prescribing the standard form does not have any leverage and more often than not signs on the dotted line. Therefore, they do not spend much time in reviewing or arguing about any terms they may not be comfortable with. The party drafting such standard forms, templates or contracts (whatever be the format) has an upper hand in the process and does not provide an opportunity to the other party to comprehensively review or comment on the terms and conditions. Their excuse is the tight timeline, the large number of contracts they have to execute, and the inability to devote time required in drafting, reviewing and negotiating each contract separately. If one cannot agree to these standard terms, it is advised to look for business elsewhere. Further, for small stake matters, at least in India, people even do not go the terms and conditions link and click the “I agree” button blindly. The reasonability or otherwise of the terms and conditions, thus, comes to light only when there is a dispute between the parties. However, the law expects that where a party holds a dominant position and enters into a contract with another party, and the transaction appears to be evidently burdensome or unreasonable on the other party, the onus lies on the dominant party to demonstrate that that contract was not imposed on the other party by applying pressure, coercion, etc.  Enforceability  There are enough legislative provisions, well laid and interpreted principles, and case law pertaining to conventional contracts (even the currently applicable Indian Contract Act is reaching a century and a half), be it oral or written. However, in view of the recent emergence of technology driven contracts and lack of robust substantive law to deal with it, the enforceability of contracts executed on the internet is often questionable.",
  "198   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 1  Often, the user of a commercial website is requested to read and agree to the terms and conditions of activities before purchasing or receiving the service provided by the site. The agreements entered into in this way are referred to as the clickwrap agreements, as the user normally specifies his agreement to the terms and conditions by clicking the button or the hyperlink marked “I agree”. Clickwrap agreements are enforceable a bit more easily compared to browsewrap agreements giving regard to traditional contractual principles. Case law on the subject is yet to develop with very few judicial decisions.  Exclusions  In particular, the IT Act 2000 excludes from electronic transactions the following documents:        Negotiable Instruments        Power of Attorney        Trust Deed        Will        Sale Deed or Conveyance deed with respect to immovable property Therefore, for these documents, one has to execute the contract in conventional form, get it executed, witnessed, stamped and registered as per legal requirements.  Conclusion  The law in India has to go a long way in embracing the avalanche of e-world ecosystem. The Information Technology Act was passed in 2000. However, many aspects of e-contracts including the requirements of signature and stamping, remain mired in controversy and confusion. We are moving more and more into a digital world and it is high time the government takes cognizance of these concerns and in fact, encourage execution and enforcement of e-contracts. From a consumer perspective, it pays to be careful before executing any e- contracts. It may take some time but try to read the “Terms and Conditions” before you blindly click “I Agree” button. The devil always lies in the details. You must be aware of what you are getting into. For a draftsman, it is necessary to be aware of the extant legal provisions and enforceability aspects in case of e-contracts. The level of care and attention expected in drafting online contracts is in fact more onerous since the other party can take the plea of having not read it or not been given a chance to negotiate it. All the factors we have discussed in this book to ensure an effective and balanced contract must be taken into account. For example, while drafting policies for websites generally and e- commerce portals, care must be taken to ensure the visitors’ privacy, consumer rights and so on in line with the current legislative provisions and case law. There should be   no   one-sided,   unreasonable   provisions   exonerating   the   website   from   all consequences, else it may be struck down.",
  "PART 10  DO’S AND DON’TS",
  "CHAPTER 1  SPELL CHECK, GRAMMAR CHECK  Part 10—Do’s and Don’ts Chapter 1 How much do you expect from your computer? Are you too demanding? Computers have replaced so many things—clocks, calendars, watches, phones (if you use Skype) and other gadgets from our lives. This makes us too reliant on the computer, doesn’t it? Same goes while one is drafting any document. While finalising any document, the most common trait of the lawyers is to take a spell and grammar check on their computer and if no mistakes are detected, it is good to go from their side. They feel satisfied that there are no mistakes. Please understand and appreciate that ‘Artificial Intelligence’ cannot replace lawyers. For example, a computer may not detect the difference between a ‘Statue” and a “Statute” or “trail” and a “trial”, or “abide” and “avoid”, “floor” and “flour”, “their” and “there”, “heir”, “here”, “hare” or “ire”, “two”, “too” or “to”. One actually needs to read the whole document to detect these errors and correct them. In fact, it would be a cause of concern if computers were smarter than humans. You   dread   replacement   by   computers,   don’t   you?   All   that   talk   of   artificial intelligence and so on ... Doesn’t it worry you?",
  "CHAPTER 2  NO MARRIAGE MANTRAS / DOCTORS’ HANDWRITING  Chapter 2 In India, it is very common to see priests solemnising marriages by pronouncing marriage mantras in Sanskrit language. Very little of what they are saying is actually heard, captured and understood by those getting married or the people around them. The same ritual happens in almost all religious ceremonies—the host and his family organising the ceremony sit in complete attention and the priest goes on chanting the holy mantras presumably appropriate for the occasion. No one understands or bothers what is going on, but everyone nods in agreement and the marriage / ceremony is solemnised. One wouldn’t even know whether the mantras are complete, correct or appropriate for the occasion. Similarly, there is a common complaint against Indian doctors. They write prescriptions in such a way that no patient or those attending to the patient can make any sense out of it. One has to go to a chemist shop to understand the medicines, frequency of administering the medicines or treatment, precautions, etc. The Medical Council is now getting strict and making it mandatory for the doctors to write prescriptions in capital letters to make it legible for the patients and / or their families. A lawyer’s position is more or less akin to that of the priest or the doctor cited above. The client trusts a lawyer to churn out a good draft agreement on the basis of information provided to him and the lawyer’s experience and expertise. Trust plays a very important part in India as far as professional services are concerned. Most of the professional relationships in India are still very personal. Once a client trusts a professional, at times, he may not bother much about what the lawyer has incorporated in the agreement. The client relies on his lawyer’s experience, expertise and skill in negotiating a good deal for him. In fact, many times, the parties do not delve deep into the negotiations or drafting, if they have engaged competent lawyers. They expect their lawyers to act in their best interest and balance their respective rights and obligations under the proposed agreements.",
  "Chapter 2]   Part 10—Do’s and Don’ts   203  In contentious negotiations, the parties may get emotional or hyper at times. The lawyers, on the other hand, remain thoroughly professional and largely emotionless and are considered to be better in this regard. This kind of situation implies a heavy burden or responsibility upon a lawyer. The client trusts him to apply his professional qualification and acumen to the best of his ability. Therefore, he is expected to do a much better job than the priest or the doctor cited earlier. One should be able to comprehend and understand the document and be fully aware of what one is actually getting into and then take a considered decision whether to get into it or not. On a serious note, lawyers with good drafting skills are acknowledged the world over and are intrinsic team members of big corporate houses in every deal they execute.",
  "CHAPTER 3  THE BALANCING ACT  Chapter 3 A mistake that many draftsmen commit is to make a one-sided draft. Generally, when a professional gets a brief from his client, he tends to keep only his client in mind and each clause of the preliminary draft is skewed in his client’s favour. However, such an attitude does not help. Except the online software policies (which I challenge someone to actually read before clicking the “I agree” button), to my mind no commercial agreement is executed without review and negotiation. Invariably, all parties seek a balance of their respective rights and obligations and therefore, all agreements are executed somewhere in the middle of expectations of all parties. Some adjustments and compromises are expected at each party’s end. My question is, why be unreasonable in the first place? A good draft should be a balanced one, so that the parties trust each other and their advisors from the word go. If any provision(s) of your draft is biased towards your client, the other party will seek balancing. If you draft a completely one-sided agreement, it is bound to be rejected by other party and your draft is going to be red-marked all over. As a result, it will take more time and effort to reach an agreement. A reasonably balanced draft will make the other party think before objecting or bargaining on any issues, if it feels you have given it enough leeway in the draft elsewhere. You can counter the other party’s bargaining attempts or arguments with terms you have provided in their favour elsewhere in the agreement. Putting forth a balanced draft for discussion creates trust and goodwill between the parties and ensures steady and expeditious negotiation process.",
  "CHAPTER 4  ALL PROVISIONS IN CONJUNCTION AND HARMONY  Chapter 4 Many provisions in an agreement are co-related and dependent on each other. Reading the different provisions together, they should make commercial and logistic sense and make the agreement workable. For example, in an acquisition transaction, the proposed acquirer wants to carry out a due diligence over the affairs of the target company and thereafter the acquisition price will be negotiated and eventually the acquisition will happen. What if the Acquisition Agreement draft provides that the proposed acquisition be completed within 30 days of execution of the agreement whereas another provision of the same agreement gives 60 days to complete the Due Diligence.. Similarly, a dispute resolution clause may say that a matter shall be referred to arbitration within 30 days of a written notice for a dispute having arisen between the parties. At another place, it may be mentioned that in case of a dispute, the parties shall first try to resolve it by appointing their senior officers in this regard and giving them 45 days from the date of a notice in this regard. Now, these two provisions are contradictory. There   could   be   many   such   examples,   dealing   with   process,   reporting, performance standards, timelines, etc. You have to be very careful to ensure conformity and harmony between different provisions. Else, the parties would be sitting on landmines of potential disputes on something or the other.",
  "CHAPTER 5  CROSS REFERENCING  Chapter 5 Several provisions of the agreement are inter-connected and sometimes such cross- referencing could even be related to another agreement between the parties. A   provision   often   refers   to   another   clause   in   the   same   agreement   or another agreement. Sometimes, a provision can also refer to itself, for example, this Article 4.1.3. Such a cross reference indicates how the two provisions interact; whether one is an elaboration on the other, subordinated, in conjunction or prevailing.  An example:  “Notwithstanding Article 4 (Restrictions on Transfer of Shares), a Party shall be free to transfer the Shares to its Affiliates with the prior written approval of the other Party.” “Except the transfers permitted under Article 4 hereof, no Party shall transfer any Shares to a third party without the prior written approval of the other Party.” Now, to understand what sort of restrictions or liberty is there under Article 4 in the above examples, the reader will have to go to Article 4 in both the cases. Cross-referencing is fine if these instances are few and far between. Too   many   cross   references,   particularly   those   appearing   as   “subject to”, ”notwithstanding” and ”without   prejudice   to”, are   normally   confusing   and break the flow of comprehension. Every time you make a cross reference, you force the reader to go back or ahead searching for another provision and read the current provision in consonance with the other provision and try to make a “combined” sense.   Multiple   cross-references   make   the   agreement   difficult   to   read   and understand. This problem is multiplied if the cross reference is to a provision of another agreement, which may or may not be attached with the present agreement. In such a case, the reader is supposed to first find the other agreement and then relate the two to understand the provision in a holistic way.",
  "Chapter 5]   Part 10—Do’s and Don’ts   207  And what if the agreement has been through many rounds of negotiation and re- drafting? Having a lot of cross-references raises the possibility of erroneous or dead cross-references. Try to eliminate cross references as much as possible. Your draft should be such that the reader is able to understand a provision in the agreement on its own, without his having to turn to other parts of the agreement or even another agreement. If   there   are   many   instances   of   cross   references   from   another   document, incorporate the relevant provision itself. If incorporating the provisions isn’t possible, at least the heading or sub-heading (if available) should be incorporated in the cross-referencing section.  An example:  “Notwithstanding Article 4 (Restrictions on Transfer of Shares), a Party shall be free to transfer the Shares to its Affiliates with the prior written approval of the other Party.” “Except the transfers permitted under Article 4 hereof, no Party shall transfer any Shares to a third party without the prior written approval of the other Party.” Now, to understand what sort of restrictions or liberty is there under Article 4 in the above examples, the reader will have to go to Article 4 in both case. Use automated cross-referencing, if possible.",
  "CHAPTER 6  REMEMBER, THE CLOCK IS TICKING  Chapter 6 Sometimes, timing is very critical to the essence of the agreement and the objectives of the agreement may be defeated, unless the parties move swiftly. In such a case, a suitable clause may be incorporated to emphasise that time is of essence and the Parties are supposed to strictly adhere to the timelines provided in the agreement. In some cases, the parties may also insist on imputing a breach or material breach of the agreement on the other party in case of non-adherence to deadlines imposed by the agreement. Be judicious to formulate a clause depending on facts of a particular transaction.",
  "CHAPTER 7  MEASURE OF TIME/DUE DATES  Chapter 7 Invariably, every agreement has time lines—duration of engagement, performance, notice period, etc. Let us discuss as to how this period should be calculated. Suppose a notice period under an employment agreement is to be calculated in terms of days. The day when notice of termination of employment agreement is given may be excluded from the notice period. Thereafter, 1. If the notice period is to be calculated in terms of months, a “month” should mean a period of time commencing on the day when notice is given, and ending—     ●    at the end of the day before the corresponding date in the following month ( e.g.   15th September to 14th October);     ●    where there is no corresponding date in the following month, at the end of the last day of the following month ( e.g.   31st January to the last day of February); or     ●    where the commencing day is the last day of a month, at the end of the last day of the following month ( e.g.   the last day of February (28th or 29th) to 31st March). 2. If the notice period is to be calculated in terms of weeks, a “week” should mean a period of time commencing on the day when notice is given, and ending at the end of seventh day after the date of notice. For example, if a week’s notice is given on 7th October, you should exclude 7th and add 7 days. Therefore, the notice period would end on 14th October. 3. If the notice period is to be calculated in terms of days, a “day” should mean a period of time commencing on the day when notice is given, and ending at the end of the number of days in respect of which the notice is given. For example, if a 15 days’ notice is given on 17th October, you should exclude 17th and add 15 days. Therefore, the notice period would end on 1st November. Exclude public holidays in your calculation of “days”, if the agreement provides for a notice of a particular number of “Business Days”. However, public holidays do not make a difference if the stipulated period is expressed in terms of weeks or months.",
  "CHAPTER 8  MULTIPLE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS— WHICH SHALL PREVAIL?  Chapter 8 Sometimes, there could be a series of agreements pertaining to a commercial transaction. For example, along with a Joint Venture Agreement, the JV parties may also execute Shareholders Agreement, Technical Licence Agreement, Secondment Agreement, Franchise Agreement, Distribution Agreement and so on. Consistency   must   be   ensured   between   the   provisions   on   all   such   related agreements and it should be clearly specified as to which of the agreements (if any) are co-terminus. It should also be clarified as to which provision shall prevail and have an overriding effect if the provisions of two agreements are not in harmony.",
  "CHAPTER 9  EACH PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE SEPARATE  Chapter 9 Split your content in paragraphs. One clause or paragraph should cover only one subject. Divide the same subject into sub-paragraph, if need be. This will ensure an easy flow of information for the reader. If one subject matter is split across several clauses and paragraphs in the same section or different provisions of an agreement, it is tough to comprehend. The efficacy of all such provisions is lost as well. Similarly, one paragraph should not be mixing up too many things. It confuses the reader.",
  "CHAPTER 10  TABLE OF CONTENTS, INDEX  Chapter 10 A table of contents and index helps a reader if he wants to have a quick look at the provisions. This is required only if the agreement is of considerable length. If the entire agreement runs in less than, say, 10 pages, a reader can easily flip through and find the required provision. During several stages of drafting and negotiation of an agreement, many clauses get deleted, added, renumbered, etc. from time to time. In view of this, you should have an in-built auto system to correct and update the table of contents and index along with changes in your draft. Prepare it once your agreement is in final shape.",
  "CHAPTER 11  PAGE NUMBERING  Chapter 11 The pages of the agreement should be numbered in numerals. The pages should preferably be numbered at the bottom (aligned centre or right). The cover page (if any) need not be numbered. The index page(s) may not be numbered. If the index page itself runs into several pages, you may number it with some other number scheme, say in small Roman numbers. Therefore, if possible, keep and print the cover page and index page(s) separately. Schedules, Annexures and Exhibits of an agreement may be numbered in their own sequence. If some document is being enclosed with an agreement for reference, you could let its own numbering continue. If you are keeping these documents in separate files, they may be numbered separately. However, page numbering in the index may become confusing. In such a case, insert a new number series, like A-1, A-2 .... Then B-1, B-2 for annexures A and B respectively.",
  "CHAPTER 12  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS  Chapter 12 Intellectual Property is, simply defined, any form of knowledge or expression created with one's intellect. It includes a lot of things—for example, scientific inventions, computer software, trademarks, trade names, works relating to literature, art, music or visuals; technology, drawings and designs and so on. IPR protects the exclusive right of the holder to copy a creative work or allow someone else to do so, including the sole right to publish, produce or reproduce, to perform in public, to communicate a work to the public by telecommunication, to translate a work, and in some cases, to rent the work. However, IPRs do not protect bare ideas, but rather the expression of such ideas. Usually, the author of a work is the first owner of copyright. However, where a work   is   created   by   an   employee   in   the   course   of   her   employment   with   an organisation, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the employer is the first owner of the copyright of such work. On the other hand, trade secrecy is basically a do-it-yourself form of protection adopted by the owner of such information. The owner may not have registered such information with concerned authorities to be secured a trade secret; it just keeps the information confidential without disclosing it to public or any third parties. Such protection comes to an end when a trade secret is made available to the public. During the course of the transactions contemplated under an agreement, the parties may have access to each other’s intellectual property rights (“IPRs”) like brand names, logos, technology, etc. Imagine a vendor obtaining a long-term arrangement with Pepsi or Sony. What if the vendor starts putting the Pepsi or Sony logo on its letterhead or visiting cards? The vendor wants to boast and show off its commercial relationship with these big corporate groups. People dealing with such a vendor may put him a notch higher than they normally would in their estimation, not knowing the nature and extent of the vendor’s relationship with Pepsi or Sony. If not stopped, the vendor may keep using these logos on his stationery even after his association with Pepsi or Sony coming to an end. Right? However, is such representation justified and legal? Most commercial agreements lay emphasis on confidentiality of commercial terms and even relationships. Further, the parties are not expected to use Intellectual Property Rights (‘IPRs’) including",
  "Chapter 12]   Part 10—Do’s and Don’ts   215  brand name, logos, etc. belonging to the other, except in course of the business contemplated under the agreement. The vendor may also come to know of certain technology or processes of these companies as well. Should he be allowed to use such information for his benefit? In   case   of   technology   transfer,   cooperation   agreements   or   employment agreements, some new IPRs may also be developed or improved during performance of the agreement. In case of employment agreements, the employer seeks to own the IPR developed through the employment process, the employment being a sort of ‘job work’. One should carve an IPR clause stipulating respective rights and obligations of the parties owing and / or using such IPRs so as to avoid any disputes or challenges to ownership of old or new IPRs or any improvements therein. These obligations can be covered in Confidentiality clause as well as a specific IPR protection clause. The parties should be barred from using each other’s IPRs, unless required in pursuance of the agreement. Further, no party should claim any power, right or license in the other’s IPR without obtaining a specific agreement or authorisation in this regard. There should be no scope for misrepresentation or falsehoods being spread by any unauthorised usage. The clause may demarcate the following: (i) scope of IPR; (ii) restrictions on the recipient—disclosure, usage, etc.; (iii) agreement regarding the new IPR developed; (iv) assistance to each other for registration of new IPR; (v) obligation to report any violation of the other’s IPR; (vi) assistance in pursuing any legal action alleging the violation mentioned in (v) (vii) remedy for violation. A sample IPR clause could be as under:  1.   The Managing Director shall have no rights to any of the Company's concepts, inventions, processes, methodologies or trademarks, nor any rights to any materials that have been copyrighted by the Company. The Company shall own all rights to its patents, inventions, trademarks, service marks, trade names and other trade information. The Company shall   own   all   copyright   rights   to   its   materials,   including   materials prepared by the Managing Director. Any inventions, concepts, processes, methodologies, trademarks, works or other material subject to copyright developed by the Managing Director in part or in whole in connection with his duties and responsibilities with or for the Company, shall belong exclusively to the Company.",

  "CHAPTER 13  IPR CONTRACTS  Chapter 13 In today’s world, intellectual property (IP) is a central element of most businesses, particularly for new-age businesses. It is the most valuable and sometimes the only asset of a business. In case some global brands, the value of its IP is bigger than the GDP of many underdeveloped countries. However, for some reason, protection of these intellectual property rights (IPRs) is not always a top priority when running a business. Protection of IP of an entity is critical and failure in establishing processes to protect it could have adverse financial consequences for the business, irrespective of the violation being intentional or advertent. An IP violation could open your business up to lawsuits and can potentially have a big price tag. Understanding what types of IP exist and how they are protected by the law is critical to avoid accidentally infringing upon someone else’s rights. There are various contracts which entail disclosure of protected IP – e.g., for employment, consultancy, supply, etc. Unless you incorporate adequate safeguards in your contracts, company policies or standard terms and conditions of business, you are exposing your IP to unauthorized usage and exploitation. More than ever before, intellectual property has become critical to the success of a business. You must know and appreciate as to what exactly is your proprietary intellectual property, and how should you protect it? In concept, intellectual property is a special intangible property, which one has created, and it should provide the creator some economic benefit, by virtue of him being the creator. This property must be new and unique, different from all others. The three most common forms of intellectual property include trademarks (distinct signifiers of a brand), copyright (original authorship works) and patents (scientific inventions). One’s capability to protect his intellectual property depends on which category it falls into, since there are different legislations and procedures for this purpose. The underlying objective of these laws is to encourage more and more people and organisations to continue developing new creative works in the fields of art, technology, designing and so on. Such creativity benefits the society at large. However, it is not easy to protect such intellectual property, particularly when you are entering into business deals every now and then. Your contracts must specify the extent of reliance, usage and permission to use your intellectual property by your counterparties while safeguarding its secrecy.",
  "218   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 13  In this chapter, we will examine some typical contracts which entail disclosure of protected IP and discuss methods to limit the disclosure and bind the recipient parties to respect and protect the IP. Let us first discuss some typical contracts and their purpose in relation to IPR protection.     Non-Disclosure Agreements  While   entering into any   negotiations   or even while executing   a contract   for commercial relationships, it is very common for the commercial entity disclosing some confidential information (including IPRs) to insist on execution of a non- disclosure agreement (NDA). This is primarily resorted to protect the confidential information qualifying as intellectual property. Such information is very intrinsic to the   successful   functioning   of   any   company   and   could   include   client   lists, manufacturing   processes,   trade   secrets,   business   structures,   long   term   plans, technologies   or   sourcing   codes,   etc.   NDAs   are   largely   a   compulsory   part   in contemplation of any important and close business relationship to protect disclosure of confidential information in future. The provisions of NDA are applicable, irrespective of the contemplated transaction being concluded. Even if an MOU or Term sheet falls, in the absence of a definitive agreement between the parties, NDA obligations survive. Typical NDA clauses can also be found in other agreements, e.g., employment agreements, consulting agreements, etc.     Assignment Agreements  Such agreements contemplate assignment (i.e. transfer) of the IPRs either fully or partially from the original creator of the IP to another person or organization. This transfer includes a consideration for the transfer to be valid and enforceable. Under such contracts, the original creator transfers his right to develop or further transfer the said IPR to another person or organization. Depending on the nature of the IPR in question (e.g., patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, geographical indications, etc.), such assignments are governed by appropriate legislations. Following are the types of Assignments:     Trademark Licensing / Franchising Agreement  Brand recognition has become one of the most important aspect driving the sales of any product or service. Trademarks are the distinguishing factor for the public to assist them in identifying the products and services of one entity from the others. Therefore, many entrepreneurs seek license or franchise of established brands to sell their products or services thereunder. Under such relationship, the seeker gets the recognition and goodwill of a well-established brand which helps him sell much easily. The brand assists the franchisee in promoting the business and maintaining the same product / service standard of the franchiser in respect of the products or services. These standards are normally universal with some tweaking around in",
  "Chapter 13]   Part 10—Do’s and Don’ts   219  particular   jurisdictions.   Many   of   the   popular   restaurants   /   café   chains   e.g., McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Dominos, KFC, Starbucks, follow a franchisee model.     Technology Transfer Agreements  Under such agreements, the IPR owner authorises another person or organization to use the IPR involved in the technology developed by the former for specific territory, period and purposes. There is a consideration for use of these rights by the licensee. On a global stage, technology generally moves from developed countries to developing or underdeveloped countries. This helps smaller and newer organizations to grow by acquisition of technology from bigger and more established organizations for goods or services. The technology provider is usually paid a monetary royalty by the licensee – a lump sum amount and / or a percentage on sales. Even securities of the licensee can be issued in lieu of royalty payment. India is a classic example. After the liberalization of Indian economy in 1991, there has hardly been any sector in India which has not witnessed technology transfer from foreign companies. Most of the automobile sector in India expanded and improved with such arrangements. The beauty of such relationship was that in addition   to   the   technology   transfer,   even   financial   joint   ventures   flourished whereunder the Indian companies benefitted from the foreign investor’s technology and the foreign investor enjoyed the Indian partner’s distribution network and wide and unmatched consumer base in India – a win-win situation for all.     Copyright Licensing  The owner of the copyright can grant other people or organizations permission or ‘license’ to leverage the copyright, e.g., creating a reprint, or to reproduce or distribute the original works on mutually agreed terms under such an agreement. The scope of the permission or license may be restricted in terms of duration, language, territory and so on. The licensee thus become entitled to use the copyright work subject to the limitations laid down in the contract and does not attain any ownership rights in the copyright. Here again, the licensee has to pay a royalty to the original creator of the copyrighted work on mutually agreed terms.     Employment agreement with inventions assignment  This type of contract confers the employer the rights over any IPR created by an employee in the course of the latter’s employment. Intellectual property rights in an employer-employee relationship are invariably assigned to employer. However, executing a separate inventions assignment agreement is very important for this purpose. Usually, all employment agreements stipulate that all the creations of an",
  "220   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 13  employee are deemed to be under the employer’s ownership. Further, these kind of agreements and clauses also protects the confidential information of the company.  Research and Development Agreement  Such agreements are executed between a company and any individual or an organization when any scientific research and development of an idea, goods or services is to be conducted. Some typical examples are scientists working with pharmaceutical companies, academics researching at universities, etc. In such agreements, the employers insist on suitable assignment clauses to assign any intellectual property developed by the engaged people in the favour of the employers.  Contracts in nature of work for hire  When an organization hires someone (say, an artist or an expert in a particular area) to perform or to create some work over which the organization wants to own copyright, e.g. audio, video, logos, designs, logos, etc., such kind of contracts are executed. Identification of the intended / executed work / product is very important to avoid any ambiguities / disputes at a later stage.  Important Clauses in Intellectual Property Contract  The Intellectual Property Contracts we discussed above include a diverse and a wide range of rights that can be sold, transferred, assigned, licensed, etc. between the contracting parties. However, given the intangible nature of the IPR and complex methods of IPR valuation, utmost care should be taken to draft such contracts. This is more important from the IPR owner’s perspective. However, the recipient too should know what it is getting into and must limit its obligations and financial exposure even in deemed default scenarios. While executing any contract which pertains to IPR, the owner must try to optimize and derive value from its IPR rather than diluting the brand equity. Following are some of the most important aspects that should be borne in mind while negotiating / executing an IPR contact  Ownership  The contract must clearly stipulate the respective rights of parties in the IPR which is in existence at the time of the initiation of the contract as well as the IPR which is developed pursuant to or during the course of the contract. Further, ownership status over the IPR upon termination or expiration of the contract must also be agreed upon and incorporated in the agreement. Most disputes arise due to lack of clarity and ambiguity on this issue. An employee feels he has moral and other rights over something that has been created by him and the",
  "Chapter 13]   Part 10—Do’s and Don’ts   221  employer is of the view that since the employee has been paid the consideration for its creation and as it is created in the course of employment, it is the employer’s prerogative to assert ownership rights. This is one of the primary reasons for discontentment on disengagement with technology companies.  Confidentiality  The primary objective of IPR related agreements is to protect the proprietary and confidential nature of the IPR. Therefore, in virtually all commercial agreements, where some IPR is to be shared with the other party, the IPR owner must insist on a confidentiality clause. IPRs provide edge to the creators over others in several spheres of their business and therefore, conscious efforts to protect such rights from falling into third parties’ hands is necessary. A confidentiality clause disincentivizes the recipient party from sharing it with unintended parties, particularly if the consequences for such unauthorized sharing are severe.  Limits of IPR Use  Whenever a party gives the right to another to use its IPR in any manner, it should have a comprehensive contract to lay down the parameters / limits for such usage. For example, the territory, the products or services or processes, the duration, the purpose, etc. of use of IPRs. Any use beyond these parameters should be deemed to be material breach of the contract.  Limit Access  The IPR owner must stipulate that the other party will restrict access to the confidential information only to those employees, agents, advisors, consultants or representatives who need to work on it in pursuance of the contact and no one else should be given access to such information.  Inventory  IPR owner should be diligent enough to record and document the IPRs in a way that they are easily identifiable at all times – at initiation or subsistence or termination of the agreement.  Consideration  IPR should fetch a good return to its owner. The contracts must stipulate precise methodology to calculate royalty and revisions therein from time to time and consequences for default.  Termination/ Breaches  The contracts must also prescribe the consequences of breach of the confidentiality / IPR contract including termination of contract, damages, legal pursuit and so on. The consequences should be severe and stringent enough to discourage the recipient party from violating the terms.",
  "222   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 13  Transfer vs License  The contract must be very clear whether the IPRs are being transferred for good (virtually sold) or just being licensed (i.e., a permission for use for limited time and purpose). In the absence of such clarity, there could be a difference in the parties’ perception of the nature of transfer and it could cause friction and disputes. Another issue emerges in case of termination or expiry, if it is a sale/assignment, nothing is to be done but in case of license, the owner may seek return of IPRs, drawings, designs, etc. and insist on the recipient not using it thereafter.",
  "CHAPTER 14  ABOLISH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN WRITING  Chapter 14 Writing in capital letters means you are shouting. It is very irritating to read and understand. However, there could be some abbreviated definitions or initials of individual parties in capital letters. Apart from this, you may also keep chapter or section headings or signatory details in capital letters. Minimise the use of capital letters in your drafting.",
  "CHAPTER 15  AVOID REDUNDANT, REPETITIVE WORDS AND PHRASES  Chapter 15 It is customary in our day to day life to use such words and phrases. The use of more words than required is called pleonasm. We use such words and phrases to emphasise and once such words and phrases are used frequently, they become acceptable too. Oxymoron. An oxymoron occurs when two contradictory words are together in one phrase. In fact, oxymoron translates from the Greek words oxy meaning sharp, and moron, which means dull. Thus, the word itself is two contradictory words joined together. The Webster Dictionary defines oxymoron as “a combination of contradictory or incongruous words”. Oxymorons can be used for dramatic effect, for example: Hell's Angels and deafening silence.

They add nothing to the meaning of adjoining words and merely emphasise the relevant word. You should avoid such words as much as possible.",
  "CHAPTER 16  GENERAL PROVISION FIRST, THEN EXCEPTIONS  Chapter 16 While working on any draft, you should start with writing the basic premise or rule, that is, a general provision regarding a right, obligation, activity of a party, etc. This is called setting forth the rule. Invariably, there are exceptions to these rules. However, these exceptions are limited and not applicable in all cases and not applicable to everyone. Therefore, you should first set the rule very clearly and only thereafter (in the following sentence or paragraph) set forth exception with a clarification as to how and why the general rule does not apply to a particular case. Exceptions and conditions attached to a general provision should follow the main sentence after the general provision has been set. Initiating a sentence with exception forces the reader to go back and forth to understand the implication of the general provision and the exception. It is much easier to follow a basic idea incorporated in the agreement and go through exceptions, if any. Read the following and observe which is easier to comprehend.  Example 1 . Except its closure on Saturday and Sunday, the Store is open from 9 am to 8 pm.  Example 2 . The store is open from 9 am to 8 pm. Closed on Saturday and Sunday.",
  "CHAPTER 17  AVOID REPETITION OF CLAUSES  Chapter 17 This happens when you do a cut-and-paste job or do not pay enough attention to the agreement structure. The components of one clause are either scattered clumsily in several provisions or the clause itself is repeated several times,   inter alia , due to: (1) cutting and pasting contents from different drafts; or (2) getting instructions from clients about insertion of a provision and you do not check that you have already provided for it in the agreement. This leads to repetition. Further, the numerous clauses on the same subject may not be the same or consistent. In case of a dispute, which one is to be relied upon. Trust me, you will be in a soup for this oversight.",
  "CHAPTER 18  WHY BE PASSIVE?  Chapter 18 Just observe what do we use more while talking—(i) active voice; or (ii) passive voice? I am sure your answer will be active voice. Then why are agreements cursed to be written in passive voice. An agreement is a way of talking to the reader, telling her what the agreement is all about. Right? Then why should it be in a tone different than our normal speech which is easily comprehendible? Agreements, therefore, should be drafted in the active voice, as much as possible. This ensures brevity, makes the language tighter and conveys the intention more directly. Active voice sentences are more concise and fewer words are required. They clearly demonstrate as to what party does what.  Example:  1. The Products shall be delivered by the Supplier to the Client. (Passive Voice) The Supplier shall deliver the Products to the Client. (Active Voice) 2. No services shall be rendered by the Service Provider in the absence of advance payment. (Passive Voice) The Service Provider shall not render any services without advance payment. (Active Voice) The first sentence emphasises the products or services erroneously, whereas the emphasis should be on the Supplier’s or the Service Provider’s obligation. The second sentence achieves this objective by putting the onus correctly. It is tedious to read and comprehend sentences in passive voice. Avoid passive voice as much as possible. It only makes sentences wordier and less effective.",
  "CHAPTER 19  SMALL SENTENCES  Chapter 19 Long sentences are a strain on the brain. If a sentence is too long, the reader tends to lose track of where the sentence started from and what it wanted to say. Break long sentences into two or more smaller sentences or even sub-clauses, if need be. This makes it look neater and easy to understand. Have a look at the following sentence / paragraph: In the event that the Purchaser defaults in the payment of any instalment of purchase price, taxes, insurance, interest, or the annual charge described elsewhere herein, or shall default in the performance of any other obligations set forth in this Contract, the Seller may: at his option: (a) Declare immediately due and payable the entire unpaid balance of purchase price, with accrued interest, taxes, and annual charge, and demand full payment thereof, and enforce conveyance of the land by termination of the contract or according to the terms hereof, in which case the Purchaser shall also be liable to the Seller for reasonable attorney's fees for services rendered by any attorney on behalf of the Seller, or (b) sell said land and premises or any part thereof at public auction, in such manner, at such time and place, upon such terms and conditions, and upon such public notice as the Seller may deem best for the interest of all concerned, consisting of advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or city in which the security property is located at least once a week for Three (3) successive weeks or for such period as applicable law may   require   and,   in   case   of   default   of   any   purchaser,   to   re-sell   with   such postponement of sale or resale and upon such public notice thereof as the Seller may determine, and upon compliance by the Purchaser with the terms of sale, and upon judicial approval as may be required by law, convey said land and premises in fee simple to and at the cost of the Purchaser, who shall not be liable to see to the application of the purchase money; and from the proceeds of the sale: First to pay all proper costs and charges, including but not limited to court costs, advertising expenses, auctioneer's allowance, the expenses, if any required to correct any irregularity in the title, premium for Seller's bond, auditor’s fee, attorney's fee, and all other expenses of sale occurred in and about the protection and execution of this contract, and all moneys advanced for taxes, assessments, insurance, and with interest thereon as provided herein, and all taxes due upon said land and premises at time of sale, and to retain as compensation a commission of five percent (5%) on the amount of said sale or sales; SECOND, to pay the whole amount then",

  "CHAPTER 20  HOW TO WRITE DATES  Chapter 20 A date can be written in many ways: 20 March, 2017 March 20, 2017 20   th   March, 2017 20 March, 2017 March 20, 2017 March 20   th , 2017 20-03-2017 20/03/207 03/20/2017 03/20/207 If you were to write 09/11/2017, what date would it indicate? In India, it would mean 9 November, 2017 as the format is Date/ Month/Year whereas in the US, it could indicate 11 September, 2017 as the format used there is Month/Date/Year. To avoid any confusion, it is better to write the month in words (rather than number), for example 20   th March, 2017 and whatever format is used first should be used throughout the agreement. This way, you will never be wrong and a same date would be registered in the mind of anyone reading the agreement anywhere in the world.",
  "CHAPTER 21  HOW TO WRITE NUMBERS  Chapter 21 When you are to write any amounts or time period in the agreement, try to write it in numerals followed by words in brackets. For example, USD 3,000 (Three thousand United States Dollars), 15 (fifteen) days, 7% p.a. (seven percent per annum) etc. The dates and years may not be written in words. However, if you do so, though it may be overdoing something but it will definitely help in eradicating scope for any mistakes! The percentages should always be mentioned in per month or per annum. Otherwise, it creates ambiguity. It is very simple for parties to say 2% penal charge for delay in performance, but there should be parity of thought process between the parties as to whether it is: (i) a lump sum figure of 2% of the consideration; (ii) 2% of consideration per month for the period of delay; (iii) 2% of consideration per annum for the period of delay. Clarity will help the parties to arrive a better claim management. Isn’t it? Also, be clear whether to write numbers in million, billions or lakhs and crores— the latter terms are used more frequently in India, a lakh being equivalent to one hundred thousand and crores meaning ten million. Choose a consistent style of writing numbers throughout the agreement, although it is always better to write numbers first then words in brackets, being more comprehendible. Further, certain European countries use comma and decimal sign (full stop) in numbers differently from others. In India 4,000 would mean four thousand but for a German party, it would mean four point zero as they use comma (,) for decimal point (.). Following numerals with words eliminates this confusion.",
  "CHAPTER 22  AGREE ONLY ONCE  Chapter 22 It is a very common (but outdated) practice to repeat “the parties hereby agree”, “the parties agree”, “the parties expressly agree”, “the parties specifically agree” in several clauses. This is an avoidable situation. Every agreement starts with the clause “The Parties agree as under:”, doesn’t it? Thereafter only, specific clauses start incorporating the specific provisions. It is clear thus that the parties agree on each clause of the agreement and therefore, the entire agreement. Indicating the parties’ agreement in different clauses doesn’t add anything to the content thereof.",
  "CHAPTER 23  DAYS VS BUSINESS DAYS  Chapter 23 A calendar day is any day of the week including weekends and festivals. It could relate to any day of the week, month or year. A business day or working day on the other hand could be any day of the week except the weekend days, which in most countries are Saturday, Sunday or both. This concept also excludes public holidays. The concept of days and business days could vary between different parties, particularly when they are from different countries or walks of life. Therefore, be careful while mentioning any timelines in the agreement (for example for giving notices, acting on a complaint, closing of a transaction, etc.) in terms of days. Wherever there is reference to days, specify if you mean business days. As a norm, keep deadlines in terms of calendar days only. As mentioned earlier, the concept of business day may be different for different people. Even if a definition is put in for business days, calculating it over a long period would be prone to errors. However, it is problematic when the deadline is spread over short time. Suppose, an action is to be taken within 3 days of receiving a complaint from the other party and a party lodges its complaint on Friday 23rd January evening. Saturday and Sunday (24th and 25th January) are weekly off days for the receiving party and Monday happens to be 26th January, which is a national holiday in India. How is the party receiving the notice supposed to act during this period? You may need to keep a provision of working or business days in such a situation. Therefore, use the concept of business days sparingly. Use it when the number of days required for any action to be taken is very less, you actually need those number of business days and the business days are very easily identifiable during such period. Similarly, if a specific time is to be mentioned, it is better to specify it in terms of 24-hour format. A day, if not defined under the agreement, is most likely to be interpreted to be a calendar day. Similarly, a month would be construed to be a calendar month.",
  "CHAPTER 24  USE OF PRECEDENTS  Chapter 24 While drafting an agreement, you should bear in mind that no two transactions are the same. Therefore, no two drafts can be identical. This holds good even if the transaction contemplated thereunder is the same, be it partnership, distributorship or an asset acquisition. I am assuming that if you are using a precedent, the transaction therein is identical to the one with you in hand. If this is not the case, there is not much that you can use from an old draft apart from boilerplate clauses. How many provisions of an old partnership agreement can you replicate for drafting out a Share Purchase Agreement among 7 companies? Over-reliance on precedents is a short-cut which can be counter-productive, if not used carefully. In each transaction, the parties, their commercial arrangement, mindset, maturity level, respective jurisdictions, prior experiences of operating in a particular location or   business   environment,   resources   at   disposal,   expectations,   ethical   practices, corporate governance norms, governing law, vision (whether short-term or long- term), commitment level, to name a few aspects - all these elements are different in each transaction. Once bitten, twice shy. In certain instances, you may come across a party may have had a bitter experience of working with some other party in a similar transaction earlier, so it may carry emotional baggage too. It is difficult for such a party   to   trust   a   new   party.   The   doubting   party’s   concerns   regarding   certain provisions could be genuine and have to be dealt with delicately. No one-size-fits-all works for corporate / commercial transactions. Further, law is an ever-evolving subject. As your experience and knowledge increases (hopefully and quite optimistically thinking) with time, your drafting skills and drafts should also get better. Check the parties’ status (individual - male / female, partnership, LLP, company — whether a one-person company or public company or private company or listed company, government, Public Sector Undertaking, etc.). The status of parties in the current case may be different from the precedent you are using. The legal provisions applicable to different kind of parties are different and should be dealt accordingly.",
  "236   Practical Guide to Drafting Commercial Contracts   [Chapter 24  You may therefore, need to go through the entire precedent very carefully and have to suitably change the terms like he, she, it, company, firm, LLP, his, her, they, them, theirs, etc. throughout with appropriate respective terms applicable in the present case while working on the draft. While using precedents, many people tend to lose track of this aspect. Certain provisions of the used precedent may not be applicable to the present transaction because of different status of parties, location or governing law among other reasons. For the same reasons, there could be many new elements required to be added in your draft. Do not get carried away if you manage to get hold of a draft from a Magic Circle firm or draft of a mega deal which made pink newspapers headline a few weeks back. You still have to customise a draft for your deal and protect your client’s interests. Summing it up, however good a precedent, it cannot be a perfect draft. There would be something or the other different in the present transaction. Pay minute attention to each aspect of the current transaction and seek confirmation from the client, if need be.",
  "CHAPTER 25  READ, READ AGAIN  Chapter 25 Many times, a lawyer drafting the agreement does not take time to read the document carefully. Many lawyers feel offended if they are asked to review their writing carefully. They are so full of themselves and feel entitled to feel that whatever they have drafted must be alright. Another reason is that when a lawyer reads the draft agreement so many times during different stages of negotiation and drafting, his eyes stop hitting the wrong notes in the draft after a while. It is only when the client / other party / other party’s lawyer reads the document and comes back to the drafting lawyer with his comments on mistakes, oversights, blatant disregard to his brief or multiple issues that are either not required in the agreement or were never contemplated, that the mistakes or oversights are realised. Sometimes, the mistakes are too many as well as embarrassing—not every mistake can be justified or brushed aside or put under the carpet, you know. Such episodes put a lawyer and / or the concerned law firm, as the case may be, to great embarrassment. To borrow from the words of William Gregory Paige, “Three things that never come back — the spent arrow, the spoken word and the lost opportunity.” In my opinion, a lawyer’s draft may be safely and fittingly added to this. It is better to read and fine tune any draft before circulating it outside your office (irrespective of the rounds of reading it takes from any number of people). Many of the errors can be detected by reading the draft carefully.

  "CHAPTER 26  CARE TO KNOW YOUR DRAFT  Chapter 26 As a matter of fact and practice, not many draftsmen pay attention to all that is written in the draft agreement. This is because on an average, not more than 10% of a written agreement is actually written or drafted afresh. Drafts nowadays are mostly nothing   but   recycled,   reworked   or   re-churned   (whichever   term   you   prefer) precedents. For this reason, many old, redundant, outdated, obsolete, incorrect provisions continue in draft agreements because no one actually cares to read and understand whether they are correct or updated and whether they are required at all in the context of the present assignment in hand. A common excuse for letting such clauses continue in a draft is—it’s been there, so let it be. Who has the time to read, review, analyse and rework (if needed)—it will take so much time and effort? Why invest so much in a clause that’s been there since time immemorial ... this is particularly true with the Boilerplate clauses. For the first 3 years of my career, I was involved with incorporation of a number of Indian companies. At the incorporation stage, the Articles of Association (bye- laws) used to be standard ones. Mostly, the draft used for incorporating the last company at the office was picked up, the name, capital clause and few other cosmetic changes were made and it was ready to go. However, when I actually started reading and trying to understand what was written, I was shocked to find grammatical errors, factual inaccuracies and variations from legal provisions. I learnt to correct these mistakes and not make the same mistakes next time. There is so much pressure on lawyers (particularly in big law firms) to log in minimum billable hours and work on multiple transactions at a time, they feel helpless devoting too much time on one assignment. Whatever be the constraints and pressure, this is a wrong approach. One must actually read, understand and question all the provisions that are there. What if the client starts asking you the meaning, relevance and requirement of any provision which you have not cared to read?. Remember the legal principle,   Nemo dat quod non habet . This principle is used in case of passing on title of a property. It literally means “no one gives what he doesn't have”.",
  "Chapter 26]   Part 10—Do’s and Don’ts   239  The same principle can be applied in the present scenario. If you do not understand something in an agreement, you cannot explain its reason or rationale to anyone else. You must endeavour to understand each provision of your draft.It is only then that you can explain or justify them to your client, the counterparty or their lawyers. For example, Articles of Association (‘AOA’) of companies typically contain provisions about calls, surrender, forfeiture, reissue, etc. relating to partly paid-up shares. However, if there is one sentence in the AOA to the effect that “The company shall only issue fully paid up shares.”, none of these provisions are required. It is very likely that no one may notice this and the aforesaid provisions will perpetually continue in the draft. Relying on old drafts too much may also not take note of new enactments, repeals or amendments in statutory provisions. Law is a very dynamic field. While working on a draft, you need to take care of the updated position on all legal provisions applicable to the present transaction. In fact, if some legal provision undergoes change while you are amidst drafting, you must update your draft while informing   the   parties   of   the   development   at   the   same   time.   It   may   have positive/negative/deal breaking effect on all or one or some of the parties. There should be nothing in your draft, absolutely NOTHING, that you do not understand completely. You need to take care when the basis of your draft is an older draft with umpteen boilerplate clauses. Do take the time to understand each provision. Include a provision from an earlier draft only if it is required in the present one and if you do not understand what it is and why it is needed, understand it first. Thereafter, take a call whether to include it; and if including it, whether you should include it in its present form or whether some changes are required. If you carry out this exercise in the initial phase of your career, your succeeding years will be very productive and successful, trust me. In the military, they say the blood you spill while training is what you save while fighting.",
  "CHAPTER 27  CONSISTENCY AND CONTINUITY— TWIN STARS  Chapter 27 Just imagine going to watch the latest blockbuster at a fancy multiplex. Half-way through the movie, you realise that you aren’t watching a new movie but some editor has managed to merge clippings from 27 old movies of an actor and put it across as a new movie. How would you feel? You may be aware of “Continuity editing” in movies or TV serials. This continuity gives the viewer the impression that the action unfolds with consistency. In most movies, logical coherence is achieved by cutting to continuity, which emphasizes smooth transition of time and space. Continuity editing is the predominant style of film editing and video editing in the post-production process of moviemaking. The purpose of continuity editing is to smooth over the inherent discontinuity of the editing process and to establish a logical coherence between shots. On the other hand, continuity errors are bloopers that don't match the storyline or timeline from other parts of the same episode or other episodes. Most people are intelligent enough to point out such bloopers. Youtube is full of such bloopers being pointed out by the viewers in almost each movie and TV serials. If you do a cut-and-paste job and draft different provisions of an agreement by picking up clauses from several precedents, what you get is a mish mash of different writing styles, number scheme for clauses, fonts, sizes, shading and what not. Some people use dynamic, crisp language and some use archaic language. Some people are still stuck in passive voice and some people write in active voice because they are active. Never lift a precedent and start making changes therein. The properties of the file will continue to show the original author’s credentials and date of creation of the document, if someone has an eye for detail. Always copy the desired text from an existing document, paste it in a new file on your system and start working on it the way you want.",
  "Chapter 27]   Part 10—Do’s and Don’ts   241  If you work to only modify the earlier documents, you are bound to deviate from continuity editing and commit continuity errors. Your reader is bound to get a movie-goer’s experience mentioned above, if you provide him with a medley of drafts squeezed into one. The flow of the agreement should be smooth and seamless, as if one is watching a new movie or participating in a dialogue. Even if it is a remake of an old movie, the new one should seem fresh and having been worked upon seriously. You   may   have   a   hard   time   harmonising   all   the   provisions   from   different precedents. However, you have to undertake this tedious task to ensure consistency. Otherwise, your efforts in collating different provisions from different places will become too apparent. There should be consistency throughout the agreement. Consistency   of   language,   format,   font,   number   scheme,   writing   style   and everything else should be there. Language. There are differences in British and American English spellings. Use one of them consistently. Recognise—Recognize Criticise - Criticize Flavour—Flavor Colour—Color Endeavour - Endeavor These words should not appear differently at different places in the agreement. Else, your spell check will show you confusing results and recommendations. Font Style and size should be consistent throughout the agreement. Headings, whether in bigger font size, bold, capital, italics, underlined, etc.—a similar pattern should be followed throughout. Similarly, a consistent approach relating to indent and spacing between clauses and sub-clauses should be adopted. Inconsistencies breed irritation and confusion in the mind of the reader. He is likely to feel dizzy and will become indifferent after a while if the consistency is lost mid-way.",
  "CHAPTER 28  FORMAL AND SERIOUS TONE  Chapter 28 Most of the corporate correspondence now takes place on the internet. Sometimes, because   the   correspondence   is   from   person   to   person,   a   certain   amount   of informality and casualness creeps into the language used in correspondence over email. However,   the   situation   is   different   when   the   parties   reach   a   commercial understanding and wish to execute a definitive agreement. An agreement is a formal and legal document. It is to be used by transacting parties and their officials may require submission to various domestic and international authorities and even arbitrators or courts in case of a dispute. Therefore, the language of an agreement should reflect seriousness and business- like approach of the parties. There should be an air of formality in the agreement to reflect this serious mind-set. This is similar to wearing formal attire at formal occasions - it breeds seriousness and respect for the occasion. These days, an agreement may also have parties from more than one country. The standards of acceptable language in terms of formality, politeness, simplicity, etc. may be different for them. If the agreement is in English language, the standard of English language knowledge between the parties may also be different. Therefore, it is better to have an easy, simple and formal language in agreement. Except   for   provisions   in   bullet   points,   there   should   be   complete   and grammatically correct sentences. Internet language and slangs should be avoided. Some avoidable terms  Used Term   Correct / suggested term  &   And @   at or at the rate of (whichever is correct in the context of the sentence) Gonna   going to wana / wanna   Want to End   Terminate",
  "Chapter 28]   Part 10—Do’s and Don’ts   243  Other words used lightly, without meaning them, out of context or abbreviations of internet terms should also be avoided to the extent possible. However, commonly understood professional abbreviations may be used with necessary explanation provided in the definition clause, if need be. This will enable even the non-technical readers or authorities to understand the agreement easily.",
  "CHAPTER 29  SIMPLE LANGUAGE  Chapter 29 If a student has bad handwriting, he may lose out on marks not only for his bad handwriting, but also inspite of correct answers. This sub-optimal result could be due to the teacher’s inability to read the answers (even correct ones) due to bad handwriting. A teacher gets very less time to examine an answer sheet and if most of his time goes only in trying to understand what a student has written; you cannot expect him to be 100% attentive, fair and generous. Same goes with an agreement, which is not drafted in a simple, easy-to- understand language. Remember, whom you are drafting the agreement for. It is broadly written for the benefit of,   inter alia , the following:  1. Parties to the agreement 2. Their advisors and employees, who are to implement the agreement 3. Banks, who are the lifeline of any business and invariably want to see everything that their client does 4. Creditors of the parties 5. Government agencies 6. Court or arbitrators (in case of any dispute between the parties) Which of the above (other than the Court or arbitrators) would have the time, intellect or inclination to decipher a complicated agreement, full of jargon and difficult words and phrases? One tends to ignore what one doesn’t understand and may not grant you the favour sought. You cannot expect a reader to sit with a dictionary and try to make sense of each clause which you have very laboriously incorporated in the agreement after taking endless hours and burning the midnight oil. Am I getting carried away with my description? Sorry. While drafting an agreement, your job is not to impress anyone with your multi- lingual proficiency or legal knowledge, jargon or verbosity. You should rather ensure",
  "Chapter 29]   Part 10—Do’s and Don’ts   245  that your client’s interests are protected to the maximum extent possible and he should derive the maximum benefit of the agreement in whatever he does and if the agreement   is   placed   before   any   of   the   authorities,   court   or   arbitrators   for enforcement of your client’s interest, they should understand your client’s position favourably. Instead of trying to impress your client and other parties listed above, you may end up confusing them. If the readers lose interest in an agreement due to your supposedly stylish and “legal” language, it is an unintended self-goal you commit. A self-defeating endeavour, I would say. For the benefit of all, thus, it is very important to draft an agreement in an easy- to-understand, simple language. Minimise the use of non-English words, if you are drafting an agreement in English. Use words that are commonly used and which most of the educated people know and understand. Legalese and jargon should be minimised, as much as possible. Certain words and phrases lose circulation with time and should be avoided. Replace them with contemporary words and phrases.",
  "PARTING NOTE FROM AUTHOR  All good things come to an end. It is time to say goodbye. I believe in ‘Two ears, one mouth’ theory and am a man of very few words. I try to hear more and speak less. This is my second book and most of the text has actually been typed by me, not lifted or cut-paste. Although I have more than 200 articles published by now, those are on diverse subjects and it is hard to believe I could actually write so much on one subject in this book. The contents of this book have been generated from my experience of the last 2 decades. I would have drafted few thousand agreements and reviewed number many times that. I tried to capture as much as I could with my experiences while drafting or reviewing agreements. The idea behind this book is not to teach law, but common drafting skills. The applicable rules, regulations, legislations are different for each agreement but the general skills required to draft an effective, efficient and unambiguous agreement are by and large the same. An industry specific knowledge would definitely add to your armour while drafting an agreement pertaining to that industry. This book should help lawyers and non-lawyers, draftsmen as well as readers. Non-legal professionals in CXO positions often get bombarded with agreement drafts for their review and inputs. This book will give them ideas as to what makes an agreement complete and effective and what loopholes one should try to avoid. Encapsulating so many experiences isn’t an easy task - it took me almost a year to bring about this book. My last book and articles on the subject have generated interest in law schools in imparting drafting skills to their students and I am increasingly getting invites from law and management colleges to give practical guidance to their students on drafting skills. Happy to help! Learning good drafting skills is a lifetime investment for students and professionals. Those investing earlier reap higher returns.
