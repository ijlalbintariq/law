That the present petitioner is hit by the principle of �Laches� so much so, the present petition has been filed the petition, after the lapse of 9 months and that too without any plausible explanation of delay.\r3. That the petition is malafide false and frivolous, since all remedies under the law has been availed at two forums i.e ombudsperson and the Worthy Governor of Punjab.\r4. That the writ petition is no maintainable since the concurrent finding are against the petitioner and not illegality and regularity has been pointed out in the petition.\r5. That the petitioner has been given full opportunity of hearing viz production of  evidence, cross examination on witnesses and the case was strongly contested on wrong and false allegations against the respondent No.3 and 4. \r6. That after contesting the protracted litigation on all the forums the respondent No.3 and 4 sustained substantial losses to their reputation, respect of integrity which necessitated to file suits for damages against the petitioner and as a counter blast the present petition has been filed with malafide intention.\r7. That earlier the petitioner filed writ petition No.22263/16 in this Honourable court which was dismissed in-limine vide order dated 27-06-2016, whoever, an Intra Court Appeal No.1211/16 was also filed, which too dismissed vide order dated          22-12-2016, Copies enclosed ANNEXURE-R/1 the petitioner has been given full and fair opportunity to plead her cause, which is evident from the record and evidence produce by the parties. Copies enclosed ANNEXURE R-2.  \rON MERITS\r1. That para No.1 is factual.\r2. That para No.2, is correct.\r3. That para No.3 is incorrect and vehemently denied to the extent that the answering respondent No.3, professor Dr. Arif Khan had a bad eye on a petitioner since the time when she was a student and this fact was not brought to the notice of anybody neither from 2004 to 2006 and from 2011 to 2016, the allegations are baseless unfounded, after thought hence vehemently denied, just to malign the answering respondent No.3. It is worth mentioning, that the petitioner has miserably failed to prove any one of the allegation before the Ombudsperson Punjab which is crystal clear fro the decision in detail dated 22-03-2017.\r4. That the para No.4 is vehemently denied as incorrect rather it was the respondent No.3, being a supervisor of the petitioner extending full support for the completion of her M.Phil and petitioner got the excellent score. The respondent No.3 has never ever any grudge malice or ill-will against the petitioner. The respondent No.3 remained affectionate and provided her all the acumen and knowledge of the educational career which all the time appreciated and acknowledge by the petitioner and she was able to obtained the Ph.d from China.\r5. That para NO.5 is incorrect hence vehemently denied, the respondent No.3 throughout his carrier treated the student male or female like his own children and never discriminated or harm any students it was not the duty of the respondent No.3 to issue university book / computer to the student, the show cause notice if any issued to the petitioner for her absence or negligent behavior was issued under rules and regulation by the chairman at the relevant point of time. It is worth mentioning here that the petitioner after completing her Ph.D in China and due to her over stay in china without any intimation and failed to joined the department in time. The show cause notice was issued under the provisions of Peeda act and minor punishment of �Sensure� was awarded her by the then voice chancellor / chairman syndicate Dr. Muhammad Nawaz. It is wroth mentioning that any disciplinary action against the petitioner before 2015 or thereafter, the answering respondent No.3 has no role in it, all the action were taken by the chairperson clinical, medical and surgery department Dr. Aneela Zameer Durani who remained the chairperson from 2013 to 2015.\r6. That para NO.6 is incorrect hence vehemently denied, the respondent No.3 being a busy person in the affair of the department has got no such time to discuss the individual matters with members and student of the faculty. It is also worth mentioning that on 12-01-2016 the respondent No.3 being the chairman on the basis of tenure track evaluation report of the petitioner as �satisfactory� and on that basis petitioner got monthly increment Rs.8937/- this shows the bonafide and fair behavior of respondent No.3.\r7. That para No.7 is incorrect hence vehemently denied. There was no conspiracy of the respondent No.3 and 4 neither respondent No.4, spied nor discussed gynecological affairs during the period of 2002 to 2014 and  never treated the petitioner as a suspect / taboo nor any compain was started against the petitioner�s new place of posting. It is surprising that the petitioner kept quit for that considerable longtime and no complaint was made to any body in the university which belies contention of the petitioner.\r8. That para No.8 is incorrect, hence dened vehemently, that the petitioner with malafide intention on the alleged allegation filed complaint on the flimsy and baseless grounds, before ombudsperson Punjab and the reply of which was duly filed by the respondent No.3 and 4. Copy of which is enclosed as ANNEXURE R/3. The parties were afforded full opportunities of hearing viz they produced their evidence and cross examination on the witnesses copies of evidence produce by the petitioner are enclosed as Annexure-R/4, whereas the evidence adduced by the respondent No.3 and 4 are enclosed as Annexure-R/5, the written argument were also submitted by the respondent No.3 and 4 the Copy of written argument is attached as Annexure-R/6, the Ombudsperson, after considering the evidence and the written arguments submitted by the parties dismissed the complaint filed by the petitioner on 22-03-2017.\r9. That the petitioner not satisfied with the order ombudsperson dated 22-03-2017 preferred an appeal to the worthy Governor Punjab respondent No.1, who afforded an opportunity to parties to submit their arguments on the appeal filed by the petitioner. That the respondent No.3 and 4 separately filed written arguments before the Worthy Governor of Punjab, who vide order dated 11-01-2018 dismissed the appeal of the petitioner, by a detailed order.\r10. The proceedings taken by the respondent No.1 and 2 are legal under in accordance with law viz proper opportunity of hearing, production of evidence, cross examination on witnesses were afforded to the parties by respondent No.2 and right of hearing was also afforded by the respondent No.1 and no illegality or irregularity was committed by both the forums and the complaint was dismissed by the respondent No.2 and after proper hearing by speaking order by the respondent No.1 also dismissed the appeal. thus concurrent finding have been by both the forum that is the ombudsperson and the worthy of Governor of Punjab being the appellate authority, it is worth mentioning here that the writ petition was filed with malafide intention as a counter blast to the suit for damages filed by the respondent No.3 and 4 against the petitioner which are pending for adjudication before the court of competent jurisdiction, after laps of 9 months and that too any without plausible explanation of delay. Therefore, the writ petition is liable to be dismissed inter-alia on the following amongst:-\rGROUNDS\ra. That there is no cavil to the proposition that every citizen should be treated in accordance with law and fair trail be afforded under the fundamental rights enshrined under the constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 and the petitioner has been given the full chance in the trial to prove her allegations, but she is measurably filed to prove baseless, false and frivolous allegations against the respondent No.3 and 4, the norms of natural justice has been fully applied and the petitioner was given the maximum opportunities to prove since serious blame and alleged allegations were leveled against senior professor of the university which was on deliberate attempt to the demoralized them and their professional carrier was put and stake the respondent No.1 and 2 after through scrutiny of evidence given their respective decisions in accordance with law which are concurrent and it is worth mentioning here that the respondents No.3 and 4 were deferred due to the serious allegations against them by the petitioner.\rb. That the para No. B is incorrect. It is not understood as to way she kept quit from 2004 till February 2016 that is for the long 12 years which shows her malafide and psycho conditions there were no reason which kept her silent for 12 year and has not prompt her put the frivolous allegations against the respondent No.3 and 4 when they have reached on the post of senior assignments which is malafide on her part she has not come with clean hands before this honourable court, hence the petition is liable to be dismissed with heavy costs on this score alone.\rc. That para NO.C is incorrect hence denied vehemently. The answering respondent No.3 was not chairman at the relevant time Dr. Aneela Zameer Durani was the chairperson of the department from 2013 to 2015 which falsifies the contention of the petitioner which shows her malice against the answering respondent No.3 and 4.\rd.

FOR RECOVERY OF SAEED AKBAR SON OF HAKIM ALI AGED ABOUT 54-YEARS FROM THE ILLEGAL AND IMPROPER CUSTODY OF RESPONDENT. \r\rRespectfully Sheweth:\r10. That the concise facts giving rise to file the instant petition are that the petitioner is the real father of the detenue captioned above, who has been in the captivity of Jail authorities for quit some time and presently kept within the premises of camp Jail Lahore.\r11. That it is note worthy to mention here that the Petitioner above mentioned son was in judicial custody on account of being nominated in false and fabricated FIRs and for the same he was allowed bail and no more required in custody, hence in an FIR No.165/16 registered under section 302, 148, 149, 109 PPC, the Petitioner�s son was allowed bail on dated 27-08-2018 from the Court of Mr. Muhammad Iqbal Chadhar, Learned ASJ Lahore.\r12. That moreover, it worth mentioning here that the Petitioner�s son is suffering from acute renal disease and presently under going dialyses and hence his life is under severe threat and danger and keeping him a moment in custody will serve catastrophe, hence in an other matter in FIR No.406/16 registered PS Shahdra Town, Lahore honuorable apex court also admitted the Petitioner�s son namely Saeed Akbar to the concession of Bail after arrest. Copy of the order of learned Apex Court is attached herewith.\r13. That the Petitioner�s son Saeed Akbar is no more required in any other case accept the cases in which he has already been granted relives in the shape of post arrest bails and continuity of his custody of mint more shall only serves as illegal, improper and unlawful detention.\r14. That despite of the fact that the Petitioner�s son has been allowed bail in all the cases, but on his day of release, the respondent refused to seat the son of the Petitioner on an illegal surmise and taking excuse of order dated 27-06-2009 passed by Mr. Ahmed Waqas, Learned Allaqa Judicial Magistrate Lahore in aforementioned case FIR No.165/16,  which amounts to illegality and malafide on the part of the respondent and which seems like a part of a bigger conspiracy against the Petitioner and his son and puts the life of the son of the Petitioner under severe threat and danger and urgently calls for the sympathetic intervention of this learned court before it is too late.\r15. That the Petitioner is an old age person aged about 90 years and cannot in this age bear the loss of grown up son, the Petitioner tried his best for seeking the mercy of the respondent, but all in vain.

BILQUIS BARKAT ETC. SITUATED AT MOUZA SHIVEPUR KALAN, TEHSIL CANTT. DISTRICT, LAHORE.\r\rRespectfully Sheweth,\r1. That the facts giving rise of filing this application are that the applicant Mst. Bilquis Barkat purchased land measuring 769 Kanals,  in her own name, in the name of her two minor daughters fouzia and shazia, and in the name of her mother, vide registered sale deed No. 5759, Bhai No. 1, Jild No. 203 dated 27-04-1977 situated in Mauza Shivpur kalan, Tehsil Cantt, Distirct Lahore.. Accordingly mutation No. 107 was sanctioned and incorporated in the revenue record in their names on 01-06-1978 AnexA.\r2. That as the land was located close to the proposed site of the Lahore Airport and its price was most likely to rise in the near future, therefore some members of the Qabza Group, in connivance of some officials of Park View Housing Society conspired to grab the aforesaid land of the applicants/ladies. \r3. That to deprive the owners of their valuable property, a forged sale deed No. 6203, dated 18-04-1988 was prepared and got registered in the office of Sub Registrar through fraud and misrepresentation. Through it, the entire land was purportedly transferred; firstly in the name of National Industrial Co-operative Finance Co-operation Ltd. \rii. On 20.04.1988, just after a gap of one day, the entire land of the applicant was shown to have been sold by National Industrial Co-operative Finance Corporation Ltd., to second party i.e. Dil Aram Khan and Ashiq Ali etc and Ashiqe Ali etc. \riii. Subsequently from the aforesaid members of Qabza Group, the then management of Lahore Cantt Park View Housing Society, despite knowledge of defect in the title of their vendors, intentionally purchased land measuring 585 Kanals through a fraudulent registered sale deed on 04.01.1990 vide mutation No. 257 dated 19-12-1990.\rThereafter they grabbed another piece of applicant�s land measuring 66 kanals.\r4. The applicants have neither sold their aforesaid land to National Industrial Co-operative Finance Corporation Ltd., nor received any amount as consideration. Mst. Shazia Malik and Fozia Barkat applicant were admittedly minors at that time; whereas Mst. Bilquis Barkat and Mst. Inayat Bibi were household ladies. The aforesaid sale deed was prepared, executed and got registered at the back of the applicant, the real owners.\r5. On coming to know about aforesaid fraudulent sale of the land to National Industrial Co-operative Finance Corporation Ltd., the applicants filed a suit for Declaration and Permanent Injunction titled �Mst. Bilquis Barkat etc. Versus NICFC etc,�on 16-05-1990 in the Court of Senior Civil Judge Lahore against the NICFC Ltd. Anex-B.\r6. The NICFC filed written statement in the suit through its executive Director, who appeared before court and categorically denied the purchase and payment of any price to the owners/applicants. The NICFC denied having had any claim, interest or title in the subject land and stated in their written statement that:-\r�They had no knowledge or notice of the alleged sale deed. They have not purchased the land. The aforesaid sale deed has not been forged by them or by their connivance and they have not paid any consideration to Mst. Bilquis Barkat etc., and that they have no objection if the alleged sale deed be cancelled. Anex-C. \rAccordingly the sale deed was cancelled and the suit was decreed in favour of Mst. Bilquis Barkat etc on 29-07-1990.Anex-D.\r7. On the basis of the aforesaid decree, the applicants moved an application to District Collector Lahore for Cancellation of all aforementioned mutations. This application was accepted and accordingly, mutations were cancelled by the District collector, Lahore through order dated 07-10-1992. It was also ordered by the District Collector that criminal proceedings be initiated against them. Thereafter the entire land was reverted back in the names of the applicant in the revenue record. Anex-E.\r8. That on 03-01-1991 Lahore Cantt Park View Co-operative Housing Society filed an application u/s 12(2) CPC. On that application the decree was set aside ex-party and the proceedings were started afresh. Anex-F.\rOn 20.10.2000, the suit was dismissed in default, however on the application of Mst. Bilquis Barkat etc the suit was subsequently restored on 31.05.2003. After the restoration of suit the Park View Housing Society had been appearing in the suit almost for 3 years and joined the proceedings without any objection on the restoration order. It is pertinent to mentioned here that the Lahore Cantt Park View Housing Society filed their written reply in the aforesaid suit after more then 11 years. \r9. That, after about 3 years of the restoration of the suit, when the Park View Housing Society was going to be merged into DHA, Lahore; to bargain the favorite terms and conditions of merger, the Park View Housing Society, by using their influence money and other illegal means, managed the dismissal of the aforesaid suit through filing of frivolous application u/s 151 CPC on the ground that the aforesaid suit was not properly restored. Although the similar application were previously dismissed twice; by the same court and by the court of learned District Judge, Lahore. As a result whereof, the suit of the applicants was declared as �treated to be dismissed� for non- prosecution through order dated 17.06.2006.\r10. The applicants challenged the aforesaid order by way of R.F.A. No.413/2006 before the Division Bench of Honorable Lahore High Court, Lahore, which is pending. \rAnd on 15.08.2006, the learned counsel of Lahore Park View Housing Society appeared before the Hon�ble high court, Lahore, and stated �That they will not transfer the land to third party�. and the Division Bench was pleased to pass the following Restraint Order:-\r �learned counsel for respondent (Park View Housing Society) undertakes not to transfer the land reverting under the impugned judgment. On that basis it is ordered that no third party right shall be created in the property under dispute.� \rCopy of order is attached as Anex-G.\rThat the applicant Mst. Bilques Barkat, etc, also got published an advertisement in this regard in news paper �Daily Jang� on 20-11-2006, through which the restraint order was brought into the notice of the general public as well. Anex-H.\r11. That an ICA titled 551 / 02 is also pending before division bench of Honourable High court Lahore Anex-I\rWhereas the application regarding 66 Kanals of land is also pending   before the  honourable High Court, Lahore. Anex-J.\r12. That the merger of the applicant land in DHA is not only illegal and unwarranted but also amounts to the contempt of the order of Hon�ble Lahore High Court, Lahore. And the DHA Lahore has no right, title or interest regarding the applicants land. \rIt is also pertinent to mention here that the Notification/Order of merger of Lahore Cantt Park View Housing Society into DHA Lahore passed by the Registrar Co- operative Society Park View Society Punjab, Lahore was based upon an order dated 17.08.2006 passed by Mr. Sohail Shahzad, District Officer (Revenue) / Collector Lahore, whereby the petition filed by Lahore Cantt Park View Housing Society was accepted and mutation No. 225,226 and 257 were restored. However, subsequently Mr. Sohail Shahzad, DO (R)/ Collector vide order dated 18.07.2007 has withdrawn  the said order dated 17.08.2007 on the ground that the said order was passed during the existence of the stay order, which was not brought to his notice. So, in this view of the matter, the order dated 28.06.2007 passed by the Registrar Cooperative Societies Punjab, Lahore ceased to have any legal effect. Copy of the order of DOR/Collector is attached as           Anex-K. \r13. That as submitted above, the land is owned by the applicant, the park view society claims to have purchased the land from Dil Aram Khan and Ashiq Ali etc; who in turn claim to have purchased the same from NICFC. As admitted by NICFC, in the written statement as well as in the statement of their learned counsel, that NICFC has not purchased the suit land from the Mst. Bilques Barkat etc, nor had they sold the same to, nor received consideration from Dil Aram Khan etc. \rThat the fraud and illegality in this regard is also evident from the facts that the vendor namely Ashiq Ali etc from whom the respondent Society claims to had purchased; himself had filed the suit on 19-08-2006 in the Civil Court, Lahore, for Specific Performance of alleged agreement dated 18-03-87, allegedly executed by the applicant in his favour. The said case is still pending in the Court of A.DJ. Lahore. Anex-L. This fact proves that the alleged vendor of respondent Society, as per his own version has not acquired the title of the subject land.\rSince the so called vendors namely Dil Aram Khan and Ashiq Ali etc had no legal right, title or interest in the suit land; they could not transfer  the same nor could the park view society acquired any title, right or interest in the suit land. It is well settled law that a vendor cannot transfer a better title then he himself possessed, as the maxim goes that �he giveth not, who haveth not�. Since the first and second transfer was void abinitio, the third transfer in favour of the park view housing society is also void abinitio and does not create any right, title or interest in its favour.\r14. That as far as case pending before member Board of Revenue titled as �Iqbal, Riaz v/s Bilquis Bakat etc� is concerned, it is stated that  That Mst. Bilquis Barkat etc purchased the land in question from one Ch. Riaz Ahmad, who purchased the land from one Sharaf Din (claimant / alottee).\rThat as far as  claim and allotment is concerned, it is respectfully stated that the claim and allotment has already been confirmed in favour of Shraf din in case titled �The State Vs Qutbudin and others� upto the level of August  Supreme Court of Pakistan. its details are as under:-\ri.\tThat on 23-12-78, CSC / MBR Ch. Muhammad Siddique has declared the claim as well as allotment of Sharaf din as valid and good. Copy attached as Annex.M. \rAn appeal was filed against that order, which was dismissed by the division \tbanch of Honourable High court Lahore on 27-04-80. Copy attached as Annex. N.\rA private party filed an appeal against that order which was also dismissed by the August Supreme Court of Pakistan on 20-08-91. Copy attached as Annex-O.\rii.\tThat it is important to mention here that the State, the Revenue Department as well as other State functionaries were party to that proceeding, but neither the State nor the revenue department has challenged the aforesaid three orders therefore, it has attained finality to their extent.\riii.\tThat on 24-07-2017, due to some pressure and connivance, the CSC / MBR, ignored the aforesaid three orders of Higher Courts and cancelled the claim and allotment in favour of sharaf din after a lapse of 40 years. Mst Bilquis Barkat etc filed writ petition against the order which was also dismissed on 28-09-17 due to connivance and pressure. \rThereafter, the filed an ICA before division Bench of Honourable High court which is pending. Copy attached as Annex.P. \riv.\tThat  neither CSC /MBR nor the learned single Judge has the jurisdiction to cancel or ignore the order passed by the division bench of Honourable High court, Lahore, therefore, the matter is likely to be decided in favour of the applicants.\r15. That it is proved that the Park View Housing Society in league with other members of Qabza/Land Mafia, from the very beginning have been in the habit of grabbing the land of the innocent persons including Mst. Bilquis Barkat etc. as it is quire clear from the above mentioned circumstances that because society and its other accomplices are well aware that from the very beginning they are playing fraud with the applicants on the basis of forged, fabricated and fraudulent documents prepared in their names through misrepresentation in respect of the land/property of the applicants. Therefore, to hide their fraudulent activities they have designed and managed to get the civil proceedings complicated, by using their political influence and other illegal means, more particularly when the first purported vendee namely NICFC had categorically denied of having purchased the aforesaid land from the applicants. They, being clever knew that because their original base has been proved wrong, illegal and fraudulent, therefore they, cannot succeed against the applicants and ultimately they will fail in civil litigations between the parties. That�s why, because of the aforesaid design of the Park View Housing Society, despite the facts, that the applicants have good case/ cases on merit in their favour they are facing difficulties in getting justice in their favour regarding their aforesaid land/property.\r\t\tFor the submissions mentioned above, it is, respectfully stated that the said matter may be resolved/ settled in the interest of justice.\rTHE PROPOSAL ON BEHALF OF THE APPLICANTS.\r1.\tThat as the Park View Housing Society is merged in DHA Lahore, therefore the matter can be settle down across the table with reciprocal cooperation. \r2.\tThat out of aforesaid land 769 Kanals; some piece of land is partially sold to different persons; whereas some land is the subject matter of illegal and fraudulent sale deeds, which litigation is pending in civil court.\r(The detail of land and its status regarding litigation is given in a schedule annex with this application as annex-1\r3. As far as the remaining land is concerned; it is free from litigation with other parties and its litigation is pending only with Park View Housing Society, Whereas after murger of Lahore Cantt. Park View Housing Society into DHA, Lahore, now the matter is pending between the DHA, Lahore and the applicants. \r4. The litigation between the parties is hanging around since long to disadvantage of both the parties. Therefore to cut short the litigation it is in the interest of both the parties to settle/resolve the issue, regarding the aforesaid land across the table and outside the court.\r5. That in case any application has been previously moved by any body, pretending to be the representative of the applicants; that may be considered and construed as non-existent. \r6. It will be expedient and in the interest of things that the matter be settled and resolved between the applicants and DHA, authorities concerned.  The applicants express their profound interest to settle the matter with the hope to have same gesture from your side.\r       \r       In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the matter, it is hoped that keeping in view, the exigency of the litigation, some emicable settlement will be reached between the applicants and DHA, Lahore accordingly.    \r       Assuring you best of cooperation at all times. \t\r       \r       \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApplicants\r       \r1.

Ex-Constable Fayyaz Ahmad No.10559 during Naka Bandi took Rs.100,000/- from the pocket of one Shah Muhammad, but You failed to inform timely your senior about his misconduct on the part of Ex. Constable�.\r4. Before passing the impugned punishment order, no charge sheet / show cause notice was issued to the appellant, rather the appellant was conemned without affording an opportunity of defence.\r5. That I was called in orderly room by respondent and awarded to punishment of stoppage of increment for one year under the Punjab police rules (E & D) 1975. \r6. That as under section 14 of the Punjab police E & D Rules 1975 no appeal lies against such like punishment with in the department therefore, the appeal seeks kind indulgence of this honourable tribunal for setting-aside impugned order, which is against the facts and circumstances inter-alia on the followings:-\rGROUNDS\ri. That the impugned order 1574/78 PA-PHP dated 27-03-2019 is against the fact circumstances, void abinitio, perverse, arbitrary based on surmises and conjunctures and devoid of force of law, hence the same is liable to be set aside.\rii. That the appellant is absolutely innocent into the matter.\riii. That while passing the impugned order, the punishing authority failed to appreciate the real situation of the case. Detailed submission of the appellant in this regard are as under:-\ra.\tOn 14-03-2018. while he appellant was posted to PHP Post Rukan Pura District Lodheran, he alongwith Ex-Constable Fayyaz Ahmad No.10559 and other PHP officials was performing patrol duty as shift incharge and had affected Naka Bandi in the beat area near Naseem Shah Farm. In the meanwhile 2 persons came there from Dunia Pur Side on a Motor Cycle. They were stopped and on this checking Alkhohlac, smell was coming from their mouths. They disclosed their names as Shah Muhammad Son of Gul Muhammad and Muhammad Bilal S/o Muhammad Shafie R/o Lodheran. They were apprehended and were handed over to HC Muhammad Naseem Muharrar PS Sadar lodhran for further proceedings. Thereafter, the appellant alongwith other PHP officials proceeded on usual patrolling. The said accused did not level any allegation against any of HP Officials regarding he alleged taking away any amount.\rb.\tAfter 40/50 minuts Muharar PS Sadar Lodhran telephonically contacted the appellant and told that said accused person are leveling allegation of taking amount from them. On this, the appellant alongwith PHP Officials reached at PS Sadar Lodhran and quired from said Shah Muhammad. Firstly said Shahid Muhammad alleged that his Rs.2-Lacs have been taken and then told that his Rs.1-1/2 lacs have been taken out and then said that the amount taken from him Rs. One lac. On further query initially said Shah Muhammad nominated Driver Constable Waseem Ahmad and thereafter nominated Ex-Consable Fayyaz Ahmad No.10559 in this regard.\rc.\tOn return to PHP Post, the appellant immediately recorded a DDR No.9 in this regard. (Copy attached for kind perusal).\rd.\tApart from above DDR, the appellant also brought the whole mater into the notice of incharge PHP, who sent a special report in this regard to senior officers. (Copy attached for kind perusal).\re.\tAs submitted above, the appellant immediately recorded a DDR regarding the above incident and also brought the matter into the notice of incharge PHP post. On the bases of information provided by the appellant, the incharge PHP submitted a special report to senior officers. Keeping in view the above facts, the charge against the appellant that he did not bring the matter into the notice of senior officers has died its own death. The appellant had no malafide in this regard.\rf.\tAfter alleged incident DSP/PHP Multan was deputed to conduct an enquiry in this regard. After a detailed enquiry, the DSP/PHP Multan concluded vide his report No.765/DSP/PHP-MN dated 10-02-2019 that no such incident has taken place, as no such heavy amount was present with the said Shah Muhammad at Relevant time.\rg.\tApart from above enquiry 3 other departmental enquiries in this regard were also  conducted in which, the appellant was not found at fault.\riv.\tThat while passing impugned order, the punishing authority did not provide proper opportunity of defence to the appellant rather passed the impugned order in a slipshod manner. The authority even did not bother to issue a show case notice / charge sheet against the appellant or to conduct an inquiry in this regard and in this way ignored the basic principles of justice. If an inquiry in this regard had been got conducted, innocence of the appellant had certainly come on record. The above omission on the part of punishing authority has lost the entire legal value of the impugned punishment order and the same is liable to be set aside on this sole ground.\rv. That the impugned punishment order has adversely affected the service career of the appellant for no fault on his part and thus has caused a grave miscarriage of justice. \rvi. That while passing impugned order the competent authority did not keep in mind the solid facts of the case rather based on surmises and conjectures which is not warranted law / justice. \rvii. That for the forgoing reasons, the impugned order is not maintainable in the eyes of law rather is liable to be set aside. \rviii. That the impugned penalty is based on surmises and conjunctures, having no support of independent direct and reliable evidence, hence appellant can not be punished on the basis of presumptions, reliance is placed on PLD 1989 SC 335.\rix. That the appellant is performing his duties in order to achieve much possible promotion in the department, so that he is performing his obligations very carefully and if the instant impugned order is not set-aside, it will lead the appellant to his dark service career.\rPRAYER\r      Under the above said circumstances, it is therefore, most respectfully prayed that the instant appeal may kindly be accepted and the impugned order No.1574/78 PA-PHP dated 27-03-2019 passed by the respondent may kindly be set-aside, to meet the ends of justice.\r\tThat any other relief which this honourable court deems fit and proper may also be awarded to the appellant.\r\rAppellant\rThrough\rSARDAR M.FAISAL WASEEM\rAdvocate High Court\rCell NO.0300-7695011\r1-farid Kot Road, Lahore\rCERTIFICATE\rAs per instruction, this is 1st appeal on the subject before this honourable court.\r\r\rAdvocate",

That the names and addresses of the parties are correct for the issuance of summons and notices by this honourable court.\r2. That briefly stating the facts of the case are that registered Trust Deed under the name and Style of �Leads Educator Welfare Trust� was created on 14-05-2008 vide document No.5694 Bahi NO.1 Volume N.1769 registered with the Sub registrar Allama Iqbal Town, Lahore on 21-05-2008. Copy is enclosed as ANNEXURE-A for kind perusal of this Honourable court.\r3. That through this deed Plaintiff No.1 has been named as Chief Executive while defendant No.1 as Director / Secretary. Similarly Plaintiffs No.2 to 4 and defendants No.2 and 5 have been named as executive members. Detail of founder is given below:-\r(i)Abdul Ghafoor Watton Chief Executive (ii) Abu Bakar, (iii) Usman, (iv) Rasheeda (V) Fatima Zahoor (vi)Kauser Perveen as Executive Members (vii) Zahoor Ahmad as Director / Secretary.\r4. That as per Trust Deed, the term of office of Trustees is for life or till resignation.\r5. That the defendant NO.1 prepared forged and fictitious / Bogus resolution dated 18-01-2014 with forge, bogus and fraudulent resignation of Rasheeda Wattoo was allegedly passed whereas the fact is that Plaintiff NO.1 was not present in the resolution dated 18-01-2014 and his signature is bogus. Similarly Rasheeda Wattoo never resigned, The affidavits of Plaintiff No.1 and Plaintiff No.4 are placed on file for kind perusal of this honourable court. \r6. That the said resolution dated 18-01-2014 is illegal, fraudulent, void abi-initio, hence liable to be set aside on the basis of Fraud.\r7. That again fraud was played by the defendant No.1 and he held so called board of Trustees meeting on 22-02-2018 in which second amendment was passed, defendant No.1 became is chairman, which is illegal because Plaintiff No.1 is chairman / chief executive. He never authorized defendant No.1 to chair the meeting neither the Plaintiff NO.1 had ever resigned. His chairmanship is long life time. In the illegal meeting, dated 22-02-2018, under so called chairmanship of defendant NO.1, approved the following names as executive members.\ri. Talha Zahoor\rii. Hamza Zahoor \r      Sons of Zahoor Ahmad Watoo.\riii. Asad Manzoor son of Manzoor Ahmad Watoo    \r8. That in meeting dated 22-02-2018 following life members were not present. Abdul Ghafoor, Abu Bakar, Usman, and Rasheeda Wattoo.\r9. That Quorum was required to be 75%, but with 43% presence the meeting was held and new members were appointed. All this exercise was futile, bogus, fraudulent, violative of fundamental Trust Deed dated 21-05-2008, hence liable to be set-aside.\r10. That again third time illegality was committed by defendant No.1 who chaired meeting when he was not authorized to chair meeting because Plaintiff NO.1 is life long chairman and be never resigned nor he authorized defendant No.1 to chair such meeting. In the meeting dated 08-05-2018 third amendment was passed to the effect that Quorum was reduced  from 75% to 60% in this meeting Plaintiff No.2 to 4 were also not present and no cogent reason has been assigned to it. Thus it is also liable to be set-aside as being violation of Basic fundamental Trust deed, \r11. That the appointment of defendant No.6 (who is registrar of leads university) as secretary of the Trust is also illegal, because he is an employee of leads University as Registrar. This is senior administrative head post whereas the office of secretary Trust is also an independent office the secretary Trust is Boss while Registrar is an employee. How an employee and boss can be equal at one and same time. This is quite ridiculous and conflict of interests. In this way the third amendment registered on 22-05-2018 is also alleged, void abi-initio and liable to be set-aside. \r12. That the defendant No.6 wrote a letter no.REG/BOG/LEWT/2018.06.09.02 dated 09-06-2018 to the defendant NO.1 addressing him a Director of Trust, enquiring clarification regarding Members and chairman of the Trust. This letter was replied by the defendant NO.1 vide letter No. Leads EWT/158 dated 10-06-2018 conveyed all the required information which is patently incorrect none of the person shown as member of the Trust who were are actually members of the Trust, similarly Showing himself (defendant No.1) as Chairman of the Trust and Board of Governors of the University is a lie, because the Plaintiff No.1 himself is chairman of the Trust for life, according to the fundamental Trust Deed dated 21-05-2008.\r13. That the defendant No.6 also wrote a letter No.REG/BOG/LEWT/2018.06.10.01 dated 10-06-2018 to the defendant NO.1 addressing him as Chairman of Board of Trust, sorting permission for holding a meeting and also asked to provide the names of the members of the Trust. The defendant No.1 replied the above letter, confirming the date for holding the meeting and provided an incorrect list of the members of the Trust. Neither the defendant NO.1 was competent to confirm any date for holding the meeting of Board of Governors nor was competent to provide any name, other than the actual names of the members of the Trust. Defendant No.1 has deliberately committed the wrong. The defendant No.1 has all along been acting without lawful authority and has assumed the title of chairman of the Trust for which he is / was not competent in the presence of the Plaintiff No.1, specially named chairman of the Trust (Plaintiff No.1).\r14. That the Plaintiffs have approached the defendants No.3, 5 & 6 to desist from calling themselves as executive members of the Trust, but they have denied. The Plaintiffs have also requested the defendant No.1 to 6 to admit Plaintiff No.4 as regular and existing executing member of the Trust, but they have also totally refused to accept the genuine and lawful request of the Plaintiffs.\r15. That the Plaintiffs also requested the defendant No.1 to restrain from posing, claiming or acting as chairman of the Trust, but out of lust of power, he refused to do so.\r16. That the Plaintiffs have also requested the defendant No.1 to withdraw the document NO.639/4/506 and document No.806/4/609 and document No.505/4/606 registered with the office of the sub registrar, Allama Iqbal Town, Lahore on 01-03-2014, 25-05-2018 and 19-04-2018 respectively, but he denied to do so, hence this suit.\r17. That the cause of action accrued in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the defendants Firstly from registration of forged and fraudulent amendments and lastly about a week ago, which is still continuing. \r18. That the parties to the suit reside at Lahore, the cause of action also accrued here, so the civil court at Lahore has the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the matter. \r19. That the value of the suit for the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction is fixed at Rs.20,000/- which is exempted from payment of court fee.\r\rPRAYER\r     Under the foregoing submissions, it is respectfully prayed that a decree for declaration may kindly be passed in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the defendants declaring that:-\ra. Defendants No.3, 4 & 6 not to be members of the Trust.\rb. Plaintiff No.4 to be an executive member of the Trust.\rc.

That the names and addresses of the parties are correct for the issuance of summons and notices by this honourable court.\r21. That briefly stating the facts of the case are that �Leads Educator Welfare Trust� was created on 14-05-2008 to promote the noble cause of education, welfare of orphans, curricular and extra curricular activities, in schools and colleges, holding sports festivals amongst student etc, etc the said Trust deed was executed and registered with the sub registrar, Allama Iqbal Town, Lahore under document No. 5694 Bahi NO.1 Volume N.1769 dated 21-05-2008. Copy of the same is attached as ANNEXURE-A for kind perusal of this Honourable court.\r22. That in the said Trust Deed the following persons were nominated as under:-\ri. Abdul Ghafoor Watoo (Plaintiff NO.1 / Chief executive)\rii. Zahoor Ahmad Wattoo (defendant No.1 Director / Secretary)\riii. Abu Bakar, Usman and Rasheeda Wattoo (Plaintiffs No.2, 3, & 4 Executive Member).\riv. Mst. Fatima Zahoor & Mst. Kausar Perveen (defendants No.2 and 5) Executive Members).\r\r23. That the Terms of the office was life time or till resignation.\r24. That the defendant No.1 fabricated first amendment fraudulently and by concealment of facts got the signature of the Plaintiff No.1 on resolution dated 18-01-2014 in which the resignation of Mst. Rasheeda Wattoo (Plaintiff No.4) was allegedly shown and the same amendment was got registered fraudulently vide No.639 bahi No.4 volume No.506 dated 01-03-2014 sub registrar Allama Iqbal Town, Lahore. Copy whereof is enclosed as           ANNEXURE-B.\r25. That Mst. Rasheeda Wattoo Never resigned from the office of executive Member of the Trust and resolution dated 18-01-2014 was prepared fraudulently and defendant No.1 got the signature of Plaintiff NO.1 by Hoodwink of facts. Mst. Rasheeda Wattoo has tendered her affidavit to this effect, that she never resigned from the office of the executive member of the Trust. (Copy enclosed as ANNEXURE-B/1). Hence the first amendment (Annexure-B) is liable to be set-aside as being bogus and fraudulent.\r26. That later on the defendant NO.1 prepared another fictitious resolution regarding the appointment of defendant No.3, 4, & 6 as executive members of the Trust. The resolution was named as second amendment and got registered vide document No.505 Bahi NO.4 volume No.606dated 18-04-2018 (Copy enclosed as ANNEXURE-C). This fictitious and bogus resolution was not approved nor presided over by the Plaintiff No.1, nor he issued any authority in favour of Zahoor Ahmad Wattoo (defendant No.1). When the Plaintiff No.1 is alive and never resigned from his office, as such all the proceedings were bogus, hence the same is also liable to be set-aside.\r27. That again the defendant No.1 prepared bogus resolution which was named as third amendment and was registered vide document No.806, Bahi No.4, volume no.609 dated 25-05-2018. (Copy of same is annexed as ANNEXURE-D). In which the Plaintiff NO.1 (who is life time chief executive) was not present nor he issued any authority in favour of any body else including defendant No.1, to preside over the meeting of Trust. In this amendment the quorum was reduced from 75% to 60 %. This amendment carries no weight in the eyes of law, because the chief executive is not present in that meeting, hence the same is liable to be set-aside.\r28. That all the amendments No.1, 2 & 3 are void ab-initio and all are liable to be set aside as being bogus, fraudulent, fictitious, illegal, and unlawful and without lawful authority.\r29. That the defendant no.7 is merely an employee of the Trust and he is persona non grata to interfere into the affairs of Leads Educator Welfare Trust. \r30. That the Plaintiffs approached the defendant No.3, 5 & 6 to refrain from calling themselves as executive members of the Trust and defendant No.1 was asked to get these illegal and unlawful amendments cancelled, but they have refused, hence the instant suit. \r31. That the Plaintiffs also demanded the defendant No.1 not to pose, act or claim himself as chairman of the Trust, but out of lust of power he has refused to do so. \r32. That the defendants were also requested to admit the Plaintiff No.4 as existing executive member of the Trust, but they paid no attention to accept it.\r33. That the cause of action first accrued in favour of the Plaintiffs with the resolution of the first amendment, secondly from the second amendment, thirdly from third amendment and lastly from few days ago when the defendants have totally refused, which is still continuing.\r34. That the parties to the suit reside at Lahore, the cause of action also accrued here, so the civil court at Lahore has the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the matter. \r35. That the value of the suit for the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction is fixed at Rs.20,000/- which is exempted from payment of court fee.\rPRAYER\r     On the foregoing submissions it is respectfully prayed that a decree for declaration may kindly be passed in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the defendants in the following terms:-\rf.

That the petitioner has not come with clean hands, before this honourable court, since martial facts have been deliberately concealed.\r9. That the present petitioner is hit by the principle of �Laches� so much so, the present petition has been filed the petition, after the lapse of 9 months and that too without any plausible explanation of delay.\r10. That the petition is malafide false and frivolous, since all remedies under the law has been availed at two forums i.e ombudsperson and the Worthy Governor of Punjab.\r11. That the writ petition is no maintainable since the concurrent finding are against the petitioner and not illegality and regularity has been pointed out in the petition.\r12. That the petitioner has been given full opportunity of hearing viz production of  evidence, cross examination on witnesses and the case was strongly contested on wrong and false allegations against the respondent No.3 and 4. \r13. That after contesting the protracted litigation on all the forums the respondent No.3 and 4 sustained substantial losses to their reputation, respect of integrity which necessitated to file suits for damages against the petitioner and as a counter blast the present petition has been filed with malafide intention.\r14. That earlier the petitioner filed writ petition No.22263/16 in this Honourable court which was dismissed in-limine vide order dated 27-06-2016, whoever, an Intra Court Appeal No.1211/16 was also filed, which too dismissed vide order dated          22-12-2016, Copies enclosed ANNEXURE-R/1 the petitioner has been given full and fair opportunity to plead her cause, which is evident from the record and evidence produce by the parties. Copies enclosed ANNEXURE R-2.  \rON MERITS\r11. That para No.1 is factual.\r12. That para No.2, is correct.\r13. That para No.3 is incorrect and vehemently denied to the extent that the answering respondent No.3, professor Dr. Arif Khan had a bad eye on a petitioner since the time when she was a student and this fact was not brought to the notice of anybody neither from 2004 to 2006 and from 2011 to 2016, the allegations are baseless unfounded, after thought hence vehemently denied, just to malign the answering respondent No.3. It is worth mentioning, that the petitioner has miserably failed to prove any one of the allegation before the Ombudsperson Punjab which is crystal clear fro the decision in detail dated 22-03-2017.\r14. That the para No.4 is vehemently denied as incorrect rather it was the respondent No.3, being a supervisor of the petitioner extending full support for the completion of her M.Phil and petitioner got the excellent score. The respondent No.3 has never ever any grudge malice or ill-will against the petitioner. The respondent No.3 remained affectionate and provided her all the acumen and knowledge of the educational career which all the time appreciated and acknowledge by the petitioner and she was able to obtained the Ph.d from China.\r15. That para NO.5 is incorrect hence vehemently denied, the respondent No.3 throughout his carrier treated the student male or female like his own children and never discriminated or harm any students it was not the duty of the respondent No.3 to issue university book / computer to the student, the show cause notice if any issued to the petitioner for her absence or negligent behavior was issued under rules and regulation by the chairman at the relevant point of time. It is worth mentioning here that the petitioner after completing her Ph.D in China and due to her over stay in china without any intimation and failed to joined the department in time. The show cause notice was issued under the provisions of Peeda act and minor punishment of �Sensure� was awarded her by the then voice chancellor / chairman syndicate Dr. Muhammad Nawaz. It is wroth mentioning that any disciplinary action against the petitioner before 2015 or thereafter, the answering respondent No.3 has no role in it, all the action were taken by the chairperson clinical, medical and surgery department Dr. Aneela Zameer Durani who remained the chairperson from 2013 to 2015.\r16. That para NO.6 is incorrect hence vehemently denied, the respondent No.3 being a busy person in the affair of the department has got no such time to discuss the individual matters with members and student of the faculty. It is also worth mentioning that on 12-01-2016 the respondent No.3 being the chairman on the basis of tenure track evaluation report of the petitioner as �satisfactory� and on that basis petitioner got monthly increment Rs.8937/- this shows the bonafide and fair behavior of respondent No.3.\r17. That para No.7 is incorrect hence vehemently denied. There was no conspiracy of the respondent No.3 and 4 neither respondent No.4, spied nor discussed gynecological affairs during the period of 2002 to 2014 and  never treated the petitioner as a suspect / taboo nor any compain was started against the petitioner�s new place of posting. It is surprising that the petitioner kept quit for that considerable longtime and no complaint was made to any body in the university which belies contention of the petitioner.\r18. That para No.8 is incorrect, hence dened vehemently, that the petitioner with malafide intention on the alleged allegation filed complaint on the flimsy and baseless grounds, before ombudsperson Punjab and the reply of which was duly filed by the respondent No.3 and 4. Copy of which is enclosed as ANNEXURE R/3. The parties were afforded full opportunities of hearing viz they produced their evidence and cross examination on the witnesses copies of evidence produce by the petitioner are enclosed as Annexure-R/4, whereas the evidence adduced by the respondent No.3 and 4 are enclosed as Annexure-R/5, the written argument were also submitted by the respondent No.3 and 4 the Copy of written argument is attached as Annexure-R/6, the Ombudsperson, after considering the evidence and the written arguments submitted by the parties dismissed the complaint filed by the petitioner on 22-03-2017.\r19. That the petitioner not satisfied with the order ombudsperson dated 22-03-2017 preferred an appeal to the worthy Governor Punjab respondent No.1, who afforded an opportunity to parties to submit their arguments on the appeal filed by the petitioner. That the respondent No.3 and 4 separately filed written arguments before the Worthy Governor of Punjab, who vide order dated 11-01-2018 dismissed the appeal of the petitioner, by a detailed order.\r20. The proceedings taken by the respondent No.1 and 2 are legal under in accordance with law viz proper opportunity of hearing, production of evidence, cross examination on witnesses were afforded to the parties by respondent No.2 and right of hearing was also afforded by the respondent No.1 and no illegality or irregularity was committed by both the forums and the complaint was dismissed by the respondent No.2 and after proper hearing by speaking order by the respondent No.1 also dismissed the appeal. thus concurrent finding have been by both the forum that is the ombudsperson and the worthy of Governor of Punjab being the appellate authority, it is worth mentioning here that the writ petition was filed with malafide intention as a counter blast to the suit for damages filed by the respondent No.3 and 4 against the petitioner which are pending for adjudication before the court of competent jurisdiction, after laps of 9 months and that too any without plausible explanation of delay. Therefore, the writ petition is liable to be dismissed inter-alia on the following amongst:-\rGROUNDS\ra. That there is no cavil to the proposition that every citizen should be treated in accordance with law and fair trail be afforded under the fundamental rights enshrined under the constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 and the petitioner has been given the full chance in the trial to prove her allegations, but she is measurably filed to prove baseless, false and frivolous allegations against the respondent No.3 and 4, the norms of natural justice has been fully applied and the petitioner was given the maximum opportunities to prove since serious blame and alleged allegations were leveled against senior professor of the university which was on deliberate attempt to the demoralized them and their professional carrier was put and stake the respondent No.1 and 2 after through scrutiny of evidence given their respective decisions in accordance with law which are concurrent and it is worth mentioning here that the respondents No.3 and 4 were deferred due to the serious allegations against them by the petitioner.\rb. That the para No. B is incorrect. It is not understood as to way she kept quit from 2004 till February 2016 that is for the long 12 years which shows her malafide and psycho conditions there were no reason which kept her silent for 12 year and has not prompt her put the frivolous allegations against the respondent No.3 and 4 when they have reached on the post of senior assignments which is malafide on her part she has not come with clean hands before this honourable court, hence the petition is liable to be dismissed with heavy costs on this score alone.\rc. That para NO.C is incorrect hence denied vehemently. The answering respondent No.3 was not chairman at the relevant time Dr. Aneela Zameer Durani was the chairperson of the department from 2013 to 2015 which falsifies the contention of the petitioner which shows her malice against the answering respondent No.3 and 4.\rd.

That the concise facts giving rise to file the instant petition are that the petitioner is the real father of the detenue captioned above, who has been in the captivity of Jail authorities for quit some time and presently kept within the premises of camp Jail Lahore.\r90. That it is note worthy to mention here that the Petitioner above mentioned son was in judicial custody on account of being nominated in false and fabricated FIRs and for the same he was allowed bail and no more required in custody, hence in an FIR No.165/16 registered under section 302, 148, 149, 109 PPC, the Petitioner�s son was allowed bail on dated 27-08-2018 from the Court of Mr. Muhammad Iqbal Chadhar, Learned ASJ Lahore.\r91. That moreover, it worth mentioning here that the Petitioner�s son is suffering from acute renal disease and presently under going dialyses and hence his life is under severe threat and danger and keeping him a moment in custody will serve catastrophe, hence in an other matter in FIR No.406/16 registered PS Shahdra Town, Lahore honuorable apex court also admitted the Petitioner�s son namely Saeed Akbar to the concession of Bail after arrest. Copy of the order of learned Apex Court is attached herewith.\r92. That the Petitioner�s son Saeed Akbar is no more required in any other case accept the cases in which he has already been granted relives in the shape of post arrest bails and continuity of his custody of mint more shall only serves as illegal, improper and unlawful detention.\r93. That despite of the fact that the Petitioner�s son has been allowed bail in all the cases, but on his day of release, the respondent refused to seat the son of the Petitioner on an illegal surmise and taking excuse of order dated 27-06-2009 passed by Mr. Ahmed Waqas, Learned Allaqa Judicial Magistrate Lahore in aforementioned case FIR No.165/16,  which amounts to illegality and malafide on the part of the respondent and which seems like a part of a bigger conspiracy against the Petitioner and his son and puts the life of the son of the Petitioner under severe threat and danger and urgently calls for the sympathetic intervention of this learned court before it is too late.\r94. That the Petitioner is an old age person aged about 90 years and cannot in this age bear the loss of grown up son, the Petitioner tried his best for seeking the mercy of the respondent, but all in vain.

That as the land was located close to the proposed site of the Lahore Airport and its price was most likely to rise in the near future, therefore some members of the Qabza Group, in connivance of some officials of Park View Housing Society conspired to grab the aforesaid land of the applicants/ladies. \r18. That to deprive the owners of their valuable property, a forged sale deed No. 6203, dated 18-04-1988 was prepared and got registered in the office of Sub Registrar through fraud and misrepresentation. Through it, the entire land was purportedly transferred; firstly in the name of National Industrial Co-operative Finance Co-operation Ltd. \riv. On 20.04.1988, just after a gap of one day, the entire land of the applicant was shown to have been sold by National Industrial Co-operative Finance Corporation Ltd., to second party i.e. Dil Aram Khan and Ashiq Ali etc and Ashiqe Ali etc. \rv.

The NICFC filed written statement in the suit through its executive Director, who appeared before court and categorically denied the purchase and payment of any price to the owners/applicants.

Anex-E.\r23. That on 03-01-1991 Lahore Cantt Park View Co-operative Housing Society filed an application u/s 12(2) CPC. On that application the decree was set aside ex-party and the proceedings were started afresh. Anex-F.\rOn 20.10.2000, the suit was dismissed in default, however on the application of Mst. Bilquis Barkat etc the suit was subsequently restored on 31.05.2003. After the restoration of suit the Park View Housing Society had been appearing in the suit almost for 3 years and joined the proceedings without any objection on the restoration order. It is pertinent to mentioned here that the Lahore Cantt Park View Housing Society filed their written reply in the aforesaid suit after more then 11 years. \r24. That, after about 3 years of the restoration of the suit, when the Park View Housing Society was going to be merged into DHA, Lahore; to bargain the favorite terms and conditions of merger, the Park View Housing Society, by using their influence money and other illegal means, managed the dismissal of the aforesaid suit through filing of frivolous application u/s 151 CPC on the ground that the aforesaid suit was not properly restored.

Anex-J.\r27. That the merger of the applicant land in DHA is not only illegal and unwarranted but also amounts to the contempt of the order of Hon�ble Lahore High Court, Lahore. And the DHA Lahore has no right, title or interest regarding the applicants land. \rIt is also pertinent to mention here that the Notification/Order of merger of Lahore Cantt Park View Housing Society into DHA Lahore passed by the Registrar Co- operative Society Park View Society Punjab, Lahore was based upon an order dated 17.08.2006 passed by Mr. Sohail Shahzad, District Officer (Revenue) / Collector Lahore, whereby the petition filed by Lahore Cantt Park View Housing Society was accepted and mutation No. 225,226 and 257 were restored. However, subsequently Mr. Sohail Shahzad, DO (R)/ Collector vide order dated 18.07.2007 has withdrawn  the said order dated 17.08.2007 on the ground that the said order was passed during the existence of the stay order, which was not brought to his notice. So, in this view of the matter, the order dated 28.06.2007 passed by the Registrar Cooperative Societies Punjab, Lahore ceased to have any legal effect. Copy of the order of DOR/Collector is attached as           Anex-K. \r28. That as submitted above, the land is owned by the applicant, the park view society claims to have purchased the land from Dil Aram Khan and Ashiq Ali etc; who in turn claim to have purchased the same from NICFC. As admitted by NICFC, in the written statement as well as in the statement of their learned counsel, that NICFC has not purchased the suit land from the Mst. Bilques Barkat etc, nor had they sold the same to, nor received consideration from Dil Aram Khan etc. \rThat the fraud and illegality in this regard is also evident from the facts that the vendor namely Ashiq Ali etc from whom the respondent Society claims to had purchased; himself had filed the suit on 19-08-2006 in the Civil Court, Lahore, for Specific Performance of alleged agreement dated 18-03-87, allegedly executed by the applicant in his favour. The said case is still pending in the Court of A.DJ. Lahore. Anex-L. This fact proves that the alleged vendor of respondent Society, as per his own version has not acquired the title of the subject land.\rSince the so called vendors namely Dil Aram Khan and Ashiq Ali etc had no legal right, title or interest in the suit land; they could not transfer  the same nor could the park view society acquired any title, right or interest in the suit land. It is well settled law that a vendor cannot transfer a better title then he himself possessed, as the maxim goes that �he giveth not, who haveth not�. Since the first and second transfer was void abinitio, the third transfer in favour of the park view housing society is also void abinitio and does not create any right, title or interest in its favour.\r29. That as far as case pending before member Board of Revenue titled as �Iqbal, Riaz v/s Bilquis Bakat etc� is concerned, it is stated that  That Mst. Bilquis Barkat etc purchased the land in question from one Ch. Riaz Ahmad, who purchased the land from one Sharaf Din (claimant / alottee).\rThat as far as  claim and allotment is concerned, it is respectfully stated that the claim and allotment has already been confirmed in favour of Shraf din in case titled �The State Vs Qutbudin and others� upto the level of August  Supreme Court of Pakistan. its details are as under:-\ri.\tThat on 23-12-78, CSC / MBR Ch. Muhammad Siddique has declared the claim as well as allotment of Sharaf din as valid and good. Copy attached as Annex.M. \rAn appeal was filed against that order, which was dismissed by the division \tbanch of Honourable High court Lahore on 27-04-80. Copy attached as Annex. N.\rA private party filed an appeal against that order which was also dismissed by the August Supreme Court of Pakistan on 20-08-91. Copy attached as Annex-O.\rii.\tThat it is important to mention here that the State, the Revenue Department as well as other State functionaries were party to that proceeding, but neither the State nor the revenue department has challenged the aforesaid three orders therefore, it has attained finality to their extent.\riii.\tThat on 24-07-2017, due to some pressure and connivance, the CSC / MBR, ignored the aforesaid three orders of Higher Courts and cancelled the claim and allotment in favour of sharaf din after a lapse of 40 years. Mst Bilquis Barkat etc filed writ petition against the order which was also dismissed on 28-09-17 due to connivance and pressure. \rThereafter, the filed an ICA before division Bench of Honourable High court which is pending. Copy attached as Annex.P. \riv.\tThat  neither CSC /MBR nor the learned single Judge has the jurisdiction to cancel or ignore the order passed by the division bench of Honourable High court, Lahore, therefore, the matter is likely to be decided in favour of the applicants.\r30. That it is proved that the Park View Housing Society in league with other members of Qabza/Land Mafia, from the very beginning have been in the habit of grabbing the land of the innocent persons including Mst. Bilquis Barkat etc. as it is quire clear from the above mentioned circumstances that because society and its other accomplices are well aware that from the very beginning they are playing fraud with the applicants on the basis of forged, fabricated and fraudulent documents prepared in their names through misrepresentation in respect of the land/property of the applicants. Therefore, to hide their fraudulent activities they have designed and managed to get the civil proceedings complicated, by using their political influence and other illegal means, more particularly when the first purported vendee namely NICFC had categorically denied of having purchased the aforesaid land from the applicants. They, being clever knew that because their original base has been proved wrong, illegal and fraudulent, therefore they, cannot succeed against the applicants and ultimately they will fail in civil litigations between the parties. That�s why, because of the aforesaid design of the Park View Housing Society, despite the facts, that the applicants have good case/ cases on merit in their favour they are facing difficulties in getting justice in their favour regarding their aforesaid land/property.\r\t\tFor the submissions mentioned above, it is, respectfully stated that the said matter may be resolved/ settled in the interest of justice.\rTHE PROPOSAL ON BEHALF OF THE APPLICANTS.\r1.\tThat as the Park View Housing Society is merged in DHA Lahore, therefore the matter can be settle down across the table with reciprocal cooperation. \r2.\tThat out of aforesaid land 769 Kanals; some piece of land is partially sold to different persons; whereas some land is the subject matter of illegal and fraudulent sale deeds, which litigation is pending in civil court.\r(The detail of land and its status regarding litigation is given in a schedule annex with this application as annex-1\r7. As far as the remaining land is concerned; it is free from litigation with other parties and its litigation is pending only with Park View Housing Society, Whereas after murger of Lahore Cantt. Park View Housing Society into DHA, Lahore, now the matter is pending between the DHA, Lahore and the applicants. \r8. The litigation between the parties is hanging around since long to disadvantage of both the parties. Therefore to cut short the litigation it is in the interest of both the parties to settle/resolve the issue, regarding the aforesaid land across the table and outside the court.\r9. That in case any application has been previously moved by any body, pretending to be the representative of the applicants; that may be considered and construed as non-existent. \r10. It will be expedient and in the interest of things that the matter be settled and resolved between the applicants and DHA, authorities concerned.  The applicants express their profound interest to settle the matter with the hope to have same gesture from your side.\r       \r       In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the matter, it is hoped that keeping in view, the exigency of the litigation, some emicable settlement will be reached between the applicants and DHA, Lahore accordingly.    \r       Assuring you best of cooperation at all times. \t\r       \r       \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApplicants\r       \r1.

That the addresses of the parties given in the head note of the appeal are correct for the purpose of summoning and notices.\r8. That the appellant is performing duties as Head Constable at PHP Kotla Adeeb Shaheed, District Sahiwal, he has been performing his duties to the entire satisfaction of his high Ups with a good unblemished service record.\r9. That the appellant was posted at PHP post Rukan pur district Lodhran, he was awarded the impugned punishment of stoppage of increment for        2-years by SP/PHP Multan region on the allegations that:\r�You HC Abbas Haider9841 while posted as shift incharge PHP post Rukan Pur District Lodhran committed misconduct in that on 14-03-18.                  Ex-Constable Fayyaz Ahmad No.10559 during Naka Bandi took Rs.100,000/- from the pocket of one Shah Muhammad, but You failed to inform timely your senior about his misconduct on the part of Ex. Constable�.\r10. Before passing the impugned punishment order, no charge sheet / show cause notice was issued to the appellant, rather the appellant was conemned without affording an opportunity of defence.\r11. That I was called in orderly room by respondent and awarded to punishment of stoppage of increment for one year under the Punjab police rules (E & D) 1975. \r12. That as under section 14 of the Punjab police E & D Rules 1975 no appeal lies against such like punishment with in the department therefore, the appeal seeks kind indulgence of this honourable tribunal for setting-aside impugned order, which is against the facts and circumstances inter-alia on the followings:-\rGROUNDS\ri. That the impugned order 1574/78 PA-PHP dated 27-03-2019 is against the fact circumstances, void abinitio, perverse, arbitrary based on surmises and conjunctures and devoid of force of law, hence the same is liable to be set aside.\rii. That the appellant is absolutely innocent into the matter.\riii. That while passing the impugned order, the punishing authority failed to appreciate the real situation of the case. Detailed submission of the appellant in this regard are as under:-\ra.\tOn 14-03-2018. while he appellant was posted to PHP Post Rukan Pura District Lodheran, he alongwith Ex-Constable Fayyaz Ahmad No.10559 and other PHP officials was performing patrol duty as shift incharge and had affected Naka Bandi in the beat area near Naseem Shah Farm. In the meanwhile 2 persons came there from Dunia Pur Side on a Motor Cycle. They were stopped and on this checking Alkhohlac, smell was coming from their mouths. They disclosed their names as Shah Muhammad Son of Gul Muhammad and Muhammad Bilal S/o Muhammad Shafie R/o Lodheran. They were apprehended and were handed over to HC Muhammad Naseem Muharrar PS Sadar lodhran for further proceedings. Thereafter, the appellant alongwith other PHP officials proceeded on usual patrolling. The said accused did not level any allegation against any of HP Officials regarding he alleged taking away any amount.\rb.\tAfter 40/50 minuts Muharar PS Sadar Lodhran telephonically contacted the appellant and told that said accused person are leveling allegation of taking amount from them. On this, the appellant alongwith PHP Officials reached at PS Sadar Lodhran and quired from said Shah Muhammad. Firstly said Shahid Muhammad alleged that his Rs.2-Lacs have been taken and then told that his Rs.1-1/2 lacs have been taken out and then said that the amount taken from him Rs. One lac. On further query initially said Shah Muhammad nominated Driver Constable Waseem Ahmad and thereafter nominated Ex-Consable Fayyaz Ahmad No.10559 in this regard.\rc.\tOn return to PHP Post, the appellant immediately recorded a DDR No.9 in this regard. (Copy attached for kind perusal).\rd.\tApart from above DDR, the appellant also brought the whole mater into the notice of incharge PHP, who sent a special report in this regard to senior officers. (Copy attached for kind perusal).\re.\tAs submitted above, the appellant immediately recorded a DDR regarding the above incident and also brought the matter into the notice of incharge PHP post. On the bases of information provided by the appellant, the incharge PHP submitted a special report to senior officers. Keeping in view the above facts, the charge against the appellant that he did not bring the matter into the notice of senior officers has died its own death. The appellant had no malafide in this regard.\rf.\tAfter alleged incident DSP/PHP Multan was deputed to conduct an enquiry in this regard. After a detailed enquiry, the DSP/PHP Multan concluded vide his report No.765/DSP/PHP-MN dated 10-02-2019 that no such incident has taken place, as no such heavy amount was present with the said Shah Muhammad at Relevant time.\rg.\tApart from above enquiry 3 other departmental enquiries in this regard were also  conducted in which, the appellant was not found at fault.\riv.\tThat while passing impugned order, the punishing authority did not provide proper opportunity of defence to the appellant rather passed the impugned order in a slipshod manner. The authority even did not bother to issue a show case notice / charge sheet against the appellant or to conduct an inquiry in this regard and in this way ignored the basic principles of justice. If an inquiry in this regard had been got conducted, innocence of the appellant had certainly come on record. The above omission on the part of punishing authority has lost the entire legal value of the impugned punishment order and the same is liable to be set aside on this sole ground.\rx. That the impugned punishment order has adversely affected the service career of the appellant for no fault on his part and thus has caused a grave miscarriage of justice. \rxi. That while passing impugned order the competent authority did not keep in mind the solid facts of the case rather based on surmises and conjectures which is not warranted law / justice. \rxii. That for the forgoing reasons, the impugned order is not maintainable in the eyes of law rather is liable to be set aside. \rxiii. That the impugned penalty is based on surmises and conjunctures, having no support of independent direct and reliable evidence, hence appellant can not be punished on the basis of presumptions, reliance is placed on PLD 1989 SC 335.\rxiv. That the appellant is performing his duties in order to achieve much possible promotion in the department, so that he is performing his obligations very carefully and if the instant impugned order is not set-aside, it will lead the appellant to his dark service career.\rPRAYER\r      Under the above said circumstances, it is therefore, most respectfully prayed that the instant appeal may kindly be accepted and the impugned order No.1574/78 PA-PHP dated 27-03-2019 passed by the respondent may kindly be set-aside, to meet the ends of justice.\r\tThat any other relief which this honourable court deems fit and proper may also be awarded to the appellant.\r\rAppellant\rThrough\rSARDAR M.FAISAL WASEEM\rAdvocate High Court\rCell NO.0300-7695011\r1-farid Kot Road, Lahore\rCERTIFICATE\rAs per instruction, this is 1st appeal on the subject before this honourable court.\r\r\rAdvocate",

That the Plaintiff had been enjoying the lawful and peaceful possession in respect of suit property since the time he owned and lawfully possessed the same till the time when minor differences of family nature started to develop amongst the party purely because of non domestic attitude and undue interference of the other family members / in laws of Plaintiff and said differences created elements of unjustified hatred and disaffection in the heart and mind of the defendant which finally resulted in few minor clashes amongst the parties on certain occasion and resolved, but temporarily due to the act of respectables.\r111.
