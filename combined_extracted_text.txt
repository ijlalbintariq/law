AFFIDAVIT

IN THE COURT OF NADEEM AHMAD CIVIL JUDGE, KHANPUR

Anila Bibi. 

versus 

Sher Zaman etc.



APPLICATION UNDER ORDER 3 RULE 4, SUB-RULES 1 & 2 OF THE CPC 1908 ALONG WITH 151 OF THE SAME, ON BEHALF OF THE APPLICANT/RESPONDENT NO.6 FOR THE LEAVE OF THE COURT TO PRESENT ANEW DULY AUTHORIZED POWER-OF-ATTORNEY AND AFRESH WRITTEN STATEMENT IN THE ABOVE TITLED CASE BASED ON THE CORRECT INSTRUCTIONS & ACCURATE/TRUE FACTS.   

AFFIDAVIT OF: Shugufta W/o Anwar Khan, resident of D.H.A, Lahore.

I, the above named deponent do hereby solemnly declare and affirm as under:- 

1. That the above titled case (‘the case’) is pending adjudication in this honourable court and is fixed for 20.06.2023. 

2. That the court vide order dated 15/05/2023, issued summons for attendance of the respondent nos.1-5 excluding respondent No.6, due to her attendance. 

3. That on the same date a power-of-attorney annexed to a written statement (‘the documents’) depicting reply in the case was purportedly submitted by Ch. Adeel Ahmed Gujjar (Advocate High Court), Sami Ullah Malik (Advocate High Court), and Muhammad Akhram MOJ (Advocate), (collectively referred hereinafter as “the ex-counsels”), on the behalf of respondent no.6.

4. That the matter of the fact is that respondent no.6 had only verbally agreed with ex-counsels to acquire their service for pleading in the above titled case, no written agreement related to fees or of any kind was made. However, to err on the side of caution, she impressed her thumb on a white paper and power attorney (‘the papers’), on the basis of assurance given by the ex-counsels that they will only use the papers in contingency of the matter.   

5. that it is submitted that respondent No.6 had intimated above-mentioned ex-counsels vide letter dates 05.05.23 about the termination of their service/pleadership in the case due to appointment of fresh counsel (Mr. Amir- Advocate High Court) to plead on her behalf.

7. That however, contrary to her instructions present in the said letter and assurance given by the ex-counsels along with mala fide intentions, the ex-counsels, presented the documents to sabotage respondent no.6’s defence in the case. It is important to explore on the fact that all the facts, given in the purported written statement, submitted on her behalf, in reply to the case, are false, misapprehension of facts, inaccurate, contrary to her instructions and does not have any bearing on her conscience. 

 8. That it is pertinent to note that no date was scribed under the hand of respondent no.6, either below her signature, in the documents, or under her thumb impression because she had never scribed the date nor signed the said documents as the matter of fact. The signature present are fake. 

9. that the further scrutiny of the documents revealed that written statement neither verified by respondent no.6 nor an effort was made to attain the stamp from oath commission in verification of the document. The reason can only be that ex-counsel in connivance acted malafidely to bring injury to her by usurping her right to defend the case as per her version of facts.  

5. That the perusal of written statement purportedly submitted in reply of the case, remits a false and infirm stance of the respondent no.6, which was neither based on true facts nor on accurate description of the events and the whole substance of the reply is contrary to her instructions.  

7. That hence the application was made in this honourable court for leave to submit anew power-of-attorney and afresh written statement based on accurate/true facts according to the correct instructions of respondent no.6.

8. That reliance was placed on 1992 SCMR 876 & 2008 SCMR 896, respectively. The reading of two authorities reveal that the admission of facts will be binding upon the client unless it is based upon mis-apprehension of facts, or it is contrary to the instructions. 

9. That further, reliance was placed on 2004 CLC 359, which provides that the vakalatnama has to be strictly interpreted.8. That nothing has been concealed.

10. The ex-Counsels’s mala fide act mentioned above shows their non-observance or violation of Art. 144 & 145 of the canons of professional conduct and etiquette provided under Legal Practitioners & Bar Council Rules, 1976 and for their professional misconduct the honourable court may refer them to the Disciplinary committee of the concerned Bar Council as per S.41 of Legal Practitioner & Bar Councils Act, 1973 to initiate disciplinary enquiry under  Art. 175A of Legal Practitioners & Bar Council Rules, 1976.

4. That the perusal of the TCS receipt record shows that it is not an urgent mail therefore, assumption can be made that by enlarge the notice were not reasonably served on applicant/defendant no.6 until 20.05.22. 

5. That section 28 (2) & (4) of The Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 provides that the manufacturer or service provider shall within 15 days of the receipt of the notice reply, thereto; a claim by the consumer or authority shall be filed within 30 days of the arising of the cause of action.

(Appellants/Plaintiffs)

Abbas Ali s/o Muhammad Aslam r/o House No.21, Street No.107, Mohallah Taylian Zaildar Road Ichra, Lahore. 

(Respondent/Defendant)



APPEAL UNDER SECTION 14(1)(b) OF FAMILY COURTS ACT 1964 READ ALONGWITH SECTION 151 CPC FOR ENHANCEMENT OF THE MAINTENANCE ALLOWANCE

Respectfully Sheweth: 

That the above captioned suit was decreed on 15.05.2023. 

That Mst. Ambreen obtain decree of dissolution of marriage on 02.12.2022 from the defendant and they have four children namely applicants/plaintiffs mentioned above out of that wedlock. 

The learned Family Court vide the said impugned decree, established that defendant is the real father of the applicants/plaintiffs; ordered that appellants/plaintiffs are entitled to recover maintenance allowance from the defendant at the rate of Rs. 6000/- each per month with 10% annual increase on basic rate of maintenance from the date of institution of the instant decided suit till their legal entitlement, however past maintenance in their case was declined.

Ground 1 

That the learned judge in the judgement/decree dated 15.05.2023, did not provide a sufficient reason and/or any reason to decline the past maintenance of applicants/plaintiffs that was reasonably prayed from the date of refusal to pay maintenance by the defendant i.e., 29.06.2022, till the date of institution of the instant suit, i.e., 28.02.2023 (hereinafter referred to as ‘period of distress’). 

That it is submitted that Ms. Ambreen Inayat owns a beauty parlour, however, due to rampant inflation, deteriorating economic conditions and non-payment of the maintenance during the period of distress, constrained Mst. Ambreen Inayat’s spending on applicants’/plaintiffs’ basic-necessities of life like education and health maintenance etc. Consequently, she had to borrow money from the locality, friends & family to buy and/or pay for necessities of life. The accumulated debt is so huge that her income is not sufficient to discharge it till this date and it is still compounding. 

That, defendant has the liability to maintain his young children/applicants/plaintiffs. Mst. Ambreen Inayat did not pray for her maintenance allowance from the defendant, whereas, she had a full right to do so, because she was earning a decent amount from her business to fulfil her needs and does not want to come out as unreasonable.

Ground 2:

That the learned judge erred to disregard the oral testimonies of PW1 and PW2 in the matter related to total income of the defendant. It is averred that Mst Ambreen Inayat have no access, permission, or approach to obtain any documentary evidence related to defendant’s income, however, she managed to get corroborative evidence in the shape of oral evidence, which the learned judge did not take in to account while pronouncing the judgement. 

That, moreover, the learned judge did not appraise the fact that Mst. Ambreen Inayat being a woman in the male dominated society and having restrained relationship with the defendant, would not be able to compel defendant to produce the real documentary evidence of his income for her inspection. It is only possible if the court render the defendant or his brother for production of evidence related to their income. 

That the learned Judge was aware of the fact in the light of oral evidences by PW1 & PW2 that defendant is the co-owner of a Mobile Shop at Hall Road and has similar businesses abroad; still the learned judge gave a lenient order related to maintenance allowance in the favour of the defendant, to the detriment of the applicants/plaintiffs, even after defendant was contumacious in appearing before the court, which is evident from the above-mentioned Ex-parte decree.

 That it is pertinent to mention that the impugned judgement was given on 15.05.2023 and defendant has until 15.06.2023 to set aside the impugned judgement. Whereas, he has not applied till date to set aside the impugned judgement, which proves the fact that defendant is willing use the given available time in law to torture Ambreen Inayat by protracting the case and avoid payment of the maintenance allowance, which in turn is an abuse of process and/or misuse of law. 

That the learned judge could have taken a reasonable income of a person owning a Mobile Shop on Hall Road and having similar businesses abroad, which comes to 500,000/- per month, out of which, defendant can easily provide a sum of Rs. 50,000/- for better living of each applicant/plaintiff. 

Ground 3: 

That the learned Judge while assessing maintenance allowance did not take account of minors promoted to higher classes and were admitted in better schools & tuition fees etc., while pronouncing the said judgement. 

Ground 4:     

That the learned judge did not take in to account the rampant inflation in the consumer market, deteriorating economic condition and instable political environment of the country. The judge only awarded a 10% increment every year on the basic rate of Rs.6000/- for each applicant/plaintiff, however, it is submitted that as the increment is on basic rate than it could have been a 20% increment instead, given the economic climate and sustenance of four growing children in this unstable political climate. 

 

PRAYER 



In the above circumstances, it is therefore respectfully prayed that the maintenance allowance may please be enhanced in accordance with the prevailing economic circumstances and other maintenance requirements of the minors/applicants/plaintiffs, also taking in to account the defendant’s income and his capacity to pay. 

It is further prayed that the learned Appellate Court may also subject defendant to provide a reasonable past maintenance allowance at the basic rate of Rs. 6000/- in the interest of justice and wellbeing of his children’s/applicants’/plaintiffs’. The total whereof comes to Rs. 1,92,000/-

It is also prayed that if the yearly increment is on basic rate of maintenance than it should have been a 20% increment instead, given the economic climate and sustenance of the applicants/plaintiffs in this unstable political climate.

Any other relief which this Honourable court deems fit may also be awarded to the applicant.

Dear Foysal,Thank you for your reply. Unfortunately we are not able to reduce the rent below E800 per month from 1/6/23. Our letting agent assures us that this amount is very good value in the present market. It is also still preferential when compared to the other units in the building. While we also regret having to make this increase it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the building.If you decide to remain in the space we will of course deal with any building maintenance issues which you have.Kind regards,Michael Lynch.Sheridan & Lynch Ltd.

GoodMorning Michael,

Thanks you so much for the reading. No I have not heard anything regarding the renew from the solicitor, I believe there should not be a problem with our agreement as we have already agreed to each other, but now the window replacement works and heater fixing is holding us for going any further with our new venture, which can cause difficulty to pay the new rent, therefore, can you please send someone to do the necessary works at the premises by this week please. We can not delay our opening any further than mid this month as we are losing money every days. I highly appreciate your understanding.

8.—The jurisdiction conferred by this Act on the Court shall be exercised by the Judge of the Court for the time being assigned to the Circuit in which are situate the premises or any part of the premises in relation to which the jurisdiction is exercised.



16.—Subject to the provisions of this Act, where this Part applies to a tenement, the tenant shall be entitled to a new tenancy in the tenement beginning on the termination of his previous tenancy, and the new tenancy shall be on such terms as may be agreed upon between the tenant and the person or persons granting or joining in the grant of the new tenancy or, in default of agreement, as shall be fixed by the Court.



17.—(1) (a) A tenant shall not be entitled to a new tenancy under this Part if—





(i) the tenancy has been terminated because of non-payment of rent, whether the proceedings were framed as an ejectment for non-payment of rent, an ejectment for overholding or an ejectment on the title based on a forfeiture, or





(ii) the tenancy has been terminated by ejectment, notice to quit or otherwise on account of a breach by the tenant of a covenant of the tenancy, or





(iii) the tenant has terminated the tenancy by notice of surrender or otherwise, or





(iv) the tenancy has been terminated by notice to quit given by the landlord for good and sufficient reason, or





(v) the tenancy terminated otherwise than by notice to quit and the landlord either refused for good and sufficient reason to renew it or would, if he had been asked to renew it, have had good and sufficient reason for refusing.





(b) In this subsection “good and sufficient reason” means a reason which emanates from or is the result of or is traceable to some action or conduct of the tenant and which, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, is in the opinion of the Court a good and sufficient reason for terminating or refusing to renew (as the case may be) the tenancy.





(2) (a) A tenant shall not be entitled to a new tenancy under this Part where it appears to the Court that—





(i) the landlord intends or has agreed to pull down and rebuild or to reconstruct the buildings or any part of the buildings included in the tenement and has planning permission for the work, or





(ii) the landlord requires vacant possession for the purpose of carrying out a scheme of development of property which includes the tenement and has planning permission for the scheme, or





(iii) the landlord being a planning authority, the tenement or any part thereof is situate in an area in respect of which the development plan indicates objectives for its development or renewal as being an obsolete area, or





(iv) the landlord, being a local authority for the purposes of the Local Government Act, 1941 , will require possession, within a period of five years after the termination of the existing tenancy, for any purpose for which the local authority are entitled to acquire property compulsorily, or





(v) for any reason the creation of a new tenancy would not be consistent with good estate management.





(b) In the case of certain dwellings and business premises to which this subsection applies the tenant is entitled to compensation for disturbance under Part IV.





(3) Where the Court is satisfied—





(a) that a tenant would but for subparagraph (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of subsection (2) (a) be entitled to a new tenancy, and





(b) that the landlord will not require possession for the purposes mentioned in the relevant subparagraph until after the expiration of a period of at least six months,





the Court may, if the tenant so requests, continue the existing tenancy until terminated by the landlord for those purposes by the service of six months' previous notice in writing, but subject to the condition that the continuation of the tenancy shall be without prejudice to the right of the tenant to relief under this Act on the termination of the continued tenancy.





(4) Where, in a case in which an application for a new tenancy has been refused on a ground mentioned in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of subsection (2) (a), it appears to the Court that the landlord has not, within a reasonable time, carried out the intention, agreement or purpose, as the case may be, on account of which such application was refused, the Court may order the landlord to pay to the tenant such sum as it considers proper by way of punitive damages.



20.—(1) A claim for a new tenancy under this Part shall not be maintained unless the claimant, within the time limited in subsection (2), serves on each person against whom the claim is intended to be made a notice of intention to claim relief in the prescribed form.





(2) A notice of intention to claim relief may be served—





(a) in the case of a tenancy terminating by the expiration of a term of years or other certain period or by any other certain event—





(i) before the termination of the tenancy, or





(ii) at any time thereafter but before the expiration of three months after the service (not earlier than three months before the termination of the tenancy) on the claimant by the landlord of notice in the prescribed form of the expiration of the term or period or the happening of the event;

(d) in the case of a tenancy to which section 29 applies—within six months after the commencement of this Act.





(3) The notice may include a claim in the alternative for compensation.



21.—(1) A person who serves a notice of intention to claim relief may, at any time not less than one month thereafter, apply to the Court to determine his right to relief and (as the case may be) to fix the amount of the compensation or the terms of the new tenancy to which he is found to be entitled.





(2) If he does not do so within three months after service of the notice, any person on whom the notice was served may apply to the Court to determine the matters to which the notice relates.





(3) An application under this section may be made, heard and determined either before and in anticipation of or after the termination of the tenancy.



22.—(1) Where the tenant serves on the landlord a notice of intention to claim compensation under Part IV for improvements, the landlord, any superior landlord or any two or more of such persons may, within two months, serve on the tenant a notice in the prescribed form offering him a new tenancy in the tenement on terms specified in the notice or on terms to be fixed by the Court.

(c) the tenant may, alternatively, within one month serve on such person or persons a notice refusing the new tenancy;





(d) in that case the tenant may proceed with his application for relief by way of compensation for improvements, but—





(i) on the hearing of the application, the Court if satisfied that the tenant is entitled to that relief, may in lieu of awarding that relief make an order requiring the necessary person or persons to grant, and the tenant to accept, a new tenancy in the tenement on such terms as the Court (subject to the provisions of this Act) thinks proper and specifies in the order, and





(ii) upon the making of that order, the necessary person or persons shall forthwith grant, and the tenant shall forthwith accept, a contract of tenancy in writing in respect of the tenement on the terms specified in the order.





(3) Where a notice is served under subsection (1) offering a new tenancy on terms to be fixed by the Court—





(a) either the person or persons who served the notice or the tenant may apply to the Court for an order fixing the terms of the new tenancy;





(b) upon the making of that order, the necessary person or persons shall forthwith grant, and the tenant shall forthwith accept, a contract of tenancy in writing in respect of the tenement on the terms specified in the order.





(4) Where any person or persons and the tenant are required by this section or an order made under this section, respectively to grant and accept a new tenancy, the tenant shall not be entitled to compensation in respect of the termination of his tenancy previous to the new tenancy.





(5) Where any person or persons and the tenant are required, by this section or an order made under this section, respectively to grant and accept a new tenancy and any dispute, failure or question arises or occurs in the granting and accepting of the tenancy, the Court, on the application of any person concerned, may make such order as justice may require.

18.—(1) This section applies where the Court, on an application for a new tenancy under this Part, finds that the tenant is entitled to a new tenancy.





(2) The Court shall fix the terms of the new tenancy and make an order requiring the landlord, and any superior landlord whose joinder may be necessary, to grant or join in the grant of, and the tenant to accept, a new tenancy accordingly.





(3) Such person or persons shall grant or join in the grant of, and the tenant shall accept, a new contract of tenancy in writing in respect of the tenement on the terms specified in the order, commencing on the termination of the previous tenancy.





(4) The tenant shall not be entitled to compensation in respect of the termination of his previous tenancy.





(5) If any dispute, failure or question arises or occurs in the carrying out of the order, the Court may, on the application of any person concerned, make such order as justice may require.



Sec. 28:

Where an application is pending under this Part for a new tenancy or to fix the terms of a new tenancy and the pre-existing tenancy was terminated otherwise than by ejectment or surrender the tenant may, if he so desires, continue in occupation of the tenement from the termination of the tenancy until the application is determined by the Court or, in the event of an appeal, by the final appellate court, and the tenant shall while so continuing be subject to the terms (including the payment of rent) of such tenancy, but without prejudice to such recoupments and readjustments as may be necessary in the event of a new tenancy being granted to commence from such termination.

64.—In this Part, “lease” includes a yearly tenancy arising by operation of law or by inference on the expiration of a lease and a statutory tenancy implied by holding over premises on the expiration of a lease.

Re:-

						MD Foysal Khan



Subject matter: letter in response to request for termination of renewed lease agreement and/or eviction from the rented unit.

Dear Michael Lynch, 

I am writing this email in response to your request to terminate the renewed lease early and/or eviction from the rented unit. It is unfortunate that our communications/negotiations fell apart related to delivery of renewed lease agreement. However, I raise a dispute related to the above cited matter on the following grounds-

1. that via email dated 04.05.2023, you made the demand for increase in rent amount to €800, from 01.06.2023, which was the explicit term of negotiation in the renewal of the lease agreement. However, the email exchanged on 11.05.2023 shows that as per negotiations with Mr. Williams first rent payment with the new rent amount will be paid from 01.07.2023, which is the explicit term in the renewed lease agreement. In the same email, I further requested for drawing and delivering of the renewed lease agreement with the similar terms as were scribed in the previous lease agreement except the rent amount. I also demanded maintenance of certain fixtures and fittings before renewed lease agreement could be effective from 01.07.2023, which is also the explicit term of the renewed lease agreement. 

2. That you assured me via email dated 21.05.2023 that I will receive the renewed lease agreement as soon as it is ready, which will be enforced from 01.07.2023. It is clearly inferable from the email that I am sure to receive the renewed agreement within reasonable time. In response to the latter email, I wrote via email dated 21.05.2023, requesting your visit, for inspection of any maintenance that was your responsibility as a landlord to complete before the renewed lease will take effect. In response to the latter email, you wrote via email dated 31.05.2023, that one of the people from your business/company will visit the shop for inspection of the required maintenance and you asked for the address that your solicitor(s) needed to scribe on the new lease agreement. Which solidify your assurance to me that I have secured the renewed lease agreement. In response to the latter email, I sent an email dated 31.05.2023, providing information related to my new business venture and address that needed to be scribed on the lease agreement. In the following emails dated 01.06.2023 respectively, you again reassured me that the renewed lease agreement is secured and I must carry on building up the new business venture, intended to be ran from the rented unit. 

3. That however, after many requests for updates on delivery of renewed lease agreement, you sent the email dated 13.06.2023, which cited your solicitor’s fault for delay in sending/providing renewed lease agreement, which was not reasonable/sufficient reason but I ignored it, given our long landlord and tenant relationship. Further in the same email, you cautioned me against making any changes in the unit until the lease is signed, which was not feasible for my new business. As you are professional, you must understand I have made an investment in the new venture, including paying the rent on the unit. The longer the unit is shut and/or non-operational, the greater the loss that I would have suffered. If I can’t fulfil the purpose of renting the unit on higher rent, then why should I even have it. Therefore, as any reasonable prudent business man would do, I started renovating the unit as per my new venture’s requirement. 

4. That further emails exchange dated 06.07.2023, 07.07.2023, 08.07.2023 and 10.07.2023 respectively, provided that your solicitors even on your command, after more than 2 months of email communications, did not send/provided me and/or you the renewed lease agreement, which is completely unreasonable, unprofessional, and unethical as a business professional. 

5. That currently, you have threatened me with the eviction and/or termination of the renewed lease on the unit, ostensibly citing change in ownership. It is to remind you that you have orally and/or in writing assured me that renewal of my lease is inevitable/definite and signing the renewed lease agreement was just a formality to form enforceable legal relations, therefore, relying on the assurance provided I paid the new rent according to the renewed lease agreement and invested substantial amount of my capital on renovating the unit, therefore, eviction and/or termination of the renewed lease, this early, will bring me irreparable loss, injury & detriment (monetary and/or non-monetary), which I cannot afford to suffer given my family and social status. 

Therefore, I reserve the right to claim relief from the Honourable Circuit Court as per Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980 but I am open to any reasonable alternate resolution to the current dispute. 

Regards, 

MD Foysal Khan

Respectfully Sheweth; -

 

That the names, descriptions, and residents of the parties mentioned herein are ascertained.

That brief facts giving rise to the filing of the instant suit are that plaintiff is a respectable business man and a successful one (evident from clause 4 of the first three agreements-mentioned later), who operates several businesses. One of his businesses is related to the bulk buying and wholesale selling to retailers and/or consumers alike, of seasonal fruits, which is the basis of contention in the instant suit (‘fruit business’). The defendants made the following agreements and arrangements with the plaintiff related to their partnership in the fruit business.

AGREEMENT No.1- BETWEEN P & D1 DATED: 10.10.202

That a written agreement dated 10.10.2021 (‘agreement no.1’) was executed, vide stamp paper no. 2 marked as serial no. J407471, entry no. 301, dated 08.10.2021, purchased through M.

(Copy of the agreement no. 2 is attached with the plaint for kind perusal of the learned court as Annexure 3- the original document is with the defendant no. 2).

That as per agreement defendant no.2 invested Rs.300,000/- capital via pay order no.25699526 dated 04.02.2022, issued by the Branch of Habib Bank Limited on Bhatta Chowk Ghazi Road Lahore, in plaintiff’s fruit business. (Copy of the pay order is attached with the plaint for kind perusal of the learned court as Annexure 4- the original document is with defendant no. 2) 

That perusal of the agreement shows that the intention of defendant no.2, was also to become a sleeping partner in the fruit business, and to receive profits on daily basis; recover the capital investment by the maturity date of the agreement i.e., 07.02.2023.

That, plaintiff in agreement to all the terms executed the cheque of amount Rs.300,000/-, numbered 1116349273 dated 07.02.2023 of the Branch of Bank of Punjab, on Ali View Garden main Bedian Road, Lahore (‘cheque no.2’), as a collateral and/or guarantee.

That Further, Clause 4 of the agreement provides that if parties agree, they may with mutual consent extend the obligations under the contract beyond the maturity date i.e., 07.02.2023, otherwise the contract will stand concluded on the scribed maturity date in the agreement. 

AGREEMENT No. 3 BETWEEN P & D3 DATED: 07.03.2022

That a written agreement was executed dated 07.03.2022 (‘agreement no.3’), vide stamp paper no. 4 marked as serial no. PB-LHR-9E2317D77E95ABE0, dated 02.03.2022, issued through Iqram Ayub Bhatti Stamp vendor, Shalimar Link Road Branch Lahore, between plaintiff and defendant no.3, which has already matured on 07.03.2023 (Copy of the agreement no.3 is attached with the plaint for kind perusal of the learned court as Annexure 5- the original document is with the defendant no. 3). 

That as per agreement defendant no.3 invested cash of Rs.150,000/- capital in plaintiff’s fruit business. 

That perusal of the agreement shows that the intention of defendant no.3, was also to become a sleeping partner in the fruit business, and to receive profits on daily basis; recover the capital investment by the maturity date of the agreement i.e., 07.03.2023.

That, plaintiff in agreement to all the terms executed the cheque of Rs.150,000/-, numbered 1313248401 dated 03.03.2024 of the Branch of Bank of Punjab, on Ali View Garden main Bedian Road, Lahore (‘cheque no.3’), as a collateral and/or guarantee.

That Further, clause 4 of the agreement provides that if parties agree, they may with mutual consent extend the obligations under the contract beyond the maturity date i.e., 07.02.2023, otherwise as provided the contract will stand concluded on the scribed maturity date in the agreement. 

Fruit Business

That plaintiff avers that he was competently carrying out his fruit business operations from Lahore since 2020. He usually buys seasonal fruits through a broker in bulk quantity, from Quetta and Waziristan, to sell them as a wholesaler to retailers in Lahore. The usual mode of payement for the consignment is in cash and no receipts were ever given of the payment as brokers are reliable source to buy the product in contention. Defendants approached plaintiff to invest in his business, as mentioned above, on different dates, given his good and flourishing reputation. 

That plaintiff and defendants went in to a partnership, where defendants were the sleeping partners and plaintiff was responsible for buying and selling the seasonal fruits including logistics. As per agreement plaintiff had submitted profits in the form of cash to the defendants on many occasions. Plaintiff and defendants’ partnership flourished for a year and more, as evident from the clause 4, of the first three agreements, where defendants had contemplated to extend the agreement period beyond one year maturity date of their respective agreements. 

That however, plaintiff ordered a consignment of apples between late August and early September of 2022, which costed him Rs. 16,00,000/-. Plaintiff investment consisted of 50% of the capital i.e., Rs. 8,00,000/- and rest of the 800,000/- investment belonged to defendants in this instant case. 

That the consignment was to be delivered on trucks to plaintiff in Lahore from Quetta and Waziristan, but due to act of God, circumstances out of plaintiff’s reach and unforeseeable disaster (flooding), trucks were stuck at the place of crossing at their respective area. Where they were stuck for 14 days due to continuous flooding and apples in the truck went rotten, which were later wasted. Plaintiff went himself and took one of his workers to visit the area, where disaster occurred and inspected the situation and the consignment of apples. The inspection shown that the consignment was positively rotten and had to be destroyed, and plaintiff informed the defendants of the loss that they have suffered, equally. Therefore, the case falls under the ambit of frustration of contract, which make the all three agreements mentioned in the preceding paragraphs liable to be void. 

That to plaintiff’s amazement, defendants started to demand unreasonably about return of their invested capital in the fruit business. Plaintiff on several occasion explained the nature of their partnership but of no avail. Therefore, on 12.04.2023, Defendants attacked plaintiff at his residence, in that attack they threaten of dire circumstances for him and his family, in case, plaintiff does not return their invested capital amount, respectively. Defendants also took away three-specific movable properties, which were not even the part of the three original. The description whereof is scribed in clause 4 of the agreement no.4.  

Agreement no. 4 mentioned in preceding paragraph was between plaintiff and all defendants. Which was purportedly executed without plaintiff’s free will, with undue influence through dangerous people accompanying them and coercion by implicating about dire consequences for him and his family, if plaintiff does not execute and sign the fourth agreement. The details where of is given in the next paragraphs.

AGREEMENT No.4 (PUNCHIAT NAMA) BETWEEN P & D1-D3 DATED: 12.04.2023

That a written agreement (‘agreement no.4’) was purportedly executed between plaintiff and defendants dated 12.04.2023, which will mature on 11.07.2023 (Copy of the agreement no. 4 is attached with the plaint for kind perusal of the learned court as Annexure 7- the original document is with the defendant no.1).

That the perusal of the agreement shows that in addition to above mentioned material facts, plaintiff had previously receipted a cash amount of Rs. 150,000/- in the form of capital investment from defendant no.1 as sleeping partner, vide stamp paper no. 1 dated 23.08.2021, serial no. T80283, entry no. 160, issued by M. Javed stamp vendor Al Faisal Town Lahore Cantt, license no.139. Therefore, the total capital invested by defendant no.1 comes to Rs. 350, 000/-.

That clause 2 shows that the total capital investment made by the defendants in plaintiff’s fruit business was Rs.800,000/-, in the following division/manner:

defendant no.1’s total capital investment is Rs. 350,000/-;

defendant no.2’s total capital investment is Rs. 300,000/-;

defendant no.3’s total capital investment is Rs. 150,000/-.  

The maturity of the fourth contract is set to be on 11.07.2023, by when defendant unreasonably demand return of their total capital invested in to plaintiff’s fruit business.

That plaintiff submits that defendants induced him without free consent, with undue influence and coerced him to agree and sign the fourth agreement, by threatening his family’s wellbeing and his, therefore, fourth agreement was made on wrong pretexts.

That under the garb of the fourth contract, defendants induced and/or coerced plaintiff to execute following three cheques as guarantee of return of their total invested capital, belonging to his account in Branch of Bank of Punjab, Main Bedian Road, Lahore, which are advertently and maliciously not mentioned in the fourth contract- 

Cheque no. 4, numbered 1313248449;

Cheque no. 5, numbered 1313248447;

Cheque no. 6, numbered 1313248448.

(Copy of the cheque no. 4,5,6 is attached with the plaint for kind perusal of the learned court as Annexure 8,9,10, respectively- the original cheques are with the defendants).

That it is pertinent to mention here about the latter cheques that Plaintiff has forgotten what amount he had scribed on those cheques or whether he has even written any amount, due to the pressure at that moment.     

That further defendants with undue influence and deceit took without permission following specific movable property belonging to plaintiff and his friends as provided in clause 3 of the fourth agreement-

defendant no. 1 took loader Riskha as a guarantee against the return of his total invested capital amount of Rs. 350,000/- by plaintiff;

defendant no. 2 took Motorbike CG-125, Bike no. LEK-7803 as a guarantee against the return of his total capital amount of Rs. 300,000/- by plaintiff;

defendant no. 3 took real/original file of Mehran Car no. LWR-3343 and related documents, Chassis no.986627, White color, belonging to Syed Muhammad Afzal Shah S/o Muhammad Anwar Shah, NIC no. 35202-2533989-5, as a guarantee against the return of his total capital amount of Rs. 150,000/- by plaintiff.

That it is essential to mention here that plaintiff did not give any consent for any of the cheques and specific movable properties mentioned in paragraphs 29 & 31, respectively, to be taken as guarantee. However, defendants with undue influence, coercion and without plaintiff’s free will executed the fourth agreement and took specific movable properties and cheques with them.

That the cause of action arose in favor of the Plaintiffs and against the defendant No.2 and the concerned authorities due to aforesaid facts and circumstances and it is continuing. 

That since the cause of action arose at Lahore the parties to the suit resides at Lahore, hence this Honorable court has jurisdiction to adjudicate in the matter. 

That the value of the suit for purposes of court fee and jurisdiction is fixed at Rs.800,000/-. The court fees will be submitted to the honorable court as per its order.   



PRAYER:

	It is respectfully prayed that agreement no. 1, 2, and 3 may be rescinded and/or declared void due to frustration of contract, consequentially first three cheques (labelled 1,2,3) given as guarantee in the latter mentioned contracts may be cancelled in the interest or justice and equity. 

	Further, prayed that agreement no. 4 may be cancelled due to execution under undue influence, coercion and without free consent. Consequently, all three later cheques (labelled 5,6,7) taken under the garb of the agreement no.4 and maliciously not mentioned in the fourth contract taken as guarantee may be cancelled too, in the interest justice, equity and fair play. 

	It is also prayed that defendants may be directed to deposit all the specific movable properties mentioned in the clause 3 of the agreement no.4, in to this Honorable Court.  

	Lastly prayed that a permanent injunction may be granted against defendants for not presenting all the six cheques anywhere and defendant may be restrained from approaching plaintiff at his home to threaten him with dire consequences, in the interest of public policy, justice and due process of law.  		

	Any other relief which this Hon’able Court deems fit may also be awarded.

APPLICATION UNDER ORDER XXXIX, RULE 1 & 2 OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, 1908 FOR GRANT OF TEMPORARY INJUNCTIONS





Respectfully Sheweth;





That the petitioner has filed the accompanying suit before this Honorable Court, the contents of which may kindly be read as an integral part of this application for temporary injunctions and no date of hearing has been fixed so far.



That the Petitioner has a good prima facie and arguable case in their favor.



That petitioner is a reputable businessman and has established wholesale fruit business. Defendants approached plaintiff to invest in his business as a sleeping partner but due to act of God and /or natural disaster, beyond the control of plaintiff, the consignment of goods containing apples was destroyed. Plaintiff and defendants equally suffered the loss. Therefore, it is a case of frustration of contract, which must be adjudged by the Honorable court on merits. Further, plaintiff was made to sign the fourth contract under due influence, coercion and without his free consent. Therefore, plaintiff also has a good case for cancellation of documents including all the cheques taken under the garb of guarantee. Plaintiff has all the proves related to the matter and has annexed the copies whereof with the plaint but the originals of the documents are with the defendants as they are the dominant party.

 

That therefore, the balance of convenience also lies in favor of the Petitioner.



That the petitioner will suffer irreparable loss if the defendants are not restrained from cashing all the cheques and approaching plaintiff and/or his family for their detriment.





PRAYER







It is therefore respectfully prayed that during the pendency of the instant suit, all defendants, its employees, agents, or any other person acting for and/or on its behalf, directly or indirectly be restrained from taking any steps/actions towards cashing all the cheques issued on behalf of Plaintiff.

The rest of the co-accused relied upon the documents presented by R1







Grounds of Appeal: 

Ground No.1: Whether the complainant was the owner in actual possession of the property in question? [Para.8: Line.11-16]

C’s legal and equitable rights in the property were established by the family agreement and dismissal of last civil appeal made by R3 (evidence of the constructive possession). About the Family agreement: Complainant did not even annex with his complaint, the alleged written family statement through which rests his claim of ownership over the house in question. [Para.8: Line.33-37]. However, Claimant is ready to present the family agreement at behest of the court. It is also submitted that Judgements in specific performance case (Ex.PE) and civil appeal (Ex.PG) proves that complainant has the legal and equitable right in the disputed property and constructive possession.  

  

Ground No.2: Prior to the date alleged for taking forcible possession of the same by the accused persons and whether the complainant, in fact, himself was in possession of the same [Para.8: Line.11-16], and why complainant never earlier ventured for obtaining possession of his property in absence of R3? [Para.8: Line.65-68]

It is submitted that C was not in actual possession of the property at any time before the complaint was made. However, C was in constructive possession of the disputed property. It can be proven by the theory that R3 had promised the C in presence of PW.2 and PW.3 to deliver the possession amicably, to which C agreed but R3 misused his trust (abuse of position of trust) to gain the time to illegally dispose of the property in connivance with Mr Murtaza; Mr Murtaza colluded with R1 and R2. Therefore, their complicity is undraped and C always had the constructive possession, however he was not in actual possession of the property. 

Ground No.3: Thus, if allegedly, as per civil pleadings of complainant, the last possessor of the property i.e., R3 was not present at the spot then who transferred the possession to the co-accused R1 and R2? [Para.8: Line.60-65]

It is submitted that judge did not contemplate the above question adequately. Therefore, this becomes the third ground to challenge the impugned judgement. 

It is submitted that R3 in collusion with Mr Ghulam Murtaza evidently sold legal rights to R1. R3, after the judgement in civil suit (25.09.2016) had apprehension that his legal right and actual possession in the disputed property, will be taken away by the court, therefore, to acquire maximum advantage of the disputed property and the position of trust, he evidently sold disputed property to Mr Murtaza. Mr Murtaza did not conduct reasonable conveyancing before ostensibly purchasing the disputed property papers (as in that period, it was under litigation, therefore could not be sold), on (31.12.2016), after the adverse judgement against R3 promulgated in the Civil suit on (25.09.2016) against R3, the proof is annexed as (Ex.PM). Further on, Mr Murtaza ostensibly sold the disputed property to R1, [it is evidenced in Ex.DA (copy of plaint in Rasheed v Ghulam Murtaza), Ex.DB (order from civil court-09.04.2022) and Ex.DC (application for temporary injunction)] in order to deter C from claiming actual possession, control, and occupancy of the disputed property. The reason for stating the latter theory is that R1 could deter C because R1 is a PTI party worker and holder of public office in government department, therefore have some influence over the governmental machinery.

R1 in an attempt to avoid facing criminal charges, Let the disputed property; installed R2 as the tenant in the property and acted as a legal owner, evidenced in initial police inquiry made on the request of predecessor judge; preliminary orders based on S 7 Illegal Dispossession Act 2005 (IDA 2005), and it could also be proven through Ex.PN (petition by R3) and Ex.DE (Petition by C). Thus, the collaboration of all the respondents to deter C from obtaining physical possession is writ large in C’s initial application, to which Court did not pay any or any sufficient attention. 

In summary, R3 lost the case in 2016, in fear of losing the possession of the disputed property and gaining maximum benefit from it, sold the legal rights to Mr Murtaza. Then ostensibly Mr Murtaza sold the disputed property to R1; evidently R1 installed R2 as tenant to avoid confrontation and criminal charges. In addition, R1 was the main person (master mind) who confronted C on 29.06.2020 with unknown men laden with weapons, evidenced in C’s private complaint under provision of IDA 2005. In addition, it was R3 who delivered the possession of the disputed property to the C in compliance with order of the court under section 7 IDA 2005. The court did not inquire from R1 about the latter situation. Therefore, the adequate contemplation or reasonable theory can only be that R1, R2, and R3 acted in Sophisticated and organised manner to illegally deter and dispossess C from the disputed property, which the court failed to contemplate in their judgement.

Ground No 4: issue related to possession of the dispute property prior to private complaint under provisions of IDA 2005 on 26.06.2022

It is submitted that prior to application under S3 IDA 2005, the physical possession was with R3 and constructive possession was with C. The argument is that by the virtue of court order in 2016, R3 became the trustee and he was holding the property on trust for C. It is pertinent to mention here that C always had the equitable right in the disputed property in lieu of family agreement. Since C was awarded the legal right of the disputed property by the court, R3 had come on back foot and started negotiation related to actual possession of the disputed property, which is evidence from PW.2 witness statement. Negotiation involved buying the rights in the disputed property and request for permission to extend stay until finding a proper home for the family to move. R3, cunningly made Civil Appeal and lost in lieu of order on 04.02.2020. Hence, attempted fresh negotiation like previous one. Given his family relations with C’s father, C shown mercy again and gave him extension of time to either vacate the property or buy rights in the property. Eventually, on 25.06.2020, in connivance with R2, he managed to deter C from claiming actual possession of the property. It is vital to mention here that C had no knowledge related to sale of the disputed property by R3 in favour of Mr Murtaza. In summary, C always had the control over the property therefore he afforded the leave to R3 to remain in the disputed property until suitable option for his family is not available. Hence, unequivocally, C always had constructive possession since court order in 2016 (ibid). it is also cogent that R3, took advantage of C’s good nature and abused the position of trust.

Ground No.5: The classification of the property: 



Ground No.6: S.3 Illegal Dispossession Act 2005 (IDA 2005)

Whether collusion of responds, connote their complicity as organised or sophisticated land grabbers or do they fall under any?



Ground No.7: Other provisions of the IDA 2005



Ground No.8: Time period of total case: 

The judge intentionally omitted to include that it took more than 2 years to conclude the present case, more than 6 months. The judge did not consider the adverse effect it had on C’s case like C’s one of the main witnesses (Atif Ali-PW.3) went hostile and they labelled him won over. Which is an incorrect description because Atif due to fear of his family’s safety did not attend his cross examination. Which judge conveniently omitted to mention. Atif was C’s property manager at the time, when the case was ensued. He presented his witness statement and attended examination-in-chief. The judge should have considered his evidence under res gestae principle and admitted it. therefore, it is a fallacy of inferring that C could not establish his case. 

Ground No.9: Fallacy of inference:

Moreover, the judge based his final orders on the fallacious facts, which were circumstantial, disregarding sine qua non matters (mentioned above as grounds), which produces the red herring fallacy. 

Conclusion:

Therefore, for the above set grounds the court is invited to grant permission to allow appeal of the impugned judgement. 



INGRID ZAMAN

LINCOLNS CHAMBER

26.07.2022

Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Ground No.2: Judge erred in his deductions: 

 It is crystal clear that R3 had possession of property in dispute, then assertion that of complaint that accused persons forcibly dispossessed him from the house on the eventful day (26.06.2020-prior to filing of the complaint) is having serious doubts, it rather appears to be based upon concoction [Para.9: Line.11-19]

The admitted position of the falling of the suit property in joint Khata as well as admitted possession of the accused persons by the PW.2 and the report of SHO concerned prior to the filing of the instant complaint are the facts raise doubts upon the claim of the complainant that he was forcibly dispossessed by the accused persons on the day of occurrence before filing of the instant private complaint [Para.9- Line.19-28]

Claimant has failed to establish the fact that present accused persons have forcibly dispossessed him on 26.06.2020 [Para.10: Line.2-5]

S.3 IDA 2005 is meant for land grabbers and it is not meant for co-owners, co-sharer of land each of them claiming title to land in dispute. (relied on Mst. Zahida Nasreen v Additional Session Judge Sahiwal (2010 PCr. LJ 575 Lahore) & Abdul Hameed v Ghulam Farid (2016 PCr. LJ(N) 18 Lahore) [Para.9: Line. 28-36]

Ground No.4: judges wrong interpretation of Section 3:

The terms, grab, control, or occupy.

It is found that the petitioner/complainant failed to establish the moot point that he was illegally dispossessed by the hands of accused persons (R1,R2,R3), which is a Sine Qua Non under the Illegal Dispossession Act 2005 (IDA 2005) [Para.9: Line.5-9]

 Ground No.5: Judge did not apply Section 4: 

Ground No.6: Case took longer than usual (application of interest of justice fails)

Ground No.7 whether the alliance of respondents denote organized effort to dispossess Claimants:

Ground No.8: the Qualifying test for accused persons to be found guilty

Ground No.9 whether defence was sufficient to discharge the burden of proof:

Defence was that they never dispossessed rather complainant never had the possession of property in question [Para.6: Line.5-6]

Preliminary pray: 

Accused persons are land grabbers, who have illegally dispossessed him from the house/property in question [Para.5: Line.6]

The suit of specific performance of contract was filed by R3 and dismissed [Para.8: Line.18-21]

Whether Claimant had the Prior possession: 

As per submitted report of SHO P.S Zahirpir, called on at initial stage by my learned predecessor, the accused R1 was found in possession of the house in dispute, who had taken the same from R3 [Para.9: Line.1-5]

The PW.2 (M. Khalid) in his cross examination has also endorsed the fact that at the moment, when the complaint was filed, the disputed house was already in possession of the accused R3 [Para.9: Line.6-10]

It is an admitted position by the defendants or present complainant Malik Gul Zaman etc., in his pleadings, that the possession of the disputed house was with R3. [Para.8: Line.21-25]

The complainant could not bring on record as to whence the possession of house in question was in fact delivered [Para.8: Line.25-27]

Or obtained by the complainant after dismissal of the Civil Appeal (04.02.2020) filed by R3 against the decree (25.09.2016) in civil suit (Abdul Karim Tariq Shah v Mst. Bilqees Begum & Malik Gul Zaman etc.) [Para.8: Line.27-33]

The complainant in his deposition as PW.1 in Cross-Examination has admitted that he never filed any suit for recovery of possession against R3 in whole six years (since 2013-2020) [Para.8: Line.37-43]

Even complainant was not sure whether he had possession of the house in dispute prior to 1994 [Para.8: Line.43-45]

Claimant claims of house in question by his mother in late 1980’s [Para.8: Line 46-48]

It is also an astonishing fact that on one side the complainant claims that he himself witnessed the scene of delivery of possession by the accused Abdul Karim Tariq Shah in favour of accused Rashid Saeed, while on the same breath of his volunteer portion, he clarified the fact that Abdul Karim Tariq Shah was not present there at that time [Para.8: Line.53-60]

As per PW.1/ (Complainant), he was informed about the occurrence of forcible possession by one neighbour namely Ishaq [Para.8: Line.68-70]

The complainant did not bother to produce said Ishaq in the witness box to substantiate his version [Para.8: Line.71-72]

The complainant was not sure, whether the accused persons were armed with any kind of weapon at the time of his forcible dispossession by accused R1 and R2 [Para.8: Line.72-75]

Whether claimant has the prior ownership: 



Judged erred in inferring that property was the part of the joint Khata:

It is further an admitted position per record that the property in question falls within joint Khata, which fact, if required, would definitely be settled by the revenue department being the proper forum [Para.8: Line 49-53]

The agent of plaintiff, Iqbal Anwar, obtained accordingly the original general power of attorney duly attested by the office of the Foreign Affairs on 13-10-2020. The agent of plaintiff, Iqbal Anwar, duly informed the Defendant No. 4 about the receiving and availability of general power of attorney for necessary cordial formalities in order to consummate the bargain.

5.	That the Defendant No. 2 on 24-07-2020 being in connivance with the Defendant No. 4 prepared the forged and fabricated documents and thereby, fraudulently got transferred the plot of the plaintiff in his favour when the plaintiff was not in Pakistan. The Defendant No. 2 also fabricated the signature and thumb impression of the plaintiff with connivance of the Defendant No. 1 and maneuvered the record of the Society.

6.	That the plaintiff at the time of this alleged fraudulent and forged transaction was not available in Pakistan nor has received any single penny from the Defendants which fact could be proved by perusal of the passport data wherein the entry and exist data speaks volume that the fraudulent transaction was took place at the back and in the absence of the plaintiff. Defendant No. 1 under the statutory and legal obligation to maintain all kind of transparencies and gumminess of all acts and deeds required for further transfer of the plot in question as the valuable proprietary rights of the plaintiff were involved.

7	That alienation and transfer of plot in question is the result of fraud and misrepresentation for the reasons that the plaintiff did not appear in the office of defendant no 1 for the purposes. The plaintiff did not enter into any bargain with defendant no 2 and 3 and likewise, did not receive any amount towards the sale consideration of the plot in question. Thus the thumb impression and signature of the plaintiff on any paper and record were faked fictitious. 

8	That the alleged sale agreement dated 24-07-2020, alleged affidavit dated 24-07-2020 between the plaintiff and the defendant no 2 are fake and fictitious documents. The said sale agreement and affidavit regarding the plot in question were neither executed by the plaintiff nor signed by him. Likewise, the same did not bear the signature and thumb impression of the plaintiff. The defendants through these acts and deeds of fraud being in consultation with each other deprived the plaintiff from his proprietary rights of the plot in question. The ownership of defendants no 2 and 3 is a result of fraud and misrepresentation therefore do not create any invested right in their favour.      

9	That the defendant no 4 become disappeared and after lodging the FIR no 603/23 dated 26-02-2023 when appeared to be dubious which fact compelled the plaintiff’s attorney to approach the office of defendant no 1 society for the inspection of property record resultantly he filed an application in the society office on 20-03-2023 therefrom fraud was transpired. It further came into knowledge that the property was alienated fraudulently in the absence and back of the plaintiff. 

10	That the cause of action has been arisen in favour of plaintiff firstly when on 26-02-2023 he lodged a criminal case under section 420 PPC with PS Iqbal Town and secondly it accrued on 20-03-2023 when he applied for the certified copies of record in society office regarding plot in question and lastly  a week ago when the defendant flately refused to accede the ownership of plot in question of the plaintiff and the same is continuing.

11	that the property subject matter is situated in Islamabad the defendant no 1 office is at Islamabad the remaining defendants also reside in the local limits of Islamabad therefore this honorable Court has jurisdiction to decide the case .

12	That the valuation of the suit for the purposes of jurisdiction and court fee is fixed at 25,00,000/- since there is a case of a declaration and court fee of  Rs 15 is affixed accordingly and likewise Rs 5 is affixed for the purpose of consequential relief.



	In the above mentioned circumstances it is therefore, respectfully prayed that a declaratory decree may be passed in favour of plaintiff and against the defendants to the effect that the plaintiff is the lawful owner of the residential plot measuring 500 Sq. Yds. in Sector G-17/4, Islamabad vide Society Membership No. 912 as per provisional offer of allotment order dated 20-01-2004 in Supreme Court Employees Co-operative Housing Society.it is further prayed that a declaratory decree may be passed in favour of plaintiff and against the defendants to the effect that the further alienation of the plot in question may also please be declared illegal void ab ni tio based on fraud and having no adverse legal effect on the proprietary rights of plaintiff.

		It is further prayed that as a consequential relief decree for permanent and mandatory injunction may be passed in favour of plaintiff and against the defendants while directing them not to permanently interfere in the proprietary rights of the plaintiff regarding plot in question and a defendants may be directed not to handover and deliver the possession of the plot to anybody except plaintiff.





Any other relief to which this Honourable Court deems fit may also be granted.

IN THE COURT OF MUHAMMAD AFZAL RENT CONTROLLER LAHORE

In re: 

Ishtiaq Ahmad Etc. v Zulfiqar Ali Etc.



WRITTEN REPLY TO THE APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO SUBMISSION LIST OF WITNESSES AFTER THE ELAPSED OF STATUTORY PERIOD OF LIMITATION ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT/DEFENDANT

Respectfully Sheweth: 

PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

That the said suit is at Examination-in-Chief stage of proceedings. 

That Applicant/Plaintiff was contumacious in not presenting the certificate of readiness to produce evidence, along with a list of witnesses, whom he proposed to call either to give evidence or produce documents within stipulated time as prescribed by Order 16, Rule 1 of the CPC 1908, i.e., 07 days after the framing of issues. 

That Applicant’s/Plaintiff’s reason for dereliction from the said legal provision was that he misunderstood the meaning and/or did not understand the context of the concern legal provision of the CPC 1908.    

That the test to allow Applicant/Plaintiff to submit witnesses list in his support after the elapse of the prescribed period is provided in Order 16, Rule 2 CPC 1908, provides that ‘A party shall not be permitted to call witnesses other than those contained in the said list, except with the permission of the court; and after showing good cause for the omission of the said witnesses from the list; and if the court grants such permission, it shall record reasons for so doing.’

That it is provided in M. Anwar v Mst. Ilyas Begum (PLD 2013 SC 255) in para.10, that good cause is “legally sufficient reason or where judicial conscious of the court should be satisfied with justifiable reasons”, it was further provided in para.8 that “a party in default cannot as a matter of right or as a matter of course without assigning or establishing any good cause for the omission, asking for the calling or summoning or even producing the witness(es) only on account of a lame excuse/reason and a bald assertion that it shall be in the interest of justice and/or it shall facilitate the court in deciding the matter.”

That the reason for the request given by applicant/plaintiff is not justifiable in the eyes of law; which is ordained to be dismissed in judicial manner after judicial application of mind. In other words, applicant/plaintiff given a lame excuse/reason and a bald excuse that he did not understand the concerned provision and/or misunderstood the context of the said provision. Keeping the latter dicta in mind and in the light of para.15 of Amjad Khan v M. Irshad (2020 SCMR 2155), the court may close applicant’s/plaintiff’s right to present the witness list and suit may be dismissed for warrant of evidence or failure of prosecution to prove the case against the respondent/defendants.

That applicant/plaintiff were ordered on many occasions to produce the witnesses for Evidence-in-Chief, however, they were contumacious to follow the Honourable Court’s order and kept on protracting the lit. Now, it came to the light that why applicant/plaintiff did not submit the witness list within the prescribed period of 7 days, it is because they filed a malicious, frivolous, and vexatious claim to tangle respondent/defendant in to litigation for his detriment.     

That the burden to show why a request should be granted or an action excused, is on the litigant. Applicant/Plaintiff has not discharged his burden. Having no understanding or knowledge of a legal provision and/or misunderstanding a basic legal procedural provision makes the learned competent advocate negligent in carrying out his duties, which is an issue related to ethics of the profession. Therefore, the honourable may disregard the provided reason by applicant/plaintiff as a good cause to allow respondent/plaintiff to submit witness list after elapse of prescribed period of 7 days because it is unimaginable for a competent learned advocate to have no knowledge of a basic procedural requirement and its application.

That the application under reply is not supported by any affidavit, hence required to be dismissed.   

ON MERITS

That Paragraph 1 of the application under reply is correct to extent of proceedings’ stage. 

That Paragraph 2 of the application under reply is vehemently denied, the detailed reply has already been provided in the preceding paragraphs. 

That Paragraph 3 of the application under reply is denied, the detailed reply has already been provided in the preceding paragraphs. 

That paragraph 4 of the application under reply is legal, therefore requires no reply. 

It is provided in para.10 of M. Anwar case that “the court is not free to grant such permission as per its own whim and caprice and in arbitrary manner, rather it shall record the reasons for such a permission.” It in the absence of cogent reason the honourable court may not allow applicant/plaintiff to submit list of witnesses. The reason to misunderstanding the legal procedural provision by the stretch of the imagination cannot be equated with a cogent reasoning for such omission.     

PRAYER 

In the above circumstances, it is therefore respectfully prayed that as applicant/plaintiff did not provide a good cause for allowing his request to submit the list of witnesses, the application under reply may please be dismissed.

BACKGROUND

The claim arises out of personal Injury accident sustained on 23 October 2019 at approximately 6.30pm at work.

D is C’s employer company, approximately at 5pm, the branch manager employed by the D at its Retail Park store in Harrow, London, Mr Alan Simpson requested C to tidy up the plant pots and plants section in the outdoor garden centre at the store. When C went in to the area, there was some daylight, as the day light went down, she had some light from the nearby street lighting. [Pg.10:7] 

In October, it goes dark around 6.30pm as evidenced in the exhibit UB2. About that time, she decided to switch on the outdoor lights in the garden centre. [Pg.10:8]

The switch was located on the external walls of buildings at the two entrances to the outdoor garden centre. The flagstones were normally stacked in a corner of the outdoor garden centre, away from pedestrian pathways. [Pg.5:3]

The C claims that flagstone had been removed from a nearby shelf and placed in the middle of the pathway by a customer or member of staff. Therefore, the accident was caused by the D’s negligence as set out in POC. [Pg.2:2]

The D denies liability and alleges negligence on the part of C as set out in the defence. [Pg.5:4]

As a result of the accident C sustained personal injury (Colles fracture to her left dominant wrist, and associated soft tissue injury). [Pg.11:2]

C was unable to return to work for 10 weeks following the accident. [Pg.10:10]

The X ray shows satisfactory signs of healing, however, given the pain being experienced, it may be that some nerves have not yet healed. A minor surgical procedure is likely to resolve the pain. [Pg.12:10/2]



PRELIMINARY/PROCEDURAL POINTS

The substantial claim is related to personal injuries sustained at work. 

C has compiled with the requirement of giving 14 days’ notice to the D, as required by CPR r. 25.6(3)(a). 

An application for an interim remedy must be supported by evidence unless the court orders otherwise (r 25.3(2)).

C has satisfied the requirement of both CPR r. 25.6(3)(b) and 25BPD.2 in submitting the requisite evidence in support of this application.



THE LEGAL TEST 

The court has a discretion to make an interim payment if it is satisfied that:

C will obtain judgement at trial for a substantial amount of money: CPR, r. 25.7(1)(c). 

The sum sought by way of interim payment is not more than a reasonable proportion of the likely amount of the final judgement: CPR r. 25.7(4). 

The court must take in to account contributory negligence and any relevant set-off or counterclaim: CPR, r 25.7(5). 

C contends that the above conditions are satisfied on the balance of probabilities for the reasons set below.



SUBMISSIONS

WILL C OBTAIN JUDGEMENT AT TRIAL FOR A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY?

This depends on (a) liability and (b) the likely quantum of the claim. 

Liability

It is submitted that C will succeed, if the claim goes to trial for the following reasons: 

C complied with managers direction.

D failed to inspect the outdoor garden centre to ensure safety before assigning the job.

D did not assess the nature of job before assigning it to the C. 

If C took longer than usual to finish the job, the D’s manager did not check on her on time.

D did not take any action to remove the flagstones in the pathway in time, which became a hazard. 

D failed to ensure proper lighting in the outdoor garden centre. 

D did not regard for C’s safety and exposed her to unnecessary risk of injury. 



Contributory negligence:

C is not likely to have caused or contributed to the accident for the reasons set out above. If the court were to make a finding of contributory negligence, such a finding would be negligible. 



Quantum

It is submitted that C is likely to obtain a substantial award of damages at trial. Her damages fall in to three categories:

General damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity. 

Special damages to the date of the hearing, 

Future loss and expense. 

General damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity 

C suffered Colles fracture of the left dominant wrist and there was associated soft tissue injury. The wounds were clean and the fracture was reduced under general anaesthetic and held in place with the plate and screws. Full details of the treatment and prognosis are set out in the medical report of Mr Singh dated 4/January/2022: exhibit UB1. [Pg.11:1]

Based on the medical evidence available to date, C submits that an appropriate award of damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity is likely to be in region of £17,469.515. C relies on following authorities: 

 Judicial College Guidelines  16th Edition, Wrist Injuries, Section (H) (c): £12,590 to £24,500

C submits that based on the present medical evidence, the claim falls in the middle of this bracket. 

Grant v Highland Council, 2004 WL 3119728 

The court awarded £15,188.83 for injuring her left wrist with a reduction of 25% for contributory negligence (adjusted with Simmons v Castle uplift). 

Kennedy v Lees of Scotland Ltd, 1996 WL 1749426

The court awarded £19,750.20 for suffering a Colles fracture of the right, which was the dominant wrist, on full liability. (Adjusted for Heil v Rankin uplift and Simmons v Castle uplift) 



C contends that the case of Kennedy is an appropriate baseline comparator for the following reasons:

The type of injury is similar. 

The hospital treatment for both was by metal plate and screws. 

Both suffers pain after fracture was healed.

Both have suffered pain and require surgery after primary fracture healed. 

However, it is contended that C’s case lies above Grant and below Kennedy, falling between two cases cited above, as in the case of C: 

She came to work with within 10 weeks. 

She can perform her work until future operation. 



Special damages 

The current figure for special damages is £4,478.90 (excluding interest): Schedule of past loss and expense. 



Future Loss and Expense

The current figure for future loss and expense is £8,525.90

  

NO MORE THAN A REAOSNABLE PROPORTION OF THE LIKELY TOTAL AWARD

The total value of the claim is likely to be in the region of £30,474.315 (17,469.515 (general damages) + 4478.90 (special damages) + 8525.90 (future loss)). C submits that £10,000 is not more than a reasonable proportion of the likely total award of damages.

In addition, C submits that she requires further surgery to her wrist and this will delay the time when the claim can be tried until later this year. 

CONCLUSION

Therefore, C seeks an order for an interim payment in the sum of £10,000 or such other sum as the court shall think fit.

Respected SHO Zahirpir, 

It is stated that complainant is a resident of Zahipir and he owns the 3.5 Marlas, double story house on Plot No. 180/179, situated at Mauza Muhammad Khan Zahirpir Chachara Shareef Road. 

Mr Tariq Shah (respondent No.1) in connivance with his companions Mr Rashid Khan (respondent no.2) and Mr Shaheryar Jatt (respondent no.3) tried to sell complainant property. 

It can be proven by the theory that R3 had promised the C in presence of PW.2 and PW.3 to deliver the possession amicably, to which C agreed but R3 misused his trust (abuse of position of trust) to gain the time to illegally dispose of the property in connivance with Mr Murtaza; Mr Murtaza colluded with R1 and R2. Therefore, their complicity is undraped and C always had the constructive possession, however he was not in actual possession of the property.

It is submitted that R3 in collusion with Mr Ghulam Murtaza evidently sold legal rights to R1. R3, after the judgement in civil suit (25.09.2016) had apprehension that his legal right and actual possession in the disputed property, will be taken away by the court, therefore, to acquire maximum advantage of the disputed property and the position of trust, he evidently sold disputed property to Mr Murtaza. Mr Murtaza did not conduct reasonable conveyancing before ostensibly purchasing the disputed property papers (as in that period, it was under litigation, therefore could not be sold), on (31.12.2016), after the adverse judgement against R3 promulgated in the Civil suit on (25.09.2016) against R3, the proof is annexed as (Ex.PM). Further on, Mr Murtaza ostensibly sold the disputed property to R1, [it is evidenced in Ex.DA (copy of plaint in Rasheed v Ghulam Murtaza), Ex.DB (order from civil court-09.04.2022) and Ex.DC (application for temporary injunction)] in order to deter C from claiming actual possession, control, and occupancy of the disputed property. The reason for stating the latter theory is that R1 could deter C because R1 is a PTI party worker and holder of public office in government department, therefore have some influence over the governmental machinery.

R1 in an attempt to avoid facing criminal charges, Let the disputed property; installed R2 as the tenant in the property and acted as a legal owner, evidenced in initial police inquiry made on the request of predecessor judge; preliminary orders based on S 7 Illegal Dispossession Act 2005 (IDA 2005), and it could also be proven through Ex.PN (petition by R3) and Ex.DE (Petition by C). Thus, the collaboration of all the respondents to deter C from obtaining physical possession is writ large in C’s initial application, to which Court did not pay any or any sufficient attention. 

In summary, R3 lost the case in 2016, in fear of losing the possession of the disputed property and gaining maximum benefit from it, sold the legal rights to Mr Murtaza. Then ostensibly Mr Murtaza sold the disputed property to R1; evidently R1 installed R2 as tenant to avoid confrontation and criminal charges. In addition, R1 was the main person (master mind) who confronted C on 29.06.2020 with unknown men laden with weapons, evidenced in C’s private complaint under provision of IDA 2005. In addition, it was R3 who delivered the possession of the disputed property to the C in compliance with order of the court under section 7 IDA 2005. The court did not inquire from R1 about the latter situation. Therefore, the adequate contemplation or reasonable theory can only be that R1, R2, and R3 acted in Sophisticated and organised manner to illegally deter and dispossess C from the disputed property, which the court failed to contemplate in their judgement.

It is submitted that if FIR is not lodge at the earliest, it may cause an irremediable loss.

That on presentation of both the abovementioned cheques, the cheque No.CB01249213 dated 20.07.2016 of Rs.3,000,000/- stood honored. However, to the utter dismay of the Plaintiff, Cheque No.CB012349212 dated 16.01.2017, of Dubai Islamic Bank issued in the name of the Plaintiff by the Defendant for an amount of Rs.20,654,332/- stood dishonored on 17.01.2017 due to “Funds Insufficient”. 



(Copies of dishonor slips & Letter dated 19.01.2017 are attached herewith as Annexure “D”)



That upon intimation of dishonoring of cheque, the Plaintiff requested the Defendant for clearance of his outstanding amount but the Defendant paid no heed to the genuine requests of the Plaintiff. To the utter astonishment of the Plaintiff, a few days back, on demand of outstanding amounts, the Defendant flatly refused to pay the outstanding amount of Rs.20,654,332/-. Hence, this suit.



That the Defendant had dishonestly issued the abovementioned cheque with the intention to deceive the Plaintiff and to deprive him of his valuable rights.



That the cause of action firstly accrued in favor of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant upon execution of agreement dated 27.03.2014 & 28.03.2014 regarding sale purchase of the shares of the companies, secondly when the plaintiff and defendant entered into compromise agreements, thirdly, when the litigation started between the parties, fourthly, when cheque No. CB01249201 dated 03.06.2016 of defendant got dishonored,  fifthly, when defendant replaced the cheque No.CB01249213 dated 20.07.2016 of Rs.3,000,000/-  and Cheque No.CB012349212 dated 16.01.2017, of Dubai Islamic Bank issued in the name of the Plaintiff by the Defendant for an amount of Rs.20,654,332/-, sixthly, when cheque No. CB012349212 got dishonored, and finally when Defendant flatly refused repayment of outstanding amounts and is still accruing day by day.



That the cheque was handed over in Lahore, and the cheque was dishonored in Lahore, the Defendant resides in Lahore, and therefore this Honorable Court has got complete jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the instant matter. 



That for the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction the value of the suit is fixed at Rs.20,654,332/- (Pak Rupees Twenty Million and Six Hundred & Fifty Four Thousand Three Hundred Thirty Two Only)and requisite court fee has been affixed. 

P R A Y E R 

Under the above mentioned circumstances it is most respectfully prayed that a Decree of Recovery of Rs.20,654,332/-(Pak Rupees Twenty Million and Six Hundred & Fifty Four Thousand Three Hundred Thirty Two Only) may kindly be passed in favor of the Plaintiff against the Defendant along with interest.

It is further prayed that Property bearing House No.136-U Block, DHA, Lahore, owned and possessed by the Defendant, may kindly be attached before judgment till the realization of claimed amount of Rs.20,654,332/- in the titled suit. 

Any other relief that this Honorable Court deems fit may also be granted to the Plaintiff.

Muhammad Asfand Yar Khan and Another



VERSUS



M/s Pak Hamalia Salt Impex (Pvt.) Limited, etc.



APPLICATION UNDER ORDER XXXIX, RULE IV OF CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE FOR VACATION OF STAY ORDER DATED 22.06.2017



Respectfully Submitted:



That the captioned Intra Court Appeal is pending adjudication before this Honorable Court in which a stay has been granted by this Honorable Court on 22.06.2017.



That the captioned appeal itself is not maintainable as proviso to Section 3(2) of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972, bars remedy of intra court appeal in cases where the relevant law provided the remedy of appeal, revision or review. The actions that were impugned in Writ Petition No.40144/17 filing of Forms A&29 for the Years 2015 & 2016 by the Appellants on the basis of alleged unenforceable Agreement dated 26.01.2015 and subsequent entertaining of the said Forms by the Respondent No.3. As per the relevant law, the alternate remedy against the orders of Registrar SECP (Respondent No.3) is available in the form of revision under Section 484 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984. Even otherwise, the Appellants themselves state that Registrar had already passed an order, and following this stance, the alternate remedy is revision as stated above. Hence, the captioned Intra Court Appeal itself being not maintainable, any consequential relief thereof is nullity in the eyes of law. Therefore, the order dated 22.06.2017 is liable to be vacated.



That order dated 22.06.2017 has been obtained through fraud and misrepresentation as the Appellants wrongly stated that decision has already been made by the Registrar (Respondent No.3). In fact no such decision was available on record and that is why Honorable Single Bench sent the petition to Respondent No.3 to decide the same in accordance with law as the Registrar had every power to decide. Thenceforth the consequential relief dated 22.06.2017 is outcome of misrepresentation and ought to be set aside/vacated.







That admittedly the Appellants were never members of the Respondent Company as evident from the paragraphs No.4, 5 and 8 of CO No.16/2017 filed by the Appellants themselves. For clarity, the same are reproduced as under:



“4. … it is important to mention here that as a result of the agreement and purchase and lying shares by the Petitioners, the Petitioners under the law have the fundamental right to be incorporated as a chief executive officer and director of the company before SECP since 2015 and in this respect, the respondent No.3&4 were duty bound to get incorporated the name of the Petitioner No.1 as chief executive officer of the company and the name of the petitioner as one of the director in addition to Nizam-Ud-Din Ahmad & Shagufta Anjum/respondents No.3&4…



5. ….that after the execution of the agreement, Nizam-Ud-Din Ahmad and Shagufta Anum/Respondents No.3&4 did not fulfill their obligations which cast upon them by the execution of agreement and did not submit the requisite form for changing of the shares in 2015 & 2016 respectively… 



… as per the Memorandum of Articles & Association of the Company, the elections of the Company should have held on 30.09.2016 but the same was not held because of malafide and malicious intent on the part of the Respondents No.3&4…



8. That when the respondents No.3&4 were not honoring the terms and conditions of the agreement regarding the transfer of shares and were not submitting the requisite form in SECP and even did not hold the election, the Appellants immediately submitted Form-A according to the agreement on 27.02.2017 with SECP for the purpose of incorporation of their names as chief executive officer and one of the director of the company respectively and also to place the shares of the Petitioners in its record as per the Companies Ordinance 1984…”





Perusal of the above makes it crystal clear that the Appellants are neither members of the Respondent Company nor are they director/chief executive officer of the Respondent Company since they were never admitted by the Board of Directors as members of the Respondent Company. Furthermore, said actions of the Appellants are clearly in violation of Section 187(h) of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, as the both the Appellants are not members of the Respondent Company and are ineligible to become directors. Hence, the order dated 22.06.2017 is liable to be vacated. 



That even otherwise, a chief executive officer of a company is appointed under Section 199 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984. Admittedly no elections had taken place and therefore, the post of Chief Executive Officer as claimed by the Appellants, cannot exist in law without fulfilling the requirements of Section 199 of the Companies Ordinance 1984.



That failure on part of the Respondent No.3 to acknowledge the legal requirements of filing of Form-A&29, i.e., annual general meeting and elections, in question and merely accepting the same on the basis of rescinded agreement dated 26.01.2015, is illegal, void and against the procedural law, therefore acts of omission and commission on the part of the Respondent No.3 whereby they are trying to justify the failure to perform their legal duties towards the Respondents No.1&2 by way of taking Forms A&29 from unrelated persons is illegal, ultravires the law and the Constitution, and being devoid of any legal mandate and justification and is liable to be declared as such.



That as per Section 173(3) of the Companies Ordinance, every general meeting of the company in respect of the proceedings whereof the minutes have been made shall be deemed to have been duly called and held, and all the proceedings which have taken place there at, and all the appointments made through the said proceedings shall be deemed to be valid unless the contrary is proved. Admittedly, the Appellants were never members of the Respondent Company and no AGM was ever held for change of directorship. No shares were being offered for sale to the Respondent Company by the alleged shareholders nor to any other member of the Respondent Company. All the illegal activities are being based on one rescinded agreement dated 26.01.2015 without following any legal requirements as ordained by the provisions of the Companies Ordinances, 1984, makes the actions and inactions of the Respondent No.3 highly objectionable. Henceforth the order dated 22.06.2017 is liable to be vacated.



That under the provisions of Section 468 of the Companies Ordinance, upon filing of a document/return, etc., the Registrar may either require a company to file the revised document, if the submitted document/return is defective and/or if the same is not in conformity with the law or the Registrar may refuse to accept the document if it is not filed in the revised form. The Respondent No.3 made no intimation regarding rejection of alleged Forms filed by Appellants who are themselves not members of the Respondent Company and had taken them on record in negation of the provisions of the Companies Ordinance, 1984.



That even otherwise, the allegation of transfer of shares is itself against the Articles of Associations of the Respondent Company, as the same was not possible without prior approval of the board of directors of the Company. It is pointed out that the alleged agreement dated 26.01.2015 was between the parties inter se and not the Company. As per Article 11 of the Articles of Association:



“No share can be mortgaged, pledged, sold, hypothecated, transferred or disposed off by any member to a non-member without the previous sanction of the Board of Directors”



Hence, the order dated 22.06.2017 is liable to be vacated.



Notwithstanding to what has been stated above, the entire actions and inactions of Respondent No.3 are tainted with malice in connivance with the Appellants. The Appellants themselves state in their appeal that no notices were issued to the Appellants regarding the subject writ petition which creates a serious doubt as to how the Appellants came to know about the impugned order or the fact of filing of the subject writ petition. In fact, when the Respondents No.1&2 obtained directions from this Honorable Court, the order was intimated to the Respondent No.3 and accordingly it was requested that hearing be fixed for decision. The Respondent No.3, with ulterior motive and malafide intentions, showing its biased and influenced nature, informed the Appellants about the directions so received from this Honorable Court, and in the meantime, intimated the Respondents No.1&2 that hearing was fixed on 29.06.2017, which was beyond the directions of this Honorable Court. The Respondents No.1&2 accordingly raised objections, and when on 29.06.2017 attended the hearing, the order dated 22.06.2017 was handed over to the said Respondents. This clearly shows that Respondent No.3 deliberately intimated the Appellants beforehand and deliberately fixed the date of hearing for a lengthy time breaching the directions of this Honorable Court, just to persuade and benefit and take sides with the Appellants. This Honorable Court ought to take notice of such illegal activities of Respondent No.3 and take appropriate measures against Respondent No.3. Copies of the correspondences are attached. 

 

That the order dated 22.06.2017 passed by this Honorable Court is against the principles of natural justice “Audi Alterem Partem” and this Honorable Court did not hear the applicant/respondent while granting stay order.



That the need for urgency for filing the instant application arose in lieu of exploration license to be granted by Director General of Mines and Minerals Punjab, as the answering Respondents have to submit certain documents within the prescribed limit which is about to expire.



That if the order dated 22.06.2017 is not vacated, the Respondents No.1&2 are bound to suffer irreparable loss and damage.





PRAYER



Under the aforementioned circumstances, it is most humbly and respectfully prayed that the order dated 22.06.2017 may very kindly be vacated in the interest of justice and fair play.

The actions that were impugned in Writ Petition No.40144/17 filing of Forms A&29 for the Years 2015 & 2016 by the Appellants on the basis of alleged unenforceable Agreement dated 26.01.2015 and subsequent entertaining of the said Forms by the Respondent No.3. As per the relevant law, the alternate remedy against the orders of Registrar SECP (Respondent No.3) is available in the form of revision under Section 484 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984. Even otherwise, the Appellants themselves state that Registrar had already passed an order, and following this stance, the alternate remedy is revision as stated above. Hence, the captioned Intra Court Appeal itself being not maintainable, any consequential relief thereof is nullity in the eyes of law. Therefore, the order dated 22.06.2017 is liable to be vacated.



That order dated 22.06.2017 has been obtained through fraud and misrepresentation as the Appellants wrongly stated that decision has already been made by the Registrar (Respondent No.3). In fact no such decision was available on record and that is why Honorable Single Bench sent the petition to Respondent No.3 to decide the same in accordance with law as the Registrar had every power to decide. Thenceforth the consequential relief dated 22.06.2017 is outcome of misrepresentation and ought to be set aside/vacated.







That admittedly the Appellants were never members of the Respondent Company as evident from the paragraphs No.4, 5 and 8 of CO No.16/2017 filed by the Appellants themselves. For clarity, the same are reproduced as under:



“4. … it is important to mention here that as a result of the agreement and purchase and lying shares by the Petitioners, the Petitioners under the law have the fundamental right to be incorporated as a chief executive officer and director of the company before SECP since 2015 and in this respect, the respondent No.3&4 were duty bound to get incorporated the name of the Petitioner No.1 as chief executive officer of the company and the name of the petitioner as one of the director in addition to Nizam-Ud-Din Ahmad & Shagufta Anjum/respondents No.3&4…



5. ….that after the execution of the agreement, Nizam-Ud-Din Ahmad and Shagufta Anum/Respondents No.3&4 did not fulfill their obligations which cast upon them by the execution of agreement and did not submit the requisite form for changing of the shares in 2015 & 2016 respectively… 



… as per the Memorandum of Articles & Association of the Company, the elections of the Company should have held on 30.09.2016 but the same was not held because of malafide and malicious intent on the part of the Respondents No.3&4…



8. That when the respondents No.3&4 were not honoring the terms and conditions of the agreement regarding the transfer of shares and were not submitting the requisite form in SECP and even did not hold the election, the Appellants immediately submitted Form-A according to the agreement on 27.02.2017 with SECP for the purpose of incorporation of their names as chief executive officer and one of the director of the company respectively and also to place the shares of the Petitioners in its record as per the Companies Ordinance 1984…”





Perusal of the above makes it crystal clear that the Appellants are neither members of the Respondent Company nor are they director/chief executive officer of the Respondent Company since they were never admitted by the Board of Directors as members of the Respondent Company. Furthermore, said actions of the Appellants are clearly in violation of Section 187(h) of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, as the both the Appellants are not members of the Respondent Company and are ineligible to become directors. Hence, the order dated 22.06.2017 is liable to be vacated. 



That even otherwise, a chief executive officer of a company is appointed under Section 199 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984. Admittedly no elections had taken place and therefore, the post of Chief Executive Officer as claimed by the Appellants, cannot exist in law without fulfilling the requirements of Section 199 of the Companies Ordinance 1984.



That failure on part of the Respondent No.3 to acknowledge the legal requirements of filing of Form-A&29, i.e., annual general meeting and elections, in question and merely accepting the same on the basis of rescinded agreement dated 26.01.2015, is illegal, void and against the procedural law, therefore acts of omission and commission on the part of the Respondent No.3 whereby they are trying to justify the failure to perform their legal duties towards the Respondents No.1&2 by way of taking Forms A&29 from unrelated persons is illegal, ultravires the law and the Constitution, and being devoid of any legal mandate and justification and is liable to be declared as such.



That as per Section 173(3) of the Companies Ordinance, every general meeting of the company in respect of the proceedings whereof the minutes have been made shall be deemed to have been duly called and held, and all the proceedings which have taken place there at, and all the appointments made through the said proceedings shall be deemed to be valid unless the contrary is proved. Admittedly, the Appellants were never members of the Respondent Company and no AGM was ever held for change of directorship. No shares were being offered for sale to the Respondent Company by the alleged shareholders nor to any other member of the Respondent Company. All the illegal activities are being based on one rescinded agreement dated 26.01.2015 without following any legal requirements as ordained by the provisions of the Companies Ordinances, 1984, makes the actions and inactions of the Respondent No.3 highly objectionable. Henceforth the order dated 22.06.2017 is liable to be vacated.



That under the provisions of Section 468 of the Companies Ordinance, upon filing of a document/return, etc., the Registrar may either require a company to file the revised document, if the submitted document/return is defective and/or if the same is not in conformity with the law or the Registrar may refuse to accept the document if it is not filed in the revised form. The Respondent No.3 made no intimation regarding rejection of alleged Forms filed by Appellants who are themselves not members of the Respondent Company and had taken them on record in negation of the provisions of the Companies Ordinance, 1984.



That even otherwise, the allegation of transfer of shares is itself against the Articles of Associations of the Respondent Company, as the same was not possible without prior approval of the board of directors of the Company. It is pointed out that the alleged agreement dated 26.01.2015 was between the parties inter se and not the Company. As per Article 11 of the Articles of Association:



“No share can be mortgaged, pledged, sold, hypothecated, transferred or disposed off by any member to a non-member without the previous sanction of the Board of Directors”



Hence, the order dated 22.06.2017 is liable to be vacated.



Notwithstanding to what has been stated above, the entire actions and inactions of Respondent No.3 are tainted with malice in connivance with the Appellants. The Appellants themselves state in their appeal that no notices were issued to the Appellants regarding the subject writ petition which creates a serious doubt as to how the Appellants came to know about the impugned order or the fact of filing of the subject writ petition. In fact, when the Respondents No.1&2 obtained directions from this Honorable Court, the order was intimated to the Respondent No.3 and accordingly it was requested that hearing be fixed for decision. The Respondent No.3, with ulterior motive and malafide intentions, showing its biased and influenced nature, informed the Appellants about the directions so received from this Honorable Court, and in the meantime, intimated the Respondents No.1&2 that hearing was fixed on 29.06.2017, which was beyond the directions of this Honorable Court. The Respondents No.1&2 accordingly raised objections, and when on 29.06.2017 attended the hearing, the order dated 22.06.2017 was handed over to the said Respondents. This clearly shows that Respondent No.3 deliberately intimated the Appellants beforehand and deliberately fixed the date of hearing for a lengthy time breaching the directions of this Honorable Court, just to persuade and benefit and take sides with the Appellants. This Honorable Court ought to take notice of such illegal activities of Respondent No.3 and take appropriate measures against Respondent No.3. Copies of the correspondences are attached. 

 

That the order dated 22.06.2017 passed by this Honorable Court is against the principles of natural justice “Audi Alterem Partem” and this Honorable Court did not hear the applicant/respondent while granting stay order.



That the need for urgency for filing the instant application arose in lieu of exploration license to be granted by Director General of Mines and Minerals Punjab, as the answering Respondents have to submit certain documents within the prescribed limit which is about to expire.



That if the order dated 22.06.2017 is not vacated, the Respondents No.1&2 are bound to suffer irreparable loss and damage.

BEFORE THE ADDITIONAL DISTRICT COLLECTOR(R), LAHORE



In Re:



In

Bank of Punjab

Vs.

The Patwari Mouza Ichra/Syed Bhais Pvt Ltd 

Objection/Arguments on Implementation of Consent Decree in the Revenue Record on behalf of Faysal Bank Limited  

Brief Facts of the Case: 

M/s Syed Bhais Pvt Ltd (judgment debtors) are also customer of the Faysal Bank Limited and availed various finance facilities which have been enhanced/renewed/restructured from time to time.



To secure the finance facilities availed from M/s Faysal Bank Ltd, the M/s Syed Bhais Pvt Ltd had created equitable mortgage charge on the following property which was also from time to time modified. 



“All that piece and parcel of land measuring 99 Kanal 18 Marlas 183 Sq.ft comprising in Khasra No. 14355/13751/7133, 7200, 14362/7201, 14363/7201 situated at Mouza Ichra, 200 Ferozpur Road, Lahore together with all plant machinery installed, structures, buildings amenities, easements, fixtures, fittings and appurtenances whatsoever”.



The equitable mortgage was also mutated in the revenue record vide mutation no.8474. 



Faysal Bank Ltd had also joint parri passu charge over fixed and current assets, plant and machinery along with the Decree holder bank (BOP) and all other parri passu holder banks.



Faysal Bank Ltd, other pari passu holder banks and BOP (decree holder bank) also executed inter creditors security sharing agreement dated 31-07-2006 whereby it was agreed that the security can be enforced by the banks jointly or by any or each of them for the benefit of all the banks. At annex C.



On default Faysal Bank Ltd filed a suit for recovery of Rs. 924,569,716.19/-(Rupees Nine Hundred Twenty Four Million Five Hundred Sixty Nine Thousand Seven Hundred Sixteen and Nineteen Paisa Only), titled “Faysal Bank Limited Vs Syed Bhais Private Limited & others” bearing Civil Original Suit No.61/2015, which is pending adjudication before Honorable Lahore High Court Lahore wherein petition for leave to appear and defend (PLA) has already been filed by M/s Syed Bhais Pvt Ltd. At annex D



BOP filed suit but intentionally has not made the Faysal Bank Ltd as party in their suit 17-B/2012, therefore the Faysal Bank Ltd could not know the proceedings. BOP obtained consent Decree on the basis of settlement.  



it is in well knowledge of the BOP that the property of the M/s Syed Bhais Pvt Ltd which has been desired to be mutated in favor of BOP is also mortgaged with the Faysal Bank Ltd and having joint pari passu charge upon the mortgaged property. 



BOP have filed Fard Taleeqa in Hon, ble Lahore High Court, Lahore in execution petition wherein he has categorically admitted and mentioned that alonwith BOP, the Faysal Bank Ltd and other banks have joint pari passu charge on the mortgaged property of the M/s Syed Bhais Pvt Ltd. At annex E



BOP in instant petition has demanded mutation of land measuring 29-Kanals & 06-Marlas(29.03Kanals) according to pro rata base out of total land measuring 98-Kanals 10-Marlas & 96-Sq.ft in favor of BOP on the basis of Judgment & decree 25.09.2014.

Objection 

Mortgage property having joint pari passu charge of the Faysal Bank Ltd and other creditors banks, therefore the Faysal Bank Ltd and other creditors banks have charge on every inch of the mortgage property, therefore the EXCLUSIVE portion of mortgage property cannot be mutated/transferred in favor of the BOP (decree holder bank) without the consent of the Faysal Bank Ltd as well as other creditors banks in lieu of decree passed in favor of BOP decree holder bank. 



The subject matter was arose on default of Syed Bhais Pvt Ltd of the finance facilities extended by the BOP, as this matter falls under jurisdiction of Banking Court under the Financial Institution (Recovery and Finances) Ordinance 2001, therefore the BOP opted to file recovery suit in Lahore High Court Lahore (Banking Jurisdiction), upon decree of the said suit the BOP filed execution petition No.33-B-16 which is pending before Hon ble Lahore High Court Lahore. Hence this Hon, lbe Court has no jurisdiction on the matter as the same is sub-judice before Hon, lbe Lahore High Court Lahore in execution of the Judgment and decree dated 25.09.2014 (Annex at F). This factum is held in 2008 CLD 742: 



“No court other than banking court exercised jurisdiction with respect to any matter to which jurisdiction of Banking Court extend under Financial Institution (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance 2001”



As per terms of settlement agreement dated 31.03.2014 which is made part of the consent decree dated 25.09.2014, it is agreed between parties that after obtaining NOC from other creditors the Syed Bhias (Pvt) Ltd will transfer the portion of properties. This factum is also mentioned BOP in its prayer clause in its execution petition No.33/2016 annex-F at page 92 of our objection petition.



Relevant prayer clause of BOP execution petition at page as under:

	“It is humbly submitted that this Hon ble court was pleased to pass consent decree 25.09.2014 in favor of the Decree Holder (BOP) and against the judgment debtors (Syed Bhais Pvt ltd, However judgment debtors have committed default of the aforesaid consent Decree 25.09.2014 and have failed to transfer land measuring 29-Kanals & 06Marlas (29.03 Kanls)(Comprising of Units) having proportionate share 131850/443346 out total land measuring 98K-10M-96Sq.ft& 96Sq.ft (98.25-Kanals)comprising khasra Numbers 14355/13751/7133/7200, 14362/7201, 14363/7201 of Register Khasra Amarti for the year 1984-85for village Ichra Lahore in favor of the Bank (BOP) after obtaining NOC from other creditors, in terms settlement Agreement dated 31.03.2014 made part of the said consent Decree dated 25.09.14.

     

Further as per clause 10 of the settlement agreement it is agreed between parties that adjustment of liability through swap transaction shall be restored if the other joint pari passu charge holder do not agree to allocated portion for land as enclosed map. 



The relevant clause 10 of Settlement Agreement as under:



“It is agreed between parties that liability adjustment through swap shall be liable to be restored in following circumstances



-If the customer fails to buy back the property within the agreed period 

-If the property becomes unsaleable due to any reason whatsoever

-If the other JPP charge holders do not agree to allocated portion for land as per enclosed map.



Its is crystal clear from above that on the one hand BOP demanding transfer portion of land unilaterally without obtaining NOC from others creditors whereas on the other hand BOP itself admitting  that the said portion of property has to transfer to BOP after obtaining NOC from other creditors/charge holders. Hence the claim of the BOP is self-contradictory, false and frivolous liable to be dismissed.



If without the consent of the Faysal Bank Ltd the portion of the mortgage property is mutated/transferred in favor of the BOP decree holder bank, the Faysal Bank Ltd is bound to suffer irreparable loss.



Under the circumstances it is therefore most respectfully prayed that the application of the BOP may kindly be dismissed in the interest of justice and fair play. 



It is further prayed that without the consent of the applicant and other charge holder banks the portion of the mortgage property may kindly not be mutated/transferred to the decree holder bank.



Any other relief which this Hon’ble Court deem fit may also be granted.

ORDER

 

ARSHAD NOOR KHAN, J.---Learned counsel for the plaintiff in support of present application has contended that on 4-12-2006 his son was operated in Liaqat National Hospital, therefore because of such severe and chronic illness of his son, he could not attend the Court and suit was dismissed in default, therefore, the absence' on his part was not wilful nor deliberate but was on account of chronic illness of his son, as such order dated 4-12-2006 may be recalled.

 

Mr. Arif Khan, advocate for defendant No.2 vehemently opposed the contention advanced by the learned counsel for the plaintiff and has contended that the plaintiff and his counsel are duty bound to remain present in Court and they have not fulfilled their obligations, therefore, the order was rightly passed by the Court whereby dismissing their suit.

 

I have considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the material available before me.

 

A perusal of the order dated 4-12-2006 shows that the plaintiff and his counsel were called absent on that day till 1.00 p.m. therefore the application was dismissed in default for non-prosecution.

 

The suit was dismissed on 4-9-2006 in default for non-prosecution, however, on that day the plaintiff was not required to fulfil any obligation on his part nor he had to make any compliance and the suit was fixed for filing of written statement by defendants Nos. 1 to 4. The record also shows that defendants Nos. 1 to 4 were also called absent on that day and at the most order regarding ex parte proceedings against defendants Nos.1 to 4 should have been passed instead of dismissing the suit in default for non-prosecution. The dismissal of the suit for non-prosecution is, therefore, an act of the Court, for which parties could not be penalized.

 

In view of the aforesaid. circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that the suit of the plaintiff could not be dismissed in default for non-prosecution and the order regarding ex­parte proceedings against defendants Nos.1 to 4 had to pass. Application is therefore, allowed, as prayed and order dated 4-12-2006 is hereby recalled. The suit is restored to its original stage when it was dismissed in default on 4-12-2006.

 

H.B.T./A-45/K                                                                                    Application allowed.
