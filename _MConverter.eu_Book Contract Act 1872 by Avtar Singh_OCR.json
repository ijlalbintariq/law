Preface
The Contract Act, 1872 provides the legal framework for formulation of
trade, business and commercial relations and transactions in which contract
is involved. It has completed its history of 144 years. The provisions of the
Act and principles enshrined therein and the application of such principles
by the courts to enormous and ever changing fact-situations constitute the
body of the Law of Contract of the country.
The court decisions provide the basic source material of development of
this subject and also for finding out the recent trends, some of the important
rulings of the period between the present and preceding editions are to be
seen in the following areas of the subject: A contract means bilateral rela-
tions, not just only unilateral. But exceptionally, one of the parties may be
given the right to do things unilaterally, e.g., a banker was given the right
to appoint an arbitrator all by himself under the loan arrangement. This
special position may be allowed to protect the interest of lending bankers.
An agreement entered into by the e-mail process has binding effect,
though not signed by parties. Some new decisions have been delivered on
withdrawal of bids. No bidder can insist that his bid should be accepted
because it is the lowest. All that he can say is that there should be no bias,
and there should be fairness, in the decision-making process. The mere
deposit of 20 per cent of the bid amount does not make the bidder owner of
the property. He has to wait for approval of his bid. Letters of intent that the
tender would be accepted does not have binding effect either way. A contrac-
tor can be blacklisted only because of grave misperformance of the contract,
not because of his impropriety at the stage of bids or tenders.
No binding obligation emerges on the part of the Government where the
contract is in conflict with constitutional provisions. Where the owner of
land had enjoyed considerable benefits after his land was freed from acqui-
sition and before it was transferred to the Government for school making
purpose without price, he was not allowed to assail the transaction by say-
ing that it was without consideration. Mortgage in favour of a minor is void
ab initio. Alienation by de facto guardian of minor's land was reversible
at the instance of the minor on attaining majority and the price paid was
[VII]

VIII Law of Contract
recoverable from the guardian and not the minor. Beneficial rights under
the Employees' State Insurance Act cannot be contracted out. Controllers
of Cricket cannot have an interest in the events organised by the Board. It is
something awfully against public policy.
Restraint upon a former employee as a ladies hairdresser from practising
the same profession for 12 months and within half a mile of the employer's
place has been held to be reasonable. An arbitration agreement restraining
parties from approaching court over the same issue has been held to be not
opposed to public policy or being in restraint of trade. A Lok Adalat is not a
court. Restrictions upon jurisdiction are not applicable to it. A contract for
CCTV services at Railway stations which happen to display vulgar material
was terminated. The forfeit of the whole of his deposit money might be ruin-
ous to him whereas the Railway's loss was not of monetary nature.
A bank guarantee was not allowed to be encashed because the Authority
had made good its losses otherwise. The controversial point whether the
surety alone be allowed to be sued without touching the principal debtor
though the latter is in possession of means which comfortably enable him to
pay, continues to engage attention of the courts. The right to encash a bank
guarantee was held to have been lost when the contract had expired without
encashment of the bank guarantee. Pledgee's right for his dues prevails over
all other rights and claims. If an LIC agent does not deposit the amount
received by him from the insured, LIC has to bear the consequences.
Privity of contract is necessary for seeking specific performance. A con-
tract requiring a retrospective date for execution was held to be not specif-
ically enforceable. Specific enforcement cannot be claimed against a person
who is devoid of title or any right to transfer: Nemo dat quod non habet. A
person who becomes entitled to specific performance also becomes entitled
to an injunction to prevent the other party from dealing with the property
in any manner whatsoever.
All these and many more rulings have been absorbed into the text at their
appropriate places.

2 Chapter 1 Agreement, Contract and Proposal
[S. 2]
4[***]Nothing herein contained shall affect the provisions of any Statute, Act
or Regulation not hereby expressly repealed, nor any usage or custom of trade,
nor any incident of any contract, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.
S. 2. Interpretation clause.-In this Act the following words and expres-
sions are used in the following senses, unless a contrary intention appears from
the context:-
(a) When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain
from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to
such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal;
(b) When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent
thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted,
becomes a promise;
(c) The person making the proposal is called the "promisor", and the person
accepting the proposal is called the "promisee";
(d) When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person
has done or abstained from doing or does or abstains from doing, or
promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or absti-
nence or promise is called a consideration for the promise; [Notes under
Chap. 3 on consideration]
(e) Every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for
each other, is an agreement; [Notes under consideration]
(f) Promises which form the consideration or part of the consideration for
each other, are called reciprocal promises; [Notes under consideration]
(g) An agreement not enforceable by law is said to be void; [Notes under
Section 23 void agreements]
(h) An agreement enforceable by law is a contract;
(An agreement which is enforceable by law at the option of one or more
of the parties thereto, but not at the option of the other or others, is a
voidable contract; [see Notes under Sections 19 to 19-A]
(j) A contract which ceases to be enforceable by law becomes void when it
ceases to be enforceable. [For notes see under Section 56]
DEFINITION OF CONTRACT
The term "contract" is defined in Section 2(b) of the Indian Contract
Act, 1872, as follows: "An agreement enforceable by law is a contract."
Thus for the formation of a contract there must be―(1) an agreement,
and (2) the agreement should be enforceable by law.
4. The words "the enactments mentioned in the Schedule hereto are repealed to the extent spec-
ified in the third column thereof; but" were repealed by S. 3 and Sch. II of the Repealing and
Amending Act, 1914 (X of 1914).
5. Bharti Airtel Ltd v Union of India, (2015) 12 SCC 1, a licence to provide telecom service is a
contract between the licensee and Government of India, the licensor.

[S. 10]
Agreement
Definition of contract 3
"Agreement" is defined in Section 2(e) as "every promise and every set
of promises forming the consideration for each other". And a promise
is defined as an accepted proposal. Section 2(b) says: "A proposal, when
accepted, becomes a promise." This is another way of saying that an agree-
ment is an accepted proposal. The process of definitions comes down to
this: A contract is an agreement; an agreement is a promise and a promise is
an accepted proposal. Thus every agreement, in its ultimate analysis, is the
result of a proposal from one side and its acceptance by the other."
When agreement becomes contract
An agreement is regarded as a contract when it is enforceable by law." In
other words, an agreement that the law will enforce is a contract. The con-
ditions of enforceability are stated in Section 10. According to this section,
an agreement is a contract when it is made for some consideration, between
parties who are competent, with their free consent and for a lawful object.
S. 10. What agreements are contracts.-All agreements are contracts if
they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful
consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared
to be void.
Nothing herein contained shall affect any law in force in "[India] and not
hereby expressly repealed, by which any contract is required to be made in
writing or in the presence of witnesses, or any law relating to the registration
of documents.
6. An arrangement for sale of goods which imposed no obligations on the part of the purchaser
and was not even signed by him was held to be no agreement. It must have been a mere
understanding. There being no mutuality, the purchaser could not ask for the remedy of spe-
cific enforcement under S. 15, Specific Relief Act, 1963; S.M. Gopal Chetty v Raman, AIR
1998 Mad 169. Every agreement has not to be in writing. It must be bilateral, Tarsem Singh
v Sukhminder Singh, (1998) 3 SCC 471: AIR 1998 SC 1400. Writing is necessary only when
prescribed by law, T.N. Tea Plantation Corpn Ltd v Srinivasa Timbers, AIR 1999 Mad 111.
Conrad Dias v Joseph Dias, (1996) 2 Mah LJ 208: (1995) 3 Bom CR 218, oral agreement
between father and son for tenancy. Asudamal Laxmandas Sindhi v Kisanrao Wamanrao
Dharmale, (2004) 2 Bom CR 361, an agreement for sale of land does not require to be an
attested document. It was an agricultural land and the purchaser was not a farmer. His suit
for specific enforcement was allowed because it was his problem to get necessary approvals.
7. S. 2(b). Mohta Alloy & Steel Works v Mohta Finance & Leasing Co Ltd, 1987 AIHC 1327
(Del), a lease agreement between two bodies corporate was signed by one only, representing
both sides because he was a director in both the legal entities. Held valid. K. Basavarajappa v
Tax Recovery Commr, (1996) 11 SCC 632, an agreement to sell does not create any right or
interests in the property under sale. R. Rangaraj v Legal Representatives, 2000 AIHC 2206,
agreement signed by the very party who had to sell the land, valid for specific enforcement.
Randhir Singh Chandolk v Vipin Bansal, (2006) 135 DLT 56, under an oral arrangement of
sale of property, the receipt for money was signed by the seller, the court said that the law did
not prohibit a written offer of sale signed by the seller being accepted orally by the buyer.
8. Subs. by S. 3 and Schedule of Act 3 of 1951 for the words "Part A States, and Part C States"
which have been substituted by the A.O. 1950 for "the Provinces".

4 Chapter 1 Agreement, Contract and Proposal
[S. 10]
Every contract is an agreement, but every agreement is not a contract. An
agreement becomes a contract when the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) There is some consideration for it. [Ss. 2(d) and 25]
(2) The parties are competent to contract.' [Ss. 11 and 12]
(3) Their consent is free. [Ss. 13-22]
(4) Their object is lawful.10 [Ss. 23-30]
Bilateral relation, not unilateral
There was a concluded agreement under the Rural Franchisee Scheme
between consumers and Electricity Board fixing specific rates with regard
to incentive payable to consumers. It was held that a unilateral revision or
modification in the scheme by the Board was not permissible during cur-
rency of the agreement. Such amendments were not enforceable."
9. C.K. Asati v Union of India, AIR 2005 MP 96, experience of partners can be considered as
experience of their firm. Without considering this, refusal of tender to the firm was not proper.
Patel Engg Ltd v National Highways Authority of India, AIR 2005 Del 298, requirement of
experience in award of contract, correct perspective is to see, actual experience of the partici-
pant and entity and not label of the firm. A statutory body could not give effect to experience
certificate issued by it.
10. Once an enforceable agreement comes into being it remains enforceable even if the goods
which were to be delivered under it were brought late and they were also accepted by the other
party. See, Jain Mills and Electrical Stores v State of Orissa, AIR 1991 Ori 117. A Collector
can be authorised only by statute to recover any dues as arrears of land revenue. Such authority
cannot be given under an agreement. Power so given by Zila Parishad was held to be against
law, Mahesh Chandra v Zila Panchayat Mainpuri, AIR 1997 All 248. A statutory contract
means a contract of the contents of which some portion is filled under a statute. For example,
S. 43-A(2) of the Electricity Supply Act, 1948 fills into a power purchase agreement the terms
relating to determination of tariff. Indian Thermal Power Ltd v State of M.P., (2000) 3 SCC
379: AIR 2000 SC 1005. The fact that a contract is for construction of a public utility and is
awarded by a statutory body does not necessarily make it a statutory contract. Kerala SEB
v Kurien E. Kalathil, (2000) 6 SCC 293: AIR 2000 SC 2573. B. Rajamani v Azhar Sultana,
AIR 2005 AP 260: (2005) 2 An LD 862, agreements to sell immovable property was reduced
to writing but not signed by the purchaser, did not mean there was no concluded contract. The
contract came into existence when both parties agreed. It became enforceable. Varsha Fabrics
(P) Ltd v State of Orissa, (2006) 102 Cut LT 137, the share Purchase Agreement had not
been signed by the parties, the court said that signing of the same was a mere formality, since
the terms and conditions had already been negotiated and agreed upon between the parties.
Bhagwati Enterprises v Rajasthan SRTC, AIR 2006 Raj 233, tenders issued for appointment
of sole licencee for transportation business, applicant's tender accepted and work order issued.
The applicant accordingly furnished requisite bank guarantee, concluded contract arose even
though no formal contract signed. Syndicate Bank v R. Veeranna, (2003) 2 SCC 15: (2003) 5
Kant LJ 1, provision in contract that interest could be revised upwards on loans up to a certain
percentage, the Supreme Court held that no prior notice for exercising this power was neces-
sary. Bharat Forge Ltd v Onil Gulati, AIR 2005 Del 369, the suit was based on invoices and
bills containing the terms of supply and other requisite terms the invoices were acted upon,
accepted and paid partly. The claim for the rest of the amount was maintainable even in the
absence of any writing. Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Peacock Plywood (P) Ltd, AIR 2005 Cal
97, acceptance by bank to provide loan on the basis of documents of hypothecation etc. exe-
cuted by the customer was held to be binding on the bank. But as no lender can be compelled
to disburse loan, an action lies only for breach of contract.
11. Sunil Chandra Mishra v State of Bihar, AIR 2016 Pat 47.

Page 141
https://t.me/LawCollegeNotes_Stuffs
[S. 10]
Proposal or offer 5
Under a hypothecation agreement, a unilateral right was given to the
bank to refer any dispute to arbitration. No consent of the borrower was
stipulated. The court said that in the absence of consensus-ad-idem, such
clause could not be regarded as an arbitration clause. In the same deci-
sion the court adopted the view that such a unilateral option is not unfair,
unreasonable or against public policy. Financial institutions carrying on the
business of collecting, investing, lending funds are well within their rights
to carve out ways and means of settlement of commercial transactions with
their borrowers.13
Where the highest bidder did not avail the opportunity given to him to
retain property by making payment along with 10 per cent interest, it was
held that there was no bona fide intention on the part of the bidder. The
Authority could resume possession."
Contract as civil obligation
The law of contract confines itself to the enforcement of voluntarily cre-
ated civil obligations. It does not cover the whole range of civil obligations.
There are many obligations of civil nature, like those imposed by law or cre-
ated by the acceptance of a trust, whose violation may be actionable under
the law of torts or of trusts, or under a statute, but they are outside the field
of contract. The law of contract is also not able to take care of the whole
range of agreements. Many agreements remain outside its purview because
they do not fulfil the requirements of a contract. In addition, there are some
agreements which literally satisfy the requirements of a contract, such as
proposal, acceptance, consideration, etc., but which do not catch its spirit
and they are not enforced because it does not sound to be reasonable to do
so. They are excluded under the legal device that the parties must not have
intended legal consequences.
PROPOSAL OR OFFER
A proposal and its acceptance is the universally acknowledged process for
the making of an agreement. The proposal is the starting point. Section 2(a)
defines "proposal" as follows:
When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from
doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or
abstinence, he is said to make a proposal.
The person who makes the proposal is called the promisor or "offeror",
the person to whom it is made is called the proposee or "offeree" and when
he accepts it, he is called a "promisee". In the terminology of Section 2(c)
"the person making the proposal is called the "promisor", and the person

[S. 3]
accepting the proposal is called the "promisee". In view of the above defi-
nition, a proposal is in the first place an expression of the offeror's willing-
ness to do or to abstain from doing something. Secondly, it should be made
with a view to obtaining the assent of the offeree to the proposed act or
abstinence.
Communication of proposal
The first part of the definition of "proposal" lays emphasis upon the
requirement that the willingness to make a proposal should be "signified".
To signify means to indicate or declare. In the traditional language of the
law of contract, it means that the proposal should be communicated to the
other party. The process of making a proposal is completed by the act of
communicating it to the other party. Section 3 recognises the modes of
communication:
S. 3. Communication, acceptance and revocation of proposals.--The
communication of proposals, the acceptance of proposals, and the revocation.
of proposals and acceptances, respectively, are deemed to be made by any act
or omission of the party proposing, accepting or revoking, by which he intends
to communicate such proposal, acceptance or revocation, or which has the
effect of communicating it.
Thus, a proposal may be communicated in any way which has the effect
of laying before the offeree the willingness to do or abstain. It may, for
example, be done by words of mouth", or by writing, or even by conduct.
Implied proposals
A man frequently expresses his desire to do something or to get some-
thing done by his actions. "Words are not the only medium of expression.
Conduct may often convey as clearly as words a promise, or an assent to a
proposed promise.”17 An offer and acceptance need not always be formal,
15. It is now settled law that a contract can come into existence between the parties by exchange
of letters. Ram Krishan Singhal v Executive Engineer, ILR (1991) 1 Del 275. Followed in SBI

nor does the law of contract or of sale of goods require that consent to a
contract must be in writing." Offer and acceptance can be spelt out from
the conduct of the parties which covers not only their acts but also omis-
sions." An offer which is expressed by conduct is called an "implied offer"
and the one which is expressed by words, written or spoken, is called an
"express offer". An acceptance may likewise be made expressly or impliedly.
Section 9 declares:
S. 9. Promises, express and implied.-In so far as the proposal or accept-
ance of any promise is made in words, the promise is said to be express. In so far
as such proposal or acceptance is made otherwise than in words, the promise is
said to be implied.
A contract implied in fact requires meeting of minds. The courts have to
refuse to read an implied term into a contract which is silent on the point or
did not clearly indicate the nature of terms.20
A bid at an auction is an implied offer to buy. Similarly, stepping into an
omnibus" and consuming eatables at a self-service restaurant, both create
implied promises to pay for the benefits enjoyed. An illustration of a con-
tract arising impliedly from conduct is Upton-on-Severn RDC v Powell:22
A fire broke out in the defendant's farm. He believed that he was enti-
tled to the free services of Upton Fire Brigade and, therefore, summoned
it. The Brigade put out the fire. It then turned out that the defendant's
farm was not within free service zone of the Upton, which therefore,
claimed compensation for the services. The court said: "The truth of the
matter is that the defendant wanted the services of Upton; he asked for
the services of Upton and Upton, in response to that request, provided the
services. Hence the services were rendered on an implied promise to pay
for them."
Similarly, where the charterer of a ship chartered for loading steel billets,
instead loaded general merchandise, for which the rate of freight was higher,
he was held to have done so under an implied promise to pay the higher
rate; where the time for which a ship was chartered expired, but the ship-
owner did not call back the ship and it remained in use with the other party,
the Supreme Court said that a silent agreement arose under which current

object to the charge of a compound rate of interest in accordance with the
usual course of business, he was held to have impliedly contracted to pay the
compound interest;25 and where the rules of a yacht club regatta provided
that competitors would be liable for damage done by fouling, they were held
bound to each other by the rules and where one of them fouled and sank a
yacht, he was held liable. This last mentioned case shows that in order to
ascertain whether an agreement has arisen, regard must be had to the total-
ity of the circumstances in which the parties contracted and not merely to
the formalities of offer and acceptance. Sometimes a sequence of events may
exhibit an agreement, though offer and acceptance are indiscernable.
This should be contrasted with a case in which a member of a Jockey Club
sought to recover damages from his club for causing him loss of earnings by
refusing him a racing licence on medical grounds. He based his contention
on the contractual duty of the club of carrying out its licensing functions
with care. The claim was struck out. The Jockey Club was a domestic tribu-
nal and no contractual duty could be implied in respect of its functioning.
The only obligation in such cases is to act fairly.27
Section 9 was applied by the Supreme Court in a case28 where on the
orders of a go between man certain goods were supplied by the plaintiff on
his own account to the defendants. The defendants clearly and unerringly
accepted the goods and paid a part of the price. Accordingly a liability to pay
the balance arose. "The defendants by their clear conduct of accepting the
goods and never repudiating any of the numerous letters and telegrams of
the plaintiff demanding the money from them, clearly showed that a direct
contract which in law is called an implied contract by conduct was brought
about between them." In another matter before the Supreme Court the facts
were: A contract was signed between an Indian and a Yugoslavian party.
One of the terms provided for arbitration by the International Chamber
of Commerce in Paris. Immediately thereafter the Indian party cabled and
also wrote its objection about the arbitration clause. The other party made
no reply to it, but permitted the work to go on. A dispute having arisen, it
was held that the arbitration clause had become deleted from the contract
by an implied agreement. A suit could lie in a court of law. In another case
of the same kind,30 a harbour authority offered to an operator berthing
facilities for his operations. Correspondence between the two followed with

a view to operate a service from there to another port. Subsequently, the
port authorities attempted to withdraw their facilities. The operator was
allowed to recover damages for breach of contract. The correspondence had
already given rise to an implied agreement that the pro-offered facilities had
been accepted. Where the parties conducted their business transactions on
the basis of a clause in their agreement, it was held that that clause became
embedded into their contract and they would not be heard to say that the
clause was intended to be only a general term."
Failure on the part of a hirer under a hire-purchase agreement to keep up
the payment of instalments would enable the financier to resume possession
of the material delivered under the contract, even if the contract contains no
term to that effect. Such right is the result of a legal implication.32 A valuer
was engaged by a bank for evaluating properties offered by the borrower for
the purpose of an equitable mortgage. There was nothing to indicate that
the bank made any promise to pay him his professional fee. The practice,
on the other hand, was that such fee was paid by borrowers. The bank was
held not liable under any implied promise, nor for compensation under the
quantum meruit principle.33
No implied contract to pay higher price was deemed to have arisen where
the Government, being bound under a contract to supply material at fixed
prices, supplied it at enhanced rate and someone on behalf of the contractor
happened to accept the material. In a contract for supply of specified quan-
tity every month by the Government to a dealer, the court said that, because
the date of supply was not prescribed, no term could be implied that supply
should be made in the first week of the month. Supply made in the last week
of the month was held to be not a breach of contract.3
An auction purchaser failed to deposit the balance amount. The auction

Communication when complete
[S. 4]
S. 4. Communication when complete.-The communication of a pro-
posal is complete when it comes to the knowledge of the person to whom it is
made.
Obviously, therefore, an offer cannot be accepted unless and until it has
been brought to the knowledge of the person to whom it is made. This prin-
ciple enabled the Allahabad High Court in Lalman Shukla v Gauri Datt
to deal with a matter involving a very crucial question on this point.
Defendant's nephew absconded from home. He sent his servant in
search of the boy. When the servant had left, the defendant by hand bills
offered to pay Rs 501 to anybody discovering the boy. The servant came
to know of this offer only when he had already traced the missing child.
He, however, brought an action to recover the reward. But his action
failed.
Explaining the principle, BANERJI J said: "In my opinion a suit like the
present can only be founded on a contract. In order to constitute a contract,
there must be an acceptance of an offer and there can be no acceptance
unless there is knowledge of the offer."
When this case was decided, the English Law on the point was uncertain.
But the principle, that there can be no acceptance without knowledge of
offer had already been adopted in the United States. For example, as early
as 1868, a judge remarked: How can there be consent or assent to that of
which the other party has never heard? The principle has been carried a
little further in an Australian case" where it was held that even if the accep-
tor had once known of the offer but had completely forgotten about it at the
time of acceptance, he would be in no better position than a person who had
not heard of the offer at all. One of the judges gave the following interesting
illustration:
An offer of £100 to any person who would swim a hundred yards in
the harbour on the first day of the year would not in my opinion be sat-
isfied by a person who was accidentally or maliciously thrown overboard
on that date and swam the distance simply to save his life, without any
thought of the offer.
The facts of the case were:
The Australian Government had offered a reward of £1000 to any-
one giving information about certain murderers. The offer further added
that if the information was given by an accomplice, not being himself the
murderer, he would also be entitled to a free pardon. The plaintiff, being
an accomplice, saw the offer and having been so excited by the hope of

pardon, he gave the information to save himself, completely forgetting the
reward. He could not recover the reward.
Where a woman gave information about the murderers of her husband,
not so much for reward, but to assuage her feelings, she was allowed to
recover. Where an offer has been accepted with knowledge of the reward,
the fact that the informer was influenced by motives other than the reward
will be immaterial.
INTENTION TO CONTRACT
There is no provision in the Indian Contract Act requiring that an offer
or its acceptance should be made with the intention of creating a legal rela-
tionship. But in English Law it is a settled principle that "to create a contract
there must be a common intention of the parties to enter into legal obli-
gations". It was pointed out in an early case that "contracts must not be
the
sports of an idle hour, mere matters of pleasantry and badinage, never
intended by the parties to have any serious effect whatsoever". 42 "It is not
every loose conversation that is to be turned into a contract, although the
parties may seem to agree.”43 The case of Balfour v Balfour 4 has become
well known as an illustration of this principle: .
The defendant and his wife were enjoying leave in England. When the
defendant was due to return to Ceylon, where he was employed, his wife
was advised, by reason of her health, to remain in England. The defendant
agreed to send her an amount of £30 a month for the probable expenses
of maintenance. He did send the amount for some time, but afterwards
differences arose which resulted in their separation and the allowance fell
into arrears. The wife's action to recover the arrears was dismissed.
Lord ATKIN explained the principle thus: "There are agreements between
parties which do not result in contract within the meaning of that term in
our law. The ordinary example is where two parties agree to take a walk
together, or where there is an offer and acceptance of hospitality. Nobody
would suggest in ordinary circumstances that these arrangements result in
what we know as contracts, and one of the most usual forms of agreement
which does not constitute a contract appears to be the arrangements which
are made between husband and wife. These arrangements do not result in
contracts at all, even though there may be what would constitute considera-
tion for the agreement. They are not contracts because parties did not intend
that they shall be attended by legal consequences."

12 Chapter 1 Agreement, Contract and Proposal
Family and social matters
[S. 4]
The intention of the parties is naturally to be ascertained from the terms
of the agreement and the surrounding circumstances. It is for the court in
each case to find out whether the parties must have intended to enter into
legal obligations. "In the case of arrangements regulating social relations it
follows almost as a matter of course that the parties do not intend legal con-
sequences to follow. In the case of agreements regulating business relations
it equally follows almost as a matter of course that the parties intend legal
consequences to follow."45
This does not, however, mean that in family or social matters there can-
not be a legally binding contract.46 All that the law requires is that the par-
ties must intend legal consequences. McGregor v McGregor is an early
illustration of a binding engagement between a husband and wife. Here a
husband and wife withdrew their complaints under an agreement by which
the husband promised to pay her an allowance and she was to refrain from
pledging his credit, the agreement was held to be a binding contract. An
agreement between relatives to share a house has been held to be binding. 48
The "principle applies to dealings between other relations, such as father
and son and daughter and mother". These words occur in the judgment of
DANCKWERTS LJ in Jones v Padavatton:49
A divorced woman was living in Washington with her son where
she was employed as an assistant accountant in the Indian Embassy on
attractive terms. Her mother was in Trinidad and wished her daughter to
be near her. She was particularly attached to the grandson. The mother
persuaded her daughter, much against her will, to leave service, to take
legal education in England and finally to come back to Trinidad as a prac-
tising lawyer. The mother undertook to foot the expenses. Subsequently,
the mother bought a house in England, part of which was allowed to the
daughter and rest tenanted out. For five long years the daughter could not
complete her education. She also remarried in the meantime. Differences
arose between them and the mother stopped payments and also com-
menced proceedings to evict the daughter.
DANCKWERTS LJ allowed the mother's appeal. His Lordship said: "There
is no doubt that this case is a most difficult one, but... is one of those family
arrangements which depend on the good faith of the promises which are
made and are not intended to be rigid, binding agreements." SALMON LJ
also allowed the mother's appeal, but on a different ground. He felt that

acting on her mother's promise, the daughter had left an attractive service
and gone to another country for education and the mother could not in these
circumstances get out of the promise at her sweet will and leave the daugh-
ter in that condition. The engagement, therefore, did result in a contract,
but the agreement could last only for a period reasonably sufficient for the
daughter to complete her education and the period of five years was more
than sufficient for the purpose. She could not have expected her mother to
support her, her son and husband in perpetuity.
The mere opening of a joint banking account between a man and his wife
or the man promising to buy her a car in an effort to improve their strained
matrimonial relationship has been held to be a purely domestic arrangement
not resulting in any legal relationship.50
Objectivity, not subjectivity, test of contractual intention
The test of contractual intention is objective, not subjective. What mat-
ters is not what the parties had in mind, but what a reasonable person
would think, in the circumstances, their intention to be. Thus, where three
ladies, two of them being mother and daughter and the third a paying guest,
together made entries into a crossword puzzle in the name of the mother, the
expenses being met by one or other, without any rules. The entry was suc-
cessful and the mother refused to share the prize. But the court held that she
was bound to do so, for any reasonable man looking at their conduct would
at once conclude that they must have intended to share the prize. Following
these principles, the Supreme Court observed on the facts of a case:
Here, one partner has lent a large sum of money to the other to be uti-
lised as capital in the partnership venture. The transaction is in the con-
text of a commercial venture. The presumption is that legal obligations
are intended. The onus is on the parties asserting the absence of legal
obligations and the test is not subjective, but is an objective one. Where,
as here, the tax implications of large financial obligations are sought to be
put an end to, the burden is heavy on the assessee to establish that what
would otherwise be the incidents of the transaction were excluded from
contemplation by the parties.52
The court cited the following passage from an English case:
In deciding whether or not there was any contract in relation to a cer-
tain transaction, or whether or not sufficient notice of a certain term
was given, the law applies an objective and not a subjective test.... In the
absence of such evidence, how can the court assume, that the master did
not intend to enter into a contract.

14 Chapter 1 Agreement, Contract and Proposal
[S. 4]
The results of cases on this subject are bound to be variable, for the
matter wholly depends upon the fact whether the conduct of the parties in
the surrounding circumstances affords evidence of objective intention. For
example, in Merritt v Merritt," an agreement to transfer to the wife the
beneficial ownership of the matrimonial home made at the time of separa-
tion was held to be binding. But in Gould v Gould," an agreement similarly
made was held to be not binding as the husband undertook to pay only as
long as he had the means to pay. Uncertainty of these words showed that no
legal relations were contemplated.56
Business matters
In an agreement to provide loan facilities to a company's subsidiary, the
company gave to the lender assurances of providing security by giving them
two "letters of comfort", they being commercial papers, were held sufficient
to create the responsibility of providing security. Taking into account the
nature of the promise, the court held: "A letter of comfort from a parent
company to a lender stating that it was the policy of the parent company to
ensure that its subsidiary was 'at all times in a position to meet its liabili-
ties' in respect of a loan made by the lender to the subsidiary did not have
contractual effect if it was merely a statement of present fact regarding the
parent company's intentions and was not a contractual promise as to the
parent company's future conduct. On the facts, the relevant para of the let-
ters of comfort was in terms a statement of present fact and not a promise
as to future conduct and in the context in which the letters were written was
not intended to be anything other than a representation of fact giving rise to
no more than a moral responsibility on the part of the defendants to meet
M's debt." An investment in a partnership firm was taken by the Supreme
Court to be of commercial nature putting the onus on the party asserting
that he did not intend to be a legal partner to prove that fact.58
Even in business matters, parties intend to rely on each other's "good
faith and honour," and not on the courts. For example, in Rose & Frank Co
v J.R. Crompton & Bros Ltd.59
An exhaustive agreement was drawn between one American and two
English firms for their dealings in paper tissues. The agreement contained
the following clause: "This arrangement is not entered into as a formal
legal agreement and shall not be subject to a legal jurisdiction in the law
courts either in the US or in England." The agreement was terminated by

binding contract as there was no intention to affect legal relations.
"Intention to contract" said Lord ATKIN LJ, "may be negatived impliedly
by the nature of the promise.... If the intention may be negatived impliedly,
it may be negatived expressly.... I have never seen such a clause before, but
I see nothing necessarily absurd in businessmen seeking to regulate their
business relations by mutual promises which fall short of legal obligations,
and rest on obligations of either honour or self-interest or perhaps both."60
In another case, coupons were invited from persons generally showing
certain entries and the correct entries were to be rewarded. there was a
clause on the back of every coupon that the transaction would not give rise
to any legal relationship, or be legally enforceable, but binding in honour
only. No action was allowed either about the receipt of a coupon or the cor-
rectness of its particulars.61
A winner at a football pool sued for his winning, but was not allowed to
recover because the pool was subject to a condition that it was not legally
enforceable. The practice, whereby workinen go to their place of business
in a motor car or on the motor cycle of a fellow workman upon the terms of
making contribution to the cost of transport, has been held not to result in
a contract. Stating the reasons UPJOHN LJ said: "The hazards of everyday
life, such as temporary indisposition, the incidence of holidays, the possi-
bility of a change of shift or different hours of overtime, or incompatibility
arising, make it most unlikely that either contemplated that the one was
legally bound to carry and the other to be carried to work." In a subsequent
case, it was pointed out that such an agreement should be held binding at
least to the extent so as to enable the vehicle owner to recover the promised
contribution from the other party." Lord CROSS OF CHELSEA did not think
it necessary that there should be positive evidence of intention to contract.
He gave an illustration:
If I get into a taxi and ask the driver to drive me to the Victoria Station
it is extremely unlikely that either of us directs his mind to the question
whether we are entering into a contract. We enter into a contract not
because we form any intention to enter into one but because if our minds
were directed to the point we should as reasonable people both agree that
we were in fact entering into one.

16 Chapter 1 Agreement, Contract and Proposal
Supreme Court's view of requirement of "intention"
[S. 4]
The Supreme Court has expressed its reservation about the need of this
separate requirement of "intention to contract" under the Contract Act.
Going by the criticism which is already there in the West, the court found
that it was a necessity of those systems where consideration was not a req-
uisite of enforceability. Thus it is still an open question whether the require-
ment of "intention to contract" is applicable under the Indian Contract Act
in the way in which it has been developed in England.65
But earlier to this, a limited recognition of the applicability of this prin-
ciple in India could be inferred from the decision of the Supreme Court in
Banwari Lal v Sukhdarshan Dayal." In an auction sale of plots of land, a
loudspeaker was spelling out the terms, etc., of the sale, one of the statements
being that a plot of certain dimensions would be reserved for a Dharamshala
(public inn). Subsequently, that plot was also sold for private purposes. The
purchasers sought to restrain this. CHANDRACHUD J (afterwards CJ) said:
Microphones... have not yet acquired notoriety as carriers of binding rep-
resentations. Promises held out over loudspeakers are often claptraps of pol-
itics. In the instant case, the announcement was, if at all, a puffing up of
property put up for sale.
In a subsequent case on the subject, the Supreme Court noted the general
proposition that in addition to the existence of an agreement and the pres-
ence of consideration there is also the third contractual element in the form
of intention of the parties to create legal relations, and also noted that this
proposition, though accepted in English Law, has not passed unchallenged.
The court then cited the following passage from Cheshire and Fifoot's Law
OF CONTRACT: 68 "... the criticism of it made by Prof. Williston demands
attention, not only as emanating from a distinguished American jurist, but
as illuminating the whole subject. In his opinion, the separate element of
intention is foreign to the common law, imported from the Continent by
academic influences in the 19th century and useful only in systems which
lack the test of consideration to enable them to determine the boundaries of
contract."
Letters of intent
A letter of intent merely indicates a party's intention to enter into a con-
tract on the lines suggested in the letter. It may become a prelude to a con-
tract. However, where a letter stated that it would be followed by a detailed
purchase order which carried an arbitration clause, it was held that the letter

was not a supply order and the arbitration clause contained in it did not by
itself fructify into an arbitration agreement."
GENERAL OFFERS
It was suggested in the old case of Weeks v Tybald" that an offer must be
made to a definite person. That case arose out of the defendant's affirmation
to the public that he would give £100 to him that should marry his daughter
with his consent. The plaintiff alleged that he did so and sued the defendant.
Rejecting the action, the court said: "It is not averred nor declared to whom
the words were spoken." The difficulty suggested was that if an offer of
this kind addressed to several persons could be accepted, the offeror would
find himself bound in innumerable contracts. This was, however, soon over-
ruled. The modern position is that an offer may be made to the world at
large. But the contract is not made with all the world. Contract is made only
with that person who comes forward and performs the conditions of the
proposal. The principle is thus stated in Anson: "An offer need not be made
to an ascertained person, but no contract can arise until it has been accepted
by an ascertained person."" An offer of this kind has already been seen in
Lalman Shukla v Gauri Datt" which was addressed to the public generally.
Another authority is Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co (Smoke Ball case).73
A company offered by advertisement to pay £100 to anyone "who con-
tracts the increasing epidemic influenza, colds or any disease caused by
taking cold, after having used the ball according to printed directions". It
was added that "£1000 is deposited with the Alliance Bank showing our
sincerity in the matter". The plaintiff used the smoke balls according to
the directions but she nevertheless subsequently suffered from influenza.
She was held entitled to recover the promised reward.
It was contended by the defendants that there was no intention to enter
into legal relations as it was simply a puffing advertisement; that the offer
was not made to any one person in particular and that the plaintiff had
not communicated her intention to accept. The first argument was easily
disposed of by BOWEN LJ by saying: "Was it intended that the £100 should,
if the conditions were fulfilled, be paid? The advertisement says that £1000
is lodged at the bank for the purpose. Therefore, it cannot be said that the
statement that £100 would be paid was intended to be a mere puff." His
Lordship also exposed the fallacy of the argument that an offer could not
be made to the world at large, when he said: "Why should not an offer be

made to all the world which is to ripen into a contract with anybody who
comes forward and performs the condition? It is an offer to become liable
to anyone who, before it is retracted, performs the conditions, and although
the offer is made to the world, the contract is made with that limited portion
of the public who come forward and perform the condition on the faith of
the advertisement."
Proposals acceptable by conduct
His Lordship also pointed out that in cases like this communication of
acceptance is not necessary. "As notification of acceptance is required for
the benefit of the person who makes the offer, he may dispense with notice
to himself if he thinks it desirable to do so... and if he expressly or impliedly
intimates in his offer that it will be sufficient to act on the proposal without
communicating acceptance of it to himself, performance of the condition
is a sufficient acceptance without notification. In the advertisement cases it
seems to follow as an inference to be drawn from the transaction itself that
a person is not to notify his acceptance of the offer before he performs the
condition.... I advertise to the world that my dog is lost and that anybody
who brings the dog to a particular place will be paid some money, are all the
police and other people whose business is to find lost dogs to sit down and
write me a note saying that they have accepted my proposal?"74
Section 8 of the Contract Act incorporates this principle:
S. 8. Acceptance by performing conditions, or receiving considera-
tion. Performance of the conditions of a proposal, or the acceptance of any
consideration for a reciprocal promise which may be offered with a proposal, is
an acceptance of the proposal.
The principle of the section was followed by YEARS CJ of the Allahabad
High Court in Har Bhajan Lal v Har Charan Lal's and applied to a situation
where the terms of a general offer were substantially, though not literally
complied with.
A young boy ran away from his father's home. The father eventually
issued a pamphlet, offering a reward in these terms: "Anybody who finds
trace of the boy and brings him home, will get Rs 500." The plaintiff was
at the Dharamshala of a railway station, there he saw a boy, overheard
part of the conversation, realized that the boy was the missing boy and
promptly took him to the Railway Police Station and sent a telegram to
the boy's father that he had found his son. It was held that the handbill
was an offer open to the whole world and capable of acceptance by any
person who fulfilled the condition, and that the plaintiff substantially
performed the condition and was entitled to the amount offered.

Offer and invitation to treat 19
A Privy Council decision is still another illustration of an offer which is
accepted by acting upon its terms. Upon the marriage of the appellant, her
aunt, Papamma, a wealthy Hindu widow with whom she had resided since
childhood, promised that if the appellant and her husband would reside
with her, she would purchase immovable property for the appellant. The
appellant and her husband accordingly resided with the aunt. She did pur-
chase some property but in her own name. This dissatisfied the appellant
who with her husband ceased to reside with the aunt. The aunt wrote to the
appellant that the property had been purchased for the appellant and would
be transferred to her upon the writer's death. The appellant and her husband
thereafter resided with the aunt until her death. This was held to be a suffi-
cient acceptance of the promise contained in the aunt's letter:
The Board is of the opinion accordingly that there was here a com-
pleted contract. Papamma accomplished her desire, and she obtained the
consideration which she had so much at heart. Acceptance of her terms
and compliance with her stipulation were made.
It has been observed in a decision of the Patna High Court" that "where
the acceptance is to consist of an act, as for example, despatching goods.
ordered by post, the rule is that no further communication of acceptance
is necessary". Where the allotment of a quarter was to become a complete
transaction on the making of the final payment, not to have done so brought
about lapse of the allotment. Such allottee was not allowed to question the
allotment of the quarter to another person." In a claim against Railways for
short delivery of goods, two cheques were dispatched to the claimant with
this clarification that encashment of the cheques would be full and final sat-
isfaction of the claim. The claimant encashed the cheques and subsequently
protested and claimed the full claim amount. His claim application was
dismissed."
General offer of continuing nature
Where a general offer is of continuing nature, as it was, for example, in
the Smoke Ball case, it will be open for acceptance to any number of persons
until it is retracted. But where an offer requires some information as to a
missing thing, it is closed as soon as the first information comes in.
OFFER AND INVITATION TO TREAT
An offer should be distinguished from an invitation to receive offers.
When a man advertises that he has got a stock of books to sell, or houses to
let, there is no offer to be bound by any contract. "Such advertisements are

offers to negotiate-offers to receive offers-offers to chaffer."80 An offer is
the final expression of willingness by the offeror to be bound by his offer,
should the other party choose to accept it. This may be inferred from the
definition of "proposal" in Section 2(a), which emphasises that there should
be the expression of willingness to do or abstain with a view to obtaining
the assent of the other. The offeror must have expressed his willingness to
contract in terms of his offer with such finality that the only thing to be
waited for is the assent of the other party. Where a party, without expressing
his final willingness, proposes certain terms on which he is willing to nego-
tiate, he does not make an offer, but only invites the other party to make
an offer on those terms. This is perhaps the basic distinction between an
"offer" and an "invitation" to receive offers. The Privy Council in Harvey v
Facey has explained the distinction.
The plaintiffs telegraphed to the defendants, writing: "Will you sell us
Bumper Hall Pen? Telegraph lowest cash price". The defendants replied,
also by a telegram: "Lowest price for Bumper Hall Pen, £900".
The plaintiffs immediately sent their last telegram stating: "We agree
to buy Bumper Hall Pen for £900 asked by you."
The defendants, however, refused to sell the plot of land at that price.
The plaintiffs contended that by quoting their minimum price in response
to the enquiry the defendants had made an offer to sell at that price. But the
Judicial Committee turned down the suggestion. Their Lordships pointed
out that in their first telegram, the plaintiffs had asked two questions,
first, as to the willingness to sell and, second, as to the lowest price. The
defendants answered only the second, and gave only the lowest price. They
reserved their answer as to the willingness to sell. Thus, they had made no
offer. The last telegram of the plaintiffs was an offer to buy, but that was
never accepted by the defendants. "Their Lordships are of opinion that the
mere statement of the lowest price at which the vendor would sell contains
no implied contract to sell at that price to the person making the inquiry."
The principle of this case was followed by the Supreme Court in Col. D.I.
McPherson v M.N. Appanna.
The plaintiff offered to purchase a lodge owned by the defendants for
Rs 6000. He wrote the defendant's agent asking whether his offer had
been accepted and saying that he was prepared to accept any higher price
if found reasonable. The agent replied: "Won't accept less than rupees
ten thousand". The plaintiff accepted this and brought a suit for specific
performance. It was held that the defendant did not make any offer or
counter-offer in his cable but was merely inviting offers. There was no

assent to the plaintiff's offer to buy at Rs 10,000 and, therefore, no con-
cluded contract.
As distinguished from it where the proposee, in response to a proposal
to purchase his land, asked for a higher price and also some advance with
acceptance; the Court held that the proposer's acceptance, along with an
advance payment amounted to a contract, although the proposee later
revoked his offer. $3
A Development Authority made an announcement for making an allot-
ment of plots on first come first served basis on payment of full consider-
ation. An application in response to this made with full consideration was
held to be an offer and, therefore, there could be no concluded contract till
the offer was accepted.
Catalogues and display of goods
A shopkeeper's catalogue of prices is not an offer; it is only an invita-
tion to the intending customers to offer to buy at the indicated prices. "The
transmission of a price list," observed Lord HERSCHELL, "does not amount
to an offer to supply an unlimited quantity of the wine described at the price
named, so that as soon as an order is given there is a binding contract to
supply that quantity. If it were so, the merchant might find himself involved
in any number of contractual obligations to supply wine of a particular
description which he would be quite unable to carry out, his stock of wine of
that description being necessarily limited." For the same reason the display
of goods in a shop with price chits attached is not an offer even if there is a
"self-service" system in the shop. This was so held in Pharmaceutical Society
of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists Southern Ltd." Lord GODDARD CJ
said: "It would be wrong to say that the shopkeeper is making an offer to
sell every article in the shop to any person who might come in and that
person can insist on buying any article by saying 'I accept your offer'.... In
most bookshops customers are invited to go in and pick up books and look
at them even if they do not actually buy them. There is no contract by the
shopkeeper to sell until the customer has taken the book to the shopkeeper
or his assistant and said: 'I want to buy this book' and the shopkeeper says
'yes'. That would not prevent the shopkeeper, seeing the book picked up,
saying, 'I am sorry I cannot let you have that book; it is the only copy I have
got and I have already promised it to another customer.' Therefore, I am of
opinion, the mere fact that a customer picks up a bottle of medicine from the
shelves in this case does not amount to an acceptance of an offer to sell. It is
an offer by the customer to buy, and there is no sale effected until the buyer's
offer to buy is accepted by the acceptance of the price."

A banker's catalogue of charges is also not an offer. A railway timetable
is in the same category." Where a shopkeeper was convicted of offering for
sale a flick-knife contrary to the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act, 1959
[S. 1(1)] (UK) which he had displayed in his shop window, it was held that
it was in no sense an offer for sale the acceptance of which could constitute
a contract.89
Announcement to hold auction
An auctioneer's announcement that specified goods will be sold by auc-
tion on a certain day is not an offer to hold the auction and he will not be
liable to persons travelling up to the place if he changes his mind and does
not hold the auction. Indication of reserve price is neither a proposal to sell
at that price nor it is a valuation of the property." Even when an auction is
held, the bid is not an acceptance so as to entitle the highest bidder to get the
goods. The highest bid is nothing more than an offer to buy and it requires
to be accepted by the auctioneer.92 It does not matter for this purpose that
the auction was held by the Government. Even a Government auction may
be cancelled before any bid is finally accepted. After cancelling the auction
(in this case the right to fell trees in a forest), the right was handed over to
a Government corporation and it was considered to be no argument that a
corporation cannot afford to pay an amount equal to private bidders. The
Supreme Court also gave this latitude to the Government, as is enjoyed by a
private auctioneer, that it may even ignore the highest bid and accept a lower
bid. The highest bidder may be found to be an undesirable person for many
reasons, for example, from the mere enormity of the bid." However, one
contractor should not be preferred over another without any rhyme or rea-
son, this would be more so in the matter of Government contracts. Where

Acceptance
CASE PILOT
DEFINITION
Section 2(b) defines acceptance as follows:
When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto,
the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted, becomes a
promise.
Thus "acceptance" is the assent given to a proposal, and it has the effect
of converting the proposal into promise.¹
COMMUNICATION OF ACCEPTANCE
Acceptance by external manifestation or overt act
The definition clearly requires that the assent should be signified. It may
be signified or expressed by an act or omission by which the party accepting
intends to communicate his assent or which has the effect of communicating
it. [S. 3] A very common instance of an act amounting to acceptance is the
fall of the hammer in the case of an auction sale. The principle is that there
should be some external manifestation (overt act) of acceptance. A mere
mental determination to accept unaccompanied by any external indication
will not be sufficient. In the words of SHAH J (afterwards CJ): "An agree-
ment does not result from a mere state of mind: intent to accept an offer
or even a mental resolve to accept an offer does not give rise to a contract.
There must be... some external manifestation of that intent by speech, writ-
ing or other act."
Such manifestation may be in the form of express words, written or spo-
ken or may be signified through conduct. An illustration of acceptance by
conduct is the decision of the House of Lords in Brogden v Metropolitan
Railway Co.'

coals but on the new terms and also received payment on the new terms.
A dispute having arisen B refused to be bound by the agreement.
The conduct of the company's agent in keeping the agreement in his
drawer was an evidence of the fact that he had mentally accepted it. But he
had not expressed his mental determination and retention of the agreement
was not a sufficient acceptance. But the subsequent conduct of the parties.
in supplying and accepting coal on the basis of proposed agreement was a
conduct that evidenced or manifested their intention. The final acceptance
"was clearly given", said Lord CAIRNS LC "when the company commenced
a course of dealing which is referable only to the contract and when that
course of dealing was accepted and acted upon by B in the supply of coals"."
Acceptance by conduct
Another common example of acceptance by conduct is an action in terms
of the offer. All cases of general offers, which are a kind of unilateral con-
tract, demand some act in return for the promise to pay. In express recogni-
tion of this principle Section 8 provides that "performance of the conditions
of a proposal, of the acceptance of any consideration for a reciprocal prom-
ise which may be offered with a proposal, is an acceptance of the proposal".
Such proposals demand acceptance by performance. Acceptance of money
after prior information that higher rates of interest would be charged and
retention of goods sent on approval amount to acceptance of the considera-
tion offered along with a proposal." A Canadian court has gone as far as to
hold that, where an offer was made for the sale of a part of a land and lease
of the other part subject to the condition that the offeree obtained planning
permission and the offeree obtained permission within nine months, a valid
contract arose, though no communication of acceptance had been made
during the period of nine months." "The offeror had indicated a particular

mode of acceptance and, therefore, by doing the act, the offeree had accepted
the offer and did not have to notify the offeror in advance of its intention to
accept."
"8
The position in India is the same. This appears from the decision of the
Calcutta High Court in Hindustan Coop Insurance Society v Shyam Sunder."
After an oral understanding to insure and the completion of the medical
examination, the company informed the proposer that if he submitted the
proposal form and deposited the half-yearly premium, his proposal would
be accepted. He accordingly submitted a cheque and the proposal. The com-
pany encashed the cheque but had not yet replied to him their acceptance of
the proposal that the proposer died. The question was whether by encashing
the cheque the company had accepted the proposal without there being the
formal acceptance. HARRIS CJ referred to the English authorities and said:
Mere mental assent to an offer does not conclude a contract either
under the Indian Contract Act or in English Law. The offeror may, how-
ever, indicate the mode of communicating acceptance either expressly or
by implication both in India and English Law. In the case before us it is
clear from the facts that the deceased indicated clearly the mode of accept-
ance of his proposal. The deceased indicated clearly that if the appellant
accepted his proposal the cheque should be appropriated towards the first
premium and that such appropriation would conclude the bargain. The
cheque was received on that implied understanding."
Where, on the other hand, the insurer had received the proposal form
along with the first premium and it was still awaiting acceptance when the
proposer died, no liability to pay arose. It was immaterial that the ground-
work for acceptance was under preparation and the agent had assured
that the proposal would be accepted." Acceptance is complete only when

Communication of acceptance 27
communicated to the offeror. Mere silence after receipt and retention of pre-
mium cannot be construed as acceptance.12 The court followed the decision
in General Assurance Society Ltd v Chandmull Jain¹³ where it was observed
that a contract is formed when the insurer accepts the premium and retains
it. The decision further says that in the case of the assured, a positive act on
his part by which he recognises or seeks to enforce the policy amounts to an
affirmation of it.
It is clear that mere encashing the cheque sent along with the proposal
cannot amount to be a concluded contract between the parties and it can-
not be said that insurer has assumed risk because of the encashment of the
cheque.14
Where the acceptance letter was issued alongwith the first premium
receipt but it happened to be sent without knowing the fact of the proposer's
death, the LIC was not allowed to disown its liability under the policy.15
Whether expressly or impliedly, the fact remains that acceptance has to
be signified. In the words of BOWEN LJ:16
One cannot doubt that, as an ordinary rule of law, an acceptance of
an offer made ought to be notified to the person who makes the offer in
order that the two minds may come together. Unless this is done the two
minds may be apart, and there is not that consensus which is necessary
according to the English Law... to make a contract.
Communication to offeror himself
Further, acceptance must be communicated to the offeror himself. A
communication to any other person is as ineffectual as if no communication.
has been made. To take, for example, Felthouse v Bindley:17
The plaintiff offered by means of a letter to purchase his nephew's
horse. The letter said: "If I hear no more about the horse, I consider the
horse mine at £33.15s." To this letter no reply was sent. But the nephew
told the defendant, his auctioneer, not to sell the horse as it was already
sold to his uncle. The auctioneer by mistake put up the horse for auction
and sold it. The plaintiff sued the auctioneer on the ground that under the
contract the horse had become his property and, therefore, defendant's
unauthorised sale amounted to conversion. But the action failed.
The court said: "It is clear that the nephew in his own mind intended the
uncle to have the horse, but he had not communicated his intention to the

uncle." The case is also an authority for two further propositions. One of
them is that the acceptance of an offer made should be communicated to
the offeror himself or to the person he has authorised to receive the accept-
ance. A communication to a stranger, like the auctioneer in this case, will
not do.
Offer cannot impose burden of refusal
Secondly, an offeror cannot impose upon the offeree the burden of
refusal. The offeror cannot say that if no answer is received within a certain
time, the same shall be deemed to have been accepted. "It is not open to
an offeror to stipulate against an unwilling offeree that the latter's silence
will be regarded as equivalent to acceptance. He cannot force him to take
a positive course of action under penalty of being contractually bound if he
does not."18
Communication by acceptor himself
The natural corollary of this principle is that the communication of accept-
ance should be from a person who has the authority to accept. Information
received from an unauthorised person is ineffective. In Powell v Lee:19
The plaintiff was an applicant for the headmastership of a school. The
managers passed a resolution appointing him, but the decision was not
communicated to him. one of the members, however, in his individual
capacity informed him. The managers cancelled their resolution and the
plaintiff sued for breach of contract.
Rejecting the action the court observed: "There must be notice of accept-
ance from the contracting party in some way. Information by an unauthor-
ised person is as insufficient as overhearing from behind the door."
When communication not necessary
In certain cases, however, communication of acceptance is not necessary.
The offeror may prescribe a particular mode of acceptance, then all that
the acceptor has to do is to follow that mode. Then, there may be an
offer which impliedly indicates that acting on its terms will be a sufficient
acceptance. Announcement to pay reward for discovering a lost thing is
an offer of this kind." Again, the offeror may have acquiesced in a certain
conduct on the part of the acceptor as equivalent to acceptance.22 In such a
18. Cotton Corpn of India Ltd v Bombay Dyeing & Mfg Co Ltd, (2006) 5 Bom CR 105, the term
in the proposal that if it is not rejected up to a certain date, it would be deemed to have been

Communication of acceptance 29

case also no formal communication of acceptance is necessary. 23 Referring
to the requirement of communication in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co,
BOWEN LJ observed as follows:
But there is this clear gloss to be made upon that doctrine, that as
notification of acceptance is required for the benefit of the person who
makes the offer, he may dispense with notice to himself... and there can
be no doubt that where the [offeror] expressly or impliedly intimates a
particular mode of acceptance as sufficient to make the bargain binding
it is only necessary for the other person to follow the indicated method of
acceptance; and if the person making the offer expressly or impliedly inti-
mates in his offer that it will be sufficient to act on the proposal without
communicating acceptance of it to himself, performance of the condition
is a sufficient acceptance without notification.
But there is this further gloss to be placed upon this principle that an
offer can dispense with notification of acceptance that it applies only in
cases of unilateral contracts as opposed to bilateral contracts. In a unilateral
contract the offer demands an action, e.g., a reward for swimming across a
river. The other party has only to perform the act and not to give a promise
in return. Where the other party has to promise or undertake to do some-
thing, the requirement of the notification of his acceptance should not be
allowed to be dispensed with. If, for example, in Paul Felthouse v Bindley25
the nephew, without having replied to the uncle's letter, had asked his uncle
to take away the horse and pay the price, the position of the uncle would
have been curious, for, while the uncle could hardly have denied the prom-
ise, the nephew could always say at his convenience whether, by not commu-
nicating his acceptance, he had accepted the offer or not. It is for this reason
that the law has in such cases always insisted upon an overt act (external
manifestation) of acceptance than a mere mental determination. In a case
of this kind before DENNING LJ," a clause in the contract provided that the
contract would be binding only when the other party put his signature upon
it. His Lordship said:
Signing without notification is not enough. It would be deplorable if it
were. The plaintiffs would be able to keep the form in their office unsigned,
and then play fast and loose as they pleased. The defendant would not
know whether or not there was a contract. ... Just as mental acceptance is
not enough, nor is internal acceptance within the plaintiff's 'office.
In another case of the same kind," a motor-cyclist was convicted for
being with his motor cycle on a public road without third-party insurance.

30 Chapter 2 Acceptance
[S. 7]
His insurance had expired, but his company had sent him a temporary cover
note. He had not accepted this and, therefore, at the relevant date there was
no contract, though the temporary risk note was still in force. Lord PARKER,
however, suggested that if he had taken out his motor cycle in reliance upon
the temporary risk note that would have been sufficient acceptance by con-
duct without communication. Even this result would create the difficulty
that while he could have saved his skin by showing the unaccepted temporary
cover, he could always deny his liability to the company to pay the premium.
Mode of communication
Acceptance should be made in prescribed manner
Acceptance has to be made in the manner prescribed or indicated by the
offeror. An acceptance given in any other manner may not be effective, par-
ticularly where the offeror clearly insists that the acceptance shall be made
in the prescribed manner. An American case illustrates this:28
A offered to buy flour from B requesting that acceptance should be sent
by the wagon which brought the offer. B sent his acceptance by post, think-
ing that this would reach the offeror more speedily. But the letter arrived
after the time of the wagon. A was held to be not bound by the acceptance.
What would have been the result if the mail had reached earlier than the
wagon? According to Winfield and Cheshire and Fifoot, 30 in that case the
offeror would have been bound unless "he had an exclusive preference for
reply by wagon". A minor departure from the prescribed mode of communi-
cation should not upset the fact of acceptance provided that the communica-
tion is made in an equally expeditious way, "for, in a case where the offeree
was told to reply 'by return of post' it was said by the Court of Exchequer
Chamber that a reply sent by some other method equally expeditious would
constitute a valid acceptance".
Where the notice to exercise an option to purchase a building land was
required to be sent by registered or recorded delivery post but it was sent by
ordinary post and received within time, the court was of the opinion that the
letter amounted to binding contract even though it was sent by ordinary post.
This Anglo-American rule has, however, not been strictly followed in the
Indian Contract Act. Section 7 deals with this matter.
S. 7. Acceptance must be absolute.-In order to convert a proposal into a
promise, the acceptance must-
(1) be absolute and unqualified,
(2) be expressed in some usual and reasonable manner, unless the pro-
posal prescribes the manner in which it is to be accepted. If the proposal

[S. 7]
https://t.me/LawCollegeNotes_Stuffs
Communication of acceptance 31
prescribes a manner in which it is to be accepted, and the acceptance is
not made in such manner, the proposer may, within a reasonable time
after the acceptance is communicated to him, insist that his proposal
shall be accepted in the prescribed manner, and not otherwise; but, if he
fails to do so, he accepts the acceptance.
Effect of departure from prescribed manner
The section. no doubt requires that acceptance should be made in the
manner prescribed in the proposal. But a departure from that manner does
not of itself invalidate the acceptance. A duty is cast on the offeror to reject
such acceptance within reasonable time and if he fails to do so, the contract
is clinched on him and he becomes bound by the acceptance. The section
thus marks a visible departure from the English law and should, therefore,
be read without reference to the English law on the subject.
English law is also now coming partly in line with Section 7. Article 7 of
the Uniform Law on the Formation of Contracts for the International Sale
of Goods, appended to the Uniform Laws on International Sales Act, 1967,
contains the following provisions:
1. An acceptance containing additions, limitations, or other modifica-
tions shall be rejection of the offer and shall constitute a counter-offer.
2. However, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but
which contains additional or different terms which do not materially
alter the terms of the offer shall constitute an acceptance unless the
offeror promptly objects to the discrepancy; if he does not object, the
terms of the contract shall be the terms of the offer with the modifica-
tions contained in the acceptance.
It has been held by the Calcutta High Court that where an offeror
requires that the acceptance should be sent to a particular person, it "has
to be read in a reasonable and in a sensible manner" and there was no vio-
lation of Section 7 when the offeree, instead of writing to the particular
person, met him personally to communicate his acceptance. The defendant
was bound by the acceptance.
There is however, one advantage to the acceptor in following the pre-
scribed mode. By giving his acceptance in that mode, he has done all that
the offeror required him to do and he is entitled to the contract, even if the
acceptance does not reach the offeror.
Where no manner prescribed: reasonable and usual manner
Where no mode of acceptance is prescribed, acceptance must "be
expressed in some usual and reasonable manner". Mail is, of course, a very
reasonable manner in such cases. In England the rule is that where an offer

32 Chapter 2 Acceptance
[S. 7]
is received through post, acceptance may also be communicated by post. But
in India, in view of the language of Section 7, post may be used as a mode
of communication in all cases where it is reasonable, except when the offer
requires a particular form of communication.
When contract concluded (postal communication)
When the parties are at a distance and are contracting through post or
by messengers, the question arises when is the contract concluded? Does
the contract arise when the acceptance is posted or when it is received. The
question first arose in England in Adams v Lindsell:33
On September 2, 1817, the defendants sent a letter offering to sell quan-
tity of wool to the plaintiffs. The letter added "receiving your answer in
course of post". The letter reached the plaintiffs on September 5. On that
evening the plaintiffs wrote an answer agreeing to accept the wool. This
was received by the defendants on September 9. The defendants waited
for the acceptance up to September 8 and not having received it, sold the
wool to other parties on that date. They were sued for breach of contract.
It was contended on their behalf that till the plaintiffs' answer was actu-
ally received there could be no binding contract and, therefore, they were
free to sell the wool on 8th. But the court said:
If that were so, no contract could ever be completed by post. For if the
defendants were not bound by their offer when accepted by the plaintiffs
till the answer was received, then the plaintiffs ought not to be bound till
after they had received the notification that the defendants had received
their answer and assented to it. And so it might go on ad infinitum
(endlessly).
The result of the decision is that a complete contract arises on the date
when the letter of acceptance is posted in due course. This rule was affirmed
by the Court of Appeal in Household Fire & Accident Insurance Co v
Grant:34
The defendant in this case had applied for allotment of 100 shares in
the plaintiff company. A letter of allotment addressed to the defendant at
his residence was posted in due time, but it never reached the defendant.
Nevertheless he was held bound by the acceptance.
THESIGER LJ stated the rule thus: "An acceptance which only remains in
the breast of the acceptor without being actually and by legal implication
communicated to the offeror, is no binding acceptance.... But if the post be
treated as the agent of both parties, then as soon as the letter of acceptance

ance letter posted in due time was delayed by one day as the slippery state of roads from frost
prevented the mail bag from reaching the station before departure of the train, nevertheless
the defendants were held bound.

Page 169

Communication of acceptance 33
is delivered to the post office, the contract is made as complete and final and
absolutely binding as if the acceptor had put his letter into the hands of a
messenger sent by the offeror himself as his agent to deliver the offer and to
receive the acceptance. ... The acceptor, in posting the letter has put it out of
his control and done an extraneous act which clinches the matter, and shows.
beyond all doubt that each side is bound. How, then, can a casualty in the
post office, whether resulting in delay, which in commercial transactions is
often as bad as no delivery, or in non-delivery, unbind the parties or unmake
the contract."35
The Indian Contract Act, in Section 4 adopts a rather peculiar modifi-
cation of the rule. According to the section, when a letter of acceptance is
posted and is out of the power of the acceptor, the proposer becomes bound.
But the acceptor will become bound only when the letter is received by the
proposer. The section runs as follows:
S.4. Communication when complete.-The communication of an accept-
ance is complete, as against the proposer, when it is put in a course of transmis-
sion to him, so as to be out of the power of the acceptor; as against the acceptor,
when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer.
Thus the provision makes no difference in the position of the offeror. The
offeror becomes bound when a properly addressed and adequately stamped
letter of acceptance is posted. This aspect was emphasised by the Allahabad
High Court in Ram Das Chakarbarti v Cotton Ginning Co Ltd.³
A letter of allotment of shares was claimed to have been posted by a
company, but the applicant denied to have received it.
The High Court said: "It follows from this (Sections 4 and 5) that a notice
of allotment, which is the acceptance of the offer to purchase shares, is com-
municated to the allottee when it is despatched, and from that moment there
is a complete contract for him. Whether or not he receives the letter is abso-
lutely immaterial."37 However, the company failed to furnish any evidence
of the posting of the notice of allotment.
35. There was a strong dissenting judgment by BRAMWELL LJ. According to him if the commu-
nication of acceptance is complete at the time of posting, the same should be true of all com-
munications sent through post. "Suppose," he said, “a man has paid a tailor by cheque, and
posts a letter containing a cheque to his tailor, which never reaches, is the tailor paid?... The
question then is, is posting a letter which is never received a communication to the person
addressed?" His Lordship answered by saying "that it is not a communication". Many other
problems illustrating the absurdity of the rule appear in the judgment of his Lordship. See,
for example, the opinion of Lord BRAMWELL in British & American Telegraph Co v Colson,
(1871) LR 6 Exch 108, where the defendant was held to be not bound by a letter of acceptance
which was lost in the course of post. His Lordship said: "If a man proposed marriage and
the woman was to consult her friends and let him know, would it be enough if she wrote and
posted a letter which never reached him?" For other arguments against the rule, see Winfield,

34 Chapter 2 Acceptance
CASE PILOT
[S. 4]
The contract is concluded at the place from where the proposal is accepted
and communication of acceptance is despatched, i.e. the address at which
the proposal was sent. The court at that place would have jurisdiction to
entertain a cause of action under the contract. 38
Difference between English and Indian laws
The only difference that the section makes is in the position of the accep-
tor. In England when a letter of acceptance is posted, both the offeror and
the acceptor become irrevocably bound. But in India, the acceptor does not
become bound by merely posting his acceptance. He becomès bound only
when his acceptance "comes to the knowledge of the proposer". The gap of
time between the posting and the delivery of the acceptance can be utilised
by the acceptor for revoking his acceptance by a speedier communication
which will overtake the acceptance.
The peculiarity of this rule is that after an acceptance is posted and before
it comes to the knowledge of the offeror, only one party, that is, the offeror,
is bound. The acceptor still has the right to recede from the contract by
revoking his acceptance. A contract, on the other hand, means an agreement
which binds both the parties to it.40
When parties in direct communication
This rule, that the communication of an acceptance is complete as against
the proposer when the letter is posted, is probably intended to apply only
when the parties are at a distance and they communicate by post. In England
also its operation has been confined only to cases where the post is used, and
the illustration (b), appended to Section 4 also supposes communication by
post. "Where, however, the parties are in each other's presence or, though
separated in space", they are in direct communication, as, for example, by
telephone, no contract will arise until the offeror receives the notification of
acceptance. This appears from the speeches delivered in Entores Ltd v Miles
Far East Corporation." DENNING LJ observed as follows:
Let me first consider a case where two people make a contract by word
of mouth in the presence of one another. Suppose, for instance, that I
by acceptor was held effective though the other party refused to receive it and it came back
undelivered.

Communication of acceptance 35
shout an offer to a man across a river or a courtyard but I do not hear
his reply because it is drowned by an aircraft flying overhead. There is
no contract at that moment. If he wishes to make a contract, he must
wait till the aircraft is gone and then shout back his acceptance so that
I can hear what he says.... Now take a case where two people make a
contract by telephone. Suppose, for instance, that I make an offer to a
man by telephone and, in the middle of his reply, the line goes 'dead' so
that I do not hear his words of acceptance. There is no contract at that
moment...
The facts of the case were that an offer was made from London by telex to
a party in Holland and it was duly accepted through the telex, the only ques-
tion being as to whether the contract was made in Hollandior in England.
The Court of Appeal-held that telex is a method of instantaneous communi-
cation and "the rule about instantaneous communications between the par-
ties is different from the rule about the post. The contract is only complete
when the acceptance is received by the offerer; and the contract is made at
the place where the acceptance is received."42
Where, however, the proposal and acceptance are made by letters, the
contract is made at the place where the letter of acceptance is posted. It has
been observed by the Supreme Court that "authorities in India exhibit
a fairly uniform trend that in case of negotiations by post the contract is
complete when acceptance of the offer is put into a course of transmission
to the offerer". Thus where a premium due on a life insurance policy was
sent by money order, it was held that the policy had revived from the date
of the money order and not from the date of its receipt by the company. The
assured having died in the meantime, his widow recovered the proceeds.45
Whatever merit this rule may have from the point of view of the assured
or the offeree, it certainly makes the position of the offeror miserable. The
current feeling, therefore, is that even in reference to postal communications
the principle of consensus or "meeting of minds" should be adhered to and
there should be no contract till the acceptance is received. Thus in Holwell
Securities Ltd v Hughes% an option to purchase land was exercisable by
notice, it was held that the mere posting of the notice which was never deliv-
ered was not a valid exercise of the option.
42. This was affirmed by the House of Lords in Brinkbon Ltd v Stahag Stahl Und
Stahlwarenhandelsgesellschaft M.B.H., (1983) 2 AC 34: (1982) 2 WLR 264 (HL), the con-
tract was held to be made in Vienna where acceptance was received.
43. In Sepulchre Bros v Sait Khushal Das Jagjivan Das Mehta, AIR 1942 Mad 13, the Madras
High Court held that although an acceptance by post is complete when the letter is posted,
it is a continuing act until it reaches the person to whom it is communicated and thus can be
taken to be made also at the place where it is received. But this opinion has not been followed.

36 Chapter 2 Acceptance
CASE PILOT
Supreme Court approval of "Entores case"
[S. 7]
The principle of the Entores case has been endorsed by the Supreme Court
in Bhagwandas Goverdhandas Kedia v Girdharilal Parshottamdas & Co."7
In this case, the plaintiffs made an offer from Ahmedabad to the defendants
at Khamgaon to purchase certain goods and the defendants accepted the
offer. The question was whether the conversation resulted in a contract at
Khamgaon or at Ahmedabad. A majority of the judges (HIDAYATULLAH J
[afterwards CJ]) (dissenting) preferred to follow the English rule as laid down
in the Entores case and saw no reason for extending the post office rule
to telephonic communications. SHAH J (afterwards CJ) felt that "Section 4
does not imply that the contract is made qua the proposer at one place and
qua the acceptor at another place. The contract becomes complete... when
the acceptance of offer is intimated to the offerer." But, he continued to say,
that the draftsman of the Indian Contract Act could not have envisaged use
of telephone because it had not yet been invented and, therefore, the words
of the section should be confined to communications by post.
HIDAYATULLAH J (afterwards CJ) was, on the other hand, convinced that
though "the law was framed at a time when telephones, wireless, Telstar
and Early Bird were not contemplated", the language of Section 4 is flexible
enough to cover telephonic communications. The courts should not com-
pletely ignore the language of the Act. When the words of acceptance are-
spoken into the telephone, they are put into the course of transmission to the
offerer so as to be beyond the power of the acceptor. The acceptor cannot
recall them. The communication being instantaneous the contract immedi-
ately arises.
Communication by fax is similar to communication by telex.
Communication by fax is also instantaneous communication. If operates
through telephone connection. The normal rule applies. Fax communication,
like telephonic communication, becomes complete when the acceptance is
received by the offeror." The mere absence of a signed formal contract does
not affect the unconditional acceptance of a proposal or implementation of
the contract resulting from it. The unconditional acceptance of a contract
through e-mail of an offer made through e-mail specifying the terms and
conditions satisfied the requirements of Sections 4 and 7.9
ABSOLUTE AND UNQUALIFIED
Section 7 provides:
In order to convert a proposal into a promise, the acceptance must be abso-
lute and unqualified.

Absolute and unqualified 37
[S. 7]
Counter proposals
"Any departure from the terms of the offer or any qualification vitiates
the acceptance unless it is agreed to by the person from whom the offer
comes. In other words, an acceptance with a variation is no acceptance; it is
simply a counter-proposal, which must be accepted by the original promisor
before a contract is made."50 The facts of the case in which this statement
occurs were as follows:
Before accepting an offer the plaintiff introduced certains terms like
'Free Bombay Harbour and interest', which were not there in the original
offer. This, the defendant refused to accept. Subsequently the plaintiff
communicated his acceptance of the original offer, but the defendant did.
not assent to this. Plaintiff's action for breach of contract was dismissed.
Sir JENKINS CJ said: "Unless there is an absolute and unqualified accept-
ance, the stage of negotiations has not yet passed, and no legal obligation
is imposed." The plaintiff's first acceptance with new terms was in fact a
counter offer which implied the rejection of the original offer. A counter
offer puts an end to the original offer and it cannot be revived by subsequent
acceptance. In another case:$1
A offered by a letter to sell certain claims to B at a specified rate. B in
turn offered to buy at a little less rate which A did not accept, but he did
not withdraw his original offer. Then B accepted the rate as originally
offered. This also A did not accept and B sued him for breach of contract.
It was held that B by his counter-offer to buy at a reduced rate impliedly
rejected A's original offer and there was no contract.
The court relied upon Hyde v Wrench. In this case an offer to sell
a farm for £1000 was rejected by the plaintiff, who offered £950 for it.
This was turned down by the offeror and then the plaintiff agreed to pay
£1000. Holding that the defendant was not bound by any such accept-
ance, the court said: "The defendant offered to sell it for £1000, and if
that had been at once unconditionally accepted, there would undoubtedly
have been a perfect binding contract, instead of that, the plaintiff made an
offer of his own, to purchase the property for £950 and thereby rejected the
offer previously made by the defendant. It was not afterwards competent
for him to revive the proposal of the defendant, by rendering an accept-
ance of it. Therefore, there exists no obligation of any sort between the
parties."53
50. Per Sir JENKINS CJ in Haji Mohd Haji Jiva v E. Spinner, ILR (1900) 24 Bom 510, 523; Food
Corporation of India v Ram Kesh Yadav, (2007) 9 SCC 531: AIR 2007 SC 1421, a condi-
tional offer has to be accepted or rejected with a counter-offer, the offeree cannot accept a
part of it.

38 Chapter 2 Acceptance
[S. 7]
Where the proposal carried an acceptance slip with certain conditions
and said that the acceptance should be signed on the slip and not in any
other manner and the offeree accepted by means of a separate letter without
signing the slip, it was held that the acceptance was good because the offeror
had to protest against such acceptance and he having not done so the condi-
tions on the slip became waived.54
Partial acceptance
Acceptance should be of the whole of the offer. The offeree cannot accept
a part of its terms which are favourable to him and reject the rest. Such
an acceptance is another kind of counter-proposal and does not bind the
offeror unless he agrees to the qualified acceptance. Thus, in a case:55
An application for certain shares in a company was made on the con-
dition that the applicant would be appointed cashier in a new branch of
the company. The company allotted him some shares without fulfilling
the condition and claimed the share money.
It was held "that the petitoner's application for 100 shares was condi-
tional and that he had no intention to become a member of the company
when he applied for the shares until he was appointed a cashier in the branch
office",
Inquiry into terms of proposal
A mere inquiry into the terms of a proposal is not the same thing as a
counter-proposal. In a negotiation for the sale of a quantity of iron, the
proposal was "I would now sell for 40s. net cash, open till Monday". The
offeree inquired by wire whether the offeror would accept 40s. for delivery
over two months or less. The offeror, treating this as a rejection, sold off the
goods. He was held liable for the breach. To seek an explanation of the terms
is something different from introducing new terms.57 An inquiry about the
technical details of a proposal is not a counter-proposal. On acceptance of
the proposal, the contract will be created on the basis of the terms and con-
ditions of the original proposal including arbitration clause."

Some instances
Absolute and unqualified 39
In a Karnataka case a Government company drew out a scheme for
procuring machinery on hire-purchase basis for small-scale firms. A firm
requested the company to arrange for the supply of a machine of a particular
maker. The company requested the maker to supply the machine to the firm
along with agreement forms for signature. The firm received the machine
but did not sign the forms. Even so it was held that a complete agreement
had already arisen between the parties.
In another case,60 an offeror asked the offeree to attend to everything
else afterwards and send him 15 to 20 bags of areca nuts at once. The
offeree wrote back that he would send the goods within 15 to 20 days.
The offeror did not reply and ultimately about a month and a half later
the offeree sent the goods. The court held that there was no absolute or
unqualified acceptance within the meaning of Section 7(1). It was an order
for immediate supply and the offeree by asking for 15 or 20 days' time had
made a counter-proposal. This destroyed the original offer. Where a tender
was accepted subject to a new stipulation that the contractor would have
to provide supervisory staff as required by the Mines Act (35 of 1952), the
acceptance was of no effect. 61
Similarly, where a person asked to supply goods, accepted the offer, but
subject to the payment of an advance, it was held that the demand for an
advance was a new term and also an uncertain term because the amount
was not specified and, therefore, prevented the contract from arising.62 The
court distinguished this case from another case where after receiving a coun-
ter-proposal, the offeror rejected it and repeated his original offer which
was then accepted by the offeree, a contract was deemed to have arisen.63
Where a landowner, on receiving a proposal, wrote back to the proposer to
know whether he would offer a higher price and, if so, whether he would
send some advance, and the latter accepted it by sending some advance, a
contract arose leaving no chance for revocation.4
A person expressed a desire to purchase the Council house in which he
was living. The Council sent him a letter which said "I refer to your request

be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase price of £2180". He
sent in an application and stated that he wished to buy the house. The issue
before the House of Lords was whether the Council's letter amounted to an
offer. It was held that this letter was not a contractual offer capable of being
converted into a legally enforceable open contract by applicant's written
acceptance of it.
A written contract was executed between the parties for telecast-
ing 65 episodes of a TV serial. Prior to this there was an oral approval
by Doordarshan Authorities of the proposal to telecast 500 episodes. That
approval was held to be only a part of the continuing negotiations. It could
not have any effect because the parties subsequently bound themselves by a
definite written contract.66
Acceptance with condition subsequent
If an acceptance carries a condition subsequent, it may not have the effect
of a counter-proposal. Thus, where an acceptance said: "terms accepted,
remit cash down Rs 25,000 by February 5, otherwise acceptance subject
to withdrawal", this was not a counter-proposal, but an acceptance with
a warning that if the money was not sent the contract would be deemed
to have been broken." In another case, after invitation for and submission
of tender, there were some negotiations between the parties. Acceptance
was communicated to the tenderer by FAX stating that "a regular purchase
order follows". The court said that this concluded the contract. The require-
ments of signatures of parties and collaborators and furnishing of bank
guarantees for due performance were subsequent conditions. They were

not like a conditional acceptance or a counter-proposal. Communication of
collaborators' approval was not necessary because the main tenderer was
acting on their behalf."
Acceptance of counter proposal
Even "where the acceptance of a proposal is not absolute and unqualified
the proposer may become bound, if, by his subsequent conduct, he indicates
that he has accepted the qualifications set up". Thus in Hargopal v People's
Bank of Northern India Ltd:70
An application for shares was made conditional on an undertaking by
the bank that the applicant would be appointed a permanent director of
the local branch. The shares were allotted to him without fulfilling the
condition. The applicant accepted the position as shareholder by accept-
ing dividends, filing a suit to recover it and by pledging his shares.
It was, therefore, held, "that he could not contend that the allotment was
void on the ground of non-fulfilment of the condition as he had by his con-
duct waived the condition".
When a counter-proposal is accepted, a contract arises in terms of the
counter-proposal, and not in terms of the original proposal.
An offer to sell a machine contained a price variation clause whereby
it was a condition of acceptance that goods would be charged at prices
ruling at the date of delivery. The offeree placed an order for the machine
in their form which did not contain any variation clause and which had
a tear-off acknowledgement slip. The proposers signed and returned the
slip. The machine was ready for delivery by September but the buyers
could not accept it until November. The sellers invoked the price vari-
ation clause. The court did not permit it. The buyer's order was not an
acceptance, but a counter-proposal, which the sellers accepted and that
carried no price variation clause."
Where tenders are invited subject to a deposit, it is open to the party
inviting them to waive the requirement and an acceptance given to a tender
without deposit would be binding on the tenderer.72
Where the tenderer modified the terms of his tender within the permissi-
ble period, but the modification was only partly accepted by the other side
without the tenderer's consent, no contract arose. Earnest money could not
be forfeited.73

42 Chapter 2 Acceptance
Provisional acceptance
[S. 7]
An acceptance is sometimes made subject to final approval. A provisional
acceptance of this kind does not ordinarily bind either party until the final
approval is given. Meanwhile the offeror is at liberty to cancel his offer. The
decision of the Punjab High Court in Union of India v S. Narain Singh is
an illustration in point. The court observed as follows:
Where the conditions of auction sale of liquor shop expressly provide
that the acceptance of the bid shall be subject to the confirmation of the
Chief Commissioner, there will be no complete contract till the accept-
ance of the highest bid is confirmed by the Chief Commissioner and the
person whose bid has been provisionally accepted is entitled to withdraw
his bid.
The bidder will have the right to withdraw his bid even where it is a con-
dition of the auction sale that a bid which has been provisionally accepted
cannot be withdrawn." "Such a prohibition against withdrawal does not
have the force of law unless there is some consideration to bind him down to
the condition." In another case:76
A bid at an auction was accepted kutcha pucca and was referred to the
owner of the goods for approval and sanction. The bidder was allowed to
revoke his bid before the approval came in.
When a provisional acceptance is subsequently confirmed, the fact should
be notified to the offeror, for it is only then that he becomes finally bound.
An acceptance is not complete till communicated. A mere noting of accept-
ance in the auction file inside the office is not enough. Even if the bidder
comes to know of that fact of his own, that will not do." The Madras High
Court, however, held in two cases," that confirmation need not be noti-
fied. The court said: "The communication of acceptance twice, that is, once
when the conditional acceptance is made and again when the condition is
fulfilled is unnecessary." In Pollock and Mulla," "it is submitted that these
two cases were wrongly decided".
Where an offer for the sale of immovable property was accepted "subject
to the condition that the title adduced should be to the satisfaction of the
purchaser's solicitors", it was held that the offeror "must prove either that
the solicitors did approve of the title or that there was such a title tendered as

made it unreasonable not to approve of it". Similarly, in Koylash Chunder
Doss v Tariney Churn Singhee:1
The defendant accepted to buy the plaintiff's house for a specified price
and called him to come to the attorney's house with title deeds and receive
the earnest money. They met at the attorney's office in the absence of
the attorney and no inspection of title deeds or payment of the earnest
money, therefore, could take place.
CUNNINGHAM J observed: "If there be a distinct offer on one side, and a
distinct acceptance on the other, a contract arises notwithstanding that the
parties may have recorded their intention that it shall be put into a more for-
mal shape by a solicitor. But, on the other hand, if on the true construction
of the correspondence and evidence it appears to have been the intention of
the parties that they are not to be bound till the agreement has been put into
more formal shape and approved by them, then the parties ought not to be
bound till the formal document has been executed." Applying this test to the
facts of the present case the learned judge concluded that "both the parties
having treated the payment of earnest money as an element in the contract,
the contract could not be completed till the amount of earnest money had
been ascertained", 2
Provisional or tentative arrangements
Thus, it is a question of fact in each case whether the parties intend to
be bound by the provisional agreement or whether that is only a tentative
arrangement. In Winn v Bull the parties entered into an agreement for a
lease "subject to the preparation and approval of a formal contract". When
the final draft was prepared the parties could not agree on its terms. Holding
that there was no contract, JESSEL MR said that this was an agreement sub-
ject to the terms being approved and the terms were not approved. Similarly,
an agreement for the sale of a house stated that it is "subject to! contract",
The seller wrote to the buyer that he has signed the final agreement and
would be glad to exchange it with the part of the contract which was to be
signed by the buyer. the buyer thereupon sent the part signed by him but
the seller changed his mind and refused to send his part in exchange. Lord
GREENE MR held, for the Court of Appeal, that the agreement was subject
to the parts being exchanged and, therefore, neither party was bound till the

exchange actually took place." His Lordship distinguished the case from
his own decision in Branca v Cobarro. An agreement for the sale of the
lease and goodwill of a mushroom farm contained the terms of payment,
a forfeiture clause and finally concluded: "This is a provisional agreement
until a fully legalised agreement drawn up by a solicitor and embodying all
the conditions herewith stated is signed." Lord GREENE MR held that the
parties intended to be bound by this "provisional agreement" until it was
replaced by a formal contract containing the same terms.
A tender was invited for settlement of sand mahals. The matter was provi-
sionally settled with one of the tenderers. The relevant rule provided that the
settlement order was to be treated as final only after 15 days. The tenderer
received the order and revoked his tender the next day after receiving it. The
court said that withdrawal took place before finality. No contract could
arise and therefore there was no question of forfeiture of earnest money."
The parties can make a contract with retrospective effect. The parties
can say, "This contract is to be treated as applying, not only to our future
relations, but also to what has been done by us in the past since the date of
the tender in the anticipation of the making of this contract."
Acceptance and withdrawal of tenders and bids
A tender is in the same category as a quotation of prices. It is not an
offer." When a tender is approved, it is converted into a standing offer. A
contract arises only when an order is placed on the basis of the tender. These

principles were laid down by the Bombay High Court in the well-known
case of Bengal Coal Co Ltd v Homee Wadia & Co.89
The defendants signed an agreement which, among other terms, pro-
vided: "The undersigned have this day made a contract with Messrs.
Homee Wadia for a period of 12 months for the supply of a kind of coal
from time to time as required by the purchasers." Certain orders were
placed and were complied with by the defendants. But before the expiry
of 12 months they withdrew their offer and refused to comply with fur-
ther orders. They were accordingly sued for breach of contract.
The court observed as follows:
"There is no contract, but simply a continuing offer, and that each
successive order given by the plaintiffs under it was an acceptance of the
offer as to the quantity ordered, and that thus the offer of the defendants
and each successive order of the plaintiff together constituted a series of
contracts. The defendants could not revoke their offer as to orders actu-
ally given, but except as to them, they had full power of revocation."⁹
Where purchase orders were issued in terms of an arrangement of supply
but there was an option in the purchase order itself for the tenderer to refuse
to supply, it was held that no concluded contract was made and therefore the
contractor was entitled to refund of his security deposit."
In reference to a tender the Supreme Court of India has observed: "As
soon as an order was placed a contract arose and until then there was no
contract."92
Also, "each separate order and acceptance constituted a different and
distinct contract". A tenderer can withdraw his tender before its final
89. ILR (1899) 24 Bom 97; C. Jayasree v Commissioner M.C.H, AIR 1994 AP 312, no contract
till a tender is accepted. The tender inviting authority can cancel the tender before that. The
tender provided that the corporation would accept a tender if the tenderer was willing to pay
the entire bid amount within 60 days. The tenderer accepted this requirement in his tender,
but even so the corporation could cancel the tender.
90. Kalyanji Vithaldas & Sons v State of M.P., (1996) 10 SCC 762, revocation should reach

ing an order is of no effect. Overruling Shiv Saran Lal v State of M.P., AIR 1980 MP 93: 1980

the conditions of a tender was that after communication of acceptance, the tenderer must

tract, Lotus Constructions v Govt of A.P., AIR 1997 AP 200. Where the auction carried the
stipulation that the acceptance of bid would be communicated through letter of intent and
that would conclude the contract, held, contract arose on such communication in spite of the

acceptance by a work or supply order even if there is a clause in the tender
restricting his right to withdraw." But once an order is placed that will
have to be complied with. The order converts the tender into a contract: A
tender which was filed along with a bank guarantee had to be accepted by
the Authority within a certain time. The Authority asked the contractor for
extension of time. The tenderer did not agree. The Authority then informed
him that the contract was likely to be awarded to him. It was held that this
did not amount to an acceptance of the tender. The bank guarantee was
not absolute. An injunction against its encashment was granted." Where a
tenderer had revised his tendered rates before acceptance of his tender, but
even so the Authority accepted his tender at the original tendered rates, it
was held that no contract had arisen and, therefore, encashment of the bank
guarantee was stayed."
If you say to another, "If you will go to York, I will give you £100," that
is in a certain sense a unilateral contract. He has not promised to go to York.
But, if he goes, it cannot be doubted that he will be entitled to receive €100.
His going to York at my request is a sufficient consideration for my promise.

goods, I will supply it at a given price;" if the order is given, there is a com-

Calcutta decision in Aroma Enterprise v Murshidabad Zilla Parishad, (2003) 2 ICC 745
(Cal), acceptance of highest or lowest bid cannot be the criteria of best deal by any State
machinery, but rejection should be supported by reasons. Tenders should be opened under
information to tenderers. An opportunity of revision should not be given to any selected ten-
derer. It can affect the rights of others. Quotation of a much less rate for a particular item as
compared with the estimate of that item should not be a ground for rejection.

A tender will, however, be irrevocable where the tenderer has, on some
consideration promised not to withdraw it or where there is a statutory pro-
hibition against withdrawal." The Alberta Court of Appeal has gone a step
further by holding that a term in the tender against withdrawal would be
equally effective.
A construction contractor submitted a tender which stipulated that
once the tender was opened, it would become irrevocable until such time
as the contract had been signed by the successful tenderer. His tender was
found to be the lowest, but prior to the award of the contract, he notified
a clerical error resulting in a substantial underestimate. He offered to do
the work for the tender as corrected (still the lowest tender). This was
refused. The contract was awarded to the next lowest tenderer and he was
sued for the difference between the two on the basis of the uncorrected
tender.
He was held liable. The terms on which tenders were invited became a
part of the offer and there was no obligation to accept the revised tender."
Explaining why such a clause is justified, the Bombay High Court said:100
"Municipal Corporation invites bids involving large financial impli-
cations and involving the interests of the community. Withdrawal of
offers by bidders results in the escalation of costs of projects and also
delays to the detriment of public interest. Hence, by demanding appro-
priate undertakings from bidders, it protects itself and also public inter-
est. It is observed that the petitioner before it who withdrew part of his
offer on the ground that quarry owner with whom he had contacted had
declined to effect supply could not make grievance about forfeiture of
tender deposit."
Just as the tenderer has the right to revoke his tender as to future orders,
so also the acceptor of the tender has a right to refuse to place any orders
whatsoever. This appears from Secy of State v Madho Ram.101
98. See, Secy of State for India v Bhaskar Krishnaji Samani, AIR 1925 Bom 485: ILR (1925) 49
Bom 759, where certain rules prohibiting withdrawal of tenders framed under the provisions

revocation of the original offer. Forfeiture of earnest money was proper.

A tender for the supply of certain goods at specified prices was accepted
by the military authorities, but no requisition was issued during the period
of the tender.
The court said: "The military authorities were not bound, by their accept-
ance of the tender, to purchase any or all of the said goods needed by them,
from the plaintiff in the absence of a covenant to that effect. They were free
to accept the offer or not as they would think fit and they could buy the
goods from any other source without any reference to him." In other words,
the party accepting a tender can always say: "We do not intend to give any
further orders under this document and against such refusal there can be no
remedy at all."102
It was pointed out by the Supreme Court in Union of India v Maddala
Thai¹³ that a clause in a tender authorising the party inviting tenders to ter-
minate the contract at any time for future supplies does not destroy the very
basis of the contract and the clause is valid.
A tender should be completed and submitted as required by its terms:
Where signing of the tender document in full was one of the requirements,
yet the tenderer did not sign it in full and only initialed it. Rejection of the
tender was held to be not improper. 104 A tender contained instructions to
bidders to state against each work item unit rates in Indian currency and
in US Dollars or Japanese Yen. The tenderer stated 50 per cent of the unit
rates in Indian currency and 50 per cent in foreign currency. This was held
to be not a clerical or mechanical error. The tender was not allowed to be
corrected. Errors in item rates were also not allowed to be rectified. Tender's
request that errors should be ignored and his tender should be taken on the
whole was ignored.105
Where the highest bidder who had already deposited the earnest money,
participated in the auction, and deposited security money after approval of
his tender, the court said that these were the relevant criteria for holding that
there was a concluded contract. The execution of the formal contract is not
the only criterion for the making of a contract.106

acceptance of the tender on final basis, Veera Property Development (P) Ltd v T.N. Slum

No obligation to accept tender or lowest tender
A party inviting tenders is not bound to accept any tender,107 nor it is
bound to accept the lowest tender. But where the party is a Government
or any of its agencies, it should not arbitrarily pick and choose. It should
have some rules and those rules must require reasons for departure from the
normal principle to be recorded in writing. Accordingly, where an author-
ity ignored the claim of the lowest tenderer because of his bad history and
awarded the contract to the next lowest tenderer, the court did not interfere
in the decision of the authority.109 Explaining the principles which public
authorities have to observe the court found it to be settled law that a public
was allowable up to that time. Withdrawal before that period, valid forfeiture of earnest
money. Failure to declare the result within the stipulated period was held to be not material.
State of Haryana v Malik Traders, (2011) 13 SCC 200: (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 429, a bid at an
auction was not allowed to be withdrawn before the expiry of 90 days which was one of the
conditions of the auction process. Villayati Ram Mittal (P) Ltd v Union of India, (2010) 10
SCC $32, after acceptance of tender, the tenderer wanted to change his rates bringing about
revision of his quotation, held, this amounted to revocation of his tender justifying forfeiture
of earnest money.
107. Deepak Kumar Sarkar v State of W.B., AIR 2004 Cal 182, there was a clause in the ten-
der documents for rejection or acceptance of any tender without assigning any reason. No
liability for not accepting any tender. Cama Hotels Ltd v Airports Authority of India, AIR
2004 Guj 349, no mala fide shown in the withdrawal of a tender by Authorities, a mere
apprehension on the part of the petitioner that this was done to favour his business rival was

not complied with the terms and conditions of the contract on an earlier occasion. State
of U.P. v Raj Narain, (1975) 4 SCC 428: AIR 1975 SC 865, the authority ought to have
recorded reasons for rejecting the tender which quoted the lowest price. In a tender for supply
of drugs the decision to accept was to be that of the Minister of Commerce who reviewed
the decision to accept the lowest tender, there was no mala fide and review was due to rec-
ommendation of the tender advisory committee, upheld, Nestor Pharmaceuticals (P) Ltd v
Union of India, AIR 1995 Del 260. After negotiations with the lowest tenderer and others,
Government preferred a Government undertaking under a statutory right of preference, no

Rose Coop Labour and Construction (LOC) Ltd v State of Punjab, AIR 1999 P&H 244,
a tender was issued twice for the same items. Nobody was awarded after the initial tender.
The quotations in response to the second tender showed that the petitioner had quoted low-
est rates in the first tender in respect of 12 items. On that basis he was not allowed to claim
award of contract in respect of those items. Sri Sankaranarayana Construction Co v Konkan
Rly Corpn Ltd, (2004) 2 Bom CR 676, the obligation ordinarily is to accept the lowest ten-
der. Shree Gopal Bhagwan Das v State of Bihar, (2004) 2 BLJR 1311 (Pat) failure to comply

cation prescribed by the notice of tender cannot be accepted. Maa Binda Express Carrier v
North-East Frontier Railway, (2014) 3 SCC 760, bidder cannot insist that his bid should be
accepted. All that the participating bidders are entitled to is fair, equal and non-discrimina-
tory treatment. The court can examine whether the aggrieved party has been treated unfairly
or discriminated against to the detriment of public interest. Bhartiya State Bank v Bhanjan
Singh, 2014 SCC OnLine Chh 52: AIR 2015 Chh 15, the document of acknowledgement
also carried an expression to pay the time-barred debt. Thus, it became a promise to pay.

authority cannot act arbitrarily even in the matter of awarding contracts.
or distributing largesse. There ought to be a public element in all its deci-
sions and it must conform to the mandate of Article 14 and observe tenets
of equality and fair action. The court said that the acceptance of a higher
tender does not ipso facto make the acceptance illegal. A sixteen member
elected council had taken the decision in accordance with the rules. The
court continued:
"Even if two views are possible, there will be no justification for inter-
ference unless the view adopted by the authority is so grossly unreasona-
ble or tainted by other vitiating circumstances.
The view does not become unreasonable, merely because another
view would arise on the facts. The process of judicial review is not in the
nature of an appeal against the decision. Only the decision-making pro-
cess, is under review. Neither the view of the Municipality on facts, nor
its assessment of future events based on past performance, can be labelled
unreasonable. As observed by Lord HAILSHAM, two reasonable persons
can perfectly reasonably come to opposite conclusions on the same facts,
without forfeiting their title to be regarded as reasonable men. Unless the
decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable person would come to it,
it does not merit interference. As observed by the Court of Appeal in the
Tamside case: 109 'No one can be properly labelled as being unreasonable,
unless he is not only wrong, but so unreasonably wrong that no reasona-
ble person could sensibly take that view'.
It is also useful to refer to the observations of SCARMAN LJ in
Nottinghamshire County Council R v Secy of State for Environment,
Exp:110 Unreasonableness must prima facie show that the official behaved
absurdly or must have taken leave of his senses'.
The decision of the Municipal Council must be tested on the touchstone
of these principles. The decision is not under appeal and the tenability

LR 890 where the highest bidder was ignored and the allotment of the liquor licence was
being negotiated with a person who had not submitted the bid but who was offering more
than the next highest bid, it was held that the next highest bidder should have been given
opportunity to appear in negotiations. Agarwal Roadlines (P) Ltd v Indian Oil Corpn Ltd,
(2003) 1 Bom CR 495, tender rejected because the tenderer by some mistake happened to
submit the earnest money amount in the name of some other company. The court said that
administrative decisions based on hypertechnical approach treating a non-essential condi-
tion as an essential condition was liable to be interfered with. The court followed Supreme
Court authorities one of which was Poddar Steel Corpn v Ganesh Engg Works, (1991) 3
SCC 273: AIR 1991 SC 1579, where the Supreme Court did not uphold the sidelining of
a tender on the ground that the earnest money draft was required to be that of the State
Bank whereas the tenderer submitted a certified cheque of another bank. The court found
the cheque to be equally safe. It could have been accepted by the authority by waiving the
requirement because it was in their interest to get the highest bidder.

of another view will be no ground to stamp the decision with vice. As
already noticed, the past performance of the petitioner-contractor, and
the reports made by competent Authorities were considered and decision
taken by an elected body of sixteen persons, after deliberation. The deci-
sion is not unreasonable."
Another case of this kind was before the Kerala High Court in Cambatta
Aviation Ltd v Cochin International Airport Ltd. The evaluation author-
ity considered all the aspects and found the appellant to be the most com-
petent tenderer to be awarded the contract. The Board of Directors selected
another tenderer (the respondent). This decision was taken by the Board
even before taking a decision on the soundness of the other tenderers. The
minutes of the Board meeting did not give any reason as to why the Board
decided to invite the respondent. The respondent was then persuaded to
make a matching offer with that of the appellant. The court declared that
the Board of directors adopted a procedure which was clearly violative of
the principles of natural justice. The award was accordingly held to be arbi-
trary and illegal.112
A bidder at an auction acquires no vested right in the property under auc-
tion until his bid has been accepted. The mere deposit of 20 per cent of the
bid amount by the highest bidder does not amount to acceptance of his bid.
Communication of acceptance of his bid to the highest bidder is necessary
for concluding the contract.113
Where there was nothing on record to show favouritism," the court
refused to interfere and cited the following Supreme Court statement:
111. AIR 1999 Ker 368.
112. Still another similar ruling is in Lanco Constructions Ltd v Govt of A.P., AIR 1999 AP 371,
it was a tender for a World Bank Project. The lowest tender was rejected by the Government
without giving any reasons. The World Bank also noted that the rejection of the lowest bid
was without any convincing reasons and, therefore, not fair and reasonable. The decision
was liable to be set aside because it was based upon incorrect information. Chandragiri
Construction Co v State of Kerala, (2003) 1 KLT (SN) 14, negotiating with one of the ten-
derers behind the back of others, held arbitrary. Sandhu Tractors v Orissa Small Industries
Corpn Ltd, (2004) 4 BC 60 (Ori), public interest being paramount in the tendering pro-
cess, there should be no arbitrariness in award of contracts, all tenderers should be treated
alike. Gupta Enterprises v Govt of A.P. Revenue & Endowments Deptt, (2003) 2 BC 4

Kaikkara Construction Co v Govt of Kerala, (1999) 2 BC 338 (Ker DB), decision of the

held to be illegal and was set aside. There were no vitiating circumstances. Coal India Ltd v

"It cannot be denied that the principles of judicial review would apply
to the exercise of contractual powers by Government bodies in order to
prevent arbitrariness or favouritism. However, it must be clearly stated
that there are inherent limitations in exercise of that power of judicial
review. Government is the guardian of the finances of the State. It is
expected to protect the financial interest of the State. The right to refuse
the lowest or any other tender is always available to the Government. But,
the principles laid down in Article 14 of the Constitution have to be kept
in view while accepting or refusing a tender. There can be no question of
infringement of Article 14 if the Government tries to get the best person
or the best quotation. The right to choose cannot be considered to be an
arbitrary power. Of course, if the power is exercised for any collateral
purpose the exercise will be struck down."
BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) though not a part of the
superstructure of the State is nevertheless performing an important pub-
lic function involving huge amounts and public interest. A writ under
Article 226, but not under Article 32 can, therefore, lie against it."17
The debarring of a company from tendering because one of its directors
had assaulted an employee of the Authority was held to be not mala fide or
with oblique motives.118
Letter of intent to accept.-Sometime a letter of intent to accept is issued
before final acceptance. It has no binding efficacy on either party.119 The
letter of acceptance only stated the corporation's intention about acceptance
of the tender. The same was not reduced into writing. The court said that
there was no concluded contract and no work order had been issued. The
amount deposited by the tenderer could not be forfeited. He was entitled to
refund.120
Liability for failure to consider tender
A valid tender must be opened and duly considered by the inviting author-
ity, otherwise it would be unfairness. In a case of this kind where a valid
listing for a certain period in the absence of any contract clause required decision on merits
after hearing parties. Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills Ltd v State of Maharashtra, (2005) 4 Bom
CR 274 (DB), the bidder was fully aware of the terms and conditions of the bidding process
and also of the fact that it was wholly a commercial matter with no public interest, writ
did not lie to question the validity of the terms on the ground of being arbitrary. Popcorn

Absolute and unqualified 53
tender was not considered, the Court of Appeal observed:121 "In certain
circumstances an invitation to tender can give rise to binding contractual
obligations on the part of the invitor to consider tenders which conformed
with the conditions of tender. Since, in this case, tenders had been solicited
by the Council from selected parties, and since the Council's invitation to
tender prescribed a clear, orderly and familiar procedure, which included
draft contract conditions available for inspection but not open to negotia-
tion, a prescribed common form of tender, the supply of envelopes designed
to preserve the absolute anonymity of tenderers and an absolute deadline,
it was to be implied that if an invitee submitted a conforming tender before
the deadline he would be entitled as a matter of contractual right to have
his tender opened and considered along with any other tenders that were
considered. Damages were to be assessed in respect of the Council's failure
in accordance with its Standing Orders."
Where the contract was awarded to an unqualified tenderer at the cost of
the petitioner-tenderer who was qualified for the job, the court allowed the
awardee to complete the work and also allowed the aggrieved party a com-
pensation of Rs 1,00,000 to be recovered from the salary of guilty officers.122
The court followed the following observation of the Supreme Court:123
"In a work of this nature and magnitude where bidders who fulfil
pre-qualification alone are invited to bid, adherence to the instructions
cannot be given a go-by by branding it as a pedantic approach, otherwise
it will encourage and provide scope for discrimination, arbitrariness and
favouritism which are totally opposed to the rule of law and our constitu-
tional values. The very purpose of issuing rules/instructions is to ensure
their enforcement lest the rule of law should be a casualty. Relaxation or
waiver of a rule or condition, unless so provided under the ITB, by the
State or its agencies in favour of one bidder would create justifiable doubts
in the minds of other bidders. It would impair the rule of transparency
and fairness and provide room for manipulation to suit the whims of the

Refund of earnest money
Where the opening and acceptance of tenders was postponed because
of a High Court order, it was held that the tenderer was entitled to with-
draw his tender and he, having effectively withdrawn it, was entitled to
refund of his earnest money. The retention of the money by the department
after revocation was unreasonable. An order for refund could be granted
with interest. 124 Where the earnest money of a tenderer was forfeited before
acceptance of the tender and conclusion of the contract and the dispute
between the parties was also not related with the contract, a writ petition
challenging the forfeiture was held to be maintainable.125 Forfeiture of bid
security on the ground that the bidder had indulged in a fraudulent practice.
was held to be not proper because no such ground was mentioned in the bid
documents. 126 Where the lowest tenderer was found to be lacking in eligi-
bility criteria at the pre-qualifying stage itself, the court said that his tender
could be rejected. But forfeiture of his earnest money and that too without
giving him show-cause notice was illegal per se and violative of the princi-
ples of natural justice.127
Non-compliance with Requirements
A tender-inviting authority made it clear to the tenderers that only one
brand of pump sets would be accepted. They gave even the last-minute
opportunity before opening the tenders to enable the tenderers to change
their quotations accordingly. The tenderer to whom the contract was
awarded refused to comply with the supply order. The authority cancelled
the contract and the order. The authority was held to be within its right to
do so. Its action could not be regarded as arbitrary.128

Where one of the conditions in the tender was that the tenderer should
have one year experience in the work involved, the court said that such a
condition could be relaxed in favour of an otherwise competent contractor
and he could be required to produce the certificate of work later. His tender
was also the lowest one. 129
It has been held that a tender inviting quotations for disposal of trees
should mention the approximate value of the trees. It could be assessed by
the tenderers and on that basis they could quote their figures.130
A tender was submitted without complying with the requirement of sub-
mitting the performance bank guarantee. But even so the other party placed
a supply order in terms of the tender. The tenderer immediately wrote back
to say that the term of performance bank guarantee was not acceptable to
it. The court said that this amounted to cancelling one's tender. No binding
order could be placed on the bases of a tender which was still in its fluid
state.131
Tender with concessional rate
A tender offered firm rates but also offered concessional rates if the tender
was finalised within shorter period than otherwise allowed. It was held that
this did not amount to a conditional offer. It was only an inducement for
bringing about more expeditious acceptance.132
tender, it was held that more time should have been given to the tenderer to comply with the

Certainty of terms
[S. 7]
An agreement to sell immovable property must identify the property with
certainty. It should fix the price and should be based on mutuality. The
notice inviting tenders for hiring of services of vehicles did not stipulate any
period. The contract was awarded to the lowest tenderer for three years. It
was held that there was nothing wrong in it. An open ended tender cannot
be regarded as void for vagueness. The tender required that vehicles should
not be more than six months old. The manufacturer had given up the speci-
fied model. The acceptance of substitute vehicles of equal efficiency and cost
was not arbitrary.134
Government contracting
The judgment of the Supreme Court in Mahabir Auto Stores v Indian
Oil Corpn3s is of extreme relevancy. SABYASACHI MUKHERJI CJ observed
as follows:
"The State acts in its executive power under Article 298 of the
Constitution in entering or not entering in contracts with individual par-
ties. Article 14 of the Constitution would be applicable to such exercise
of power. The action of State organ can be tested under Article 14. Every
action of the State executive authority must be subject to the rule of law
and must be informed of reason. So, whatever be the activity of the public
authority, it should meet the test of Article 14 of the Constitution. If a
Government action even in the matters of entering or not entering into
contract, fails to satisfy the test of reasonableness, the same would be
unreasonable. Rule of reason, rule against arbitrariness and discrimina-
tion, and rules of fair play and natural justice are all a part of the rule
of law applicable to dealings with citizens. Even where the rights of citi-
zens are in the nature of contractual rights, the manner, the method and
motive of a decision of entering or not entering into a contract, are subject
to judicial review on the touchstone of relevance and reasonableness, fair
play, natural justice, equality and non-discrimination. It is well settled
that there can be 'malice in law'. Indeed 'malice in law' is a part of the
dimensions of the rule of relevance and reason as well as the rule of fair
play in action."

Lapse of offer 57
The court could not sit in appeal against the decision of the Tender
Committee which consisted of experts to substitute it's own decision. Scope
of interference by the court is very limited and only when the court is satis-
fied that the decision making process of the Tender Committee was actuated
by mala fides, the court might interfere in the same.136
There can be no contractual obligation on the part of government in con-
flict with the constitutional obligations. Obligations flowing from contract
must necessarily yield to obligations flowing from the Constitution and
laws.137
Preventing from tendering and blacklisting
A bidder was prevented by some elements inside the office from submit-
ting his tender. An inquiry conducted by the authorities verified the allega-
tion. The person so ruled out was permitted to submit his tender after two
intervening holidays. His tender was accepted. No prejudice was caused to
other tenderers. The work order issued to him was not interfered with.138
The condition of blacklisting a contractor arises only if the contract is
awarded and the tenderer fails to perform any part of the contract. Some
material fact may be required from the bidder about his experience for the
purpose of seeking permission for making his proposal. If any such fact is
concealed, it may disentitle the bidder from getting the contract. It may lead
to forfeiture of earnest money but not to blacklisting.119
The power of blacklisting a contractor is inherent in a party allotting
contracts. But when the party is a State, the decision to blacklist is open to
judicial review on the touchstone of proportionality and principle of natural
justice.140
LAPSE OF OFFER
Acceptance should be made before the offer lapses. An offer lapses in the
circumstances provided for in Section 6.
5.6. Revocation how made.-A proposal is revoked-
(1) by the communication of notice of revocation by the proposer to the
other party;
(2) by the lapse of the time prescribed in such proposal for its acceptance
or, if no time is so prescribed, by the lapse of a reasonable time, without
communication of the acceptance;

(3) by the failure of the acceptor to fulfil a condition precedent to accept-
ance; or
(4) by the death or insanity of the proposer, if the fact of his death or insanity
comes to the knowledge of the acceptor before acceptance.
1. Notice of revocation
Section 5 provides that "a proposal may be revoked at any time before
the communication of its acceptance is complete as against the proposer,
but not afterwards". It has already been seen that as against the proposer,
the communication of acceptance is complete "when it is put in a course of
transmission to him, so as to be out of the power of the acceptor". It means,
therefore, that the communication of revocation to be effective must reach.
the offeree before he mails his acceptance and makes it out of his power. A-
revocation is effective only when it is brought to the mind of the person to
whom the offer is made. This was laid down in Henthorn v Fraser.141
The secretary of a building society handed to the plaintiff in the office
of the society an offer to sell a property at £750 giving him the right to
accept within fourteen days. The plaintiff resided in a different town and
took away with him the offer to that town. The next day at about 3.50
p.m. he sent by post his letter of acceptance. This letter was received
at the society's office at 8.30 p.m. But before that at about 1.00 p.m.
the society had posted a letter revoking its offer. The revocation and the
acceptance crossed in the course of post. The plaintiff received the letter
of revocation at 5.30 p.m. The revocation was held to be ineffective.
Explaining the principle, Lord HERSCHELL observed: "If the acceptance
by the plaintiff of the defendant's offer is to be treated as complete at the
time the letter containing it was posted, I can entertain no doubt that the
society's attempted revocation of the offer was wholly ineffectual. I think
that a person who has made an offer must be considered as continuously
making it until he has brought to the knowledge of the person to whom it
was made that it is withdrawn."
Thus the communication of revocation should reach the offeree before
the acceptance is out of his power. An illustration to Section 5 explains the
matter. A proposes by letter sent by post, to sell his house to B. B accepts
the proposal by a letter sent by post. A may revoke his proposal at any
time before or at the moment when B posts his letter of acceptance, but not
afterwards.142
The provisions relating to communication of proposal, acceptance, and
revocation are to be found in Sections 4 and 5. These sections are as follows:
141. (1892) 2 Ch 27. To the same effect, Manchester Diocesan Council for Education v
Commercial and General Investment Ltd, (1970) 1 WLR 2041.

S.4. Communication when complete.-The communication of a proposal
is complete when it comes to the knowledge of the person to whom it is made.
The communication of an acceptance is complete,-
as against the proposer, when it is put in a course of transmission to him, so
as to be out of the power of the acceptor;
as against the acceptor, when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer.
The communication of a revocation is complete,-
as against the person who makes it, when it is put into a course of transmis-
sion to the person to whom it is made, so as to be out of the power of the person
who makes it;
as against the person to whom it is made, when it comes to his knowledge.
S. 5. Revocation of proposals and acceptances.-A proposal may be
revoked at any time before the communication of its acceptance is complete as
against the proposer, but not afterwards.
An acceptance may be revoked at any time before the communication of the
acceptance is complete as against the acceptor, but not afterwards.
Withdrawal before expiry of fixed period
Where an offeror gives the offeree an option to accept within a fixed
period, he may withdraw it even before the expiry of that period. The deci-
sion of the Madras High Court in Alfred Schonlank v Muthunyna Chetti
is an illustration in point. The defendant left an offer to sell a quantity
of indigo at the plaintiff's office allowing him eight days' time to give his
answer. On the 4th day however the defendant revoked his proposal. The
plaintiff accepted it on the 5th day.
Holding the acceptance to be useless, the court said: "Both on principle
and on authority it is clear that in the absence of consideration for the prom-
ise to keep the offer open for a time, the promise is mere nudum pactum."
Notice of revocation shall be deemed to have been served when it reaches
the offeree's address. A notice for the withdrawal of a ship from the char-
terers' services was sent by telex and was received by the plaintiff's telex
machine during normal business hours, but the plaintiff read the message
the next day. He was, however, held bound by the notice when his machine
received it.44 The court said: "If a notice arrives at the address of a person
to be notified, at such a time and by such a means of communication that it
would in the natural course of business come to the attention of that person
on its arrival, that person cannot rely on some failure of himself or his serv-
ants to act in a normal businesslike manner in respect of taking cognizance
of the communication, so as to postpone the effective time of the notice until
some later time when it in fact came to his attention."
Where the question was whether the notice for withdrawal of a ship
under a charterer-party for default in payment of hire was effective when

it was recorded on the telex machine of the charterer or on the opening of

working day,145
Acceptance of proposal under Voluntary Retirement Scheme [VRS]
The employees were given the right to apply under a voluntary retirement
scheme. The authorities had, under the scheme, an absolute discretion to
accept or reject the request of an employee. The retirement was to take effect
only after the request had been accepted in writing. The scheme was held
to be only an invitation to offer. An employee's application had the effect
of making an offer. He could withdraw it before it was accepted. A term in
the scheme which prevented the employee from withdrawing his request was
held to be not binding. It had the effect of a promise not to withdraw the
request and there was no consideration for the promise to make it binding.146
An employee first proposed to take voluntary retirement and then
requested that his resignation be kept in abeyance. The Government
accepted the resignation. The court said that the mere assertion without any
proof or affidavit that the retraction was served on the Government before
acceptance could not be accepted. The court further said that a request for
keeping the proposal in abeyance was not the same thing as withdrawing
it. An employee can withdraw his proposal of resignation. It is possible.
up to the time when the acceptance of the proposal has been communicated
to him. The court did not consider it tenable that the employee in ques-
tion should have been permitted to withdraw her proposal till she received
the cash. A resignation was submitted and it was accepted on March 31,
2003, but that it would take effect from June 23, 2003 after expiry of the
notice period of three months. The court said that the effective date of resig-
nation was the date on which the employee was going to be released and not
the date of acceptance and, therefore, in the meantime resignation could be
withdrawn.149

Lapse of offer 61
An employee made a conditional proposal of retirement and one of the
conditions was a higher amount of gratuity. The offer was accepted by
the employer. In view of the provisions of Section 4(5) of the Payment of
Gratuity Act, 1972 which have an overriding effect, the employee became
entitled to receive better terms of gratuity.10
The employer is not necessarily bound to accept the proposal of premature
retirement. No action lies against refusal to accept. In this case the applica-
tions for retirement happened to be more than expected and the number of
retirements that the employers could afford to accept was exhausted when
some applications were still left out. It was held that the employer could not
be forced to accept the whole number.151
Where the scheme stipulated that an application once made could not be
withdrawn, no withdrawal was allowed after the closure of the scheme.152
The general principles of contracting were held to be not applicable where
the voluntary retirement was under a statutory scheme which categorically
barred the employee from withdrawing the option once exercised. The terms
of a statutory scheme would prevail over the general principles.153
Agreement to keep offer open for specified period
Where the agreement to keep the offer open for a certain period of time
is for some consideration, the offeror cannot cancel it before the expiry of
that period. The owner of a house agreed, in consideration of the sum of
one pound, to give the plaintiff an option to purchase the house for ten
thousand pounds within a stated period. He was not allowed to revoke

the proposal within that time. One pound was a sufficient consideration
because it was valuable. The effect was that the offer was irrevocable for the
specified period of time and the offeree could accept it notwithstanding the
purported revocation,154
The bid carried a condition that the bid security would be forfeited in
case the bid was withdrawn during its validity period. It was held that with-
drawal of the bid during validity period even before acceptance did not nul-
lify the right of the offeree to forfeit the bid security,155
Communication of revocation should be from offerer himself
It is, of course, necessary that the communication of revocation should
be from the offeror or from his duly authorised agent. But it has been held
in England in Dickinson v Dodds 156 that it is enough if the offeree knows
reliably that the offer has been withdrawn. The facts were:
The defendant signed and delivered to the plaintiff an offer to sell a
property at a price fixed and added a postscript saying: "This offer to be
left open until Friday 9 o'clock, a.m., 12th June.' A day before the expiry
of this period the plaintiff was informed by a third person that the prop-
erty had already been sold to another. However, the plaintiff, before 9
a.m. of 12th June, found the defendant entering a railway carriage and
handed him the notice of acceptance.
The court held "that the document amounted only to an offer, which
might be withdrawn at any time before acceptance, and that a sale to a
third person which came to the knowledge of the person to whom the offer
was made was an effectual withdrawal of the offer". JAMES LJ added: "In
this case, beyond all question, the plaintiff knew that Dodds was no longer
minded to sell the property to him as plainly and clearly as if Dodds had told
him in so many words, 'I withdraw the offer"."
It is suggested in Pollock and Mulla, that this rule will not be applicable in
India for the simple reason that Section 6(1) requires in so many words that
the notice of revocation should be "by the proposer to the other party."157
Revocation of general offers
Where an offer of a general nature is published through newspapers, it
can be withdrawn by the same media and the revocation will be effective
even if a particular person, subsequent to the withdrawal, happened to per-
form its terms in ignorance of the withdrawal. In an American case, the
announcement through newspapers of a reward for reporting certain crim-
inals was withdrawn by a subsequent notification. But a person who was

working on the track of the criminals detected and reported them. He was
absolutely unaware of the revocation. He could not recover. "It was with-
drawn through the same channel in which it was made. The same notoriety
was given to the revocation that was given to the offer."158
Superseding proposal by fresh proposal
Where, before acceptance, a proposal is renewed in some parts of it and
not in its entirety as proposed earlier (proposal to sell salvage claims in
respect of 9 vessels, superseded by a subsequent proposal to sell only 4) and
the letter purports to supersede the earlier communication, such proposal
is no longer available for acceptance. The acceptance can be only of the
renewed part. The allotment of the rest of the work to another buyer would
give him a good right.159
Cancellation of allotment of land
An allotment of land was made under the order of a Development
Authority. The allottee deposited the money and an agreement was signed
by the parties. This brought about a concluded contract. A subsequent can-
cellation of the allotment by the Authority was held to be not proper. The
court said that the Authority was under a binding obligation to approve
building plans for the land. The pendency of a criminal investigation regard-
ing the allotment was held to be of no relevance.160
Revocation of bid
In the case of an auction, "the assent is signified on the part of the seller
by knocking down the hammer". "A bid may be retracted before the ham-
mer is down".161 In a Madras case:162
The appellant made a bid at an auction (the highest bid that was made)
but before the property was knocked down, he discovered that the prop-
erty was subject to a mortgage and retracted his bid. But even so the
auctioneer knocked down the property to him. The owner of the property
sued him.
The court held that "the plaintiff's bid was no more than an offer and he
was entitled to withdraw the same before it was accepted by the property
being knocked down to him by the auctioneer".163

CASE PILOT
[S. 5]
In a subsequent case,164 the same High Court extended this principle to
cases where a bid has been provisionally accepted and is subject to confir-
mation by higher officers. The bidder can withdraw before any such confir
mation takes place. This principle has been endorsed by the Supreme Court
in Union of India v Bhim Sen Walaiti Ram.165
A liquor shop was knocked down to a bidder at a public auction. This
was subject to the confirmation by the Chief Commissioner who had the
power before granting the licence to inquire into the financial condition
of the bidder. The bidder had to pay one-sixth part of the price imme-
diately and in case of any default on his part the Government had the
power to re-auction the shop and the shortfall, if any, was recoverable
from the bidder. He failed to pay one-sixth part and, therefore, the Chief
Commissioner did not confirm the bid and ordered resale. Resale realised
much less than the original bid and the question of bidder's liability to
pay the shortfall arose.
The court said: "It is not disputed that the Chief Commissioner has disap-
proved of the bid offered by the respondent. If the Chief Commissioner had
granted sanction in favour of the respondent, then there would have been
a completed transaction and he would have been liable for any shortfall on
the resale."
The question arises that when the bidder by not making the deposit
had committed a default, where was the necessity of any final confirma-
tion, which, even if given, would have meant nothing. If the Supreme Court
equated the default in making the deposit with a formal revocation, then
it would not have been necessary to say that if the confirmation had been
given the respondent would have been liable, for if the bid had been with-
drawn by the default, its confirmation would have made no difference.
The reason why the bidder has the liberty to withdraw is that the contract
is concluded only when the bid is confirmed and formal communication of
it is given to the bidder. This has been further pointed out by the Supreme
Court in Haridwar Singh v Bagun Sumbrui. A forest was knocked down
before the hammer is down. Such is the rule with regard to auctions in general, and the same
must be held applicable also to court auctions, in the absence of any law or rule to the con-
trary."; State of Punjab v Kishan Lal, (1991-92) PLR 283 where the provisional acceptance
was not approved for a long period and the bidder withdrew his bid and he was allowed 6 per
cent interest on his earnest money.

to a bidder below the minimum price. Its confirmation was still in the pro-
cess that the bidder agreed to pay the minimum. The department accepted
this and telegraphed its acceptance to the forest officer for onward transmis-
sion to the bidder. The forest officer never received the telegram. Meanwhile
another person offered a still higher price. The department accepted this and
informed the forest officer, who received this communication and passed it
on to the new bidder. It was held that no contract had been made on the
earlier bid. Whatever acceptance had taken place that was still within the
department and not communicated to the bidder.167
The auctioneer can provide the manner in which bids can be revoked. In
a case before the Supreme Court, 168 one of the auction rules provided that
"telegraphic bids or telegraphic instructions regarding bidding" will not be
considered. The defendant had made his bid by filling a bid form at the spot.
Subsequently, before the results were announced, he sent a telegram revok-
ing his bid. But the Board accepted his bid. On his refusal to perform, he was
held liable for breach. The Supreme Court felt that the words "telegraphic
instructions regarding bidding" were wide enough to include all kinds of
instructions about bids, including their revocation.
A tender was withdrawn at the stage when financial bids were still in
sealed cover and the offeree was still to take decision on awarding the con-
tract. On opening of financial bids it was found that the petitioner firm
was not the lowest bidder and no loss would have been caused due to with-
drawal. Withdrawal as made before acceptance was complete. Revocation
was permissible and therefore forfeiture of earnest money was not proper.
Where an auction bid was accepted being the highest and no further com-
munication was necessary and the bidder had only to deposit money and
subsequently the full payment within the specified time, the court said that

he was not entitled to extension of time for making payment and also not
entitled to refund of his earnest money.170 Where the tenderer sought upward
revision of his bid after it had already been accepted, the earnest money was
held to be not refundable.171
2. Lapse of time
An offer lapses on the expiry of the time, if any, fixed for acceptance.172
Where an offer says that it shall remain open for acceptance up to a certain
date, it has to be accepted within that date. It has been suggested by the
Calcutta High Court that in such a case it is enough if the acceptor has
"posted the acceptance before the stipulated time", even if it reaches the
offeror after the stipulated date. The court said, "that an effective date on
which the option of acceptance is exercised by a party is to be ascertained
from the date when the acceptance is put in transmission and the letter is
posted".
Where an offer was to last until the end of March and the offeree sent a
telegram accepting the offer on 28 March which was received by the offeror
on 30 March, it was held that the option was duly exercised.173
Where an application for admission to an institution had to be filed within
the prescribed time by sending it either by registered post or in person and
the candidate sent it by registered post some four days before the last date
but it reached after the expiry of time, it was held that the application was
too late. A majority of two judges were of the view that where delivery can
be made in a mode at the option of the sender, the agency through whom
delivery is made acts as the agent of the sender, whereas if the delivery is
made in a mode prescribed by the addressee, the agency acts as the agent of
the addressee. In the first case, delivery to the agency is not delivery to the
addressee, but in the later case it is. The dissenting judge was of the view that
if the candidate selected one of the two modes prescribed by the addressee,
the prescribed agency, i.e., post office, would be the agent of the addressee.
Where no time for acceptance is prescribed, the offer has to be accepted
within a reasonable time. What is "reasonable time" will depend upon the

could have been obtained by exercise of ordinary diligence. Even otherwise the bank sells
the secured assets as owner. Bidder's plea was untenable. Forfeiture of earnest money was
proper.

[S. 5]
Lapse of offer 67
The definition of "a reasonable
facts and circumstances of each case.
period" is a question of fact depending on the surrounding circumstances
in which the agreement was made. Where the subject-matter of the contract
is an article, like gold, the prices of which rapidly fluctuate in the market,
very short period will be regarded as reasonable, but not so in reference to
land. An offer for sale of shares allowed a month in which to accept, but
both parties agreed that a reasonable period for acceptance was an implied
term. The offeree felt that he could not make an informed decision within
one-month time and argued that a reasonable period in this context would
be one that would allow an informed decision as to whether the acceptance
was in their best financial interest. The court did not agree with this conten-
tion. The offer was made at an uncertain time. Yet the offeree wanted that
he should be allowed to accept after the uncertainties were over. This would
be unusual in this type of commercial agreement.176
3. By failure to accept condition precedent
Where the offer is subject to a condition precedent, it lapses if it is
accepted without fulfilling the condition. Where a salt lake was offered by
way of lease on deposit of a sum of money within a specified period, and the
intended lessee did not deposit the amount for three long years, it was held
that this entailed cancellation of the allotment.177
4. By death or insanity of offerer
An offer lapses on the death or insanity of the offeror, provided that the
fact comes to the knowledge of the offeree before he makes his acceptance.
In England it was felt at one time that an offer terminates at once on the
death of the offeror, whether or not the fact has come to the notice of the
offeree. MELISH LJ suggested (obiter) in Dickinson v Dodds that an offer
cannot be accepted after the death of the offeror. But in an earlier case,179
where a creditor continued to act on a guarantee without knowledge of the
surety's death, the court pointed out that an offer is not necessarily termi-
nated with the death of the offeror. It may remain open until the offeree
comes to know of death.
There is no provision in the Act about the effect of the death of an offeree.
But as an offer can be accepted only by an offeree and not by any other

person, it should not be capable of being accepted by the offeree's executor
also,180
REVOCATION OF ACCEPTANCE
According to English law an acceptance once made is irrevocable. In the
words of Anson: "Acceptance is to offer what a lighted match is to a train
of gunpowder. Both do something which cannot be undone."181 This rule is
obviously confined in its operation only to postal acceptance. It is suggested
in Anson that in other cases "an acceptance can be revoked at any time
before acceptance is complete, provided, of course, that the revocation itself
is communicated before the acceptance arrives".
In India, on the other hand, acceptance is generally revocable. An acceptor
may cancel his acceptance by a speedier mode of communication which will
reach earlier than the acceptance itself. Section 5 is the relevant provision:
An acceptance may be revoked at any time before the communication of the
acceptance is complete as against the acceptor, but not afterwards.
Thus the communication of revocation should reach earlier than the
acceptance itself. What will be the result if they reach together. The section
does not make this point clear. But the only illustration appended to the
section seems to show that in such a case also the acceptance will be deemed
to have been revoked. The illustration is as follows:
"A proposes, by letter sent by post, to sell his house to B. B accepts the
proposal by a letter sent by post. B may revoke his acceptance at any time
before or at the moment when the letter communicating it reaches A, but
not afterwards."
That this should be the principle is further borne out by Countess of
Dunmore v Alexander. 183
A proposal of service made by a letter was sent through an agent. The
agent received the acceptance and forwarded it to the principal, but the
principal was away that day. The next day the agent received the revo-
cation and forwarded it to the principal, who received the two letters
together.
The revocation was held to be effective, the court saying that "the admis-
sion that the two letters were received together puts an end to the case."
180. See, for example, Reynolds v Atherton, (1921) 125 LT 690, 695-96 (CA) and the Canadian

Standard form contracts 69
[S. 5]
Jurisdiction
In a suit for recovery of damages on account of breach of contract, the
notice terminating the contract was received by the plaintiff at a place in
Hyderabad. It was held that a part of the cause of action could be said to
have arisen at that place. The suit filed at that place was maintainable.184
STANDARD FORM CONTRACTS
Exploitation of weaker party
The law of contract has in recent times to face a problem which is assum-
ing new and wide dimensions. The problem has arisen out of the modern
"large-scale and widespread" practice of concluding contracts in standard-
ised forms.1 The Life Insurance Corporation of India, for example, has
to issue thousands of insurance covers every day,186 Similarly, the railway
administration of India has to make innumerable contracts of carriage. It
would be difficult for such large-scale organisations to draw up a separate
contract with every individual. They, therefore, keep printed forms of con-
tract. Such standardised contracts contain a large number of terms and con-
ditions in "fine print" which restrict and often exclude liability under the
contract. The individual can hardly bargain with the massive organisations
and, therefore, his only function is to accept the offer whether he likes its
terms or not. "He cannot alter those terms or even discuss them; they are
there for him to take or leave. He therefore does not undertake the laborious
and profitless task of discovering what the terms are."187 Lord DENNING MR
pointed out in Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd:188
No customer in a thousand ever read the conditions. If he had stopped
to do so, he would have missed the train or the boat.
This gives a unique opportunity to the giant company to exploit the weak-
ness of the individual by imposing upon him terms which often look like a
kind of private legislation and which may go to the extent of exempting the
company from all liability under the contract. "The battle against abuse has
fallen to the courts." The courts have found it very difficult to come to the
rescue of the weaker party particularly where he has signed the document.
In such cases the courts have been constrained to hold that he will be bound
by the document even if he never acquainted himself with its terms. This has
come to be known as the rule in L' Estrange v F. Graucob Ltd. 189

Mrs L signed an agreement without reading it under which she pur-
chased a cigarette vending machine. The agreement excluded liability for
all kinds of defect in the machine. The machine was totally defective.
The court found it as a fact that the supplier had made no effort to bring
the sweeping exemption term to the notice of Mrs L. Even so the court held:
"Where a document containing contractual terms is signed, then, in the
absence of fraud, or misrepresentation, the party signing it is bound, and
it is wholly immaterial whether he has read the document or not."150 The
result would have been different if the plaintiff had not signed.
Such contracts have been variously described. "Contracts of Adhesion",
which means that the individual has no choice "but to accept; he does not
negotiate, but merely adheres";191 "compulsory contracts", they being a
kind of imposition;192 and "private legislation", they being a kind of code
of bye-laws on the basis of which the individual can enjoy the services
offered, 193
Protective devices
The individual, therefore, deserves to be protected against the possibility
of exploitation inherent in such contracts. Following are some of the modes
of protection which have been evolved by the courts.194
1. Reasonable notice
In the first place, it is the duty of the person delivering a document to give
adequate notice to the offeree of the printed terms and conditions. Where
this is not done, the acceptor will not be bound by the terms. This was laid
down by the House of Lords in Henderson v Stevenson, 195
The plaintiff bought a steamer ticket on the face of which were these
words only: "Dublin to Whitehaven"; on the back were printed certain
conditions one of which excluded the liability of the company for loss,

injury or delay to the passenger or his luggage. The plaintiff had not seen
the back of the ticket, nor was there any indication on the face about the
conditions on the back. The plaintiff's luggage was lost in the shipwreck
caused by the fault of the company's servants. He was held entitled to
recover his loss from the company in spite of the exemption clauses.
The House of Lords observed that the plaintiff could not be said to have
accepted a term "which he has not seen, of which he knew nothing, and
which is not in any way ostensibly connected with that which is printed
and written upon the face of the contract presented to him". The result
would have been otherwise if words like "For conditions see back" had
been printed on the face of the ticket to draw the passengers' attention to
the place where the conditions were printed. The principle would, therefore,
seem to be that where a written document is presented to a party for accept-
ance, a reasonably sufficient notice must be given to him of the presence of
terms and conditions. Notice will be regarded as sufficient if it will "convey
to the minds of people in general that the ticket contains conditions". This
was clearly recognised in the subsequent case of Parker v South Eastern
Railway Co.196
The plaintiff deposited his bag at the cloakroom at a railway station
and received a ticket. On the face of the ticket were printed, among other
things, the words, "see back" and on the back there was a notice that
"the company will not be responsible for any package exceeding the value
of £10". A notice to the same effect was also hung up in the cloakroom.
The plaintiff's bag was lost and he claimed the full value of his bag which
was more than £10. The company relied upon the exemption clause. The
plaintiff contended that although he knew there was some writing on the
ticket, he did not see what it was as he thought that the ticket was a mere
receipt for the money paid by him.
MELLISH LJ pointed out that if the plaintiff "knew there was writing on
the ticket, but he did not know or believe that the writing contained condi-
tions, nevertheless he would be bound", for there was reasonable notice that
the writing contained conditions.
Where, on the other hand, a folded up ticket was handed over to a pas-
senger and the conditions printed on it were also obliterated in part by a
stamp in red ink 197 and where in another case, the words on a ticket, "For
conditions see back", were obliterated by the date stamp, 198 it was held in
either case that no proper notice of the terms had been given.

The principle has been cited with approval by the Calcutta High Court
in two cases and was applied by it in Mackillican v Compagnie Des
Messageries Maritimes de France. 200
The plaintiff accepted a steamer ticket containing conditions printed in
the French language. He claimed that he was not bound by them, being
unable to read French.
Rejecting this contention, GARTH CJ said: "Although he may not under-
stand French, he was a man of business contracting with a French company,
whose tickets he knew very well were written in the French language. He
had ample time and means to get the tickets explained and translated to him
before he went on board; and it very plainly disclosed upon the face of it
that the conditions endorsed were those upon which the defendants agreed.
to carry him." "Similarly, it has been held that where reasonably sufficient
notice of existence of the terms is given, it would be no defence to say that
the plaintiff was illiterate or otherwise unable to read."201
Difference between contractual documents and receipts, etc.
In the application of this principle the courts have had to distinguish
between two kinds of documents, namely, contractual documents and
mere receipts and vouchers. Emphasising this distinction in Parker v South
Eastern Railway Co202 MELLISH LJ said: "I think there may be cases in
which a paper containing writing is delivered by one party to another in
the course of a business transaction, where it would be quite reasonable
that the party receiving it should assume that the writing contained in it no
condition, and should put it in his pocket unread. For instance, if a person
driving through a turnpike-gate received a ticket upon paying the toll, he
might reasonably assume that the object of the ticket was that by produc-
ing it he might be free from paying toll at some other turnpike-gate, and
might put it in his pocket unread. On the other hand, if a person who ships
goods to be carried on a voyage by sea receives a bill of lading signed by the
master, he would plainly be bound by it, although afterwards in an action
against the shipowner for the loss of the goods, he might swear that he had
never read the bill of lading and that he did not know that it contained the
terms of the contract of carriage." A document is said to be contractual if it
embodies the contract, that is to say, if the persons to whom it is delivered
should know that it is supposed to contain conditions. But where the paper
is not supposed to express the conditions of the contract, it will be regarded

as a mere voucher etc., and extra care will have to be taken to communicate
its terms than mere warning on the face. A good illustration is Chapelton v
Barry UDC:203
The plaintiff went on to a beach and hired two chairs from a pile of
deck chairs belonging to the defendant Council. He received two tickets
from the attendant, glanced at them, and slipped them into his pocket.
While he was sitting on one of the chairs, he had the misfortune to go
through the canvas with the result that he suffered injury. Tickets carried
the words: "The Council will not be liable for any accident or damage
arising from hire of chairs." He said that he had no idea that there were
any conditions on these tickets and that he did not know anything about
what was on the back of them. The Council was held liable for his injury.
SLESSER LJ said: "In my opinion, this ticket is no more than a receipt,
and is quite different from a railway ticket which contains upon it the terms
upon which a railway company agrees to carry the passenger." The object of
the ticket was that the person taking it might have evidence that he had paid
the hire and the term printed on it was no part of the contract.
In such cases, Lord DENNING MR pictorially remarked in Thornton v
Shoe Lane Parking Ltd:204 "In order to give sufficient notice, it would need
to be printed in red ink with a red hand pointing to it, or something equally
startling." If this is not done, the condition would not form part of the con-
tract. The facts of the case were:
The plaintiff parked his car in an automatic car park. A notice at the
entrance stated: "Cars parked at the owner's risk". The plaintiff slipped
the money into a machine which brought forth a ticket. The barrier at the
gate was then automatically raised and the plaintiff parked in his car. He
looked at the ticket to see the time of parking, and noticed some other
words, but did not pay further attention to them. These words drew the
attention of the customer to a poster inside the garage which displayed
the conditions one of which excluded liability for any injury to the car or
customer. While taking back his car, the plaintiff was injured, for which
he brought an action and the defendants sought the protection of the
exemption clause.
But they were held liable. "The exempting condition is so wide and so
destructive of rights that the court should not hold any man bound by it
unless it is drawn to his attention in the most explicit way."
A lorry load of whisky was delivered to warehouse-keepers under a deliv-
ery note which stated that they would be liable for any loss of the goods.
The warehouse-keepers stamped the delivery note on receiving the goods.
and this carried a condition limiting their liability to £800 per ton. The

[S. 5]
goods were lost by theft and the question arose as to whose terms governed
the contract. The court said that the warehouse-keepers' conditions were
incorporated into the contract and not those of the owner and therefore the
liability was limited to £800 per ton subject to further reduction for the
bottles which were recovered after the theft.205
The mere existence of a clause in a consignment note restricting jurisdic-
tion to one court only was held to be not capable of binding the other party.
The term, being too serious, required special notification.206 The court cited
the following passage from CHITTY ON CONTRACTS:207
"The document must be of a class which either the party receiving it
knows, or which a reasonable man would expect, to contain contractual
conditions. Thus a cheque-book,208 a ticket for a deck-chair,209 a ticket
handed to a person at a public bath house, 210 and a parking-ticket issued
by an automatic machine have been held to be cases where it would be
quite reasonable that the party receiving it should assume that the writing
contained no conditions and should be put in his pocket unread."
Lord DENNING MR in George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock
Seeds Ltd212 observed:
"The clause was not negotiated between persons of equal bargaining
power. It was inserted by the seed merchants in their invoices without any
negotiations with the farmers."
Exhibited notices can become a part of the contract if they are displayed
so prominently as to bring them home to the other party before or at the
time of contracting. Thus, where a receipt issued for a deposit showed that
it was subject to the conditions exhibited on the premises and the notices
were displayed in prominent places in the premises, that was held to be a
reasonably sufficient notice, 213
Contract signed by acceptor
Where a written contract is signed by the party accepting, he becomes
bound by all its terms, whether he has read it or not. "In an ordinary case,
where an action is brought on a written agreement which is signed by the
defendant, the agreement is proved by proving his signature, and, in the

absence of fraud, it is wholly immaterial that he has not read the agreement
and does not know its contents."214
This principle was laid down in L'Estrange v F. Graucob Ltd²¹s and has
already been noted. But even in cases like this, the affected party can be
protected by the doctrine of fundamental breach or by finding that the terms
are unreasonable or that there was misrepresentation about them. The for-
mer two modes of protection will be noted subsequently, the effect of mis-
representation may be illustrated here. The leading authority is Curtis v
Chemical Cleaning & Dyeing Co.216
The plaintiff delivered a white satin wedding dress to the defendants
for cleaning. On being asked to sign a receipt, she inquired why she was
to sign it and was told that she was to take responsibility for any damage
to beads and sequins. The plaintiff then signed the receipt without read-
ing it. The receipt, in fact, contained a condition excluding liability for
any damage howsoever caused. When the dress was returned there was a
stain on it. To the plaintiff's action for damages, the cleaners pleaded the
exemption clause.
But they were held liable. Lord DENNING MR said: "In those circum-
stances by failing to draw the attention to the width of the exemption clause,
the assistant created the false impression that the exemption only related to
beads and sequins, and that it did not extend to the material of which the
dress was made," and this was sufficient to disentitle them from relying on
the exemption clause.
In a Canadian case, 217 a vendor fraudulently misrepresented the capacity
of a boiler. He was held liable in damages for the fraud, despite the presence
of an exemption clause. "A party to a contract cannot rely on an exclusion
clause to avoid liability for fraud."
Where a statement accompanies the delivery of a document, an oral
assurance may prevail over what the document provides.
A person parked his car in a garage. The attendant told him not to lock
the car. He told the attendant that there were valuable articles in the car.
The attendant told him that he would lock it after moving it to the proper
place. The briefcase containing valuables was stolen. Though the garage
owner had excluded liability for the loss of the contents of a car, he was
held liable. The attendants in such cases get an apparent authority to give

assurances about the safety of the vehicles and garage users could rely on
the assurance.2 218
The modern development in this connection is reflected by AMERICAN
RESTATEMENTS OF CONTRACTS. [S. 11, Part 13] The rule stated is that when
the other party has reason to believe that the party manifesting written
assent would not do so if he knew that the writing contained a particular
term; the term is not a part of the agreement. "Reason to believe" may be
inferred from the fact that the term is bizarre or oppressive, or from the fact
that it eliminates the dominant purpose of the transaction. An application
of this principle is exemplified by Tilden Rent-A-Car v Clendenning.219 The
plaintiff signed a motor car insurance document which carried a warning
on the face that no liability would arise if the provisions were not observed.
On the back there were terms in fine and faint print one of which was that
there would be no liability if the driver had taken any drink. The driver who
caused the accident testified that though he had consumed some alcohol,
he was not intoxicated and was capable of controlling the vehicle. Holding
the company to be liable, the court said that a signature can be relied on as
manifesting assent to a document when it is reasonable for the party relying
on the signed document to believe that the signer really did assent to its
contents. Hence the plaintiff was not bound by unusual and onerous printed
terms which were not drawn to his attention.
Notice of unusual terms
Another example is Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual
Programmes Ltd.220 The defendants, an advertising agency, required pho-
tographs for a 1950's presentation. The plaintiffs dispatched 47 transparen-
cies with a delivery note which stated that the same were to be returned in
14 days and that a holding fee of £5 per day for each transparency would
be charged if they were not so returned. The defendants did not use the
transparencies, put them to one side and forgot about them for a further
two weeks. To their utter and considerable consternation an invoice arrived
for £3783 holding fee. The court said that where a condition is particularly
onerous or unusual, the party seeking to enforce it has to show that a clear,
fair and reasonable effort was made to bring it to the attention of the other
party. The condition, in this case, was unreasonable and extortionate and
had not been sufficiently brought to the defendant's attention, it did not
form part of the contract.
In another case,221 the party was sent two apparently similar documents
for counter-signature, and one for return to the sender had additional clauses

on the reverse side which were written in a foreign language and to which
the other party's attention had not been drawn in any way. That party was
held to be not bound by those terms even though he signed and returned
those documents.
These cases show the importance of the remark of DENNING LJ in Spruling
(J.) Ltd v Bradshaw 222 to the effect that:
"The more startling a clause is, the greater the notice which must be
given of it. Some clauses would need to be printed in red ink with a red
hand pointing to it before the notice could be held to be sufficient."
The court attached equal importance to the view of the matter as expressed
by MEGAW LJ in Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd:223
When a particular condition relied on involves a sort of restriction
which is not usual in that class of contracts, a defendant must show that
his intention to attach an unusual condition of that particular nature was
fairly brought to the notice of the other party. How much is required
depends upon the nature of the restrictive condition.
In addition to this the courts are also under the statutory duty to consider
reasonableness of the clause in the light of the circumstances which were
known or which should have been known at the time of contracting. 224
2. Notice should be contemporaneous with contract
Secondly, notice of the terms should be given before or at the time of the
contract. A subsequent notification will indeed amount to a modification of
the original contract and will not bind the other party unless he has assented
thereto. A man and his wife hired a room in a hotel and paid a week's rent
in advance. When they went up to occupy the room there was a notice on
one of the walls to the effect that: "The proprietors will not hold themselves
responsible for articles lost or stolen, unless handed to the managers for safe
custody." Their property having been stolen owing to the negligence of the
hotel staff, the defendants were held liable as the court held that the notice
was not a part of the agreement. 225
Where the making of a contract is symbolised by the issue of a ticket by
an automatic machine, the question arises whether the notice printed on the
ticket has been given contemporaneously with the contract or subsequent
to it. This aspect of the matter was considered by Lord DENNING MR in
Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd. 226 In the case of tickets issued by clerks
the theory is that the company makes the offer of the ticket and the cus-
tomer by paying for the ticket without objection accepts it with all its terms.

78 Chapter 2 Acceptance
[S. 5]
He has a chance of rejecting the ticket. But where the ticket is issued by an
automatic machine, the customer cannot refuse it. He cannot get back his
money. He is committed beyond recall at the very moment when he puts his
money into the machine. The installation of the machine as ready to receive
the money is an offer and the conduct of the customer in putting his money
into the slot is an acceptance. The contract is then made. The terms of the
offer are contained in the notice placed on or near the machine. The cus-
tomer is bound by those terms if they are sufficiently brought to his notice
beforehand, but not otherwise. He is not bound by the terms printed on the
ticket if they differ from the notice, because the ticket comes too late. The
contract has already been made. The ticket is no more than a mere voucher
or receipt for the money. Applying these principles to the facts, his Lordship
said:
In the present case the offer was contained in the notice at the entrance
giving the charges for garaging and saying 'at owner's risk'. The offer
was accepted when the plaintiff drove up to the entrance... and the ticket
was thrust at him. The contract was then concluded, and it could not be
altered by any words printed on the ticket itself.
Thus it is the duty of the party relying on an exclusion clause to make it
clear to the other at the time of the contract that the same is incorporated
into the contract.
A vehicle was offered for sale at an auction; the auction conditions,
advertised by posters in the auction room, excluded all rights of buyer
to return the vehicle or claim damages. The vehicle failed to reach the
reserve price. The auction ended. It was then bought by a person by pri-
vate negotiation. The vehicle broke down almost immediately. The buyer
returned it and stopped the payment of the cheque for the price. The seller
sued him for the price.
The court delivered a judgment for the buyer. The vehicle was not of
merchantable quality. It was purchased at a private sale where the seller did
not point out to the buyer that the auction conditions would be applicable.
Imputed notice
The court said in the case of an e-ticket for contract of carriage of pas-
sengers, there is the possibility of the passenger not having read the contract
or not demanding a copy of the contract and even if a particular term is
not within the knowledge of the passenger, it could not be ignored. The
passenger would be bound by the terms of the contract. The term related to
exclusive jurisdiction of courts at Delhi. Such term could not be allowed to
be ignored.227
227. Inter-Globe Aviation Ltd v N Sachidanand, (2011) 7 SCC 463: (2011) 104 AIC 101. The
court conceded that the Lok Adalat at Hyderabad too had jurisdiction because the passenger
having been detained there, a part of the cause of action arose there.

3. Theory of fundamental breach
Standard form contracts 79
The third method is the doctrine of fundamental breach. It is a method
of controlling unreasonable consequences of wide and sweeping exemp-
tion clauses. Even where adequate notice of the terms and conditions in a
document has been given, the party imposing the conditions may not be
able to rely on them if he has committed a breach of the contract which
can be described as "fundamental". The rule has been thus stated by Lord
DENNING LJ:228
These exempting clauses are now a days all held to be subject to the
overriding proviso that they only avail to exempt a party when he is car-
rying out his contract, not when he is deviating from it or is guilty of a
breach which goes to the root of it. Just as a party who is guilty of a rad-
ical breach is disentitled from insisting on the further performance by the
other, so too he is disentitled from relying on an exempting clause.
An easy illustration is to be found in cases where goods different from
those contracted are delivered. For example, a car was sold on "as is" basis
and without any warranty or guarantee whatever. Even so the seller was
held liable when five days later the engine of the car blew up. It was not
a "car" which was delivered. Hence the contract was fundamentally bro-
ken. 229 If the car had shown any other defect which a used car is to every-
body's knowledge likely to develop, such as, for example, a transmission
problem, it would not have been regarded as a fundamental breach.230
"Core" of contract
What constitutes fundamental breach? "Every contract contains a
'core' or fundamental obligation which must be performed. If one party
fails to perform this fundamental obligation, he will be guilty of a breach of
the contract whether or not any exempting clause has been inserted which
purports to protect him."232 This may be illustrated with the facts of Davies
v Collins:233
The plaintiff entrusted to a dyer and cleaner a uniform for cleaning.
On the docket given to him when he handed over the uniform were the
following clauses: "Whilst every care is exercised in cleaning and dye-
ing garments, all orders are accepted at owner's risk entirely and we are

unable to hold ourselves responsible for damage, shrinkage, colour or
defects developed in necessary handling. The proprietor's liability for loss
is limited to an amount not exceeding ten times the cost of cleaning." The
defendant sent the uniform to be cleaned by a sub-contractor and it was
never returned. The plaintiff claimed the full value of the uniform.
It was held that the mere fact of the particular limitation clause in the
contract was sufficient to exclude any right to sub-contract the performance
of the substance of the contract. Limitation clauses of this kind do not apply
where the goods are lost not within the four corners of the contract but
while something was being done which was outside the terms of the contract
altogether, or when loss takes place in the course of some operation which
was never contemplated by the contract at all. In Alderslade v Hendon
Laundry Ltd on the other hand, the plaintiff's handkerchiefs were lost in
the laundry itself and, therefore, the exemption clause effectively limited the
defendant's liability to twenty times the charge made for laundering.
Another illustration of fundamental breach is Alexander v Railway
Executive,235
On depositing his luggage at the parcel office of a railway station, pay-
ing ordinary rates, the plaintiff received a ticket containing conditions.
one of which exempted the defendants from liability for misdelivery or
loss of any article exceeding £5 in value unless a special charge for the
same was paid. The defendants allowed the plaintiff's friend to take away
the luggage and in an action by the plaintiff relied on the above exemp-
tion clause.
But it was held that "an essential part of the executive's duty was to take
care of the deposited goods; that they had committed a fundamental breach
of the contract in allowing an unauthorised person to have access to the
goods and to take them away and, therefore, they could not rely on the
exemption clause to shield them from liability."
Departure from main purpose
In the following two cases, however, the bailees were held not liable as
the court did not find any fundamental departure from the main purport
of the contract. One of them is Gibaud v Great Eastern Rly Co. 236 Here a
cycle deposited at a station of the defendant-railway company was not in
fact taken to the cloakroom, but was left in the booking hall itself and from
there it was stolen, the company was held to be protected by the clause in
the ticket which exempted the company from liability. The Court of Appeal
could find no fundamental breach as it was no part of the contract that the
cycle should be necessarily stored in the cloakroom.

The other case is Hollins v J. Davey Ltd.237 The plaintiff's car was garaged
at the defendants' garage. One of the conditions of the contract exempted
the defendant from loss or misdelivery. One of the plaintiff's former serv-
ants called at the garage and successfully persuaded the attendant to deliver
the car to him telling him that he had been authorised by the plaintiff. The
defendants were held not liable. The attendant made the innocent mistake in
believing in the holding out by the servant. But if the attendant had delivered
the car to a complete stranger, there would have been fundamental breach.
Rule of construction
The results of these cases have been variable because it seems that the
theory of fundamental breach is not an independent rule of law, but is only a
rule of construction. A rule of law operates irrespective of the parties' inten-
tions. But a rule of construction is one of the methods of ascertaining the
parties' intention. This approach was "most clearly and accurately" enun-
ciated by PEARSON LJ in U.G.S. Finance Ltd v National Mortgage Bank of
Greece, S.A.238 His Lordship said:
As to the question of 'fundamental breach',... there is a rule of con-
struction that normally an exception or exclusion clause or a similar pro-
vision in a contract should be construed as not applying to a situation
created by a fundamental breach of contract. This is not an independent
rule of law imposed by the courts on the parties willy-nilly in disregard
to their contractual intention. On the contrary, it is a rule of construction
based on the presumed intention of the contracting parties. It involves
the implication of a term to give to the contract that business efficacy
which the parties reasonably must have intended it to have. This rule of
construction is not new in principle but it has become prominent in recent
years in consequence of the tendency to have standard forms of contract
containing exception clauses drawn in extravagantly wide terms, which
would have produced absurd results if applied literally.
This passage was cited with approval by the House of Lords in Suisse
Atlantique Societe D'Armement S.A. v N.V. Rotterdamsche Kolen
Centrale,239
The defendants chartered the plaintiff's ship for carriage of coal from
the United States to Europe for two years. The contract set out the rates
of loading and also provided that in case of any delay in loading the
defendants would have to pay demurrage at the rate of one thousand dol-
lars a day. The defendants caused delays for which the plaintiffs claimed
that the contract was repudiated but nevertheless, without prejudice to

[S. 5]
their rights, allowed the defendants to use the ship. At the end of the term
they claimed damages for the delays in excess of the demurrage clause.
The House of Lords held that there was no fundamental breach. The
defendants were guilty of conduct which entitled the plaintiffs to repudiate
the contract, but they, in fact, affirmed it. The contract remained in force
including the demurrage clause. Moreover, the demurrage clause was not
an exception or limiting clause; it only stipulated liability for breach of con-
tract and, therefore, the principle of fundamental breach was not applicable.
But even so their Lordships explained (obiter) the meaning of fundamental
breach or a breach going to the root of the contract. "These expressions",
observed Lord WILBERFORCE, "are used in the cases to denote two quite dif-
ferent things, namely: (i) a performance totally different from that which the
contract contemplates, (ii) a breach of contract more serious than one which
would entitle the other party merely to damages and which (at least) would
entitle him to refuse performance or further performance of the contract."
His Lordship then explained that if fundamental or total breach means a
departure from the contract, the question will arise how great a departure
and if it means supply of a different thing, the question will be how differ-
ent? And added: "No formula will solve this type of question, and one must
look individually at the nature of the contract, the character of the breach
and its effect on future performance and expectation and make a judicial
estimation of the final result."
These observations of the House of Lords on the question of fundamental
breach being in the nature of obiter dicta, it left the Court of Appeal free to
reconsider the question. This opportunity came in Harbutt's "Plasticine"
Ltd v Wayne Tank & Pump Co Ltd.240
The defendants agreed with the plaintiff to design and install equip-
ment for storing and dispensing stearine in a molten state at their factory.
The defendants specified durapipe, a form of plastic pipe. In fact this was
wholly unsuitable for the purpose. It burst at the very first testing leading
to a fire which destroyed the factory. The defendants had limited their lia-
bility under the contract for any accident, etc., to £2330. The plaintiff's
loss was much greater.
The Court of Appeal held that the defendants were guilty of fundamental
breach and, therefore, they could not avail of the limitation clause and were
liable for the cost of reinstating the factory. The court pointed out that one
must look not merely at the quality of the breach but also at its results. If the
result of breach is the total destruction of the subject-matter of the contract
(factory in this case) then the contract is automatically at an end along with
all its exception clauses. Lord DENNING MR considered the effect of the
decision of the House of Lords in the Suisse Atlantique Societe D'Armement
240. (1970) 1 QB 447: (1970) 2 WLR 198 (CA).

S.A. v N.V. Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale and their Lordships' emphasis
upon the rule of construction, and remarked:242
So, in the name of construction, we get back to the principle that, when
a company inserts in printed conditions an exception clause purporting to
exempt them from all and every breach, that is not readily to be construed
or considered as exempting them from liability for a fundamental breach;
for the good reason that it is only intended to avail them when they are
carrying out the contract in substance; and not when they are breaching
it in a manner which goes to the very root of the contract.243
The contrast between the Suisse Atlantique case and this case is that
though in each the defendant had limited his liability under the contract,
that is, in the Suisse Atlantique case liability for delay was £1000 a day and
in this case £2330 for any accidental damage, in the former the delay did
not operate as a fundamental breach, but in the latter the supply of unsuita-
ble material destroyed the very substratum of the contract.
That these two cases were not contradictory, but reconcilable, further
appears from the judgment of DONALDSON J in Kenyon Son & Craven Ltd
v Barter Hoare & Co Ltd,244
The plaintiff stored in the defendant's warehouse 250 tons of ground-
nuts packed in bags. The warehouse was suitable for the purpose and
was otherwise also structurally sound. The defendants had excluded their
liability for any loss or damage unless it was due to the wilful neglect or
default of the company or its own servants. The warehouse was not, how-
ever, rat-proof and the groundnuts were badly damaged by rats.
DONALDSON J referred to three categories of cases in which the rule of
fundamental breach has been applied as stated by Lord WILBERFORCE in the
Suisse Atlantique case. They are: (i) Supply of a different article; (ii) Hire-
purchase cases; and (iii) Marine cases relating to deviation. The learned judge
then stated that the Court of Appeal considered the Harbutt's "Plasticine"
case as one of deviation from the main purpose of the contract. "The breach
found consisted of the design, supply and the creation of a system or instal-
lation that was wholly unsuitable for its purpose."
Coming to the facts of the present case, the learned judge found that the
case did not fall in any of Lord WILBERFORCE'S categories. He said: "Had
the defendants stored these nuts in the open or in an area which was prohib-
ited by the contract or had they even stored them in a warehouse which was
structurally or by reason of its other contents so unsuited to such storage as

to destroy the whole contractual substratum of the contract, then none of
the defendant's conditions would have applied. That was not, however, the
position. The warehouse itself, although not perfect and therefore requir-
ing special vigilance against infiltration by rats, was not unsuitable and the
other goods stored there caused no damage to the nuts.245
It has been laid down by the Court of Appeal that where the goods are
lost from the custody of a bailee (a carpet-cleaner in this case) fundamental
breach would be presumed unless he accounts for the loss. The bailee must
show that the loss had not occurred in consequence of a fundamental breach
on his part since he is in a better position than the bailor to know what had
happened to the goods while they were in his possession. Since the cleaner
could not account for the loss he was not permitted to rely upon a clause
by which he had limited his liability to a negligible figure. Lord DENNING
went to the extent of saying that limitation clauses should not be given effect
to in contracts in standard forms where there is inequality of bargaining
power.
In a contract of carriage entered into on standard conditions of the for-
warding trade, the parties orally agreed that the goods would be carried
under the deck of the ship and not on the deck. The goods were by mistake
put on the deck and lost. The cargo-owner was allowed to recover his loss
notwithstanding the exemption clause in the standard form limiting the car-
rier's liability, because the oral promise was to be treated as overriding the
printed conditions.247
A contract for hire-purchase of a motor cycle stated that the motor cycle
was subject to no conditions or warranties whatsoever, express or implied.
The machine was defective. It was returned for remedying the faults. It was
delivered again to the buyer but all the faults were not rectified. Ultimately
there was breakdown of the chain damaging also some other parts. The
buyer finally rejected the machine and sought refund of the hire instalments
he had already paid. He succeeded. The supply of a defective machine was a
fundamental breach, this cancelled out all the exemption clauses. There was
no affirmation of the contract on the buyer's part simply by asking for and
accepting repairs, 248
Fundamental breach was also inferred where the plaintiff's factory was
burnt down by a security guard who had been provided by the defendants
to protect the factory against fire. The defendants were held liable despite a
number of exemption clauses. The limit of £25,000 as stated in the contract
was held to be not applicable.249

Definition of breach in Unfair Contract Terms Act
The theory of fundamental breach has now found statutory recognition
to some extent in the (English) Unfair Contract Terms Act, 1977. The Act
says that a party who commits breach of his contract cannot take the advan-
tage of any clause in the contract which either excludes or limits his liability.
Further, if there is any provision in the contract to the effect that "no perfor-
mance" or "substantially different performance" will be taken as equivalent
to performance, that will be of no avail. Thus the term "breach" will include
a performance which is substantially different from that contemplated by
the contract.
Resort to "fundamental breach" no longer necessary
The effect of the provision is that it is no longer necessary for the courts to
resort to "fundamental breach". The same result can be attained by resort-
ing to the test of reasonableness under Section 11 of the Unfair Contract
Terms Act, 1977 (English). This approach was in evidence in the decision
of the House of Lords in George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock
Seeds Ltd,250
The plaintiffs, who were farmers, ordered a quantity of seeds from seed
merchants. It was known to the sellers that the seed should be for winter
white cabbage fit for human consumption. The supply was on standard
terms which limited liability in case of defective goods to replacement
or refund of price. The seeds grew into unusable weeds and not fit for
human consumption.
The defendants were not allowed to claim the protection of the exemption
clause and were held liable for the plaintiffs' loss. The plaintiffs had based
their claim on fundamental breach and requirement of reasonableness. But
their Lordships preferred to go by the statutory ground.
Where as a result of the breach, the injured party rescinds the contract,
all the exemption clauses will fall with it. But if he treats the contract as still
subsisting and wants only to be compensated, it will be a matter of construc-
tion whether the type of breach which has occurred will be covered by the
exemption clause or not.
An electrical equipment was supplied under a contract to the plaintiff
to be used by him for producing chemicals. The machine turned out to
be defective so that it could not operate at full capacity. It was set right
two-and-a-half months later and then it functioned to its full capacity.
The plaintiff sued for the loss of earnings for the two-and-a-half months'
period.251

[S. 5]
He had to face a formidable exemption clause by which the supplier had
undertaken the responsibility for repair but no responsibility for consequen-
tial damage. But even so the defendant was held liable. The court said that
by supplying equipment which suffered from an error in design, the supplier
had done something which was essentially different from what was contem-
plated by the parties. The plaintiff was entitled to repudiate the contract and
was, therefore, entitled to compensation in lieu of repudiation. The court
construed the exemption clause as confined only to cases requiring repair
and not to be extensive enough to cover errors in design also.
A term in a sale of potato seeds excluded all liability unless the buyer gave
notice of any defects within three days of delivery has been held to be unrea-
sonable. In such cases the defect is likely to be discovered only when the
seed has been planted and it comes out. The other term which restricted the
seller's liability to contract price was found to be reasonable because it was
there with the approval, and as a common practice, of the whole trade.252
4. Strict construction
Exemption clauses are construed strictly particularly where a clause is so
widely expressed as to be highly unreasonable. Any ambiguity in the mode
of expressing an exemption clause is resolved in favour of the weaker party.
An illustration of this principle of construction is afforded by Lee (John)
Sons (Grantham) Ltd v Railway Executive:253
Goods stored in a railway warehouse let to a tenant were damaged by fire
and the tenant brought an action against the railway executive alleging that
the accident was due to their negligence because a spark ejected from their
railway engine had caused the fire. The defendants set up a clause in the
tenancy agreement which exempted them for loss of or damage to property
however caused (whether by act or neglect of the company or their servants
or agents or not) which "but for the tenancy hereby created would not have
arisen". The company was nevertheless held liable. The court was of opin-
ion that the words "but for the tenancy hereby created" were confined to
liabilities which arose by reason of the relationship of landlord and tenant.
Another illustration of strict interpretation is Akerib v Booth:254
By a written agreement the defendants let to the plaintiffs a few rooms
on the second and third floors of their premises for office and store pur-
poses. They retained in their possession a water-closet on the fourth floor.
The agreement provided that the plaintiffs would exclusively employ the

defendants in making up and packing all the goods brought by them for
business on the premises and that the defendants would not in any cir-
cumstances be responsible for damage caused by water, insects, vermin
or fungi to any goods. Owing to the negligence of the defendants or their
servants water escaped from the closet and caused damage to the plain-
tiffs' goods.
It was held that the exception clause must be limited to the purpose of the
contract. The purpose was to exempt the defendants from liability to goods
that came to their possession for packing or making up, etc. The exemption
clause must be confined to this and was not to apply to any other goods and
accordingly the defendants were liable.
An insurance covered loss by flood and inundation but excluded liability
for events like earthquake, typhoon, etc. Loss took place due to floods and
subsidence of the building. The court said that in view of the non-inclusion
of subsidence, the insurer's contention that the policy did not cover subsid-
ence was not sustainable. The insurer had also certified that the building
was a first class construction and, therefore, was estopped from saying that
there were structural defects.255
Contra proferentem
Where the words used in an exclusion clause are capable of two con-
structions, a wider construction and a limited construction, then the limited
construction would be preferred, for the rule of law is that "every exception
clause is to be interpreted, in case of ambiguity, contra proferentem". 256 This
means that "if there is any doubt as to the meaning and scope of the exclud-
ing or limiting term, the ambiguity will be resolved against the party who
has inserted it...."257 These principles were applied by the Court of Appeal
in Hollier v Rambler Motors AMC Ltd.258
H inquired of R over telephone whether R could repair his car. R told
H to bring the car and that it would be repaired in due course. On three

intention in doubt. But when the parties have clearly expressed what their intention is, there
is no necessity to refer to the principle. In this case insurance against fire during the execution
of the works was made by the contract a responsibility of the owner, he was not allowed to
hold the contractor liable even when the fire was due to the contractor's negligence.

H. On each occasion R was required to sign an invoice which described
the work and mentioned the charge and gave warning below the custom-
er's signature that "the company is not responsible for damage caused by
fire to the customer's car on the premises". On this occasion the customer
did not sign any such invoice and this time his car was destroyed by a fire
which occurred due to R's negligence. R was held liable.
This doctrine applies in the case of a commercial contract since the clauses
of the contract are bilateral and mutually agreed upon.259
The Court of Appeal had to face two formidable questions, namely,
whether the signature on the previous occasions amounted to a notice of the
term for this occasion also and, secondly, if it did, whether negligent fire was
within the scope of the exclusion clause. In reference to the first question
SALMON LJ had to consider two earlier House of Lords' decisions. One of
them is Henry Kendall & Sons v William Lillico & Sons Ltd.240 In this case
during the past three years three or four times in every month goods were
supplied on oral orders followed by signature on sold notes which excluded
liability for latent defects. It was held that this practice was a sufficient
notice of the terms. Distinguishing this case from the present the court said
that that was a typical case where a consistent course of dealing between the
parties made it imperative for the court to read into the contract the terms
printed on the sold notes, whereas in the present case there had been only
three or four dealings during the past five years. This was not sufficient to
establish a course of dealing. Moreover, the dealing was not consistent as on
this occasion the customer was not required to sign any invoice.
The other case is MacCutcheon v David McBrayne Ltd. In this case
M had asked his brother-in-law to have a car shipped from the Isle of Islay
to the mainland. M had personally consigned goods on four previous occa-
sions and each time he signed what was called a "risk" note. The risk note
made it plain that the company was accepting the goods on its ship on the
condition that they would not be responsible for any damage by negligence
that the goods might suffer during the course of the voyage. The ship sank
through negligence and the car was lost. M's brother-in-law had also con-
signed goods on several previous occasions. Sometimes he signed a risk note
and sometimes not. On this occasion no such note was presented to him for
signature. The House of Lords held that there was no previous course of
dealing from which the term of inclusion could be implied into the contract
which had been made on behalf of M by his brother-in-law.

After considering the case, SALMON LJ concluded: "If it was impossible
to rely on a course of dealing in the McCutcheon case, still less would it be
possible to do so in this case, when the so-called course of dealing consisted
only of three or four transactions in the course of five years."
This should have been sufficient to dispose of the case. But SALMON LJ
went further to examine that supposing that the clause had become a part of
the contract, would it have covered fire by negligence. "It is well-settled that
a clause excluding liability for negligence should make its meaning plain on
the face of it to an ordinary literate and sensible person.... The defendant
should not be allowed to shelter behind language which might lull the cus-
tomer into a false sense of security by letting him think that he would have
redress...for any damage which he might suffer by the negligence of that
person."
A car insurance policy excluded liability for "Loss, damage, and/or lia-
bility caused or arising while any such car is conveying any load in excess of
that for which it was constructed." At the time of the accident under which
the car became a total loss there were six persons in the five-seater car. The
court said that any doubt about the use of the word "load" would be con-
strued in favour of the assured. The clause should have been spelled out in
terms of specified weight. The court also gave this advice that if any insur-
ance company wishes to put forward a policy which would be inapplicable
when an extra passenger is carried, they should print that provision in red
ink so that the assured would have it drawn to his particular attention.262
Cotton threads delivered under a contract were found to be 6 per cent
shorter than they should have been and the seller sought to get rid of the
liability for short delivery by sheltering himself under the exemption clause
which said that the goods actually delivered would be taken to be in accord-
ance with the contract in all respects unless the sellers were informed within
14 days of delivery of something wrong. The buyers discovered the shortage
when they put the threads to actual use and that was much later than 14.
days. The court did not permit the seller to use his clause for creating this
phenomenon that goods not delivered should be taken to have been deliv-
ered. There was no warrant for an implication to the effect that non-delivery
in length or small measure was included in the objections which should,
within the time-limit, be made to goods delivered.263

closely to the building, held, fell within the expression damage by "impact". Even if its mean-
ing was not clear, it was to be taken in favour of the insured.

Interpretation of price review and escalation clauses

In a case before the Supreme Court 264 a clause in a contract for supply of
electricity provided:
"The rate of supply as determined in Clause 17 shall be reviewed every
fifth year provided the component of the cost of generation out of the
total cost varies by 25 per cent or more."
The consumer contended that this was a price escalation clause and
would permit increase from the base price only according to a rise in the
cost of production. The Supreme Court did not accept this. Explaining the
distinction between an "escalation" clause and a "price review" clause, A.K.
SEN J said:
An escalation clause, according to its accepted legal connotation means
a clause which takes care of the rise and fall of prices in the market,
whereas the right to review confers the power to revise the rate of supply.
The word 'review' necessarily implies the power of the Board to have a
second look and to so adjust from time to time its charges so as to carry
on its operation under the Act without sustaining a loss.
The court referred to Butterworth's ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF FORMS AND
PRECEDENTS,265 Hudson's BUILDING AND ENGINEERING CONTRACTS, 266
Keating's BUILDING CONTRACTS 267 and Black's LAW DICTIONARY, 268 which
portray different forms of "rise and fall" or escalator clauses in building
and commercial contracts. The court cited the following passage from
AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE, 269
In some contracts there is what is known as an escalator or fluctuation
clause which is defined as one in which the contract fixes a base price but
contains a provision that in the event of specified cost increase, the seller
or contractor may raise the price up to a fixed percentage of the base
and such escalator clauses are generally held to be sufficiently definite for
enforcement.

Standard form contracts 91
The court also cited the following passage from CORPUS JURIS
SECUNDUM:270
[A] contract giving one of the parties the right to vary the price is not
unenforceable for lack of mutuality where the right is not an unlimited
one, as where its exercise is subject to express or implied limitation, such
as that the variation must be in proportion to some objectively deter-
mined base, or must be reasonable, and this rule has been applied to
contracts containing so-called 'escalator' clauses.
Where under a housing scheme, the price to be charged is made expressly
variable, the allottees cannot claim any estoppel against variation nor seek
refund on the ground of any proposed, but reasonable, variation.271
The Supreme Court held that the power to vary terms relating to quan-
tum of work cannot be unlimited. Any clause giving absolute power to one
party to modify the contract terms would amount to interfering with the
integrity of the contract. Under the general law of contract, once the con-
tract is entered into, any clause giving absolute power to one party to modify
the terms of the contract at his sweet will or to cancel the contract would be
in essence a negation of the contract. 272
Purposive interpretation.-A contract has to be interpreted according to
its purpose. Consistent with the character of purposive interpretation, the
court is required to determine the ultimate purpose of the contract primarily
by looking at the joint interest of the parties. 273 It is not appropriate to put
strict construction upon an international commercial contract. Meaningful
and purposive interpretation should be given to its clauses. 24 In another
decision the Supreme Court deprecated another kind of practice in the use
of standard form contracts. It observed that use of such contract forms in
a blanket manner without paying attention leads to the fact that many of
its general clauses are inapplicable to the transaction in hand. The court
viewed it with disapproval that a party using a standard form does not take
care to check it in the context of a particular contract and to delete clauses
which are not applicable to the transaction in hand. The document should
be transaction specific. The court has to ignore the inapplicable clauses
to find out the intention of the parties and nature of the transaction, for
example to know whether the transaction is simply that of subrogation or
assignment or subrogation-cum-assignment, etc. Even where the document
was meant to apply to carriage of goods by road, it seemed to pertain to
carriage by air, or rail. Claims and remedies against a road carrier were not

even mentioned. When all superfluous matter was excluded, the document
seemed to be purely one of subrogation.275
5. Liability in tort
Even where an exemption clause is exhaustive enough to exclude all kinds
of liability under the contract, it may not exclude liability in tort. Thus in
White v John Warwick & Co Ltd:276
The plaintiff hired a cycle from the defendants. The defendants agreed
to maintain the cycle in working order and a clause in the agreement pro-
vided: 'nothing in this agreement shall render the owners liable for any
personal injuries.... While the plaintiff was riding the cycle the saddle
tilted forward and he was thrown and injured.
It was held that although the clause exempted the defendants (even if they
were negligent) from their liability in contract, it did not exempt them from
liability in negligence.277
It is, however, open to the parties to exclude liability even for negli-
gence by express words or necessary implication. For example, in Rutther v
Palmer278 a car was given to the defendants for sale under a contract which
provided that while on trial the cars would be driven at the customer's risk.
An accident took place while the car was on a trial run. The defendants
were held not liable, for they had by express words shifted the risk to the
customers.
Liability for negligence
The results of such cases should now be different. The (English) Unfair
Contract Terms Act, 1977, expressly provides that any clause in a contract
which excludes or restricts liability for death or personal injury resulting
from negligence shall be absolutely void. The expression "negligence" is
defined in the Act to mean the breach of any common law or contractual
duty.
6. Unreasonable terms
Another mode of protection is to exclude unreasonable terms from the
contract. A term is unreasonable if it would defeat the very purpose of the
275. Economic Transport Organisation v Charan Spg Mills (P) Ltd, (2010) 4 SCC 114: (2010) 3
All LJ 281.
276. (1953) 1 WLR 1285 (CA).
277. Besides these, the courts have tried other ways of controlling the undesirable consequences
of exemption clauses. This is indeed the only way to protect the individual and make up
for the growing loss of individual freedom of contract. For a summary of such techniques,
see Gower, Exemption Clauses: Contractual and Tortious Liability, (1959) 17 MLR 155.
For an assessment of the need and propriety of such contracts see Bowes Egan, Standard
Contracts, 1968 JBL 204; G.H. Treitel, Exclusion Clauses, Possible Reforms, (1967) JBL 209
and 334.

contract or if it is repugnant to public policy. Pointing this out in the Suisse
Atlantique case, Lord WILBERFORCE said:
One may safely say that the parties cannot, in a contract, have contem-
plated that a clause shall have so wide an ambit as in effect to deprive one
party's stipulations of all contractual force: to do so would be to reduce
the contract to a mere declaration of intent.
An example of an unreasonable term is to be found in Lily White v
Munuswami. A laundry receipt contained a condition that a customer
would be entitled to claim only fifteen per cent of the market price or value
of the article in case of loss. The plaintiff's new sari was lost. The court
observed:
Certainly the conditions printed on the reverse of a bill may govern or
modify any simple contract... subject to the obligation on the part of the
businessman to perform the process properly and to return the article safe
and intact. But, if a condition is imposed which is in flagrant infringement
of the law relating to negligence... the court will not enforce such a term
which is not in the interest of the public, and which is not in accordance
with public policy. And there is certainly justification for the observation
that this (enforcement of the condition) may well be putting a premium
upon the abstraction of clothes, which may be committed by an employee
of the firm, intent on private gain, though the firm itself may be blameless
with regard to the actual loss. 281
Explaining the justification for not enforcing unreasonable terms in Lee
(John) & Sons (Grantham) Ltd v Railway Executive, 282 Lord DENNING LJ
remarked:
There is the vigilance of the common law which, while allowing free-
dom of contract, watches to see that it is not abused.
The importance of this vigilance was amply demonstrated by his Lordship
in Levison v Patent Steam Carpet Cleaning Co Ltd.283
A carpet was delivered to a cleaning company under the signature of
the carpet-owner. Immediately above the space for signature the form
stated that the undersigned agreed to the terms and conditions set out
above. One of the clauses fixed the value of the carpet at £40 and another

condition restricting liability for loss or damage to 20 times laundering charges or half the
value of the garment, whichever was less. The condition was held to be unreasonable.

stated that the goods had been accepted at the owner's risk and the cus-
tomers should insure their goods. The carpet was never returned and the
cleaners informed the customer that it had been stolen. The customer
recovered the full value of the carpet from his insurer and recovered £900
from the cleaners.
The clause which fixed the liability at £40 was regarded as unreasonable
and, therefore, the cleaners were required to pay the full value of the carpet.
Not to have returned the carpet also amounted to a fundamental breach.
Lord DENNING reiterated that an exemption or limitation clause should not
be given effect to if it was unreasonable or if it would be unreasonable to
apply it in the circumstances of the case. The cleaners knew that the carpet
was worth a lot of money and it would be most unreasonable to limit liabil-
ity to £40. It was equally unreasonable to impose a term on the customers
that their goods were accepted only at their risk.
It is not reasonable to exclude liability for breach of a term which is fun-
damental to the contract.
A photocopying machine was taken on lease. The machine was sup-
posed to contain a particular feature. The machine which was actually
supplied did not have that feature. The lease excluded liability for rep-
resentations, if any, made about the machine.
It was held that the exclusion clause was unreasonable. It became overrid-
den by the representations made by the copier salesman. 284
Statutory definition of reasonableness
The principle of excluding unreasonable clauses has now found statu-
tory recognition in the (English) Unfair Contract Terms Act, 1977. The Act.
provides that in respect of any loss caused by the breach of contract, any
restricting or excluding clause shall be void unless it satisfies the requirement
of reasonableness. A term will be regarded as reasonable if it is "a fair and
reasonable one to be included having regard to the circumstances which
were, or ought reasonably to have been known to or in the contemplation of
the parties when the contract was made". 285
284. Lease Management Services Ltd v Purnell Secretarial Services Ltd, (1994) 13 Tr LR
337 (CA).
285. In AMERICAN RESTATEMENT [2nd Edn, S. 211 (Part 3)] the modern doctrine is thus stated:
Where the other party has reason to believe that the party manifesting such (written) assent
would not do so if he knew that the writing contained a particular term, the term is not a
part of the agreement. Reason to believe may be inferred from the fact that the term is bizarre
or oppressive, from the fact that it eviscerates the non-standard terms explicitly agreed to,
or from the fact that it eliminates the dominant purpose of the transaction. See Todd D.
Rakoff, Contracts of Adhesion: An Essay in reconstruction, (1983) 96 Harv LR 1174; J.H.
Baker, From Sanctity of Contract to Reasonable Expectation, CURRENT LEGAL PROBLEMS,
1979 where it is said that judges are to impose reasonableness. Whatever is not reasonable
is not law. If the parties have agreed to something unreasonable they should be treated as if
they have not agreed and they should be released. This brings in the doctrine of reasonable
expectation. Policing Unfairness in Contracts, (1984) 47 Mod LR 523 in Reuben Hassen's

Standard form contracts 95
A local authority entered into a contract with a supplier for purchase
of computer software designed to administer the collection of community
charge according to population. The software contained an error which
led to wrong count and, therefore, loss of revenue. The supplier company
had limited its liability under the standard terms to £100,000. The court
allowed the authority to recover its whole loss of revenue and not merely
the amount under the limitation clause, which was held to be unreasona-
ble. The supplier was a substantial company with ample resources to meet
any liability and was insured under a worldwide policy for fifty million
pounds. There were a very few companies who could meet the authority's
requirements and, therefore, the supplier was in a very strong bargaining
position. The supplier company failed to adduce any evidence as to why
the limit of £100,000 was justified. It was irrelevant to the defendant
company's liability that the authority had made up its loss by increasing
the community charge the following year.286
In reference to statutory contracts, the Supreme Court observed:
A statutory contract cannot be varied, added to, or altered by importing
the doctrine of fairness. In a commercial or mercantile contract between
parties of equal bargaining power, more so in a contract for liquor vend,
the licensee takes a calculated risk of being put under the burden of rules
and regulations. 287
Removal simpliciter clauses in contracts of employment
A term in a contract of employment being offered by a Government
corporation providing for the removal of a permanent employee without
inquiry has been regarded by the Supreme Court to be unreasonable. 288 The
Supreme Court has gone further still by laying down that in all its affairs,
including economic and contractual matters, the state and its instrumental-
ities have to observe the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution and offer
equal opportunities and make a fair and reasonable selection of the party,
including the selection of a Government District Counsel, on whom benefits
of a Government contract are going to be conferred. 289

Compromise of existing contract
[S. 5]
The purpose of the Unfair Contract Terms Act, 1977 (English) is to inval-
idate exemption clauses in the strict sense, its clauses in a contract which
modify prospective liability. The Act does not affect retrospective compro-
mises of existing claims. Section 10 of the Act on its true construction does
not apply to a contract to settle disputes which have arisen concerning the
performance of an earlier contract. Furthermore, Section 10 does not apply
where parties to both contracts (namely, the earlier contract and agreement
of its accord and satisfaction) are the same. Thus a compromise would not
be bad in law even if some of the clauses of the contract were unreasonable
either generally or within the meaning of the English Act. 290
7. Exemption clauses and third parties
One of the basic principles of the law of contract is that a contract is a
contract only between the parties to it and no third party can either enjoy
any rights or suffer any liability under it.291 This should apply to standard
form contracts also. The effect would be that where goods are supplied or
services rendered under a contract which exempts the supplier from liability
and a third party is injured by the use of them, the supplier is liable to him
notwithstanding that he has purchased his exemption from the other party
to the contract. If, for example, a contractor agrees to maintain and repair
a lift in certain premises under contract with the owner who exempts him
from liability, that exemption would be of no avail to the contractor against
a person who is injured owing to bad repairs. If this were not so, the life and
security of millions of people would be in the hands of the two parties to a
contract. They would then make law not only for themselves, but also legis-
late for countless others. Obviously, therefore, in Haseldine v C.A. Daw &
Son Ltd,292 the abovementioned lift case, the defendants were held liable for
the tort of negligence. GODDARD LJ reminded the contractor "that the duty
to the third party does not arise out of contract, but independently of it".
Just as a third party is not affected by the terms of a contract, so also a
third party cannot claim the advantage of them. If, for example, a sea-line
company exempts itself from any liability to its passengers for the negligence
of its employees, a passenger injured by the negligence of an employee will
nevertheless be entitled to sue the negligent employee.293 In another case,
a shipping company limited its liability to a fixed amount for any loss of
or damage to goods. The stevedores in England agreed with the company
opportunity to enable him to come under the new policy. The court also relied upon Wade's

to handle cargo subject to the same condition, but the plaintiff had no
knowledge of this agreement. His consignment having been lost through the
negligence of the stevedores, they were held not entitled to the protection of
the limiting clause. 294
Looking at this state of the law transport companies began to draft their
exclusion clauses so as to provide that neither they nor their employees would
incur any liability. In two such cases, in both of which two free pass-holders
of a bus company were injured, one through the negligence of the driver and
the other of the conductor, they were allowed to proceed against the negli-
gent employees, in the one case because the free pass was a licence and not
a contract and the driver was not a party to it295 and in the other because it
was a contract and was void under Section 151 of the (English) Road Traffic
Act, 1960.296
The only way of conferring the benefit of exception clauses upon employ-
ces or sub-contractors, etc., seems to be the principle of vicarious immunity
or implied contract as suggested by the House of Lords in Elder, Dempster
& Co v Paterson Zochonis & Co. 297 In this case the plaintiff contracted
with a charterer and the latter hired a ship from the shipowner for carriage
of oil casks. The bill of lading as drawn between the plaintiff and charterer
exempted both the charterer and shipowner from consequences of bad stow-
age. The oil was lost in circumstances covered by the exception clause. The
plaintiff sued both of them, but they were held liable, either because the bill
of lading became an implied contract between the plaintiff and shipowner
or because the shipowner was acting as an agent of the charterer. A dif-
ferent result followed where the exclusion clause not merely protected the
carrier, but also his agents and contractors and the stevedores contracted to
unload the ship as agents for the carrier. They were accordingly held not lia-
ble for damage caused to the plaintiff's machinery through their negligence
in the act of unloading. 298 Now under the (English) Unfair Contract Terms
Act, 1977, a clause which excludes liability for negligence would be enforced
only if it is reasonable in the circumstances of the case. Another case of the
same kind is Norwich City Council v Harvey,299
A contract for the erection of a building contained a provision that
the building owner was to bear the risk of loss or damage caused to the
building by fire. A sub-contractor had contracted with the contractor on
that basis. The court said that it would not be just and reasonable to
exclude the sub-contractor from the protection of that provision in the
main contract if the building was damaged by fire as the result of the

negligence of the sub-contractor, even though there was no privity of con-
tract between him and the building owner. In such circumstances there
was not such a close and direct relationship between the building owner
and the sub-contractor for the latter to owe a duty of care to the former.
It followed that the sub-contractors were entitled to the benefit of the
exemption from liability under the main contract in respect of the claim
brought against them by the building owners in respect of their employees'
negligence.
Where a person is entitled to the benefits of a contract he would have to
accept its burdens also. 300
In conclusion, the following statement of Lord REID in the Suisse
Atlantique case may be cited: 301
Exemption clauses differ greatly in many respects. Probably the most
objectionable are found in the complex standard conditions which are
now so common. In the ordinary way the customer has no time to read
them and, if he did read them, he would probably not understand them. If
he did understand and object to any of them, he would generally be told
that he could take it or leave it. If he then went to another supplier, the
result would be the same. Freedom to contract must strictly imply some
choice or room for bargaining.
At the other extreme is the case where the parties are bargaining on
terms of equality and a stringent exemption clause is accepted for a quid
pro quo or other good reason; but this rule appears to treat all cases alike.
There is no indication in the recent cases that the courts are to consider
whether the exemption is fair in all the circumstances or is harsh and
unconscionable, or whether it was freely agreed to by the customer. It
does not seem to be satisfactory that the decision must always go one
way if, e.g., defects in a car or other goods are just sufficient to make the
breach of contract a fundamental breach, but must always go the other
way if the defects fall just short of that. This is a complex problem which
intimately affects millions of people, and it appears to me that its solution
should be left to Parliament.
Unfair Contract Terms Act, 1977 (UK)
The (UK) Unfair Contract Terms Act, 1977, which came into force on
February 1, 1978, improves or affects some of the principles established by
the courts in reference to business contracts. The Act tries to improve the
situation by completely overruling certain types of exemption clauses and
subjecting all of them to the test of reasonableness.
300. Pyrene Co v Scindia Navigation Co, (1954) 2 QB 402: (1954) 2 WLR 1005 where it was held
that a person who accepts the benefit of a contract shall have to take its burdens also.

(UK) Unfair Contract Terms Act, 1977.

[S. 5]
Standard form contracts 99
The Act provides, for the first time, a statutory definition of the term
"negligence" which is applicable both to tort and breach of contract cases.
In the terms of the definition, negligence means:
(a) breach of any obligation, arising from the express or implied terms of
a contract, to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill in the
performance of the contract;
(b) breach of any common law duty to take reasonable care or exercise
reasonable skill (but not a stricter duty); or
(c) breach of the duty of care imposed by the Occupiers' Liability
Act, 1957.
The second important effect of the Act is that any clause in a contract
which excludes or restricts liability for death or personal injury resulting
from negligence shall be absolutely void.
The third noteworthy provision of the Act is that in regard to other types
of loss, not being death or physical injury, any restricting or excluding clause
shall also be void unless it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness. The
test will be deemed to be satisfied if the term is "a fair and reasonable one
to be included having regard to the circumstances which were, or ought
reasonably to have been, known to or in the contemplation of the parties
when the contract was made". It means that reasonableness depends upon
the unfairness of the terms in the light of the circumstances which ought
to have been either known or to be in the contemplation of the parties. A
chartered surveyor who gave a negligent mortgage valuation of a bungalow
upon which the plaintiff relied in purchasing the property was held liable in
spite of a clause excluding his liability in the matter. The clause was found
to be not reasonable in the circumstances. 302
The fourth important provision of the Act is concerned with the protec-
tion of the consumer and those who have been subjected to a standard form
contract. The Act says that a person who deals with a consumer on his own
standard terms, will not be allowed to claim the protection of any clauses.
restricting or excluding liability if he himself commits breach; nor can he
claim substantially different performance as equivalent to performance. He
can, however, take advantage of such terms if they are reasonable.
The fifth important part of the Act extends the scope of the Supply of
Goods (Implied Terms) Act, 1973. This Act does not permit in reference to
consumer sales the liability for breach of implied conditions and warranties
to be excluded. This will now apply to all contracts under which possession
of or property in goods passes from one person to another, for example,

A plant hire company, hired an excavator to the plaintiff together with
the first defendant, a driver, for use in building work consisting of an
extension to the plaintiff's factory. A condition was that the drivers were
to be regarded for all purposes as the servants or agents of the hirer who
alone will be liable for the consequences of the operation by them. An
accident occurred as a result of the driver's negligence, causing consider-
able damage to the plaintiff's factory.
Going by the substance and effect of the term, rather than by its form, the
court held that the term had the effect of excluding the common law duty in
tort. It had the effect of excluding liability which fell within the purview of
the Act and was, therefore, not fair and reasonable.304 The court relied upon

abuse their economic power by means of oppressive standard contracts. Courts have often
expressed their unwillingness to delve into the problem of contractual morality and unfair-
ness. The author regrets that our judges have not been prepared to formulate a general theory
of contractual conscionability which could govern all instances of abuse of bargaining power;

all these have combined to erode the pacta sunt servanda principle. Today all western legal
systems have a multiplicity of protective laws, ranging from anti-monopoly legislation to
consumer protection laws, from rent control to legislation regulating sales on instalments;

Standard form contracts 101
In considering the requirement of reasonableness, the court must enter-
tain a whole range of considerations, put them in the scales on one side
or other and decide at the end of the day on which side the balance comes
down. There will sometimes be room for a legitimate difference of judi-
cial opinion as to what the answer should be, where it will be impossible
to say that one view is demonstratably wrong and the other demonstrat-
ably right.
Exclusion of right of set-off
The right of set-off being an instrument of justice and equity, its exclusion
under contract clauses has been held to be prima facie unreasonable and hit
by Section 13 of the Act. Accordingly, a counter-claim raised by way of set-
off against the contractor's bill for final payment was allowed to be raised
despite a clause in the contract excluding the right of set-off. The court put
the burden upon the contractor to prove the reasonableness of the clause and
added that the question whether a contract term satisfied the requirements
of reasonableness in Section 13 of the 1977 Act has to be determined by
considering the term as a whole and not merely that part of it relied on by
the plaintiffs to defeat the defendant's set-off, 306
Exclusion clauses and disclaimer
The House of Lords have laid down that negligent advice given by a pro-
fessional man would make him liable to his immediate advisee even if the
advice was given under a clause containing disclaimer of all liability. The
disclaimer would have to pass the test of reasonableness under the 1977
Act. 307 A house was purchased by the plaintiffs, price being paid on the
basis of the advice sought from a local authority whose surveyors prepared
a negligent report and advice. The advice was offered under disclaimer of
liability. The house turned out to be unusable and required an amount for
repair which was more than the cost of the purchase price. The authority
was held liable to the plaintiffs. Their Lordships said that having regard to
the high cost of the house it would not be fair and reasonable for valuers to
impose on purchasers the risk of loss arising out of incompetence or care-
lessness on the part of valuers. It followed, therefore, that the disclaimer was
not effective to exclude liability for the negligence of the valuers.

Consideration
Section 25 of the Indian Contract Act opens with the declaration that "an
agreement made without consideration is void..."." In England also "prom-
ises without consideration are not enforced, because they are gratuitous".²
In Rann v Hughes' Lord Chief Baron SKYNNER observed: "It is undoubtedly
true that every man is by the law of nature bound to fulfil his engagements.
It is equally true that the law of the country supplies no means, nor affords
any remedy, to compel the performance of an agreement made without suf-
ficient consideration."
DEFINITION AND ITS REQUIREMENTS
Consideration has been variously defined. The simplest definition is by
Blackstone: "Consideration is the recompense given by the party contract-
ing to the other."
In other words, it is a price of the promise. In the words of Pollock,
"Consideration is the price for which the promise of the other is bought, and
the promise thus given for value is enforceable." Another simple definition
is by Justice PATTERSON: "Consideration means something which is of some

tion do not arise unless there is an agreement. Associated Bombay Cinemas (P) Ltd v Urmi

[S. 2(d)]
value in the eyes of the law.... It may be some benefit to the plaintiff or some
detriment to the defendant."
But the most commonly accepted definition is that which was attempted
by LUSH J in Currie v Misa: "A valuable consideration in the sense of the
law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to
the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility given,
suffered or undertaken by the other."
The definition of consideration as a "price of the promise" has been com-
mended by Cheshire and Fifoot. According to the learned writers, "it is
easier to understand, it corresponds more happily to the normal exchange
of promises and it emphasises the commercial character of the English con-
tract. It reveals the essential simplicity of the concept." The Calcutta High
Court has observed in a case that "consideration is the price of a promise,
a return or quid pro quo, something of value received by the promisee as
inducement of the promise."
In Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act consideration is defined as
follows:
When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has
done or abstained from doing or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do
or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or promise is called
a consideration for the promise.
This is rather a practical definition. The purpose is to emphasise the sim-
ple fact that consideration is some act, done or promised to be done, at the
desire of the promisor. It also avoids the practical difficulties caused by the
theory of consideration as consisting of some act which is beneficial to one
party or detrimental to the other. This antithesis has been described to be
not altogether happy. The Act simplifies the matter by saying that any kind
of act or abstinence which is done or undertaken to be done at the desire of
the promisor is a sufficient consideration.
The definition of consideration in Section 2(d) requires, in the first place,
that the act or abstinence, which is to be a consideration for the promise,
should be done at the desire of the promisor; secondly, that it should be done
by promisee or any other person and, lastly, that the act or abstinence may

joint promisors executing a promissory note liable though consideration was handed over to
only one of them. Prakashwati Jain v Punjab State Industrial Development Corpn, AIR 2012
P&H 13, detriment suffered by the promisor for the benefit of another person (not party to
consideration) was held as good consideration. Accordingly, the collateral security offered by
the surety for the benefit of the principal debtor was regarded as sufficient consideration to
make it enforceable.

have been already executed or is in the process of being done or may be still
executory, that is to say, it is promised to be done.
"At the desire of the promisor" (promissory estoppel)
The definition of consideration in Section 2(d) clearly emphasises that
an act or abstinence which is to be a consideration for the promise must be
done or promised to be done in accordance with the desire of the promisor.
In other words, an act shall not be a good consideration for a promise
unless it is done at the desire of the promisor. In Durga Prasad v Baldeo:"1
The plaintiff, on the order of the Collector of a town, built at his own
expense, certain shops in a bazar. The shops came to be occupied by the
defendants who, in consideration of the plaintiff having expended money
in the construction, promised to pay him a commission on articles sold
through their agency in the bazar. The plaintiff's action to recover the
commission was rejected.
"The only ground for the making of the promise is the expense incurred
by the plaintiff in establishing the Ganj (market) but it is clear that anything
done in that way was not 'at the desire' of the defendants so as to consti-
tute consideration."12 The act was the result not of the promise but of the
Collector's order.
Acts done at request
On the other hand, an act done at the promisor's desire furnishes a
good consideration for his promise even though it is of no personal sig-
nificance or benefit to him. The decision of the Calcutta High Court in
Kedarnath Bhattacharji v Gorie Mahomed" has become well-known in
this connection.
It was thought advisable to erect a town hall at Howrah provided suf-
ficient subscription could be got together for the purpose. To this end the
Commissioners of Howrah municipality set out to work to obtain neces-
sary funds by public subscription. The defendant was a subscriber to this
fund for Rs 100 having signed his name in the subscription book for that
10. The word "act", for the purpose of this definition, includes "abstinence" also. Bank of Baroda
v Kayenkay Agencies, (2003) 1 BC 59 (Del), in connection with the grant of overdraft facil-
ity, fee of Rs 5000 for execution of documents was held to be a valuable consideration. K.

promised to bring a Thakur to the plaintiff's house to preside over a dinner to be given to the
plaintiff's guests. The defendant failed to bring the Thakur and consequently the dinner was
wholly wasted as no guest partook of it in the absence of the Thakur. The plaintiff's action for
damages was dismissed as he had done nothing on the desire of the promisor.

amount. On the faith of the promised subscriptions the plaintiff entered
into a contract with a contractor for the purpose of building the hall. But
the defendant failed to pay the amount and contended that there was no
consideration for his promise.
He was, however, held liable: Persons were asked to subscribe knowing
the purpose for which the money was to be applied, they knew that on the
faith of their subscription an obligation was to be incurred to pay the con-
tractor for the work. The promise is: "In consideration of your agreeing to
enter into a contract to erect, I undertake to supply money for it." The act
of the plaintiff in entering into contract with the contractor was done at
the desire of the defendant (the promisor) so as to constitute consideration
within the meaning of Section 2(d).
It was indeed a promise to pay for the performance of an act and it
could not have been revoked once the promisee entered performance. In
England also "the law for centuries has been that an act done at the request
of another, express or implied, is sufficient consideration to support a prom-
ise". Writing in an article DENNING LJ says: "Nowadays there are some
grounds for suggesting that an act may be good consideration even though
it is not a benefit to the promisor nor a detriment to the promisee. If a man
promises a charitable institution that he will pay £100 into its funds if it
procures nine other persons to do the same, justice requires that his promise
should be held binding on him as soon as it has procured the nine others to
pay £100 each; but the act done by the institution is not a benefit to him nor
a detriment to the institution." A trend of this kind is observable in a decision
of the Supreme Court." On the death of their father, his two sons picked up
a clash. Their mother intervened writing to the junior son that in case his
elder brother did not pay the sum of rupees fifty lakhs which was due to him
out of the family assets, she would pay the same. The brother paid a part of
the amount. The mother supplemented the payment to a certain extent, but
she had still to pay the balance amount and for that she claimed a reduction
in the computation of her net wealth. The Court allowed the deduction. The
contract was a part of the family arrangement. It was not hit by Section 25
as purchase of family peace in such circumstances is good consideration.
A loan given to the son at the instance of his father who executed all the
essential documents was held to be enforceable against the father.16

laid down that "a promise to pay a subscription becomes enforceable as
soon as any definite steps have been taken in furtherance of the object and
on the faith of the promised subscription". In one of these cases:
A sum of Rs 5000 was promised by the defendant as a personal contri-
bution for the purpose of constructing a bridge. He was held liable to pay
the amount on the completion of the bridge.18
In a subsequent case, Doraswami lyer v Arunachala Ayyar", the Madras
High Court explained the principle of Kedarnath Bhattacharji v Gorie
Mahomed on the footing that there was not a bare promise to subscribe,
but also a request that the promisee should do an act (construction of the
town hall in that case), and that where there is no such request for an act the
promise will be a bare promise and without any consideration. The facts of
the case were:
The repair of a temple was in progress. As the work proceeded, more
money was required and to raise this money subscriptions were invited
and a subscription list raised. The defendant put himself down on the list
for Rs 125 and it was to recover this sum that the suit was filed.
But no recovery was allowed. CORNISH J proceeded like this: "The plaint
found the consideration for the promise as follows: That plaintiffs relying on
the promise of the subscriber incurred liabilities in repairing the temple. The
question is, does this amount to consideration? The definition of considera-
tion in the Contract Act is that where at the desire of the promisor the prom-
isee has done or abstained from doing something, such act or abstinence is
called consideration. Therefore, the definition postulates that the promisee
must have acted on something amounting to more than a bare promise.
There must be some bargain between them in respect of which consideration
has been given.... There must have been some request by the promisor to the
promisee to do something in consideration of the promised subscription."
The learned judge found support in the English case of Hudson, re20
where the promise was to contribute a large sum of money for the payment

18. District Board of Ramnad v D.K. Mahomed Ibrahim Sahib, AIR 1933 Mad 524. There are
some English authorities to the same effect. See, for example, Soames, re, (1837) 13 TLR 439.
In this case S promised to leave the plaintiffs £3000 by will for opening of a school and its
maintenance. The plaintiffs immediately established the school, which it was clear they would
not have done but for Miss Soame's influence. But her will contained no such bequest. It was
held that the plaintiffs were entitled to be paid £3000 from the estate by way of damages for
breach of contract. Another case to the same effect is Mountgarret, re, (1913) 29 TLR 325. A
testator promised to defray the cost of certain alterations in a Chapel in which he was inter-
ested, provided the total expense did not exceed a certain amount. Estimates were obtained
and submitted to the testator, and thereafter the Provost of the Chapel entered into a formal
contract for the work. The testator died after some of the work had been executed, but before
a contract for the remainder had been entered into. Held, that the testator's estate was liable
for the cost of so much only of the work in respect of which a contract had been entered into
before the testator's death.

of Chapel debts, the promisor having died after paying a large instal-
ment, the balance could not be recovered from his executors. The claim
was considered to be unsustainable in as much as the promisee had not
undertaken any liability as part of the bargain with the promisor. Applying
these principles to the present case, the learned judge said that there was no
evidence of any request by the subscriber to the plaintiff to do the temple
repairs.
Unilateral promises
A unilateral promise is a promise from one side only and is intended to
induce some action by the other party. “A unilateral contract refers to a gra-
tuitous promise where only one party makes a promise without any return
promise." The promisee is not bound to act, for he gives no promise from
his side. But if he carries out the act desired by the promisor, he can hold the
promisor to his promise. His act is at the same time an acceptance of and a
consideration for the promise. "An act done at the request of the offeror in
response to his promise is consideration, and consideration in its essence is
nothing else but response to such a request.
It should be noted that in all the above cases where liability arose it arose
only when the promisee had by doing some act, on the faith of the promise,
altered his position. It follows, therefore, that where the promisee has done
nothing, there is no consideration. Accordingly, in Abdul Aziz v Masum
Ali, the defendant promised Rs 500 to a fund started to rebuild a mosque
but nothing had been done to carry out the repairs and reconstruction. The
subscriber was, therefore, held not liable. Similarly, it has been pointed out
in other cases that a mere promise to subscribe to a charitable institution
cannot be sued upon." Thus where the defendant had agreed to pay from
time to time, out of his own pocket certain sums proportionate to the value
of the goods imported by him, to a charitable society, the promise was held
to be not enforceable, being without consideration.25

the observation in Mohd Mohar Ali case, AIR 1998 Gau 92 that an agreement of sale is a
unilateral contract is not correct. Every sale presupposes somebody to sell and some other to
buy.

Revocation of unilateral promises
There is yet another problem concerning such unilateral contracts. It is
no doubt true that a promise which is given in return for an act is revo-
cable before the promisee begins to alter his position by acting upon the
promise. But may it be revoked after the promisee has commenced perfor-
mance? If, for example, the promise is to pay a sum of money if the prom-
isee walks from Lucknow to Kanpur, can it be revoked after the promisee
has embarked upon the journey? The decision in Kedarnath Bhattacharji v
Gorie Mahomed² suggests, though not in so many words, that such a revo-
cation is impossible. The defendant, in that case, was held liable as soon as
the contract for the construction of the hall was entered into.
The same appears from the decision of DENNING LJ in Errington v
Errington and Woods. The owner of a house had mortgaged it. The house
was in the occupation of his son and daughter-in-law. He told them that
the house would become their property if they paid off the mortgage debt
in instalments and they commenced payment. In these circumstances, the
court felt that it would be unjust if the promisor could revoke this promise
at his pleasure. His Lordship said: "The father's promise was a unilateral
contract... a promise of the house in return for their act of paying the instal-
.ments. It could not be revoked by him once the couple entered on perfor-
mance of the act, but it would cease to bind him if they left it incomplete
and unperformed."
Either way there is some difficulty. If the promisor is at liberty to revoke,
he can frustrate the promisee at his pleasure. On the other hand, if he has
no such liberty, he will be bound even though the promisee may stop per-
formance at his sweet will. The House of Lords, therefore, suggested in
Morrison Steamship Co Ltd v Crown28 that the mere commencement of
performance does not convert the offer into a contract in the sense that the
promisor is bound to stay with his promise, but that if he revokes it, he may
be sued for damages or on a quantum meruit.29

110 Chapter 3 Consideration
[S. 2(d)]
Law of promissory estoppel which found its most eloquent exposition
in Union of India v Indo Afghan Agencies Ltd, crystallised in Motilal
Padampat Sugar Mills v State of U.P.32 as furnishing cause of action
to a citizen, enforceable in a court of law, against the Government if
it or its officials in the course of their authority extended any promise
which created or was capable of creating legal relationship, and it was
acted upon by the promisee, irrespective of any prejudice. It was reit-
erated in Union of India v Godfrey Philips India Ltd and was taken
further when it was held that no duty of excise was assessable on ciga-
rettes manufactured by the assessee by including the cost of corrugated
fibre board containers when it was clearly represented by the Central
Board of Excise and Customs in response to the submission made by
the Cigarette Manufacturers' Association and the representation was
approved and accepted by the Central Government that the cost of con-
tainers would not be included in the value of cigarettes for the purpose
of assessment of excise duty. In Delhi Cloth and General Mills Ltd v
Union of India" it was held: 'All that is now required is that the party.
asserting the estoppel must have acted upon the assurance given to him.
Must have relied upon the representation made to him. It means that the
party has changed or altered his position by relying on the assurance
or representation. The alteration of his position by the party is the only
indispensable requirement of the doctrine. It is not necessary to prove
further any damage, detriment or prejudice to the party asserting the
estoppel.'
In Pournami Oil Mills v State of Kerala" the Government was not per-
mitted to go back on its earlier promise of wider exemption from sales tax in
pursuance of which certain industries were set up. A subsequent notification
curtailing the exemption was held to be applicable to industries established
after the notification. A promise which is against public policy or in viola
tion of a statutory prohibition cannot be the foundation of an estoppel."
Estoppel of licensee

saying afterwards that some of the restrictions imposed upon his trade free-
dom, particularly the one under which the Government reserved with it

the power to vary issue prices, were unreasonable. Unreasonableness has to
be considered in the totality of the circumstances including public interest.
Liquor consumption has to be reduced and, therefore, free trade of such
an item cannot be encouraged. The power to vary issue prices is a method
of exercising control of this trade. The courts will only prevent a crush-
ing use of this power. Such power does not also offend Section 29 of the
Contract Act because there is no uncertainty about the nature of the price
variation clause. Its unreasonable use can always be prévented under writ
jurisdiction.37
A person, who had acquired title to the land of a Council by adverse
possession, agreed subsequently to hold the same under a term licence from
the Council. On the expiry of the term the Council told him to hand over
possession. He tried to assert his title by adverse possession. He was not
allowed to do so. Whatever rights he had acquired became substituted under
the new arrangement which he voluntarily accepted. The new arrangement
constituted a promissory estoppel against him.38
PRIVITY OF CONTRACT AND OF CONSIDERATION
"Promisee or any other person"
The second notable feature of the definition of consideration in Section 2(d)
is that the act which is to constitute a consideration may be done by "the
promisee or any other person". It means; therefore, that as long as there is
a consideration for a promise, it is immaterial who has furnished it. It may
move from the promisee, or, if the promisor has no objection, from any
other person. This principle had its genesis in the English common law, hav-
ing been adopted by the Court of King's Bench as early as 1677 in Dutton
v Poole:"
A person had a daughter to marry and in order to provide her a mar-
riage portion he intended to sell a wood of which he was possessed at
the time. His son (the defendant) promised that if 'the father would for-
bear to sell at his request he would pay the daughter £1000'. The father
accordingly forbore but the defendant did not pay. The daughter and her
husband sued the defendant for the amount.
It is clear that the defendant gave this promise to his father and it was the
father alone who, by abstaining from selling the wood, had furnished con-
sideration for the promise. The plaintiff was neither privy to the contract nor
interested in the consideration. But it is equally clear that the whole object of
the agreement was to provide a portion to the plaintiff. It would have been.
highly inequitable to allow the son to keep the wood and yet to deprive his
sister of her portion. He was accordingly held liable.

Chapter 3 Consideration
[S. 2(d)]
Position of beneficiary who is not party
Nearly two hundred years later in 1861 in Tweddle v Atkinson the
Court of Queen's Bench refused to follow this principle.
The plaintiff was to be married to the daughter of one G and in con-
sideration of this intended marriage G and the plaintiff's father entered
into a written agreement by which it was agreed that each would pay
the plaintiff a sum of the money. G failed to do so and the plaintiff sued
his executors. WHITMAN J considered it to be an established principle
'that no stranger to the consideration can take advantage of a contract,
although made for his benefit'.
Thus, although the sole object of the contract was to secure a benefit to
the plaintiff, he was not allowed to sue as the contract was made with his
father and not with him.
The case laid the foundation of what subsequently came to be known as
the doctrine of "privity of contract", which means that a contract is a con-
tract between the parties only and no third person can sue upon it even if it
is avowedly made for his benefit." Referring to this in Drive Yourself Hire
Co (London) Ltd v Strutt DENNING LJ suggested that the doctrine never
arose until 1861 and then observed:
For the last two hundred years before 1861 it was settled law that, if
a promise in a simple contract was made expressly for the benefit of a
third person in such circumstances that it was intended to be enforceable
by him, then the common law would enforce the promise at his instance,
although he was not a party to the contract. 43
The principle was affirmed by the House of Lords in Dunlop Pneumatic
Tyre Co v Selfridge & Co Ltd.44
Plaintiffs (Dunlop & Co) sold certain goods to one Dew & Co and
secured an agreement from them not to sell the goods below the list price
and that if they sold the goods to another trader they would obtain from
him a similar undertaking to maintain the price list. Dew & Co sold the
motor tyres to the defendants (Selfridge & Co) who agreed not to sell the
tyres to any private customer at less than the list prices. The plaintiffs
sued the defendants for breach of this contract.
It was held that assuming that the plaintiffs were undisclosed prin-
cipals, no consideration moved from them to the defendants and that
the contract was unenforceable by them. Lord Viscount HALDANE most
emphatically declared that:

Privity of contract and of consideration 113
In the law of England certain principles are fundamental. One is that
only a person who is a party to a contract can sue on it. Our law knows
nothing of a jus quaesitum tertio arising by way of contract. Such a right
may be conferred by way of property, as, for example under a trust, but
it cannot be conferred on a stranger to a contract as a right to enforce the
contract in personam. A second principle is that if a person with whom a
contract not under seal has been made is to be able to enforce it, consid-
eration must have been given by him.
Fundamental propositions of English Law
Stated in other words the two fundamental propositions of English law
referred to by his Lordship are:
(1) Consideration must move from the promisee and the promisee only. If
it be furnished by any other person, the promisee becomes a stranger to the
consideration and, therefore, cannot enforce the promise."5
(2) A contract cannot be enforced by a person who is not a party to it even
though it is made for his benefit. He is a stranger to the contract and can
claim no rights under it.16
Privity of consideration
The former of these two propositions is not at all applicable in India. Here,
in view of the clear language used in defining consideration in Section 2(d),
it is not necessary that consideration should be furnished by the promisee.
A promise is enforceable if there is some consideration for it and it is quite
immaterial whether it moves from the promisee or any other person. The
leading authority is the decision of the Madras High Court in Chinnaya v
Ramayya:47
An old lady, by deed of gift, made over certain landed property to the
defendant, her daughter. By the terms of the deed, which was registered,
it was stipulated that an annuity of Rs 653 should be paid every year to
the plaintiff, who was the sister of the old woman. The defendant on the
same day executed in plaintiff's favour an Iqrarnama (agreement) prom-
ising to give effect to the stipulation. The annuity was, however, not paid
and the plaintiff sued to recover it.
It was clear that the only consideration for the defendant's promise to pay
the annuity was the gift of certain lands by the old woman to the defendant.

writer maintains that the doctrine is not after all as dogmatic as the leading authors on the
English Law of Contract assert.

114 Chapter 3 Consideration
[S. 2(d)]
The defendant, therefore, tried to defend herself on the ground that the
promisee (the plaintiff) had furnished no consideration. Briefly, the whole
situation was this: the defendant's promise was given to the plaintiff, but
consideration was furnished by the plaintiff's sister. The court could have
easily allowed the plaintiff to recover the annuity, as consideration given by
"any other person" is equally effective. The court reached the same result
but on a somewhat different ground. INNES J tried to equate the situation
with the facts of Dutton v Poole. In that case the defendant's sister would
have got her marriage portion but for the defendant's promise. In the present
case also it appeared that the plaintiff was already receiving from her sister
an annuity of like amount out of the estate and when the estate was handed
over to the defendant it was stipulated that the payment to the plaintiff
should be continued and she promised accordingly. That means that the
failure to keep the promise would have deprived the plaintiff of an amount
which she was already receiving and it is a legal commonplace that if a
promise causes some loss to the promisee, that is sufficient consideration for
the promise. Thus the plaintiff had given consideration.
Justice KINDERSLEY also came to the same conclusion, but on a different
ground. According to him the deed of gift and the defendant's promise to
pay the annuity were executed simultaneously and, therefore, they should be
regarded as one transaction and there was sufficient consideration for that
transaction.
American judicial opinion is in favour of this rule. In the words of the great
American writer Williston: "The rule that consideration must move from
the promisee is somewhat technical, and in a developed system of contract
law there seems no good reason that why A should not be able for a consid-
eration received from B to make an effective promise to C. Unquestionably
he may in the form of a promissory note, and the same result is generally
reached in this country in the case of an ordinary simple contract."48
Privity of contract
The rule of "privity of contract" which means that a stranger to contract
cannot sue has taken firm roots in the English Common Law. But the prin-
ciple has been generally criticised. In 1937, the Law Revision Committee,
under the chairmanship of Lord Wright, also criticised the doctrine and rec-
ommended its abolition. In its Sixth Interim Report the Committee stated:
Where a contract by its express terms purports to confer a benefit
directly on a third party, the third party shall be entitled to enforce the
provision in his own name, provided that the promisor shall be entitled

to raise against the third party any defence that would have been valid
against the promisor....
Lord Justice DENNING has also criticised the rule in a number of cases, 50
in one of which his Lordship observed:"1
It (the privity principle) has never been able entirely to supplant another
principle whose roots go much deeper. I mean the principle that a man
who makes a deliberate promise which is intended to be binding, that is
to say, under seal or for good consideration, must keep his promise; and
the Court will hold him to it, not only at the suit of the party who gave
the consideration, but also at the suit of one who was not a party to the
contract, provided that it was made for his benefit and that he has a suffi-
cient interest to entitle him to enforce it, subject always, of course, to any
defences that may be open on the writs.
In the subsequent case of Beswick v Beswick the Court of Appeal
adopted the same approach. In that case:
B was a coal merchant. The defendant was assisting him in his busi-
ness. B entered into an agreement with the defendant by which the busi-
ness was to be transferred to the defendant. B was to be employed in it as
a consultant for his life and after his death the defendant was to pay to his
widow an annuity of £5 per week, which was to come out of the business.
After B's death, the defendant paid B's widow only one sum of £5. The
widow brought an action to recover the arrears of the annuity and also to
get specific performance of the agreement.
It was held that she was entitled to enforce the agreement. Thus the plain-
tiff was allowed to enforce the agreement in her personal capacity, although
she was not a party to it and it was considered not necessary to infer a trust
in favour of the plaintiff. Lord DENNING MR concluded with the words:
Where a contract is made for the benefit of a third person who has a
legitimate interest to enforce it, it can be enforced by the third person in
the name of the contracting party or jointly with him or, if he refuses to
join, by adding him as a defendant. In that sense, and it is a very real sense,
the third person has a right arising by way of contract. He has an interest
which will be protected by law. The observations to the contrary...are

the third party. S. M. Waddams, Privity of Contract in the Supreme Court of Canada, (1993)

in my opinion erroneous. It is different when a third person has no legit-
imate interest, as when he is seeking to enforce the maintenance of prices
to the public disadvantage, as in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v Selfridge &
Co Ltd or when he is seeking to rely not on any right given to him by
the contract, but on an exemption clause, seeking to exempt himself from
his just liability.
The case shows that a reform, as was recommended by the Law Revision
Committee in 1937, is long overdue and if Parliament takes any step in this
respect that would hardly be revolutionary.
Another such observation is to be seen through the words of STEYN LJ in
Darlington Borough Council v Wiltshier Northern Ltd:54
"The case for recognising a contract for the benefit of a third party
is simple and straightforward. The autonomy of the will of the parties
should be respected. The law of contract should give effect to the reason-
able expectations of contracting parties. Principle certainly requires that
a burden should not be imposed on a third party without his consent. But
there is no doctrinal, logical or policy reason why the law should deny
effectiveness to a contract for the benefit of a third party where that is the
expressed intention of the parties. Moreover, often the parties, and par-
ticularly third parties, organise their affairs on the faith of the contract.
They rely on the contract. It is therefore unjust to deny effectiveness to
such a contract. I will not struggle further with the point since nobody
seriously asserts the contrary...."
But the House of Lords did not approve the approach adopted by Lord
DENNING MR and found for the plaintiff on a different ground." Lord REID
said that the plaintiff "in her personal capacity has no right to sue, but she
has a right as administratrix of her husband's estate to require the appellant
to perform this obligation under the agreement". Lord PEARCE put it like
this: "The estate (though not the widow personally) can enforce it."56
In some earlier cases also the House of Lords showed no preference
for Lord DENNING'S approach. For example, in Scruttons Ltd v Midland
Silicones Ltd referring to the argument that the orthodox view which crys-
tallised a century ago in Tweddle v Atkinson (1861) and finally established
in Dunlop v Selfridge (1915) should be rejected, Viscount SIMOND said that
"certain statements which appear to support it in recent cases such as Smith.
v River Douglas Catchment Board and White v John Warwick & Co Ltd³⁹
must be rejected. If the principle of jus quaesitum tertio is to be introduced

into our law, it must be done by Parliament after a due consideration of its
merit and demerits". His Lordship emphasised that "the law is developed
by the application of old principles to new circumstances. Therein lies its
genesis. Its reform by the abrogation of those principles is the task not of the
courts of law but of Parliament".
Position in India: Decisions following English Law
In India also there has been a great divergence of opinion in the courts as
to how far a stranger to a contract can enforce it. There are many decided
cases which declare that a contract cannot be enforced by a person who is
not a party to it and that the rule in Tweddle v Atkinson is as much appli-
cable in India as it is in England. But there is no provision in the Contract
Act either for or against the rule. The Privy Council extended the rule to
India in its decision in Jamna Das v Pandit Ram Autar Pande."
A borrowed Rs 40,000 by executing a mortgage of her zamindari in
favour of B. Subsequently she sold the property to C for Rs 44,000 and
allowed C, the purchaser, to retain Rs 40,000 of the price in order to
redeem the mortgage if he thought fit. B sued C for the recovery of the
mortgage money, but he could not succeed because he was no party to the
agreement between A and B.
Lord MACNAUGHTAN, in his very short judgment, said that the under-
taking to pay back the mortgagee was given by the defendant to his vendor.
"The mortgagee has no right to avail himself of that. He was no party to the
sale. The purchaser entered into no contract with him, and the purchaser is
not personally bound to pay this mortgage debt."62
Thus, where all that appears is that a person transfers property to another
and stipulates for the payment of money to a third person, a suit to enforce
that stipulation by the third party will not lie. But the party making the
contract may sue for specific performance for the benefit of the third party.64
Similarly, where on a lease of certain muafi land, the lessees undertook,
as between themselves and their lessor, to be responsible for the payment
to the zamindar of certain sums which the muafidar was primarily bound
to pay, it was held that the zamindar could not enforce this covenant by a

suit against the lessees. In still another case", the plaintiff could not get
a decree against the appellant for his salary on the basis of an agreement
entered into by the plaintiff with another person.67
In the opinion of RANKIN CJ this seems to be the effect of the Contract
Act itself. In Krishna Lal Sadhu v Promila Bala Dasia he observed: Not
only, however, is there nothing in Section 2 to encourage the idea that con-
tracts can be enforced by a person who is not a party to the contract, but
this notion is rigidly excluded by the definition of "promisor" and "promi-
see". In my judgment, it is erroneous... to suppose that in India persons
who are not parties to a contract can be permitted to sue thereupon....
Consequently, a Hindu assured's wife's action to recover the money due
under her deceased husband's policy was rejected because she, though a
nominee under the policy, was not a party to the contract between the
deceased and the insurance company and no interest passed to her merely
because she was named in the policy.
Decisions not following English Law
There is, however, another line of thinking also which is mainly based
upon an observation of the Privy Council in Nawab Khwaja Muhammad
Khan v Nawab Hussaini Begum.70 Their Lordships observed:
In India and among communities circumstanced as the Mahommedans,
among whom marriages are contracted for minors by parents and guard-
ians it might occasion serious injustice if the common law doctrine was
applied to agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with
such contracts.
This statement has been taken by some High Courts as laying down the
rule that Indian courts are not bound by the rule in Tweddle v Atkinson."
Accordingly, it has been observed by the Madras High Court:
65. Mangal Sen v Mohd Husain, ILR (1915) 37 All 115.
66. State of Bihar v Charanjitlal Chadha, AIR 1960 Pat 139.
67. This line of thinking has been followed in insurance cases also. See, for example, Shankar
Vishvanath v Umabai, ILR (1913) 37 Bom 471, where the beneficiary of an insurance policy
could claim no right under the contract between the assured and the insurance company
because there was nothing to show that the plaintiff was either the promisor or the promisee
and, therefore, a party to the agreement. See also Oriental Govt Security Life Assurance Ltd

Privity of contract and of consideration 119
There is ample authority for the proposition that in this country, and
indeed in a certain class of cases in England where a contract is made
between 'A' and 'B' for the benefit of 'C', 'C' is entitled to sue the default-
ing party. It is unnecessary to cite authorities, but the principle is firmly
established for this country by the decision of the Privy Council in Nawab
Khwaja Muhammad Khan v Nawab Hussaini Begum."
Similarly, the Calcutta High Court observed:" Nor is there anything in
the Indian Contract Act, which prevents the recognition of a right in a third
party to enforce a contract made by others, which contains a provision for
his benefit.
Again, JENKINS CJ said in another important case: We now have ample
authority for saying that the administration of justice in British India is
not to be in any way hampered by the doctrine laid down in Tweddle v
Atkinson." That I take to be the result of the decision of the Privy Council
in Nawab Khwaja Muhammad Khan v Nawab Husaini Begum,
Supreme Court upholds privity
The Supreme Court of India has expressed itself in favour of the rule in
Tweddle v Atkinson. In M.C. Chacko v State Bank of Travancore," SHAH
Ag. CJ (afterwards CJ) endorsed the statement of RANKIN CJ in Krishna Lal
Sadhu v Promila Bala Dasi" and after referring to the observation of Lord
HALDANE in Dunlop v Selfridge, said:
The Judicial Committee applied that rule in Nawab Khwaja
Muhammad Khan v Nawab Hussaini Begum.80 In a later case, Jamna

where the court said that the doctrine of privity of contract has undergone a change in recent
years and, therefore, a principal can initiate a legal action against a third party although the
principal was only one of the beneficiaries under the contract. The court cited the decision
of the High Court of Australia in Trident General Insurance v McNiece Bros P Ltd, (1988)
165 CLR 107: 1989 Comm LR 1 where the court observed: "The long-established rule that
a contract could be enforced only by the parties to that contract had caused considerable
injustice and inconvenience in the context of contracts of liability insurance. The existence
of the privity rule had provoked criticism by judges, academics and law reform agencies alike
and in some jurisdictions statutory abrogation of the rule had occurred. It would be unjust
in the present case to apply the rule and preclude the respondent from enforcing the policy of
insurance." The court also cited Indian Mutual General Insurance Society Ltd v Himalaya
Finance and Construction Co, AIR 1974 Del 114, where the ratio of the decision was that the
owners of a vehicle who really have legal interest in the property could very easily come within
the definition of beneficiary, though not party to the policy because the same was taken out by
the hirer.

120 Chapter 3 Consideration
[S. 2(d)]
Das v Pandit Ram Autar Pande," the Judicial Committee pointed out
that the purchaser's contract to pay off a mortgage could not be enforced.
by the mortgagee who was not a party to the contract. It must therefore
be taken as well-settled that except in the case of a beneficiary under a
trust or in the case of a family arrangement, no right may be enforced by
a person who is not a party to contract. 82
The facts of the case were as follows:
The Highland Bank was indebted to the State Bank of Travancore
under an overdraft. One M was the manager of the Highland Bank and
his father K had guaranteed the repayment of the overdraft. K gifted
his properties to the members of his family. The gift deed provided that
the liability, if any, under the guarantee should be met by M either from
the bank or from the share of property gifted to him. The State Bank
attempted to hold M liable under this provision of the deed.
But he was held not liable. "The State Bank not being a party to the deed
was not bound by the covenants in the deed, nor could it enforce the cove-
nants. It is settled law that a person not a party to a contract cannot enforce
the terms of the contract."
The representatives who held the properties of K would have been liable.
to pay out of the property if the action against them had not been time
barred.
Exceptions to privity rule
In the course of time, the courts have introduced a number of excep-
tions in which the rule of privity of contract does not prevent a person from
enforcing a contract which has been made for his benefit but without his
being a party to it. Many of the exceptions are connected with the special
branches of the law of contract, such as negotiable instruments, agency, bill
of lading, railway receipts, transfer of property, etc. Some of the most com-
monly known exceptions may be considered here.
1. Beneficiaries under trust or charge or other arrangements
A person in whose favour a charge or other interest in some specific prop-
erty has been created may enforce it though he is not a party to the contract.
The decision of the Privy Council in Nawab Khwaja Muhammad Khan v
Nawab Hussaini Begum is illustrative of this principle. The facts were:

Privity of contract and of consideration 121
The appellant executed an agreement with the respondent's father that
in consideration of the respondent's marriage with his son (both being
minors at the time) he would pay to the respondent Rs 500 a month in
perpetuity for the betel-leaf expenses and charged certain properties with
the payment, with power to the respondent to enforce it. The husband
and wife separated on account of a quarrel and the suit was brought by
the plaintiff-respondent for the recovery of the arrears of this annuity.
It was held that the respondent, although no party to the agreement, was
clearly entitled to proceed in equity to enforce her claim. "Here the agree-
ment executed by the defendant (appellant) specifically charges immovable
property for the allowance which he binds himself to pay to the plain-
tiff (respondent); she is the only person beneficially entitled under it." An
example of a trust in favour of a third party is to be found in the facts of
another Privy Council decision, namely, Rana Uma Nath Bakhsh Singh v
Jang Bahadur:" U was appointed by his father as his successor and was put
in possession of his entire estate. In consideration thereof U agreed with
his father to pay a certain sum of money and to give a village to J, the ille-
gitimate son of his father, on his attaining majority. It was held that in the
circumstances mentioned above a trust was created in favour of J for the
specified amount and the village. Hence he was entitled to maintain the
suit.
In England also there is a line of cases in which "trust" has been used as
a device for holding the promisór to his promise. One such case is Gregory
Parker v Williams:8
Parker was indebted to both Williams and Gregory. Parker assigned all
his property to Williams in satisfaction of the debt and Williams prom-
ised to pay Parker's debt to Gregory. Williams failed to pay. But he was
held liable to pay Gregory in terms of his promise with Parker.
Another illustration is Touche v Metropolitan Rly Warehousing Co:17
The plaintiff rendered services to the promoters of the defendant-
company and they promised that he should receive £2000 from the com-
pany. Later, when the company was formed, its articles of association
provided that £2000 should be paid to Walker, one of the promoters, for
the benefit of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff sued the company in his own name. It was held that the
defendant-company's promise was for the benefit of the plaintiff and that
the plaintiff had the right to obtain the benefit of the arrangement entered
into between the promoter and the company.

122 Chapter 3 Consideration
[S. 2(d)]
Trust may be actual or constructive. But in general the courts are slow to
infer a constructive trust. Explaining the judicial approach in Ramchand v
Thakur Janki Ballabhji Maharaj SHAH, AG CJ (afterwards CJ) said:
For creating a charge on immovable property no particular form of
words is needed;... But in order that a charge may be created, there must
be evidence of intention disclosed by the deed that a specified property
or fund was intended to be made liable to satisfy the debt. The recitals in
the deed (in the present case) do not evidence any intention of the donor
to create a charge in favour of the State Bank; they merely set out an
arrangement between the donor and the members of his family that the
liability under the guarantee will be satisfied by M.C. Chacko out of the
property allotted to him under the deed.
Constructive trust is created in favour of an addressee of insured arti-
cles and he can claim compensation from the Central Government on
non-delivery of such articles.89
An airline company made an arrangement with a hotel for accommo-
dating its passengers. One of the passengers so accommodated was injured
because of negligent maintenance of the hotel premises. His action directly
against the hotel-keeper was allowed. The court said the doctrine of privity
of contract is subject to many exceptions, one of them being that a benefi-
ciary can sue on a contract which is meant only to provide some benefits to
him.90
2. Marriage settlement, partition or other family arrangements
Where an agreement is made in connection with marriage, partition or
other family arrangement and a provision is made for the benefit of a per-
son, he may take advantage of that agreement although he is no party to
it. For example, in Rose Fernandez v Joseph Gonsalves," a girl's father
entered into an agreement for her marriage with the defendant, it was held
that the girl after attaining majority could sue the defendant for damages for
breach of the promise of marriage and the defendant could not take the plea
that she was not a party to the agreement. Similarly, where two brothers,

passage to a person who had purchased a part of the property. Denial of such passage to the

improper.

on a partition of joint properties, agreed to invest in equal shares a certain
sum of money for the maintenance of their mother she was held entitled to
require them to make the investment." Also, where a daughter along with
her husband agreed that she will maintain her mother if the property of the
father is conveyed to them, the mother was held entitled to maintain a suit
for specific performance although the agreement was between the father,
daughter and the daughter's husband only and the mother was not a party
to it." Another interesting case is Daropti v Jaspat Rai." The defendant's
wife left him because of his cruelty. He then executed an agreement with
her father, promising to treat her properly, and if he failed to do so, to pay
her monthly maintenance and to provide her with a dwelling. Subsequently
she was again ill-treated by the defendant and also driven out. She was held
entitled to enforce the promise made by the defendant to her father.
3. Acknowledgment or estoppel
Where by the terms of a contract a party is required to make a payment
to a third person and he acknowledges it to that third person, a binding obli-
gation is thereby incurred towards him. Acknowledgment may be express
or implied. This exception covers cases where the promisor by his conduct,
acknowledgment, or otherwise, constitutes himself an agent of the third
party. The case of N. Devaraja Urs v Ramakrishniah" is a good example:
A sold his house to B under a registered sale deed and left a part of the
sale price in his hands desiring him to pay this amount to C, his creditor.
Subsequently B made part-payments to C informing him that they were out
of the sale price left with him and that the balance would be remitted imme-
diately. B, however, failed to remit the balance and C sued him for the same.
The suit was held to be maintainable. "Though originally there was no priv-
ity of contract between B and C, B having subsequently acknowledged his
liability, C was entitled to sue him for recovery of the amount."
An illustration of acknowledgment by conduct is Kshirodebihari Datta
v Mangobinda Panda: The tenant and the sub-tenant of a piece of land
agreed between themselves that the sub-tenant would pay the tenant's rent
direct to the landlord. The agreement was acted upon by all the parties
interested.
Under these circumstances the landlord was allowed to obtain a decree
for his rent direct against the sub-tenant. In other words, the sub-tenant was
estopped from denying his liability to pay the tenant's rent on the ground
that there was no such contract between him and the landlord.
In a tripartite building contract the builder contracting with his employer
simultaneously agreed to be directly responsible to the owner of the building.

[S. 2(d)]
It was held that the employer had no right to sue the builder for any loss
caused to the owner by any deficiency in works. Such liability was incurred
directly to the owner.97
4. Covenants running with land
The rule of privity may also be modified by the principles relating to
transfer of immovable property. The principle of the famous case of Tulk v
Moxhay is that a person who purchases a land with notice that the owner
of the land is bound by certain duties created by an agreement or covenant
affecting the land, shall be bound by them although he was not a party to
the agreement.
An illustration of the principle is Smith & Snipes Hall Farm Ltd v River
Douglas Catchment Board:" The defendants (the Board) agreed with cer-
tain landowners adjoining a stream to improve the banks of the stream and
to maintain them in good condition. The landlords on their part paid pro-
portionate costs. Subsequently one of the landlords sold his land to the first
plaintiff and he to the second plaintiff. There was negligence on the part of
the Board in maintaining the banks, which burst and the land was flooded.
Both the plaintiffs were strangers to the agreement with the Board, but
even so the Court of Appeal allowed them to sue the Board for breach of the
contract, for the whole arrangement was for the benefit of the landowners.
whoever they might be and not merely the parties to the agreement.
Where the Central Government assigned a piece of land to its own cor-
porate undertaking with all the rights, interests and privileges, it was held
that privileges or rights to exemption from payment of land revenue which
had accrued to the Central Government in respect of that land would also
be available to the undertaking as a successor in interest to the Central
Government. 100
"... HAS DONE OR ABSTAINED FROM DOING..."
These words mean that consideration is an act or abstinence which has
already been done at the desire of the promisor, or is in progress or is prom-
ised to be done in future. An act which has already been done in response to
the promise is referred to as an executed consideration.
Past consideration
It is an age-old principle of English law that consideration should be
contemporaneous with the promise. Consideration, being the price for the

"... Has done or abstained from doing..." 125
promise, should be given in response to and as an inducement for the prom-
ise. If the act has been done before any promise is made, it is called past
consideration and a past consideration is no consideration. If, for example:
A has lost his purse and B, a finder, delivers it to him. A, in recognition of
this service, promises to pay B, a sum of money. This promise is given for an
act which was done before any promise existed, and, therefore, cannot be
said to have been done as a price for the promise. The promise is to pay for
a wholly past act and is, therefore, no more than an expression of gratitude.
The past act may explain why the promise was given and may, thus, be a
motive for the promise, but it furnishes no legal consideration.101 "The con-
sideration and the promise ought to go together."102 An example is McArdle,
re:03 A effected certain improvements to property. The ultimate beneficiar-
ies of the property signed a document declaring that: "In consideration of
your carrying out certain alterations and improvements, we the beneficiaries
shall repay to you the sum of £488 in settlement of the amount spent on
such improvements." An action to enforce this promise was rejected.
JENKINS LJ said: "But the true position was that, as the work had in fact
all been done and nothing remained to be done by the promisee at all, the
consideration was wholly past consideration, and, therefore, the beneficiar-
ies' agreement for the repayment to her out of the estate was nudum pactum,
a promise with no consideration to support it."104
The rule involves inconvenience and hardship. If a person promises to
pay for a past act, he means to recognise the past consideration and, there-
fore, should not be permitted to break his voluntary promise. The (English)
Law Reform Committee has, therefore, recommended the abolition of the
rule.105
Past act at request good consideration
However, an important exception is almost as old as the rule itself. It was
established as early as 1616 in Lampleigh v Brathwait that a past act done
at request will be good consideration for a subsequent promise. The facts
were:
The defendant, having committed a murder, requested the plaintiff to
labour and to do his endeavour to obtain pardon from the King. The
plaintiff did his best to obtain the King's pardon, riding and journeying at
his own expense. Afterwards the defendant promised the plaintiff to give
him £100 and then refused to pay. He was, however, held liable.

126 Chapter 3 Consideration
[S. 2(d)]
The court observed: "A mere voluntary courtesy will not have considera-
tion to uphold as assumpsit. 107 But if the courtsey were moved by a request
of the party that gives the promise, it will bind, for the promise, though it
follows, yet it is not naked, but it couples itself with the suit before."
The modern version of this rule is that in such cases it is ordinarily in the
contemplation of the parties that the service rendered at request would be
ultimately paid for and that subsequent promise is nothing but a fixation of
reasonable compensation for the service.
Besides this, two more exceptions have been admitted. A promise to pay a
time-barred debt and a negotiable instrument issued for a past consideration
are both valid.
Position in India
It is not necessary for the courts in India to follow the English rule as to
past consideration. 108 A past consideration may arise in two ways. It may
consist of services rendered at request but without any promise at the time
or it may consist of voluntary services.
1. Past voluntary service
A past voluntary service is adequately covered by the provision in
Section 25(2). A voluntary service means a service rendered without any
request or promise and there is a subsequent promise to pay for the same.
For example, to borrow an illustration from Anson:
"If A saves B from drowning and B later promises A a reward."
Then in English law "A cannot rely on his action as consideration for B's
promise for it is past in point of time".109 But in India the promise would
be enforceable by virtue of Section 25(2) which provides that "a promise to
compensate, wholly or in part, a person who has already voluntarily done
something for the promisor" is enforceable. The Act gives the following two
illustrations to explain this:
"A finds B's purse and gives it to him. B promises to give A Rs 50. This
is a contract."
"A supports B's infant son. B promises to pay A's expenses in so doing.
This is a contract."
2. Past service at request
The only area of uncertainty should be about requested services, because
this is not adequately covered either by Section 2(d) or by Section 25(b).
107. Assumpsit was the name of a form of action (now abolished) from which the law of contract
originated.
108. Devukutty Amma v Madhusudanan Nair, (1995) 2 KLT 118, where it was observed that
past consideration is good consideration under the Indian Contract Act and that it is a devi-
ation from the English common law.

[S. 2(d)]

"... Has done or abstained from doing..."
Section 2(d) requires that the act should be done at the promisor's desire.
This presupposes the existence of a promise to pay for the act and even when
construed literally the provision cannot apply to an act done at request but
without any promise to pay. But the provision can be construed to include an
act which has been done at request and for which a promise to pay is given
subsequently. Even if no subsequent promise is given the courts can, follow-
ing the principle laid down in Upton-on-Severn RDC v Powell,110 infer an
implied promise. Every request for an act carries an inbuilt promise to pay.
In the words of BOWEN LJ in Casey's Patents, re, Stewart v Casey:111
The fact of a past service raises an implication that at the time it was
rendered it was to be paid for, and if it was a service which was to be
paid for, when you get in the subsequent document a promise to pay, that
promise may be treated as an admission which evidences or as a positive
bargain which fixes the amount of that reasonable remuneration on the
faith of which the service was originally rendered.
In that case, J and T, the joint owners of a patent, wrote a letter to their
manager saying: "We now have pleasure in stating that in consideration
of your services as the practical manager in working both our patents, we
hereby agree to give you one-third share of the patents". The court held that
"here for past services there is ample justification for the promise to give the
third share".
Pollock and Mulla have been heavily in favour of this interpretation of
Section 2(d). The learned editor, Mr J.L. Kapur expressed his preference in
these words:112
They (the words 'has done or abstained from doing') declare the law
to be that an act done by A at B's request, without any contemporaneous
promise from B, may be a consideration for a subsequent promise from
B to A.... The use of the perfect tense in the clause embodies in the law
of India the exception to the general rule which is supposed to have been
made by the seventeenth century case of Lampleigh v Brathwait.113
The Bombay High Court in Sindha Shri Ganpatsinghji v Abraham laid
down that services rendered to a minor at his request and which were con-
tinued after majority at the same request, were good consideration for his
promise to pay.
Past and executed consideration
A past consideration should, however, be distinguished from executed
consideration. Past consideration always consists of an act done without any
promise. But executed consideration means an act which has been done in
110. (1942) 1 All ER 220 (CA). See "Proposal" or "Offer" in the first chapter.

[S. 2(d)]
response to a positive promise. Where, for example, a reward is offered for
finding a lost article, the offer can be accepted only by producing the article
to the offeror and that is also a consideration for the promise. It is, thus, an
example of a consideration which has already been executed. Explaining
this in Union of India v Chaman Lal Loona & Colls S.K. DAS J of the
Supreme Court said: "An executed consideration consists of an act for a
promise. It is the act which forms the consideration. No contract is formed
unless and until the act is performed, e.g., the payment for a railway ticket,
but the act stipulated for exhausts the consideration, so that any subsequent
promise, without further consideration, is merely a nudum pactum. In an
executed consideration the liability is outstanding on one side only; it is a
present as opposed to a future consideration."
"In an executory consideration the liability is outstanding on both sides.
It is in fact a promise for a promise; one promise is bought by the other.
The contract is concluded as soon as promises are exchanged. In mercantile
contracts this is by far the most common variety."116
Executory consideration
Thus consideration may consist of an act which has already been, or is
in the process of being done. It may also consist of an act which is only
promised to be done at some future time. There may be a simple exchange
of promises and each promise is a consideration for the other. For example:
A agrees to sell and B to buy a quantity of goods at a stated price. In other
words, A has promised to sell and B has promised to pay. Until the goods are
actually delivered to B under the contract, the consideration is executory.
To put it in a few words, consideration may, under Section 2(d), consist of a

IS CALLED CONSIDERATION"
Consideration must be of some value
Consideration, as defined in the Act, means some act, abstinence or
promise on the part of the promisee or any other person which has been
done at the desire of the promisor.18 Does it, therefore, mean that even a
worthless act will suffice to make a good consideration if it is only done at

the promisor's desire. For example: A promises to give his new Rolls-Royce
car to B, provided B will fetch it from the garage.119 The act of fetching the
car cannot by any stretch of imagination be called a consideration for the
promise. Yet it is the only act the promisor desired the promisee to do. Such
an act no doubt satisfies the words of the definition, but it does not catch its
spirit. It is for this reason that the English common law has always insisted
that "consideration must be of some value in the eyes of the law."120 White y
Bluett¹¹ may be cited as an illustration in point.
The defendant owed a sum of money under a promissory note to his
father. The defendant perpetually, day and night, complained to his father
that he had not been treated equally with other children in the distribu-
tion of his property. Thereupon the father promised to discharge him
from all liability in respect of the loan and the note, provided he would
stop complaining, which the defendant accordingly did. The question was
whether the defendant's promise to cease his complaints was a sufficient
consideration to sustain his father's promise.
POLLOCK CB said: "It would be ridiculous to suppose that such promises
could be binding. In reality there was no consideration whatever." In a later
case a judge said that "a contract founded upon such an illusory considera-
tion appears to be as invalid as a promise by a father made in consideration
that his son would not bore him".122
In India also it has been laid down by SUBBA RAO J (afterwards CJ) of
the Supreme Court in a case that consideration "shall be 'something"
which not only the parties regard but the law can also regard as having
some value". Similarly, it has been observed by the Madras High Court:124
Though the Indian Contract Act does not in terms provide that consid-
eration must be good or valuable to sustain a contract it has always been
understood that consideration means something which is of some value
in the eyes of law. It must be real and not illusory, whether adequate or
not.... So long as the consideration is not unreal it is sufficient if it be of
slight value only.
But the courts have been very liberal in this respect and have always tried
to find value in something to which parties attach value. Thus, a transfer of
property "in consideration that the transferee shall accept the responsibility

and discharge those recurrent religious services and ceremonies",125 and a
promise by a wife to pay off her husband's debts and to maintain his mother
made in consideration of enjoying certain properties, were held to be for
valuable consideration.126
Value need not be adequate (adequacy of consideration)
It is not, however, necessary that consideration should be adequate to the
promise. The courts can hardly assume the job of settling what should be
the appropriate consideration for a promise. It is entirely for the parties. If a
party gets what he has contracted for and if it is of some value, which may
be great or small, the courts "will not enquire whether it was equivalent to
the promise which he gave in return". 127 "The adequacy of the consideration
is for the parties to consider at the time of making the agreement, not for
the court when it is sought to be enforced.128 This is the English rule and
is applicable in India also, for Explanation 2 attached to Section 25 lays it
down so clearly that "an agreement to which the consent of the promisor
is freely given is not void merely because the consideration is inadequate".
This is further fortified by illustration (f) which is as follows: A agrees to
sell a horse worth Rs 1000 for Rs 10. A's consent to the agreement was freely
given. The agreement is a contract notwithstanding the inadequacy of the
consideration.
The best known English authority is De La Bere v Pearson Ltd.129
The defendants, who were newspaper proprietors, offered to answer
inquiries from readers of the paper desiring financial advice. The plaintiff
wrote to them asking for a safe investment and also for the name of a
good stock broker. The editor recommended a person who, unknown to
him, was, in fact, an undischarged bankrupt. The plaintiff, in reliance on
the recommendation, sent sums for investment and they were immedi-
ately misappropriated. In an action against the defendants, the question
was whether there was sufficient consideration for the offer of the advice.
Holding that there was, VAUGHAN WILLIAM J said: "Such publication
might obviously have a tendency to increase the sale of the defendant's

sideration in such a situation and even if it is there the contract cannot be rendered nugatory

paper. I think that this offer, when accepted, resulted in a contract for good
consideration."
The principle has been followed in this country also. The transfer of the
goodwill and the whole of the assets of a business for a bare Rs 1000 has
been upheld.130
Inadequacy as evidence of imposition
However, the Act provides in Explanation 2 to Section 25 that "inade-
quacy of consideration may be taken into account by the court in determining
the question whether the consent of promisor was freely given". Illustration
(g) explains this: A agrees to sell a horse worth Rs 1000 for Rs 10. A denies
that his consent to the agreement was freely given. The inadequacy of the
consideration is a fact which the court should take into account in consider-
ing whether or not A's consent was freely given.
"A party seeking to set aside a transaction on the ground of inadequacy
of consideration, must show such inadequacy as will involve the conclusion
that he either did not understand what he was about, or was the victim of
some imposition."131 For "once a court is satisfied that a person has entered
into an agreement freely and with knowledge of its purport and effect", the
agreement will be valid notwithstanding the inadequacy of consideration.
Even where a transaction is avoided under this principle, it is not because of
the inadequacy of consideration, but because of fraud or some other vitiat-
ing element. For "inadequacy of consideration may in circumstances suggest
fraud, coercion, mistake and such like". The same result would follow
where the consideration is so markedly inadequate as to be unconscionable
and there is a serious inequality of bargaining power between the parties. A
lady was injured as a result of the defendant's negligent driving. Soon there-
after she confronted an insurance adjuster and signed up a release agreement
of all her claims for just $331. Subsequently she sued the defendant in tort
and her damages were assessed at $21,000. She was held to be not bound by
the agreement. She was still suffering from her injuries; she received no inde-
pendent advice and was, therefore, in a much weaker position as compared
with a professional claim adjuster.133
Forbearance to sue
Forbearance to sue has always been regarded as valuable consideration.
It is, indeed, a kind of abstinence, which is so very clearly recognised as

[S. 2(d)]
good consideration in the definition itself. "Forbearance to sue" means that
the plaintiff has a certain right of action against the defendant or any other
person and on a promise by the defendant he refrains from bringing the
action. The Patna High Court observed in a case that: Where a wife who
is ready to sue her husband for maintenance allowance has forborne to sue
on husband's agreeing to pay her monthly allowance by way of mainte-
nance, the contract is supported by consideration as wife's forbearance to
sue amounts to consideration for husband's agreement for payment of main-
tenance allowance.
Another easy illustration is in a decision of the Kerala High Court:135
Three depositors of a bank refrained from demanding payment of their
deposits, although they had matured and become payable, as the director
of the bank had given them a written agreement undertaking personal lia-
bility to return the amount with interest at 6 per cent within 12 months.
This forbearance to withdraw the amount or press for its repayment was
held to be sufficient consideration for the agreement within the meaning of
Section 2(d),136
An act or forbearance on the part of the creditor, though it may not be
for a definite period, is a good consideration. The compromise of doubtful
rights has also been regarded as sufficient consideration for an agreement.137
But there must be a bona fide claim and not merely one which is set up
frivolously or vexatiously. "If there is in fact a serious claim honestly made,
the abandonment of the claim is good consideration for a contract."138 "If
a person believes that he has a bona fide claim to enforce, his forbearance
from trying to put that claim in a court and to have it decided will be a good
consideration for a contract, however the claim, if brought, may be decid-
ed."139 A claim set up on the basis of a false or forged "will" cannot sustain
an agreement. Rejecting a claim of this kind in Krishna Chandra Dutta
Roy v Hemaja Sankar Nandi the Calcutta High Court cited the following
statement of Lord BLACKBURN: Of course, forbearance of a non-existing
claim would not be forbearance at all."41
Again there can be no real forbearance unless the claim is immediately
due. In Manna Lal v Bank of Bengal:12

Performance of existing duties 133
A hundi debt had not yet matured when the acceptor of the hundies
pledged his own house and shops as security for due payment in the event
of their dishonour on maturity.
The court quite obviously came to the conclusion that there was no con-
sideration for the pledge.
Compromise good irrespective of merits
Compromise of a pending suit is a good consideration for the agreement
of compromise. But here also it is essential that the dispute should be bona
fide, although the Patna High Court has held in a case that a compromise
is binding even if the "suit was based on a false claim". However, a com-
promise is a good consideration "irrespective of merits of the claim of either
side", and even "where there is some doubt in the minds of the parties as to
their respective rights",144
An agreement to accept a new mortgage in substitution and in considera-
tion of not enforcing the earlier mortgage, although the original was executed
only by one person and the substitute by four persons 145 and an agreement
to release a debtor and to accept a new debtor in his place have been sus-
tained.146 "An agreement to avoid further litigation is not an agreement void
of consideration."147 Similarly, it has been held that "where an agreement
has been arrived at between certain members of a family that is designed to
promote grace and goodwill, this by itself is a good consideration to support
the transaction."148 In a case before the Supreme Court 149 two brothers were
quarrelling over the division of their late father's property. Their mother
persuaded the junior to give up the struggle on the promise that if the elder
one did not provide him a sum of money she would subsidise him. The
promise was held to be enforceable. It was given to purchase family peace
and that was sufficient consideration.

134 Chapter 3 Consideration
[S. 2(d)]
by law or by contract. "Performance of a legal duty is no consideration
for a promise." This principle of English law was adopted by the Madras
High Court in P. Sashannah Chetti v P. Ramasamy Chetti¹ even before
the Contract Act came into force, although the Act contains no provision
on the point.
The facts of the case were that the plaintiff had been served with sum-
mons requiring him to give evidence before a court of law. The defendant,
who was a party to the case, gave him a promissory note promising to pay
a sum of money for his trouble. The note was held to be void for want of
consideration.
The court observed: "It is quite clear that if a sub poena (summon) had
been served, and the note had been given to compensate the plaintiff for his
loss of time or other inconvenience, it would have been without consider-
ation, because his attendance and the giving of evidence would have been
merely the performance of a duty imposed upon him by law." Collins v
Godefroy is an English authority to the same effect. Similarly, a promise
to pay a sum of money to a police officer for investigating a crime will be
without consideration if he is already bound to do so by law. "But doing or
agreeing to do more than one's official duty will serve as consideration."
As was observed by Lord DENMAN CJ in England v Davidson:15 "I think
there may be services which the constable is not bound to render and which
he may, therefore, make the ground of a contract." Following this principle
the Court allowed in that case a police officer, who had given information
leading to the conviction of a criminal, to recover the reward offered by the
defendant for such information. But in all such cases the court must make
sure that the service rendered is really beyond the scope of official duty and
not a mere pretence for extracting money. An American Judge remarked in
a case that:
If a constable for making extraordinary efforts to perform an ordinary
official act, may not only receive, but may also collect by law a compensa-
tion beyond what the statute allows for the act, any other officer may do
the same; and sheriffs, legislators and judges might, and soon would, put
their extraordinary efforts in the market, to be had by the higher bidder.
This is a sickening and revolting view of the subject:153
In an American case:
A fireman was allowed to receive a reward offered by a husband to
anyone who would rescue his wife from a burning building, dead or alive,
because at great peril to his life and health he accomplished the rescue of

her dead body and because the court found that as a fireman of the city
he was not legally bound to risk his life in that rescue.114
The English case of Glasbrook Bros Ltd v Glamorgan County Council'ss
is another illustration of services rendered outside the scope of official
obligations:
On the occasion of a strike, a colliery manager applied for police
protection for his colliery and insisted that it could only be efficiently
protected by billeting a police force on the colliery premises. The police
superintendent was prepared to provide what in his opinion was adequate
protection by means of a mobile force, but refused to billet police officers
at the colliery except on the terms of the manager agreeing to pay for
the force so provided at a specified rate. It was held by a majority that
there was nothing illegal in the agreement, nor was it void for want of
consideration.
The court laid down that "although the police authority is bound to pro-
vide sufficient protection to life and property without payment, if in par-
ticular circumstances, at the request of an individual, they provide a special
form of protection outside the scope of their public duty, they may demand
payment for it".
On the same principle, the mother of an illegitimate child, having been
separated from the child's father, was allowed to enforce the father's prom-
ise to pay £1 per week for looking after the child, although she was herself
under a statutory obligation to maintain the child.156 Similarly, a married
woman who had deserted her husband was allowed to enforce her husband's
promise to pay her a weekly sum if she would maintain herself and lead a
chaste life.157 In the last-mentioned case DENNING LJ said: "A promise to
perform an existing duty is, I think, sufficient consideration to support a
promise, so long as there is nothing in the transaction which is contrary to
the public interest."
Performance of contractual obligations
A. Pre-existing contract with promisor
Secondly, compliance with legal obligation imposed by a contract with
the promisor can be no consideration for a promise. An illustration is sup-
plied by the facts of Ramchandra Chintaman v Kalu Raju:158
The plaintiff accepted a Vakalatnama from the defendant to act for
him in a certain suit on receiving his usual fee. Subsequently the defend-
ant agreed to pay him a certain sum as a special reward (inam), if the suit

[S. 2(d)]
was decided in his favour. The suit was decided in favour of the defendant,
who, however, did not pay the amount. The plaintiff, therefore, brought
the present suit against him.
Rejecting the action, WESTROPPE CJ said: "The plaintiff, having accepted
a Vakalatnama was already bound to render his best service as a pleader.
There was no fresh consideration proceeding from the plaintiff when he
obtained the agreement."
The better known illustration is the old English case of Stilk v Meyrick:19
In this case while a ship was on a voyage, two of the seamen deserted;
and the captain, having in vain attempted to supply their places, entered
into an agreement with the rest of the crew that if they work the ship
home, they should have the wages of the two who had deserted equally
divided among them.
Lord ELLENBOROUGH CJ held that the agreement was void for want of
consideration in as much as it was the contractual duty of the mariners who
remained with the ship to exert themselves utmost in any emergency of the
voyage to bring the ship in safety to her destined port and the desertion of a
part of the crew was definitely an emergency of the voyage.
But where, in another case, sailors refused to complete a voyage because
of war risks, not originally contemplated, but remained on duty on the
promise of extra pay, they were allowed to recover it.160 The principle would
seem to be that "where conditions have arisen under which a party is enti-
tled to refuse to go ahead with his contract, a promise to pay him extra
if he will not do so is valid".161 Where the main contractor found that his
sub-contractor was slow in progress and it was partly due to the low rates
allowed to him. Partly for this reason and partly for the reason that the main
contractor would fall under heavy penalties if the work was not completed
in time, he promised more money to the sub-contractor for doing the same
work which he had already undertaken and no additional work. He was
held bound to pay the sub-contractor according to the increased rates. 162 It
has been observed that the case provided an authority for the proposition
that a promise to perform an existing obligation can amount to good con-
sideration provided there are practical benefits to the promisee. This state-
ment was not accepted to be a working principle in a subsequent case in
which the payment of tax arrears was rescheduled to the acceptance of the
Tax Collector, but the agreement was held to be not binding. An aggravat-
ing factor was that the taxpayer was not able to keep up the payment of

instalments.163 The court said: "When a creditor and a debtor who are at
arm's length reach agreement on the payment of the debt by instalments to
accommodate the debtor, the creditor will no doubt always see a practical
benefit to himself in so doing."
The court continued to say that if there were no authority, like the deci-
sion in John Weston Foakes v Julia Beer, there would have been much to
be said for the enforceability of such a contract. The same result was reached
in another case involving part payment, namely C Re (A debtor). A person
was under a statutory demand of the Legal Aid Board for about £16,500.
He mailed a cheque for the lesser amount of £14,000 with a request for the
Board to return the cheque if it was not acceptable in full settlement. The
Board accepted the cheque but only "on account". Thus, it was not possible
for the debtor to prove a promise by the Board to accept the lesser sum.
These cases were distinguished from the decision in Williams v Roffey Bros
Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd. Here money was promised to a contractor
in excess of the amount for which he undertook to complete the project. The
promise was intended to ensure the completion of the work in time. There
was no evidence of any undue influence or exploitation by the contractor.
The court overcame the effect of authorities by resorting to the doctrine of
promissory estoppel. The best and simplest description of the doctrine and
how it works is to be found in the following words of Lord DENNING:167
"When a man, by his words or conduct, has led another to believe
that he may safely act on the faith of them-and the other does act on
them he will not be allowed to go back on what he has said or done
when it would be unjust and inequitable to do so."
In a Canadian case,169 a contractor was carrying out construction work
for the completion of which the plaintiff was to supply steel at a fixed price.
The plaintiff then found that steel prices were rising and, therefore, asked
the contractor for an upward revision of the price for future supplies. The
contractor orally accepted the revision and also accepted deliveries against
invoices reflecting the increased price. The contractor, however, did not pay
and the supplier sued for the difference. It was held that the price revision
being without consideration, the contractor was not bound. The fact that he
continued to accept supplies without repudiating the invoices did not create
any promissory estoppel against him.169

138 Chapter 3 Consideration
Promise to pay less than amount due
[S. 2(d)]
On the same principle, a promise to pay less than what is due under a
contract cannot be regarded as a consideration. This rule, having been laid
down in an early case, was thus formulated in Pinnel's case. 170
"Payment of a lesser sum on the day in satisfaction of a greater cannot
be any satisfaction for the whole, because it appears to the judges that by
no possibility can a lesser sum be a satisfaction to the plaintiff for a greater
sum. But the gift of a horse, hawk or robe, etc., in satisfaction is good. For
it shall be intended that a horse, hawk or robe, etc., might be more ben-
eficial to the plaintiff than the money in respect of some circumstances;
or otherwise, the plaintiff would not have accepted of it in satisfaction."
The rule was criticised by JESSEL MR in a case where his Lordship
said: "According to English Common Law a creditor might accept anything
in satisfaction of his debt except a less amount of money. He might take a
horse, or a canary, or a tomtit he chose, and that was accord and satisfaction.
but, by a most extraordinary peculiarity of the English Common Law, he
cannot take 19s. 6d. in the pound."
Similarly, Earl of SELBORNE LC said in Weston Foakes v Julia Beer: 172
"It might be (and indeed I think it would be) an improvement in our law, if
a release or acquittance of the whole debt, on payment of any sum which
the creditor might be content to receive by way of accord and satisfaction
(though less than the whole) where held to be, generally, binding,...."
Despite this criticism the rule was unanimously affirmed by the House of
Lords in the above-cited case:
Dr Foakes was ordered by a judgment decree to pay £2000 to Mrs
Beer. The doctor, not being able to pay up at once, made an agreement
with her under which he paid £200 immediately and agreed to pay the
balance by instalments and she in her turn agreed not to enforce the judg-
ment. When the balance was fully paid, she sued the doctor to recover
interest on the judgment-debt.
The House of Lords held that she was entitled to the payment of the
judgment-debt and to interest to the date of final payment as she accepted
less in satisfaction of the whole and there was no consideration for her prom-
ise to accept anything less than the sum to which she was entitled.
Exceptions to the rule in "Pinnel case".
The Law Revision Committee in its report in 1937 recommended aboli-
tion of the rule,173 The courts have tried to avoid the awkward results of the
rule by admitting exceptions to it.

[S. 2(d)]
1. Part-payment by third party
Performance of existing duties 139
In the first place, part-payment by a third party may be a good consider-
ation for the discharge of the whole of the debt.
The father of a debtor wrote to the creditor, offering an amount less
than that of the debt in full settlement of the debt, and enclosing a draft
for that amount, and the creditor cashed and retained the proceeds of
the draft, and afterwards brought an action against the debtor for the
balance of the debt. It was held that the creditor must be taken to have
accepted the amount received by him on the terms upon which it was
offered, and therefore, he could not maintain the action.174
A debtor's wife has not been regarded as a third person for this purpose.
The plaintiff had a claim of £ 480 against the defendant. To the knowl-
edge of the defendant he was in desperate financial straits. Exploiting
this knowledge they offered him only £ 300 in full satisfaction, which he
accepted. The payment was made by the defendant's wife.
The plaintiff was allowed to recover the remaining £180 on two grounds,
first, there was no consideration for the settlement and, second, there was
no true accord because no person can insist upon a settlement procured by
intimidation,17
2. Composition
Secondly, payment of a lesser sum is a good satisfaction for a larger sum
where this is done in pursuance of an agreement of compromise entered into
by the debtor with his creditors.
3. Payment before time
Thirdly, payment of a lesser sum before time, or in a different mode or
at a different place than appointed in the original contract or "the gift of a
horse, hawk or robe, etc., in satisfaction is good".176
4. Promissory estoppel
The following statement of BOWEN LJ is an instructive expression of the
principle of promissory estoppel.177
If persons who have contractual rights against others induce by their
conduct those against whom they have such rights to believe that such
rights will either not be enforced or will be kept in suspense or abeyance

[S. 2(d)]
for some particular time, those persons will not be allowed by a Court of
Enquiry to enforce the rights until such time has elapsed....
This principle is well-known in the United States and seems to have
been first applied in England in Thomas Hughes v Metropolitan Railway
Co.179
A landlord had given notice to his tenant to repair the premises within
six months, failing which the lease was to be forfeited. A month after
this the landlord entered into negotiations for the sale of the land to the
tenant and, consequently, during the period covered by the negotiations,
the tenant carried out no repairs. The negotiations failed to materialise
and shortly thereafter the period of six months expired and the landlord
claimed the lease to have been forfeited.
But it was held that six months would run from the failure of the negoti-
ations. The conduct of entering into negotiations was an implied promise on
the part of the landlord to suspend the notice and the tenant had acted on it
by not carrying out the repairs.
Another landmark in the development of this principle is the much
debated case of Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House
Ltd 10 where DENNING J asserted "that a promise intended to be binding,
intended to be acted on and in fact acted on, is binding so far as its terms
properly apply" 181
The plaintiffs gave to the defendants a tenancy of a block of flats at
a ground rent of £2500 a year for a period of 10 years. As a result of
the 2nd World War, the flats could not be fully let and, therefore, the
plaintiffs agreed to reduce the rent by half the amount. In 1945, war
conditions ceased to exist, and the flats became fully occupied, but the
defendants continued to pay only the reduced rent. The plaintiffs' action
to recover the full rent as reserved in the original lease from the middle of
1945 was successful, but not for the arrears.
One of the questions was what was the consideration for the agreement to
reduce the rent. Apparently there was none. But in the opinion of DENNING

Performance of existing duties
J there was no necessity of finding consideration in a case like this where the
promise is not set up as cause of action, but only as a defence. The plain-
tiffs having deliberately agreed to forego the rent and the defendants having
acted on that promise up to the time of action, the plaintiffs were estopped
from alleging that here was no consideration for the promise.
Referring to the above principle in his judgment in Combe v Combe,182
DENNING LJ said: "That principle does not create new cause of action where
none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting upon his strict
legal rights, when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them, having
regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties."
In this case a wife obtained a decree nisi against her husband for
divorce. She received a letter from the husband in confirmation of her
own, as exchanged through solicitors, that he would make her £100.
allowance a year. The husband did not make the payments and ultimately
the wife brought an action to enforce the promise.
The Court of Appeal held that neither there was any consideration for
promise nor was there any promissory estoppel against the husband. The
husband never made a request that she should not enforce her normal right
to maintenance, nor was there any undertaking on her part not to do so. Her
abstinence was not the result of any promise of the husband.
Though promissory estoppel may not sustain a new cause of action, it is
not necessarily confined to cases where the parties are bound by a subsisting
contract and one of them promises not to enforce his normal contractual
rights. The decision of the Court of Appeal in Evenden v Guildford City
Assn Football Club Ltd's marks a further extension of the boundaries of
promissory estoppel. Lord DENNING MR stated that the doctrine of estop-
pel applies whenever a representation is made, whether of fact or law, pres-
ent or future, which is intended to be binding, intended to induce a person
to act on it and he does act on it. The facts were that the plaintiff had been
working since 1955 as a groundsman in a supporters' club of a football club.
In 1968 the football club itself acquired his services on the same terms and
for the same work. In 1974 he was made redundant. He claimed redundancy
benefit right from 1955 whereas the club proposed to pay him only from
1968. The principle of promissory estoppel was applied because there was a
representation that his employment would be treated as continuous:
That representation was intended to be binding and intended to be
acted on. He did act on it. He did not claim from the supporters' club
the redundancy payment to which he would otherwise have been entitled
from that club. Six months later his claim against the supporters' club was
barred by lapse of time. It would be most unfair for the football club to

Chapter 3 Consideration
[S. 2(d)]
go back now on that representation. The employment must be treated as
continuous for 19 years.
The House of Lords considered this line of cases in their decision in Tool
Metal Mfg Co Ltd v Tungsten Electric Co Ltd, and applied the principle
of promissory estoppel to the facts of the case. Their Lordships held that
where a party has suspended his normal rights under a contract, he can at
any time by giving reasonable notice to the other resume them; and a coun-
ter-claim based on those rights which was raised in an earlier case was a suf-
ficient notice of the intention to resume the original rights. The Tool Metal
Company was entitled to a fixed rate of compensation depending upon the
quantity of material consumed by the Electric Co. A new agreement being
under preparation, the T.M. Co told the other company that they would not
claim compensation in the meantime. The new agreement was not accepted
by the Electric Co and, therefore, T.M. Co sought to restore its right to
compensation and was allowed to do so for the future. The final shape of
the principle of promissory estoppel as it has resulted from the line of cases
has been stated by Lord HODSON while delivering the opinion of the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council in Emmanuel Ayodeji Ajaji v R.T. Briscoe
(Nigeria) Ltd.385
The principle is that when one party to a contract in the absence of
fresh consideration agrees not to enforce his rights an equity will be
raised in favour of the other party. This equity is, however, subject to the
qualifications: (1) that the other party has altered his position, (2) that the
promisor can resile from his promise on giving reasonable notice, which
need not be a formal notice, giving the promisee reasonable opportunity
of resuming his position, (3) the promise only becomes final and irrevoca-
ble if the promisee cannot resume his position.
A promise to pay more than the sum due under an existing contract may
be equally void. A recent illustration is provided by a Canadian case in
which there was an agreement to supply steel at a stated price for complet-
ing a construction contract. On account of rising steel prices it was orally
agreed between parties that increased price would be charged. Subsequent
deliveries were made and accepted on increased prices, but not paid for.
The contractor was held to be not bound to pay the extra price, the revision
agreement being without any consideration,186
Where the party carrying out works to a vessel was told that he would
be paid an additional amount by way of bonus, if he completed the works
within a certain date, and a certificate was issued by an employee of the ship-
owning company that the works had been satisfactorily completed within
the given time, the shipowner was not allowed to resile from the promise

by saying subsequently that the work was not satisfactory. No objection
was raised about the certificate for a considerable period of time and the
shipowner had also benefited from the timely completion. It would not have
been fair or just to allow the shipowner to deny the promised benefit to the
other party,187
Position under Indian Contract Act different
Luckily in India controversies of this kind are not likely to arise, for the
Contract Act in Section 63 clearly provides that "every promisee may dis-
pense with or remit, wholly or in part, the performance of the promise made
to him, or may extend the time for such performance, or may accept instead
of it any satisfaction which he thinks fit". The section has the following
illustrations:
(b) A owes B 5000 rupees. A pays to B and B accepts, in satisfaction of the whole debt, 2000
rupees paid at the time and place at which the 5000 rupees were payable. The whole
debt is discharged.
(c) A owes B 5000 rupees. C pays to B 1000 rupees, and B accepts them, in satisfaction of his
claim on A. This payment is discharge of the whole claim.
(d) A owes B under a contract, a sum of money, the amount of which has not been ascer-
tained. A, without ascertaining the amount gives to B and B, in satisfaction thereof,
accepts the sum of 2000 rupees. This is discharge of the whole debt whatever may be
its amount.
(e) A owes B 2000 rupees, and is also indebted to other creditors. A makes an arrange-
ment with his creditors, including B to pay them a composition of eight annas in the
rupee upon their respective demands. Payment to B of 1000 rupees is a discharge of B's
demand.
There was a development-agreement between an Improvement Trust and
a land owner. A clause in the agreement provided that the owner is to trans-
fer the plot earmarked for a primary school to the Trust free of cost. It was
held to be not void for being without consideration or being opposed to
public policy. The land owner had under the agreement derived huge benefit
by getting his land freed from acquisition and also getting permission to
develop the land and put it to commercial use. 188
B. Pre-existing contract with third party
Where a person has contracted to do an act, and a third person promises
to pay him a sum of money if he would go ahead with the performance, is
there a consideration for the promise? A situation like this arose in Shadwell
v Shadwell,189
The plaintiff was already engaged to be married to a girl, named Ellen
Nicholl. His uncle, the defendant, sent him the following letter: 'I am glad
to hear of your intended marriage with Ellen Nicholl; and, as I promised

to assist you at starting, I am happy to tell you that I will pay to you £150
yearly during my life, and until your annual income derived from your
profession of a Chancery barrister shall amount to 600 guineas."
The question was what was the consideration for the uncle's promise. The
majority judgment was delivered by ERLE CJ who found sufficient consider-
ation to sustain the promise. According to his Lordship the promise of the
annuity might have been intended as an inducement to the marriage. "The
plaintiff may have made the most material changes in his position... and
have incurred pecuniary liabilities resulting in embarrassments, which could
be in every sense a loss, if the income which had been promised should be
withheld." His lordship also noted that there was some benefit to the prom-
isor as the marriage of a near relative is always an object of interest.
BYLES J dissented. In his opinion the letter disclosed no consideration.
"Marriage of the plaintiff at the testator's express request would be, no
doubt, an ample consideration; but the marriage of the plaintiff without
the testator's request is no consideration to the testator..., for the plaintiff
before the letter had already bound himself to marry, by placing himself not
only under a moral but under a legal obligation, to marry and the testator
knew it."190
To the same effect is the decision in Scotson v Pegg:19 The plaintiffs were
carrying a cargo of coal aboard their ship and had contracted with the char-
terer to deliver it to his order. The charterer ordered the coal to be delivered
to the defendant. The defendant promised to unload the ship at a specified
rate if the shipowner would deliver the coal to him. This the shipowner
agreed to do, but the defendant delayed unloading for a few days putting
the plaintiffs to loss. In an action by the plaintiffs to recover the loss, the
defendant contended that there was no consideration for his promise as the
shipowner was already bound by his contract with the charterer to deliver
the cargo to him. Nevertheless the court held for the plaintiff. WILDE B
observed as follows: I accede to the proposition that if a person contracts
with another to do a certain thing, he cannot make the performance of it
a consideration for a new promise to the same individual. But there is no
authority for the proposition that where there has been a promise to one
person to do a certain thing, it is not possible to make a valid promise to
another to do the same thing. Therefore, deciding this matter on principles it
is plain to my mind that the delivery of the coals to the defendant was a good
consideration for his promise, although the plaintiffs had made a previous
contract to deliver them to the order of other persons.
The principle of these cases has been followed in India by the High Court
of Madhya Pradesh in Firm Gopal Co Ltd v Firm Hazarilal Co:192 The
190. Followed in India in Indermal v Ram Prasad, AIR 1970 MP 40, where a person who had
agreed to execute a sale-deed did so only when a third person promised to give him a prom-
issory note for Rs 30,000 held, that the promise was for consideration.

Performance of existing duties
plaintiff was under a contract to purchase some bales of cotton from a mill,
but refused to fulfil a substantial part of his contract as the prices of cloth
had fallen down. The defendants, who were the sole selling agents of the
mill and who had guaranteed the performance of the contract, requested the
plaintiff to take the whole of the quota of bales fixed for delivery in the first
month and promised that they would buy from the plaintiff a part of such
bales at the contract price or pay him Rs 25,000 at his option. The plain-
tiff complied with their request and elected to take Rs 25,000. The defend-
ants contended that their promise was void for want of consideration as the
plaintiff was already bound to take the cotton. The court reviewed English
authorities and said: "From these decisions it appears that the second agree-
ment brings into existence a new contract between different parties and
therefore a promise to do a thing which the promisee is already bound to do
under a contract with a third party can be good consideration to support a
contract."
Here also the courts have to safeguard a party from being blackmailed
into extra payment.
A vessel was chartered to carry a consignment of tractors to Yemen.
The freight was prepaid by the consignees. The charterers, however,
defaulted in their payment of hire to the shipowners, because there was
congestion at the port of discharge and the ship had proceeded to other
ports. During this period the shipowners negotiated an extra payment by
the consignees for the discharge of cargo. The consignees agreed to pay,
but, after the cargo was discharged, refused to make the payment.
It was held that the promise of extra payment did not create any estoppel
against the consignees. There being no consideration for the promise, it was
not enforceable.193
Consideration and motive
Consideration should be distinguished from motive or a pious desire to
fulfil an obligation. "Motive is not the same thing with consideration." This
well-known phrase occurs in the judgment of PATTERSON J in Thomas v
Thomas: A testator, on the day of his death, had verbally said in front of
witnesses that he was desirous that his wife should enjoy certain premises
for her life. The executors, who were also the assignees, "in consideration
of such desire and of the premises," agreed with the widow to convey the
premises to her provided she would pay to the executors the sum of £1
yearly towards the ground rent and keep the said house in repair. On the
question of consideration for the agreement between the executors and the
widow the court pointed out that the motive for the agreement was, unques-
tionably, respect for the wishes of the testator. But that was no part of the

146 Chapter 3 Consideration
[S. 25]
legal consideration for the agreement. Motive should not be confounded
with consideration. The agreement was, however, held to be binding as the
undertaking to pay the ground rent was a sufficient consideration.195
Absence of consideration
In a case where the promissory note was apparently genuine, neither
forged, nor fabricated, the lender was allowed to recover the loan amount
with interest. The court said that a bare denial of the passing of consider-
ation does not make any defence. Something which is probable has to be
brought on record so that the court may either believe that consideration
did not exist or that its non-existence was so probable that a prudent man
would, under the circumstances of the case, act on the belief that it did not
exist.196
EXCEPTIONS TO CONSIDERATION
Contracts under seal in English Law
In English law a contract under seal is enforceable without consideration.
In the words of Anson: "English law recognises only two kinds of contract,
the contract made by deed that is under seal, which is called a deed or spe-.
ciality, and the simple contract." 197 A contract under seal means a contract
which is in writing and which is "signed, sealed and delivered".
Exceptions under Section 25, Contract Act
Indian law, however, does not recognise any such exception. But
Section 25 of the Contract Act lays down a few exceptions.
S. 25. An agreement made without consideration is void, unless.-
(1) it is in writing and registered.--It is expressed in writing and regis-
tered under the law for the time being in force for registration of [doc-
uments], and is made on account of natural love and affection between
parties standing in a near relation to each other; or unless
(2) or is a promise to compensate for something done.---It is a promise
to compensate, wholly or in part, a person who has already voluntarily
done something for the promisor, or something which the promisor was
legally compellable to do; unless
(3) or is a promise to pay a debt barred by limitation law. It is a prom-
ise, made in writing and signed by the person to be charged therewith,
or by his agent generally or specially authorised in that behalf, to pay
wholly or in part a debt of which the creditor might have enforced pay-
ment but for the law for the limitation of suits.

Exceptions to consideration 147
In any of these cases, such an agreement is a contract.
Explanation 1.-Nothing in this section shall affect the validity, as between
the donor and donee, of any gift actually made.
Explanation 2.-An agreement to which the consent of the promisor is freely
given is not void merely because the consideration is inadequate; but the inade-
quacy of the consideration may be taken into account by the Court in determin-
ing the question whether the consent to the promisor was freely given.
Illustrations
(a) A promises, for no consideration, to give to B Rs 1000. This is a void agreement.
(b) A, for natural love and affection, promises to give his son, B, Rs 1000. A puts his promise
to B into writing and registers it. This is a contract.
(c) A finds B's purse and gives it to him. B promises to give A Rs 50. This is a contract.
(d) A supports B's infant son. B promises to pay A's expenses in so doing. This is a contract.
(e) A owes B Rs 1000, but the debt is barred by the Limitation Act. A signs a written promise
to pay B Rs 500 on account of the debt. This is a contract.
(f) A agrees to sell a horse worth Rs 1000 for Rs 10. A's consent to the agreement was freely
given. The agreement is a contract notwithstanding the inadequacy of the considera-
tion.
(g) A agrees to sell a horse worth Rs 1000 for Rs 10. A denies that his consent to the agree-
ment was freely given.
1. Natural love and affection
The essence of the first exception is that a written and registered agree-
ment based on natural love and affection between near relatives is enforce-
able without consideration.18 Who is a near relative? The Act provides no
guidance, nor has the expression been judicially construed. The expression
will without doubt include parties related by blood or marriage. Again,
what is meant by natural love and affection? There is always some degree of
instinctive love and affection between parties nearly related. But this instinct
may sometimes be overruled by external circumstances. Thus, for example,
in Rajlukhy Dabee v Bhootnath Mookerjee:™"
The defendant promised to pay his wife a fixed sum of money every
month for her separate residence and maintenance. The agreement was
contained in a registered document which mentioned certain quarrels and
disagreements between the two.
The Calcutta High Court refused to regard the agreement as one cov-
ered by the exception. The court could find no trace of love and affection
between the parties whose quarrels had compelled them to separate.200
198. Love and affection has to be the basis of the promise because otherwise emotional expres-
sions and human sentiments cannot take the place of consideration in the material sense of

148 Chapter 3 Consideration
[S. 25]
With this should be contrasted the decision of the Bombay High Court in
Bhiwa v Shivaram:201
A sued B, his brother, for a share in certain lands. But the suit was
dismissed as B solemnly affirmed that the property was not ancestral; B
then agreed by registered writing to give A one-half of the same property.
The present suit was brought to obtain that share.
The plaintiff admitted that he and his brother had long been on bad
terms. But in spite of the strained relations, the court held "that this is just
the case to which Section 25(1) should be held to apply. The defendant had
such natural love and affection for his brother that in order to be reconciled
to him, he was willing to give him his property."202
A family settlement between a man and his wife was made for providing
maintenance to wife. This was held to be enforceable because it was meant
for deriving satisfaction and peace of mind from family harmony. So it could
be interpreted either as a consideration or as love and affection.203 The court
followed the decision of the Supreme Court in Ram Charan Das v Girja
Nandini Devi 204 where it was observed that "the courts give effect to a fam-
ily settlement upon the broad and general ground that its object is to settle
existing or future disputes regarding property among members of a family.
The word 'family' in this context is not to be understood in the narrow sense
of being a group of persons who are recognised in law as having the right
of succession or having a claim to a share in the property in dispute.... The
consideration for such a settlement, if one may put it that way, is the expec-
tation that such a settlement will result in establishing or ensuring amity and
goodwill among persons bearing relationship with one and another. That
consideration having passed by each of the disputants, the settlement con-
sisting of recognition of the right asserted by each other cannot be permitted
to be impeached thereafter." The same view was again reiterated in Maturi
Pullaiah v Maturi Narasimham, 205
favour of the other members who agreed to maintain him in the family. This promise was
held to be void as the plaintiff did not seem to have been moved by love and affection in
renouncing his share.

parents to provide for children. There was also consideration because he purchased his fam-
ily peace by saving the attachment of his sons estate. 6 per cent interest was allowed to the
bank and not 14 per cent. Ranganayakamma v K.S. Prakash, (2005) AIR Kant 2654: 2005

Exceptions to consideration 149
A power of attorney was executed by a sister, relinquishing her right to
share in joint family properties in favour of her brother on token of Re 1 but
out of love and affection for the brother also authorising the brother to enter
into partition agreement on her behalf. The document was in writing and
registered. She was held to be bound by her promise, it being wholly covered
by the exception. 206
2. Past voluntary service
Secondly, a promise to compensate wholly or in part, a person who has
already voluntarily done something for the promisor, is enforceable. In other
words, a promise to pay for a past voluntary service is binding. It is neces-
sary to attract this exception that the service should have been rendered
voluntarily07 and also for the promisor. Thus where services were rendered
for a company not then in existence, a subsequent promise to pay for them
could not be brought within the exception. But a promise made after attain-
ing majority to pay for goods supplied to the promisor during minority has
been held to be within the exception. 208 The court in that case said: "It is
now settled law that a promise by an infant is in law a mere nullity and
void, but we fail to see how an agreement made by a person of full age to
compensate a promisee, who has already voluntarily done something for the
promisor even at a time when the promisor was a minor does not fall within
the purview of Section 25(2) of the Indian Contract Act. As at the time when
the thing was done the minor was unable to contract, the person who did it
for the minor must, in law, be taken to have done it voluntarily. But he has in
fact done something for the minor, and if words mean anything at all, surely
his case must be deemed to come within the scope of the Act."
Earlier the Bombay High Court had held in Sindha Shri Ganpatsinghji v
Abraham209 that "services rendered at the desire of the minor expressed dur-
ing his minority and continued at the same request after his majority form a
good consideration for a subsequent express promise by him in favour of the
person who rendered the services".210
Another situation covered by the exception is where the promisee has
done something for the promisor "which the promisor was legally compel-
lable to do". A subsequent promise to pay for the act is enforceable.

Chapter 3 Consideration
3. Time-barred debt
211
[S. 25]
Lastly, a promise to pay a time-barred debt is enforceable. The promise
should be in writing. It should also be signed by the promisor or "by his
agent generally or specially authorised in that behalf". The promise may
be to pay the whole or any part of the debt. The debt must be such "of which
the creditor might have enforced payment but for the law for the limitation
of suits",
Is it necessary that the promise should be given by the person who was
liable for the original time-barred debt? The Bombay High Court has held.
that "a promise made by a person who is under no obligation to pay the
debts of another... does not fall within the clause."213 But in the opinion of
the Madras High Court "the words 'by the person to be charged therewith'
in Section 25(3) are wide enough to include the case of a person who agrees
to become liable for the payment of a debt due by another and need not be
limited to the person who was indebted from the beginning."214
An admission by the legal heir of a deceased debtor in his deposition in
the court to the effect that he was willing to pay the principal time-barred
amount was held to be a promise to pay making him liable.215
"The promise referred to in Section 25(3) must be an express one and
cannot be held to be sufficient if the intention to pay is unexpressed and has
to be gathered from a number of circumstances. There must be a distinct
promise to pay before the document can be said to fall within the provisions
of the section." Thus a debtor's letter to his creditor "to come and receive"
what was due to him, was held to disclose no express promise. A brief note
by the promisor on the back of the promissory note written at the expiry of
the period of limitation that he had taken the loan and unaccompanied by
any words promising or undertaking to pay, was held to be not sufficient.
to attract Section 25.216 In another case there was a demand by a landlord
for rent including time-barred rent. The tenant replied that the rent may
211. It is different from acknowledgment of liability because that has to be within the period of
limitation, whereas under this exception the matter is ex hypothesi an already time-barred
debt. Hence, the promisee gets new cause of action. Umesh Chandra Chakravarty v Union
Bank of India, (1991) 1 Gau LR 223. A pronote executed for a time-barred debt was held to

be collected by cash or cheque, but mentioned no amount. This was not
regarded by the court as a promise to pay a time-barred debt.217 As against
it, in another case, where an acknowledgment of a debt was coupled with
an agreement to pay interest, it was held to be an agreement with a promise
to pay within the meaning of Section 25(3).218 Similarly, where a tenant in a
letter to the landlord referred to the arrears of time-barred rent and said: "I
shall send by the end of the Vysakh month", it was held that the document
contained the ingredients required by Section 25(3),219 Where, in a reply to
a notice, the authorised advocate stated that on receiving payment from a
third person the account with the plaintiff will be settled, it was held that
this amounted to a promise to pay.220
The Bombay High Court has given a new turn to this exception by hold-
ing that a statement in the balance sheet of a firm signed by a partner show-
ing that the firm was indebted to the plaintiff in respect of the stated sum
became an implied promise to pay.221 In reply to a winding-up petition, the
company admitted its liability and also promised to pay by a letter to the
creditor. The debt being time-barred at the time, the letter revived it.222
A cheque issued for a time-barred debt would still fall within the purview
of Section 138, Negotiable Instruments Act in view of Sections 25(3).223
An acknowledgement of a debt is something different from a promise
of this kind. An acknowledgement has to take place before expiry of the
period of limitation only then the period of limitation becomes extend-
ed. 224 Section 25(3) requires a promise to pay a time-barred debt. It thereby
becomes a new contract. It is not just merely the acknowledgement of an
existing liability, 225

of a cheque for a time-barred debt does not create liability under S. 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, that section requires an enforceable debt or liability.

the whole debt."

The provisions as to consideration do not affect, as between donor and
donee, the validity of any gift which has actually been made. A gift of mova-
bles which has been completed by delivery and gift of immovables which has
been perfected by registration cannot be questioned as to their validity only
on the ground of lack of consideration. They may be questioned otherwise.
Where a gift of property was made by registered deed and attested by two
witnesses, it was not allowed to be questioned by the donor on the ground
that she was the victim of fraud which she was not able to establish.226
Inadequacy of consideration [S. 25 (Expln. II)]

Capacity to Contract
Section 10 of the Contract Act requires that the parties must be compe-
tent to contract. Competence to contract is defined in Section 11:
S. 11. Who are competent to contract.-Every person is competent to
contract who is of the age of majority according to law to which he is subject,
and who is of sound mind, and is not disqualified from contracting by any law
to which he is subject.
Thus, the section declares the following persons to be incompetent to
contract-
(1) minors,
(2) persons of unsound mind, and
(3) persons disqualified by law to which they are subject."
MINOR
Age of majority
The age of majority is generally eighteen, except when a guardian of a
minor's person or property has been appointed by the court, in which case it
is 21.2 The age of majority of a person is to be determined "according to the
law to which he is subject","
In England the age of majority formerly was 21 years. But now under the
Family Law Reform Act, 1969, "a minor is a person under the age of eight-
een years". Formerly a minor was referred to as an "infant", but this Act has
changed the term to "minor".

2. The Indian Majority Act, 1875, S. 3, which reads:
"Every person domiciled in India shall be deemed to have attained his majority when he
shall have completed his age of eighteen years, and not before. In the case, however, of a minor
of whose person or property or both a guardian has been appointed by a court, or of whose
property the superintendence is assumed by a court of wards, before the minor has attained
the age of eighteen years, when he has completed the age of 21 years."
3. The section defines inherent competence to be a party to a contract, and not competence for
being an agent or representative, etc. Dharmeshwar Kalita v Union of India, AIR 1955 Ass

154 Chapter 4 Capacity to Contract
Nature of minor's agreement
[S. 11]
Section 10 requires that the parties to a contract must be competent and
Section 11 declares that a minor is not competent. But neither section makes
it clear whether, if a minor enters into an agreement, it would be voidable
at his option or altogether void. These provisions had, therefore, quite nat-
urally given rise to a controversy about the nature of a minor's agreement.
The controversy was only resolved in 1903 by the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council in their well-known pronouncement in Mohori Bibee v
Dhurniodas Ghose. Sir Lord NORTH observed: "Looking at Section 11.
their Lordships are satisfied that the Act makes it essential that all contract-
ing parties should be competent to contract and expressly provides that a
person who by reason of infancy is incompetent to contract cannot make a
contract within the meaning of the Act. The question whether a contract is
void or voidable presupposes the existence of a contract within the meaning
of the Act, and cannot arise in the case of an infant."
Ever since this decision it has not been doubted that a minor's agreement
is absolutely void. In England also the Infants' Relief Act of 1874 declares
the following categories of a minor's agreement to be "absolutely void".
(1) contract for repayment of money lent or to be lent, or
(2) contract for goods supplied or to be supplied (other than necessary),
and
(3) contract for accounts stated.6
Any other rule would have made the law asymmetrical leaving it to the
whim of a child to pick and choose between agreements made by him which
he will and which he will not enforce. A child may show poor judgment in
making a particular contract, and it is a protection against his own ignorance
and immaturity-not merely fraudulent manipulation by others-that the
law affords. The general presumption that every man is the best judge of his
own interests is suspended in the case of children.
The ruling of the Privy Council in the Mohori Bibee case has been gener-
ally followed by the courts in India and applied both to the advantage and
disadvantage of minors. Another decision of the Privy Council in line is Mir
Sarwarjan v Fakhruddin Mahomed Chowdhury." "A contract to purchase

certain immovable property had been made by a guardian on behalf of a
minor, and the minor sued the other party for a decree of specific perfor-
mance to recover possession. His action was rejected."
The court said that it was not within the competence either of the man-
ager of the minor's estate or of the guardian of the minor, to bind the minor
or the minor's estate by a contract for the purchase of immovable property;
that as the minor was not bound by the contract, there was no mutuality;
and that consequently the minor could not obtain specific performance of
the contract.
In its subsequent pronouncement in Sirkakulam Subramanyam v Kurra
Subba Rao' the Privy Council overruled earlier decisions and entertained no
doubt that it was within the powers of the mother of a minor as guardian
to enter into a contract of sale for the purpose of discharging his father's
debts. Following this decision the Orissa High Court held that endowment
of property for religious purposes by guardians on behalf of minors, being
within their competence, was specifically enforceable. 10 The other High
Courts have also expressed the view that the doctrine of mutuality should
not have been imported into the matter where the contract was within the
competence of the guardian and that there is no scope for this doctrine
under Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963." If the contract is within
the competence of the guardian and it is for the benefit of the minor it is
specifically enforceable.12
In today's society it does not seem to be possible, much less desirable,
for law to adhere to the categorical declaration that a minor's agreement is
always "absolutely void". Minors are appearing in public life today more
frequently than even before. A minor has to travel, to get his dresses tai-
lored, or cleaned, to visit cinema halls and deposit his cycle at a stand. He
has to deal with educational institutions and purchase so many things for
the facility of life and education. If, in any one of these cases, the other
party to the contract could brush aside the minor on the ground that the
engagement is void, the legal protection against contractual liability would
be too dear to minors. The Privy Council had, therefore, to modify its ear-
lier decisions. This trend is evidenced by the decision of their Lordships in
Srikakulam Subrahmanyam v Kurra Subba Rao." In order to pay off the
debts of his father, which were promissory notes owing to the appellants and
a mortgage to another, a minor son and his mother sold a piece of land to

[S. 11]
the appellants in satisfaction of the notes, requiring that the appellants pay
off the mortgage debt. The appellants, accordingly, paid off the mortgagee
and took possession. Afterwards the minor brought an action to recover
back the land. It was found as a fact that the transaction was for the benefit
of the minor and the guardian had the capacity to contract on his behalf.
Lord MORTON said that Section 11 and the Mohori Bibi case leave no doubt
that a minor cannot contract and that if the guardian and the mother had
taken no part in this transaction it would have been void. The contract being
for the benefit of the minor and within the power of the guardian was held
to be binding upon him.
Effects of minor's agreement
A minor's agreement being void, ordinarily it should be wholly devoid of
all effects." If there is no contract, there should, indeed, be no contractual
obligation on either side. Consequently, all the effects of a minor's agree-
ment must be worked out independently of any contract.
1. No estoppel against minor
Suppose that a minor by misrepresenting his age induces another to con-
tract with him, will there be any estoppel against him, or, in other words,
will he be precluded from disclosing his true age in a litigation resulting
from the contract? Even this question had at one time created a controversy.
But it is now settled by a preponderance of authority that there is no such
estoppel against the minor. The infant is not estopped from setting up
the defence of infancy. The reason is very simple. There can be no estoppel
against a statute. The policy of the law of contract is to protect persons
below age from contractual liability and naturally the doctrine of estoppel
cannot be used to defeat that policy. Thus, in a case before the Bombay High
Court, BEAUMONT CJ reviewed the earlier authorities and concluded by
saying: "The court is of opinion that where an infant represents fraudulently
or otherwise that he is of age and thereby induces another to enter into al
contract with him then in an action founded on the contract the infant is not
estopped from setting up infancy."
14. An agreement which confers benefits on a minor is not only not void, but is enforced at his
instance. A minor's consent, being nullity, it cannot change matters, in this case, matters relat-
ing to validity of possession. See Padma Vithoba Chakkayya v Mohd Multani, AIR 1963 SC
70, 74: (1963) 3 SCR 229; minor releasing rights in a property, infructuous, see Wali Singh.v
Sohan Singh, AIR 1954 SC 263; family settlements are binding, but minor's position under it
will depend upon the principle that a minor's agreement is void.
15. See, for example, Jagar Nath Singh v Lalta Prasad, ILR (1908-10) 21 All 21, where the courts
said: "the law of estoppel cannot be invoked in aid to validate that which is void under the

2. No liability in contract or in tort arising out of contract
A minor's agreement is, of course, in principle devoid of all legal effects.
"A minor is in law incapable of giving consent, and, there being no con-
sent, there could be no change in the character" or status of the parties."
In England it was laid down as early as 1665 in Johnson v Pye¹ that "an
infant who obtains a loan of money by falsely representing his age cannot
be made to repay the amount of the loan in the form of damages for deceit".
The court pointed out that if infants were held liable on their contracts by
means of actions in tort, all the infants of England would be ruined. Hence
a minor cannot be held responsible for anything which would be an indirect
way of enforcing his agreement. "You cannot convert a contract into a tort
to enable you to sue an infant."19 This principle has been generally followed
in India. The Calcutta High Court, for example, refused to hold a minor lia-
ble in tort for money lent on a bond.20 The court said: "If the tort is directly
connected with the contract and is the means of effecting it and is a parcel
of the same transaction, the minor is not liable in tort."21
But where the tort is independent of the contract, the mere fact that a con-
tract is also involved, will not absolve the infant from liability. Thus, where
an infant borrowed a mare for riding only, he was held liable when he lent
her to one of his friends who jumped and killed her.22 Similarly, in another
case, an infant was held liable for the tort of detenue for his failure to return
certain instruments which he had hired and then passed on to a friend.23
ATKIN J's (as he then was) judgment in Fawcett v Smethurst24 explains the
earlier cases and also the test for ascertaining whether the tort in question
is independent of the contract. "The principle of law applicable to this case
is that which is referred to in Leslie (R) Ltd v Sheills where KENNEDY LJ
in his judgment cites with approval the following passage from POLLOCK
ON CONTRACTS: 'He (i.e., the infant) cannot be sued for a wrong when
the cause of action in substance is ex contractu, or is so directly connected
with the contract that the action would be an indirect way of enforcing
the contract.... But if an infant's wrongful act, though concerned with the
subject-matter of a contract, and such that but for the contract there would
have been no opportunity of committing it, is nevertheless independent of

the contract in the sense of not being an act of the kind contemplated by it,
then the infant is liable.' In the present case the car was hired for the purpose
of going to Cairn Ryan and back, but was in fact driven further. In my opin-
ion nothing that was done upon that further journey made the defendant
an independent tortfeasor; and, if any damage was done to the car on that
journey, the defendant would only be liable if he were liable under the con-
tract made.... In Burnard v Haggis, the defendant who was a Cambridge
undergraduate and an infant, hired a horse for the purpose of going for a
ride, expressly stating that he did not want a horse for jumping. The defend-
ant let the horse to a friend, who used it for jumping, with the result that
it fell and was injured. The defendant was liable on the ground that the act
resulting in injury to the horse was one which was quite outside the contract,
and could not be said to be an abuse of the contract. In Jennings v Rundall,28
on the other hand, where the defendant, an infant, had hired a horse to be
ridden for a short journey and took it on a much longer journey, with the
result that it was injured, the court held the defendant not liable upon the
ground that the action was founded in contract and that the plaintiff could
not turn what was in substance a claim in contract to one in tort."
3. Doctrine of restitution
If an infant obtains property or goods by misrepresenting his age, he can
be compelled to restore it, but only so long as the same is traceable in his
possession. This is known as the equitable doctrine of restitution. Where the
infant has sold the goods or converted them, he cannot be made to repay
the value of the goods, because that would amount to enforcing a void con-
tract. Again, the doctrine of restitution is not applied where the infant has
obtained cash instead of goods. The well-known authority is Leslie (R) Ltd
v Sheill:30
29
An infant succeeded in deceiving some money-lenders by telling them
a lie about his age, and so got them to lend him £400 on the faith of his
being an adult.
Their attempt to recover the amount of principal and interest as dam-
ages for fraud failed for the reasons explained above. They then claimed
the return of the principal moneys under a quasi-contract as "money had
and received to the plaintiff's use". To this Lord SUMNER replied: "Further,
under the statute the principal, which at common law relieved an infant

29. There has been, however, one case in England, namely, Stocks v Wilson, (1913) 2 KB 235,
where an infant was held liable to account for the value of certain furniture and other articles
which he had resold after obtaining them from the plaintiff by misrepresentation of age. The
decision was criticised a year later by Lord SUMNER in Leslie (R) Ltd v Sheill, (1914) 3 KB 607
(CA), 618, and is not likely to be followed.

from liability for a tort directly connected with a voidable contract, namely,
that it was impossible to enforce in a roundabout way an unenforceable
contract, equally forbids the courts of law to allow, under the name of an
implied contract or in the form of an action quasi ex contractu, a proceed-
ing to enforce part of a contract, which the statute declares to be wholly
void."32
Finally, the money-lenders relied upon the doctrine of restitution, con-
tending that the infant should be compellable in equity to restore the money.
Rejecting this contention, Lord SUMNER said:
"I think that the whole current of decisions down to 1913... went to
show that, when an infant obtained an advantage by falsely stating him-
self to be of full age, equity required him to restore his ill-gotten gains, or
to release the party deceived from obligations or acts in law induced by
the fraud, but scrupulously stopped short of enforcing against him a con-
tractual obligation, entered into while he was an infant, even by means of
a fraud.... Restitution stopped where repayment began.
... the money was paid over in order to be used as the defendant's own
and he has so used it and, I suppose, spent it. There is no question of trac-
ing it, no possibility of restoring the very thing got by the fraud, nothing
but compulsion through a personal judgment to repay an equivalent sum
out of his present and future resources.... I think this would be nothing
but enforcing a void contract."33
Minor seeking relief, compellable to restore
However, where an infant invokes the aid of the court for the cancellation
of his contract, the court may grant the relief subject to the condition that
he shall restore all benefits obtained by him under the contract, or make
suitable compensation to the other party."
This aspect of the doctrine of restitution found expression in Section 41 of
the original Specific Relief Act of 1877. The section authorised the courts
to order any compensation that justice required to be paid by the party at
whose instance a contract was cancelled. The first well-known case decided
under the section is that of Mobori Bibee v Dhurmodas Ghose.3

160 Chapter 4 Capacity to Contract
[S. 11]
The plaintiff, a minor, mortgaged his houses in favour of the defend-
ant, a money lender, to secure a loan of Rs 20,000. A part of this amount
was actually advanced to him. While considering the proposed advance,
the attorney, who was acting for the money lender, received information.
that the plaintiff was still a minor. Subsequently the infant commenced
this action stating that he was underage when he executed the mortgage
and the same should, therefore, be cancelled.
The relief of cancellation had to be granted as the plaintiff was entitled
to it under Section 39 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 [S. 31 of 1963]. The
money lender's only request was that the relief should be made subject to the
condition of the minor repaying to him the sum of Rs 10,500 advanced as
part of the consideration for the mortgage. He first relied upon Section 64 of
the Contract Act. According to this section, a person who, having the right
to do so, rescinds a voidable contract, he shall have to restore to the other
party any benefit received by him under the contract. The Privy Council
held that this section applies only to voidable contracts and cannot apply
to the agreement of a minor, which is absolutely void. Similarly no relief
was allowed under Section 65 of the Act. The essence of this section is that
a party receiving any benefit under a contract shall have to restore it if the
contract becomes void or is discovered to be void. Quite obviously the Privy
Council said "that this section, like Section 64, starts from the basis of
there being an agreement or contract between competent parties, and has no
application to a case in which there never was, and never could have been,
any contract.":
"37
Finally, the money-lender relied upon Section 41 of the Specific Relief
Act, 1877 [S. 33 of 1963], which was as follows: "On adjudging the can-
cellation of an instrument the court may require the party to whom such
relief is granted to make any compensation to the other which justice may
require." As to this their Lordships said: "This section no doubt gave a
discretion to the court; but the court of first instance and subsequently the
Appellate Court, in the exercise of such discretion, came to the conclusion
that under circumstances of this case justice did not require them to order
the return by the respondent of money advanced to him with full knowledge
of his infancy, and their Lordships see no reason for interfering with the
discretion so exercised."
There was alienation of a minor's property by a de facto guardian. The
minor repudiated the sale on attaining majority. The purchaser was fully
aware that the de facto guardian was incompetent to alienate. It was held
that the minor was not liable to restore to the purchaser benefits obtained
by him. Purchaser's remedy was to proceed against the de facto guardian.38

[S. 11]
The second landmark decision in this line of cases on the extent of relief
available against a fraudulent minor was the decision of the Lahore High
Court in Khan Gul v Lakha Singh:
The defendant, while still a minor, by fraudulently concealing his age,
contracted to sell a plot of land to the plaintiff. He received the consid-
eration of Rs 17,500 and then refused to perform his part of the bargain.
The plaintiff prayed for recovery of possession or refund of considera-
tion. There could be no question of specific enforcement, the contract being
wholly void. The only question, therefore, was: "Can a minor who has
entered into a contract by false representation refuse to perform the contract
and at the same time retain the benefit he may have received therefrom?"
Section 41 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, would not help the plaintiff as
Sir SHADILAL CJ admitted that "the language of the section no doubt shows
that the jurisdiction conferred thereby is to be exercised when the minor
himself invokes the aid of the court." Nor would the principle of restitution
as explained by Lord SUMNER in Leslie (R) Ltd v Sheill be of any help
unless it was extended in India to cover cases of money also. The learned
Chief Justice found sufficient reason for this extension as he said: "There is
no real difference between restoring the property and refunding the money,
except that the property can be identified but cash cannot be traced.... It
must be remembered that, while in India all contracts made by infants are
void, there is no such general rule in England. There should therefore be a
greater scope in India than in England for the application of the equitable.
doctrine of restitution."41
Referring to Sections 39 and 41 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 [now
Ss. 31 and 33 of Act 1963], His Lordship said: "The doctrine of restitution is
not however confined to cases covered by those sections. The doctrine rests.
upon the salutary principle that an infant cannot be allowed by a court of
equity to take advantage of his own fraud." Accordingly, the learned Chief
Justice ordered refund of the consideration.42
This opinion was not followed by the Allahabad High Court in another
landmark on the subject, namely, Ajudhia Prasad v Chandan Lal.13
A sum of money was borrowed by two minors under a mortgage deed.
They were more than 18 but less than 21 years of age, but fraudulently
concealed the fact that a guardian had been appointed for them. The
question was whether the lender could get a decree for the principal
money or sale of mortgaged property.
SULAIMAN CJ who delivered the judgment of the Full Bench, refused to
follow the enlarged view of restitution as applied by Sir SHADILAL CJ in

Khan Gul v Lakha Singh." His Lordship felt that the courts in India were
probably bound by the principle of restitution as explained and restricted by
Lord SUMNER in Leslie (R) Ltd v Sheill, as it had already been approved
by the Privy Council. In the opinion of his Lordship, any other "view would
be contrary to the great preponderance of authority both in England and in
India and would ignore the well-recognised distinction between the posi-
tion of a minor when suing as a plaintiff and when he is being sued as a
defendant." The learned Chief Justice added: "Where the property is not
traceable and the only way to grant compensation would be by granting a
money decree against the minor, decreeing the claim would be almost tanta-
mount to enforcing the minor's pecuniary liability under the contract which
is void.... There is no rule of equity, justice and good conscience which
entitles a court to enforce a void contract of a minor against him under the
cloak of restitution."
The Andhra Pradesh High Court had aligned itself with the Allahabad
High Court. After an extensive review of authorities, SUBBA RAO CJ said
that the effect of the authorities is "that a person, who has parted with his
goods can trace them into the hands of the quondam minor and recover
them back in specie, for he has not lost his title to them. But he cannot seek
to recover their price or damages, for, if allowed to do so, the court would
be enforcing the contract of loan".
In the matter of a mortgage in favour of a minor, it has been held by the
Supreme Court that the minority of the mortgagee renders it void ab initio.*
Amended provisions in the Specific Relief Act, 1963
The Law Commission of India preferred the view of Sir SHADILAL CJ
and accordingly the controversy has now been set at rest by the new Specific
Relief Act, 1963. The principle of restitution is contained in Section 33 of
the new Act. The net result of the amendment may be stated in terms of the
following two propositions:
(1) Where a void or voidable contract has been cancelled at the instance
of a party thereto, the court may require him to restore such benefits
as he has received under the contract and to make any compensation
to the other party which justice may require.
(2) Where a defendant successfully resists any suit on the ground that the
contract, by reason of his being incompetent, is void against him, he
may be required to restore the benefits, if any, obtained by him under
the contract, but only to the extent to which he or his estate has bene-
fited thereby.

[S. 11]
Sub-section (1) of the above provision, as noted before, incorporates
the principle that he who seeks equity must do equity. The courts have the
discretion to require the minor-plaintiff to restore the advantages he has
obtained under a void agreement. A good illustration of the circumstances
in which this power is to be exercised is Jagar Nath Singh v Lalta Prasad,"
where BANERJI J of the Allahabad High Court said: "Where persons who
are in fact underage induce others to purchase property from them, they
are liable in equity to make restitution to the purchasers for the benefit they
have obtained before they can recover possession of the property sold."50
But the court will not compel any restitution by a minor even when he is a
plaintiff, where the other party was aware of the infancy so that he was not
deceived, or where the other party has been unscrupulous in his dealings
with the minor, or where, though the minor had misrepresented his age,
the other party was so zealous to enter into the transaction that the false rep-
resentation exerted no influence on him, 53 or where the other party lays no
material before the court for coming to the conclusion that justice requires
return of the money paid to the minor.
Section 33(1) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 does not alter the earlier
law. If the minor comes to the court as a plaintiff, he can be compelled to
disgorge his gains under the agreement. Sub-section (2), however, makes
this difference that if a minor is brought before the court as a defendant, he
can be compelled to account for such portion of the money or anything else
received by him as has gone to benefit him personally, such as education or
training, or has resulted in an accretion to his estate.
Beneficial contracts
The law declared by the Privy Council in the Mohori Bibi case that
a minor's agreement is "absolutely void" has been generally followed, but
it has been growingly "confined to cases where a minor is charged with
obligations and the other contracting party seeks to enforce those obli-
gations against the minor." It was observed by ABDUR RAHIM J of the
Madras High Court that "what is meant by the proposition that an infant

is incompetent to contract or that his contract is void is that the law will
not enforce any contractual obligation of an infant". Accordingly, a minor
is allowed to enforce a contract which is of some benefit to him and under
which he is required to bear no obligation. In Raghava Chariar v Srinivasa,57
the following question was referred for the decision of a Full Bench of the
Madras High Court: "Whether a mortgage executed in favour of a minor
who has advanced the whole of the mortgage money is enforceable by him
or by any other person on his behalf."
The unanimous opinion of the Full Bench was that the transaction was
enforceable by or on behalf of the minor. WALLIS CJ said:
"The provision of law which renders minors incompetent to bind them-
selves by contract was enacted in their favour and for their protection,
and it would be a strange consequence of this legislation if they are to
take nothing under transfers in consideration of which they have parted
with their money."58
The same opinion was expressed by BEAUMONT CJ of the Bombay High
Court: "The provisions of the law which make a contract by a minor not
binding were no doubt intended to be for the benefit of the minors, and the
courts in this country when faced with a contract which has been carried
out by or on behalf of the minor, the performance of which by the other
party is then resisted on the ground of minority, have struggled hard to
avoid holding the contract wholly void to the detriment of the minor."
Accordingly, the learned Chief Justice rejected the defence of an insur-
ance company that the person on whose behalf certain goods were insured
was a minor and allowed the minor to recover the insurance money.60
On the same principle it has been held that "a minor is capable for pur-
chasing immovable property and he may sue to recover the possession of the
property purchased upon tender of the purchase money." A transfer which
has already been executed in favour of a minor can, of course, be much less
impeached.62
57. Ibid.
58. A.T. Raghava Chariar v O.A. Srinivasa Raghava Chariar, (2011) 3 MWN (Civ) 1 (FB), noth-
ing in the Contract Act prevents an infant from being promisee, where consideration passes
from minor, he can enforce the promise of the adult promisor; if the consideration for the
promise is transfer of property by minor, promise would be unenforceable. Minor is wholly
incompetent to transfer property. Minor can seek cancellation of the transfer of property to
him by returning the consideration to the other party.

to allow an insurer to escape responsibility having accepted the proposal with full knowledge
of the plaintiff's minority. Chekha Adinarayana v Oriental Fire & General Insurance Co Ltd,

61. Thakar Das v Pulli, AIR 1924 Lah 611.
62. Ulfat Rai v Gauri Shankar, ILR (1911) 33 All 657, where the court said that "there is nothing
in the Transfer of Property Act which makes a minor incapable of being the transferee of

Page 302
https://t.me/LawCollegeNotes_Stuffs
[S. 11]
"A lease, however, is not like other transfers of property and a lease to a
minor has been held to be void."63 A minor may enforce a promissory note
executed in his favour." "There is nothing in the Contract Act to prevent an
infant from being the promisee." "The law does not regard a minor as inca-
pable of accepting a benefit." A gift of some property under a deed exe-
cuted by the mother in favour of her minor child was held to be binding on
the mother. The fact that the mother had reserved to herself the possession
and enjoyment of the property did not destroy the effectiveness of the gift."
All these cases proceed on the principle that the minor has already given
the full consideration to be supplied by him and there is nothing that remains
to be done by him under the contract. He is now a mere promisee and prays
the court for recovering the benefit stipulated. But where the contract is still
executory or the consideration is still to be supplied, the principle of the
Mohori Bibi case67 will thwart any action on the contract. In Raj Rani v
Prem Adib:68
The plaintiff, a minor, was allotted by the defendant, a film producer,
the role of an actress in a particular film. The agreement was made with
her father. The defendant subsequently allotted that role to another artist
and terminated the contract with the plaintiff's father.
The Bombay High Court held that neither she nor her father could have
sued on the promise. If it was a contract with the plaintiff, she being a
minor, it was nullity. If it was a contract with her father it was void for
being without consideration. The promise of a minor girl to serve, being not
enforceable against her, cannot furnish any consideration for the defend-
ant's promise to pay her a salary."69
Where a minor has given consideration under a contract, but the consider-
ation given to him has failed, he may have restitution. Thus, where a minor
bought a zamindari property on payment of money, but he was ousted on a
suit by a third party, it was held "that the minor was at any rate entitled to
recover from the vendor the sum which he had paid as purchase money".70
For this principle to apply there should be total failure of consideration.
Where, for example, a minor purchased shares in a company and then repu-
diated them and also asked for refund of the partly paid purchase price,
the court held that the price which he has already paid was not refundable,
immovable property. He cannot transfer immovable property, it is true, but that is a different
thing from recovering as transferee".

because there was evidence that the shares were of some value. If the shares
were totally worthless there would have been a total failure of consideration
entitling the minor to refund. But he was not liable to pay further demands
or calls for payment."
"When an infant has paid for something and has consumed or used it, it
is contrary to natural justice that he should recover back the money which
he has paid." This is the principle of the well-known case of Valentini v
Canali:72
The plaintiff, a minor, agreed with the defendant to become a tenant
of his house and to pay £100 for the furniture therein. He paid £68 in
cash and gave a promissory note for the balance. The plaintiff occupied
the premises and used the furniture for some months and then brought an
action for the refund of the consideration paid by him.
The court ordered the cancellation of the promissory note, but refused to
order refund of the sum paid. "The infant plaintiff had the quantity use of
furniture for some months. He could not give back this benefit or replace
the defendant in the position in which he was before the contract.... The
legislature never intended, in making provisions for this purpose (for the
protection of infants), to sanction a cruel justice." "73
Contracts of marriage
A contract for the marriage of a minor is also prima facie for his or
her benefit. "It is customary amongst most of the communities in India for
parents to arrange marriages between their minor children and the law has
to adapt itself to the habits and customs of the people." It has, therefore,
become well-established, almost without any controversy, "that while the
contract of marriage could be enforced against the other contracting party
at the instance of the minor it cannot be enforced against the minor"."
Where the agreement for marriage of a minor involves statutory violation,
e.g. the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the age of the girl has to be 18 years, the
agreement is likely to be avoided. In this case, on the date of engagement the
girl was not of 18 years but on the date fixed for marriage she would have
completed 18 years. The agreement was held to be valid. The other party ran
away from the agreement. The court allowed her compensation of Rs 27,000

spent on engagement ceremony.75
Marriage of Muslim minor girl
Parties were governed by Shariat law. The medical report showed that the
girl had not attained the age of majority. She had, therefore, no right to enter
into the contract of marriage on her own free will. She could have been given
in marriage only by her father or guardian. The Kazi who performed the
ceremony of marriage was in know of things. The marriage was not valid.
She could not have been forced to live with her husband against the mandate
of Quran Sharif. The father was entitled to her custody."
Contracts of apprenticeship
Contracts of apprenticeship is another species of contracts which are for
the benefit of minors. The Indian Apprentices Act, 1850 provides for con-
tracts in the nature of contracts of service which are binding on minors. The
Act was passed, as the preamble of the Act shows: "For better enabling chil-
dren, and specially orphans and poor children brought up by public charity,
to learn trades, crafts and employments, by which, when they come to full
age, they may gain a livelihood."77
The Act requires the contract to be made by a guardian on behalf of the
minor. [S. 9]
"In English law contracts of service and apprenticeship are put on the
same footing and in the same category as contracts for necessaries." The
well-known English case on the subject is Roberts v Gray:78
The defendant, an infant, agreed with the plaintiff, a noted billiards
player, to join him in a billiards-playing tour of the world. The plaintiff
spent time and money in making arrangements for billiards matches, but
the defendant repudiated the contract. The plaintiff succeeded in recover-
ing damages for the breach of the contract.
The contract was held to be one for necessaries as it was for the infant's
"good teaching or instruction whereby he may profit afterwards". The most
important part of the contract was the instruction that would be received

held that betrothal itself was in the nature of a contract. Ma Pwa Kywe v Maung Hmat Gyi,
AIR 1939 Rang 86, a Buddhist girl sought to enforce a promise to marry made to her, when
she was less than 18 years. The court held that she could not enforce such a promise. Here,
the question was not of specific performance of promise to marry. The question was of getting
damages for breach of promise. Khimji Kuveriji Shah v Lalji Karamsi Raghavji, AIR 1941
Bom 129, the court categorically ruled that a guardian can enter into a contract of betrothal
on behalf of minor children and also can sue for breach.

by the defendant from playing constantly with the plaintiff under the con-
ditions of a worldwide tour, a thing which a distinguished billiards player
apparently contemplates as part of his career."
It has been suggested by DESAI J of the Bombay High Court in Raj Rani
v Prem Adib that "though according to English Law the minor would
be liable in the case of a contract of service where the contract was for his
benefit, it is clear that under Section 11, the minor's contract being void, the
minor would not be held liable".
Trade contracts not included in beneficial contracts
This category of beneficial contracts does not include ordinary trade con-
tracts. In Cowern v Nield", for example, a minor was carrying on business
as a hay and straw merchant. He received a cheque from the plaintiff for
the supply of clover and hay. He delivered the clover which was rejected as
bad and failed to deliver hay. The plaintiff's action for recovering back the
amount of the cheque failed. PHILLIMORE J observed: "In a general sense
contracts which can be brought within certain categories and are also for
the benefit of the infant can be supported. A trading contract does not come
within any of these categories. The only contracts of an infant which can
be enforced are which relate to the infant's person, as contracts by which
he provides himself with clothes, food, or lodging or contracts of marriage,
apprenticeship and service."
Option to retire from beneficial contracts on majority
A minor will have the option of retiring from a contract of beneficial
nature on attaining majority provided that he exercises the option within
a reasonable time. Where a minor in pursuance of a marriage settled his
after-acquired property and after attaining majority he received a large sum
of money under the will of his father which came under the settlement, and,
therefore, he attempted to repudiate the settlement, the House of Lords held
that the repudiation coming five years after attaining majority was too late.
Ratification
82
A person cannot on attaining majority ratify an agreement made by him
during his minority. 83 Ratification relates back to the date of the making of
the contract and, therefore, a contract which was then void cannot be made
valid by subsequent ratification. "It would be a contradiction in terms to
say that a void contract can be ratified."85 If it is necessary, a fresh contract

[S. 11]
should be made on attaining majority. And a new contract will also require
a fresh consideration. "The consideration which passed under the earlier
contract cannot be implied into the contract into which the minor enters on
attaining majority.”86 In a case before the Full Bench of the Allahabad High
Court the facts were:87
A minor borrowed a sum of money, executing a simple bond for it, and
after attaining majority executed a second bond in respect of the original
loan plus interest. It was held by a majority of two as against one that the
suit upon the second bond was not maintainable, as that bond was with-
out consideration and did not come under Section 25(2) of the Contract
Act. SULAIMAN CJ said: "Section 25, sub-clause (2), applies when there is
a promise to compensate wholly or in part a person who has already vol-
untarily done something for the promisor. The word 'compensate' has been
used advisedly and does not connote the same idea as a loan. The word 'vol-
untarily' also indicates to my mind that something has been done without
any promise of compensation.... Similarly the expression 'done something
for' does not mean 'advance money to another person'. Doing something for
a person is not paying money to him."88
Where, however, a person, after attaining majority has not only ratified
but also paid the debt incurred by him during minority, he cannot after-
wards recover it back. In the view of the Allahabad High Court such a debt
is only void and not unlawful."
Where, in addition to the consideration already given during minority,
a further advance is made or a fresh consideration given after majority, a
promise to pay the whole of the amount, in the opinion of the Calcutta
and Allahabad" High Courts, becomes binding. "There is no question of
ratification in such cases." A person can always make a fresh promise after
attaining majority in terms of the promise made during minority. All that is
necessary is that there should be some fresh consideration for it.93
Some wind of change is reflected by the following decision. The defend-
ant was minor at the time when he executed a deed about his interest in the
estate. The suit was filed at a time when he had attained majority. He did
not repudiate the agreement on attaining majority. He rather admitted it.
The contract became enforceable to the extent of the minor's interest in the
estate.94

170 Chapter 4 Capacity to Contract
Liability for necessaries [S. 68]
[S. 68]
Section 68 of the Contract Act provides for the liability for necessaries
supplied to persons incompetent to contract.
S. 68. Claim for necessaries supplied to person incapable of contract-
ing, or on his account.-If a person incapable of entering into a contract, or
anyone whom he is legally bound to support, is supplied by another person
with necessaries suited to his condition in life, the person who has furnished
such supplies is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of such incapable
person.
Illustrations
(a) A supplies B, a lunatic, with necessaries suitable to his life. A is entitled to be reimbursed
from B's property.
(b) A supplies the wife and children of B, a lunatic, with necessaries suitable to their condi-
tion in life. A is entitled to be reimbursed from B's property.
Meaning of "necessaries"
The liability is only for necessaries, but there is no definition of the term
"necessaries" in the Act. We may consequently turn to judicial decisions
to determine its precise import. An illustrative statement of the meaning
of the term is to be found in the judgment of ALDERSON B in Chapple v
Cooper:"
"Things necessary are those without which an individual cannot rea-
sonably exist. In the first place, food, raiment, lodging and the like. About
these there is no doubt. Again, as the proper cultivation of the mind is as
expedient as the support of the body, instruction in art or trade, or intel-
lectual, moral and religious education may be necessary also.... Then the
classes being established, the subject and extent of the contract may vary
according to the state and condition of the infant himself. His clothes may
be fine or coarse according to his rank; his education may vary according
to the station he is to fill; and the medicines will depend on the illness
with which he is afflicted, and the extent of his probable means when of
full age.... But in all these cases it must first be made out that the class
itself is one in which the things furnished are essential to the existence
and of reasonable advantage and comfort of the infant contractor. Thus
articles of mere luxury are always excluded, though luxurious articles of
utility are in some cases allowed."
Thus, "what is necessary" is a relative fact to be determined with ref-
erence to the fortune and circumstances of the particular minor; articles,
therefore, that to one person might be mere conveniences or matters of taste
may, in the case of another, be considered necessaries, where the usage of
society renders them proper for a person in the rank of life in which the

[S. 68]
infant moves. The infant's need of things may also sometimes depend upon
the peculiar circumstances under which they are purchased and the uses to
which they are put." For instance, articles purchased by an infant for his
wedding may be deemed necessary, while under ordinary circumstances the
same articles may not be so considered. "... Wedding presents for the bride
of the infant may be necessaries."98 But where such marriage is forbidden by
law, the position will be different. Where "the funds are supplied to a minor
for the marriage of a minor female in the family the lender may be able to get
himself reimbursed from the property of the minor.""" "The debt incurred
for performing the funeral obsequies of the father of a minor" is a neces-
sary, 100 Where a minor is involved in a litigation threatening his property
or liberty,102 expenses reasonably incurred on his defence may be recovered
from his estate.
"In Peters v Fleming the court took judicial notice that it was prima
facie not unreasonable that an undergraduate at a college should have a
watch and consequently a watch chain; and that therefore it was a question
of fact whether the watch chain supplied on credit was such as was neces
sary to support himself properly in his degree. PARKE B says: 'All such arti-
cles as are purely ornamental are to be rejected, as they cannot be requisite
for anyone.' Possibly there may be exceptional cases in which things purely
ornamental may be necessary,"104 The burden lies upon the supplier to prove
that the ornamental thing is specially necessary for the minor. Thus, where
a minor was supplied a pair of jewelled solitaires and an antique goblet and
though he moved in high society, he was held not liable as the plaintiff could
not prove that the articles were specially necessary for the minor.105
To render an infant's estate liable for necessaries "two conditions must
be satisfied, namely: (1) the contract must be for goods reasonably necessary
for his support in his station in life, and (2) he must not have already a suf-
ficient supply of these necessaries".106 The 'supplier has to prove, "not only
that the goods supplied were suitable to the condition in life of the infant,
but that he was not sufficiently supplied with the goods of that class". This is
the principle of Nash v Inman107 where an undergraduate in the Cambridge

position, was supplied by the plaintiff with a number of dresses, including
eleven fancy waistcoats, the price was held to be irrecoverable.
Nature of liability
There are two theories relating to the liability of a minor's estate for nec-
essaries. According to one of the theories the liability does not depend upon
the minor's consent. It arises because the necessaries have been supplied to
him and is, therefore, quasi-contractual in nature. The best statement of this
theory is that of FLETCHER MOULTON LJ in Nash v Inman, 108
"An infant, like a lunatic, is incapable of making a contract of purchase
in strict sense of the word; but if a man satisfies the needs of the infant or
lunatic by supplying to him necessaries the law will imply an obligation
to repay him for the services so rendered, and will enforce that obligation
against the estate of the infant or lunatic. The consequence is that basis of
the action is hardly contract. The real foundation is an obligation which
the law imposes on the infant to make a fair payment in respect of needs
satisfied. In other words, the obligation arises re and not consensu."
In India the subject has been dealt with in the chapter on "Certain
Relations Resembling Those Created by Contract". The chapter provides
for obligations of quasi-contractual nature. Further, the liability is not per-
sonal, but is only that of the minor's estate. Thus it has a very little contrac-
tual element.
The other view of the liability in England is that it is contractual. An.
infant is not absolutely destitute of contractual capacity. A contract for nec-
essaries is just one of those categories of contracts which an infant is per-
mitted to make.109
English Law
PERSONS OF UNSOUND MIND
In English law a person of unsound mind is competent to contract,
although he may avoid his contract if he satisfies the court that he was inca-
pable of understanding the contract and the other party knew it. The con-
tract is voidable at his option. It becomes binding on him only if he affirms
it.110 In this case Lord ESHER said that a lunatic (now such a person is known
as mentally disordered) can only set aside a contract entered into with a per-
son of sound mind in the following circumstances:
"When a person enters into a contract and afterwards alleges that he
was so insane at the time that he did not know what he was doing, and
proves the allegation, the contract is as binding on him in every respect,

whether it is executory or executed, as if he had been sane when he made
it, unless he can prove further that the person with whom he contracted
knew him to be so insane as not to be capable of understanding what it
was about."
The position of a drunken person is also the same. If he makes a contract
while drunk, he may, when sober, elect to avoid the contract or to affirm it.111
As regards the general effect of mental incapacity on the contractual com-
petence of a person, HALSBURY'S LAWS OF ENGLAND states the following:"12
"There must be a free and full consent to bind persons in contract. Consent
is an act of reason and of volition or choice, and it is on the ground that there
is a want of rational and deliberate consent that the contracts of mentally
disordered persons may be invalidated. A valid contract cannot be made by
a person suffering from such incapacity of mind as not to understand the
nature of what he is doing....
A fair contract with a person who was apparently of sound mind, but
who in fact was suffering at the time of the contract from such mental disor
der as rendered him incapable of entering into the contract, is voidable but
not void. If the contract is not to be enforced against him, the person men-
tally disordered must prove that the other party either knew that he was of
unsound mind or knew of such facts as would justify the Court in inferring
such knowledge."113
In Campbell v Hooper, where a mortgagee sought a decree directing
repayment and foreclosure in default of such repayment and where there was
evidence that at the time the mortgage was executed the mortgagor was a
lunatic, STUART VC said:
"I do not understand that the simple fact of lunacy, if established,
would deprive the mortgagee of all rights to equitable relief. I am not
aware of any case in which it has been so held....
Even at law the contract of a lunatic is not necessarily void. Even at law
the plaintiff in an action at law, seeking to recover under the contract of a
person whose lunacy is established, has been held to be entitled to relief......
Mr Justice PATTESON, in Dane v Viscountess Kirkwalls in directing
the jury laid down the law thus: 'It is not sufficient that Lady Kirkwall
was of unsound mind, but you must be satisfied that the plaintiff knew it,
and took advantage of it.' It would be a strange thing if a Court of Equity
in dealing with contracts were to deal on any different principle."

New Zealand. In the Maha P Ltd case the mortgage executed by a person who was mentally
unsound was enforced because it was not proved that the mortgagee bank had knowledge of
his mental disorder.

174 Chapter 4 Capacity to Contract
Position in India
[S. 12]
In India, on the other hand, the agreement of a person of unsound mind
is, like that of minor, absolutely void.116 According to Section 12 "a person
is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract if, at the
time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a
rational judgment as to its effects upon his interest."117 However, a person
who is usually of unsound mind may make a contract when he is of sound
mind. But a person who is usually of sound mind may not make a contract
when he is of unsound mind.
S. 12. What is a sound mind for the purposes of contracting.-A person
is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract if, at the time
when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational
judgment as to its effect upon his interests.
A person who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind,
may make a contract when he is of sound mind.
A person who is usually of sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind,
may not make a contract when he is of unsound mind.
Illustrations
(a) A patient in a lunatic asylum, who is at intervals of sound mind, may contract during
those intervals.
(b) A sane man, who is delirious from fever, or who is so drunk that he cannot understand
the terms of a contract, or form a rational judgment as to its effect on his interests, can-
not contract whilst such delirium or drunkenness lasts.
Disability at the time of agreement
For the purpose of declaring an agreement to be void what is relevant is
that the person in question was suffering from the disability on the date of
execution of the agreement, the report of medical unfitness of the year 1989
being much later in point of time was held to have no bearing on the agree-
ments entered into in the years 1985 and 1987 respectively.118
An illustration is the decision of the Patna High Court in Inder Singh v
Parmeshwardhari Singh.119 A property worth about Rs 25,000 was agreed

not mentally sound at the time of sale. The purchaser adduced no evidence that the vendor
was of sound mind. Kimtu v Lachhi Devi, 1999 AIHC 2533 (HP), selling the property of an
insane by wife whose power of attorney was not valid, the purchaser also did not take care

to be sold by a person for Rs 7000 only. His mother proved that he was
a congenital idiot, incapable of understanding the transaction and that he
mostly wandered about. Holding the sale to be void, SINHA J explained the
effect of Section 12 in the following passage: "According to this section,
therefore, the person entering into the contract must be a person who under-
stands what he is doing and is able to form a rational judgment as to whether
what he is about to do is to his interest or not. The crucial point, therefore, is
to find out whether he is entering into the contract after he has understood it
and has decided to enter into that contract after forming a rational judgment
in regard to his interest.... It does not necessarily mean that a man must be
suffering from lunacy to disable him from entering into a contract. A person
may to all appearances behave in a normal fashion, but, at the same time, he
may be incapable of forming a judgment of his own, as to whether the act he
is about to do is to his interest or not. In the present case (he) was incapable
of exercising his own judgment."
Illustration (b) appended to Section 12 shows that a drunken person is
in the same category as a person of unsound mind. A sale deed of property
was executed at a time when the transferor was suffering from alcoholic
psychosis which was proved by medical certificate. A very valuable land was
sold for a paltry amount. The sale deed was ordered by the Supreme Court
to be set aside. The court said that unsoundness of mind is a finding of fact.
There could be no interference in second appeal.120
A marriage between a Hindu girl and Muslim man was declared to be no
marriage at all when the evidence showed that the girl was under intoxica-
tion at the material time and was not conscious of ongoing conversion and
nikah ceremony. She also proved that she had not lived with the man even
for a single day. Registration of the marriage under the Hindu Marriage
Act, 1955 was also illegal. The Family Court was held to be competent to
declare the status of the parties and declare the marriage to be void.121

Free Consent
DEFINITION OF FREE CONSENT [S. 14]
According to Section 10 free consent is an essential requirement of a con-
tract. Section 14 defines "free consent".
S. 14. "Free consent" defined.-Consent is said to be free when it is not
caused by:
(1) coercion, as defined in Section 15, or
(2) undue influence, as defined in Section 16, or
(3) fraud, as defined in Section 17, or
(4) misrepresentation, as defined in Section 18, or
(5) mistake, subject to the provisions of Sections 20, 21 and 22.
Consent is said to be so caused when it would not have been given but for
the existence of such coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or
mistake.
Vitiating factors and their effect
Where consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, undue influence,
fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the
option of the party whose consent was so caused." If, for example, a per-
son is induced to sign an agreement by fraud, he may, on discovering the
truth, either uphold the contract or reject it. If he confirms it, the contract
becomes binding on both the parties. It is a contract which is enforceable at
the option of only one of the parties, namely, the party whose consent was
not free. Giving the meaning of a voidable contract, Section 2(i) says that
"an agreement which is enforceable by law at the option of one or more of
the parties thereto, but not at the option of the other or others, is a voidable
contract.²
1. Ss. 19 and 19-A. For an example of compulsory consent under a statute see Mangaldas
Raghavji Ruparel v State of Maharashtra, AIR 1966 SC 128: (1965) 2 SCR 894, 906. Krishna
Prasad v Shyam Narayan Prasad, AIR 2006 Sikk 25, in a deed of exchange, the stand taken
by one of the executants was that only the business was included and not RCC building. Oral
evidence also supported such a stand. The court said that RCC building could not be said to
have been included on the basis of the recital in the deed alone.
2. See Nokhia v State of H.P., AIR 1985 HP 88, where it was observed that consent to an
acquisition cannot be described as a real consent. In the absence of these vitiating factors
the contract binds and no one can get rid of it by unilateral action. Thus a site allotted and

Where consent is caused by mistake, the agreement is void. [Ss. 20-22]
A void agreement is not enforceable at the option of either party. [S. 2(g)]
Definition [S. 15]
COERCION
An agreement the consent to which is caused by coercion is voidable at
the option of the party whose consent was so caused. "Coercion" is defined
in Section 15.
S. 15. "Coercion" defined.-"Coercion" is the committing, or threatening
to commit, any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860), or the
unlawful detaining, or threatening to detain, any property, to the prejudice of
any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an
agreement.
Explanation.-It is immaterial whether the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860), is
or is not in force in the place where the coercion is employed.
Illustrations
A, on board an English ship on the high seas, causes B to enter into an agreement by an
act amounting to criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860).
A afterwards sues B for breach of contract at Calcutta.
A has employed coercion, although his act is not an offence by the law of England, and
although Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860), was not in force at the time
when or place where the act was done.
Techniques of causing coercion
Consent is said to be caused by coercion when it is obtained by pressure
exerted by either of the following techniques:
(1) committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the Indian
Penal Code; or
(2) unlawfully detaining or threatening to detain any property.
Acts forbidden by IPC
It is clear that coercion as thus defined implies a committing or threat-
ening to commit some act which is contrary to law. The section has given
rise to few decisions. The Privy Council observed in Askari Mirza v Bibi

of that fact available. Hasina Bano v Alam Noor, AIR 2007 Raj 49. The right of mehar can

[S. 15]
Jai Kishori³ that "cases brought under this particular branch of Section 15
of the Contract Act must be of rare occurrence". A clear illustration would
be consent obtained at the point of pistol, or by threatening to cause hurt,
or by intimidation or by threatening to burn a man's house or slashing his
valuable picture. An intriguing question in this connection was before the
Madras High Court in Chikham Amiraju v Chikham Seshamma:
By threat of suicide, a Hindu induced his wife and son to execute a
release in favour of his brother in respect of certain properties which they
claimed as their own.
It was held by a majority "that the threat of suicide amounted to coercion
within Section 15 and the release deed was, therefore, voidable". The differ-
ence of opinion related to whether suicide is an act forbidden by the Indian
Penal Code. An attempt to commit suicide is punishable under the Code,
but there is no punishment provided for suicide. The majority consisting
of WALLIS CJ and SESHAGIRI J believed that the man who commits suicide
goes unpunished, not because the act is not forbidden, but because there is
nobody left to be punished. OLDFIELD J dissented on the ground that unless
an act is made punishable it cannot be said to be forbidden.
"When a criminal prosecution is instituted against a person and such per-
son fearing the result of the prosecution enters into an agreement in favour
of the complainant in consideration of his abandoning the prosecution, it
cannot be held simply upon these facts that the consent of such person was
caused by coercion." "To threaten a criminal prosecution is not per se an
act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code. Such an act could only be one
forbidden by the Indian Penal Code if it amounted to a threat to file a false
charge." This was pointed out by the Privy Council in Askari Mirza v Bibi
Jai Kishori:?
A minor, having borrowed on two mortgage deeds, agreed to a compro-
mise decree although the mortgages were void. Subsequently he pleaded
that he entered into the compromise because he was threatened with pros-
ecution for falsely misrepresenting his age and that this amounted to coer-
cion. Their Lordships observed: "The law as contained in Section 15 is
much wider than anything to be found in the English authorities and in
India it is not correct to say that a contract is vitiated merely by proof of
a threat to bring a criminal charge. Of course, if the charge of cheating

was a true one, there is an end to the plaintiff's case, for a threat to bring
such a charge would not be an act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code."
As the court below recorded no finding as to the truth or falsity of the
charge, the case was referred back for re-trial.
The plea was that the plaintiff was dispossessed of promises forcibly
under threat that he would be arrested and detained under the Maintenance
of Internal Security Act. The court said that such threats would fall within
the mischief of Section 15.9
Detention of property
An illustration of detention of property is provided by an early case. The
plaintiff had pledged his plate with the defendant for £20. When he went
to redeem it the pledgee insisted that an additional £10 interest was also
owed. The plaintiff paid this to redeem his plate and then súed to recover it
back. The court allowed it. He was in immediate need of his article and the
defendant extracted from him an extra amount by refusing to deliver it.10
Refusal by a Government department to release the payment of a contractor
unless he gave up his claim for extra rates amounted to coercion under the
category of detention of property." A company entered into a contract with
a Government company (GAIL), for purchase of gas. The buyer company
constructed the pipeline for carriage of gas and was also responsible for
its maintenance. Even then GAIL demanded from the company transpor-
tation charges. The demand was also found to be against the price struc-
ture fixed by the Government. It was held that GAIL was acting dehors
the Government pricing order and, being an agency of the Government, it
should not have done so. It should not have acted in a commercial and arbi-
trary manner. GAIL had incurred no cost in transportation.12

Court:13

imprisonment of the contracting party or his wife, parent or child, by the
other party or by anyone acting with his knowledge and for his advan-
tage. But coercion as defined in Section 15 is much wider and includes the
unlawful detention of property also. Further, coercion may be committed
by any person, not necessarily a party to the contract. Again, it need not
be directed against the contracting party, or his parent, wife or child.
It may be directed against any person, even if he is a stranger. While in
English Law, duress must be such as will cause immediate violence and
also unnerve a person of ordinary firmness of mind, these requisites are
not necessary in Indian Law."
Definition [S. 16]
UNDUE INFLUENCE
S. 16. "Undue influence" defined.-(1) A contract is said to be induced by
"undue influence" where the relations subsisting between the parties are such
that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses
that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other.
(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing prin-
ciple, a person is deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of another-
(a) where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other or where he
stands in a fiduciary relation to the other; or
(b) where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is tem-
porarily or permanently affected by reason of age, illness, or mental or
bodily distress.
(3) Where a person who is in a position to dominate the will of another, enters
into a contract with him, and the transaction appears, on the face of it or on evi-
dence adduced, to be unconscionable, the burden of proving that such contract
was not induced by undue influence shall lie upon the person in a position to
dominate the will of the other.
Nothing in this sub-section shall affect the provision of Section 111 of the
Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872).
Illustrations
(a) A, having advanced money to his son, B, during his minority, upon B's coming of age
obtains, by misuse of parental influence, a bond from B for a greater amount than the
sum due in respect of the advance. A employs undue influence.
(b) A, a man enfeebled by disease or age, is induced, by B's influence over him as his med-
ical attendant, to agree to pay B an unreasonable sum for his professional services. B
employs undue influence.
(c) A, being in debt to B, the moneylender of his village, contracts a fresh loan on terms
which appear to be unconscionable. It lies on B to prove that the contract was not
induced by undue influence.
(d) A applies to a banker for a loan at a time when there is stringency in the money market.
The banker declines to make the loan except at an unusually high rate of interest. A
accepts the loan on these terms. This is a transaction in the ordinary course of business,
and the contract is not induced by undue influence.

Ability to dominate will of other
Undue influence 181
Sometimes the parties to an agreement are so related to each other that
one of them is able to dominate the will of the other. The person who occu-
pies the superior position may prevail upon the other to obtain his consent
to an agreement to which he, but for the influence so exerted, would not
have consented. The relationship between the parties so as to enable one of
them to dominate the will of the other is a sina qua non for undue influence
to come into play." A spiritual adviser (guru), for example, in a case before
the Allahabad High Court,15 induced the plaintiff, his devotee, to gift to him
the whole of his property to secure benefits to his soul in the next world.
Such a consent is said to be obtained by undue influence. "Would any rea-
sonable man," the court said, "in full possession of his senses and not under
unusual influence of some kind or the other do such a thing?"
Consent under pressure
In a mediclaim insurance policy, the insured was forced and pressurised
to consent to exclusion of cover for cardiac ailments. It was held that the
consent being not lawful, it had no binding effect."6
Subtle species of fraud
"Undue influence is said to be a subtle species of fraud whereby mastery is
obtained over the mind of the victim, by insidious approaches and seductive
artifices. Sometimes the result is brought about by fear, coercion, importu-
nity or other domination, calculated to prevent expression of the victim's
true mind. It is a constraint undermining free agency, overcoming the pow-
ers of resistance, bringing about a submission of the other."17 The following
statement bears out the distinction between coercion and undue influence:
"The law draws a distinction between duress and undue influence.
Duress (coercion) in the execution of a contract or deed occurs when
there is a physical compulsion of the person, which must be very rare, or
when there is a threat to the person's life or limb, or threat of a physical
beating or of imprisonment. It may also take into account threats of a
wrongful imprisonment or prosecution of the person and possibly of the
person's near relative.
In contrast to duress, undue influence may exist without violence or
threats of violence against the victim. It depends upon the existence of a
relationship between two parties which, while it continues, causes one to
place a confidence in the other which produces a natural influence over
the one which that other abuses to his own advantage."18

182 Chapter 5 Free Consent
Relations which involve domination
[S. 16]
When can it be said that one party is able to dominate the will of the
other? The answer is, in all cases where there is active trust and confidence
between the parties or the parties are not on equal footing." The principle
applies to every case where influence is acquired and abused, where confi-
dence is reposed and betrayed. It applies "to all variety of relation in which
domination may be exercised by one person over another."20 "The rela-
tionships which may develop a dominating influence of one over another
are infinitely various. There is no precisely defined law setting limits to the
equitable jurisdiction of a court to relieve against undue influence. This is a
world doctrine, not of neat and tidy rules. The courts of equity have devel-
oped a body of learning enabling relief to be granted where the law has to
treat the transaction as unimpeachable unless it can be held to have been
procured by undue influence. It is the unimpeachability at law of a disad-
vantageous transaction which is the starting-point from which the court
advances to consider whether the transaction is the product merely of one's
own folly or of the undue influence exercised by another. A court in the
exercise of this equitable jurisdiction is a court of conscience. Definition is a
poor instrument when used to determine whether a transaction is or is not
unconscionable: this is a question which depends upon the particular facts
of the case. For example, in Williams v Bayley:22
A son forged his father's signature on several promissory notes and
paid them into his banking account. When the truth came to light, the
manager of the bank threatened prosecution of the son and "transporta-
tion" if a satisfactory solution were not found. To avert this threat, the
father agreed to give an equitable mortgage to the bank on his property
in return for the promissory notes. Subsequently the father sought to have
this agreement cancelled on the ground that he was influenced by the
threat.
The House of Lords held the agreement to be voidable. Lord CHELMSFORD
expressed the opinion that the negotiation proceeded upon an understanding
that the agreement to give security for the promissory notes would relieve
the son from the consequences of his criminal act; and the fears of the father
were stimulated and operated on to an extent to deprive him of free agency,
and to extort an agreement from him for the benefit of the bankers. There

tion to influence the will of voter, nor in that process they are making any agreement. Any

Undue influence 183
was inequality between the parties and one of them took unfair advantage
of the situation of the other and used undue influence to force an agreement
from him.
In particular, however, and without prejudice to the generality of the
principle, the Act lays down, in sub-section (2) of Section 16 that a person is
deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of another in the following
cases-
(a) where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other, or where he
stands in fiduciary relation to the other; or
(b) where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is
temporarily or permanently affected by reason of age, illness, or men-
tal or bodily distress.
Real or apparent authority
A person in authority is definitely able to dominate the will of the person
over whom the authority is held. The authority may be real or apparent.
Persons in authority would include an Income Tax Officer in relation to an
assessee; a magistrate or police officer in relation to an accused person and
the like. The expression "apparent authority" would include cases in which
a person has no real authority, but is able to approach the other with a show
or colour of authority.
Fiduciary relation
Fiduciary relations are of several kinds. Indeed every relationship of trust
and confidence is a fiduciary relation. 23 And confidence is at the base of innu-
merable transactions of mankind. This category is, therefore, a very wide
one. It includes the relationship of solicitor and client, trustee and cestui
que trust,25 spiritual adviser and his devotee,26 doctor and patient,27 woman
and her confidential managing agent,28 parent or guardian and child," and

subsequently sought rescission on the ground that the property was considerably overvalued.
The Court of Appeal held that when undue influence is alleged against a solicitor he has to
prove that he disclosed all the material facts and that the transaction was of advantage to the
client.

creditor and debtor.30 The relationship of trust and confidence presents a
very good opportunity to the person in whom confidence is held to exploit it
to his own use. A contract between persons so related is, therefore, voidable
if the consent was obtained by abusing the confidence. The duty of the per-
son in whom confidence is reposed was explained by the Court of Appeal in
Moody v Cox." A solicitor sold certain property to one of his clients. The
client subsequently alleged that the property was considerably overvalued.
SCRUTTON LJ proceeded as follows: "Generally when you have made a legal
contract and correctly expressed it in writing, and it has not been obtained
by any misstatement of facts, innocent or fraudulent, the contract stands,
and the fact that one party or the other knows facts about which he says
nothing, which made the contract unprofitable one to the other party, is of
no legal consequence. But there are certain relations and certain contracts
in which a higher duty is imposed upon the parties and they must not only
tell the truth, but they must tell the whole truth so far as it is material, and
they must not only not misrepresent by words, they must not misrepresent
by silence if they know of something that is material. Some of those cases
depend on the relationship between the parties, and, generally speaking, are
cases where the relation is such that there is confidence reposed by one party
and influence exercised by the other. In that class of relation of parties you
may get the duty, first of all, that the party who has influence must make
a full disclosure of everything that he knows material to the contract, and,
secondly, that the party who has the influence must not make a contract
with the party over whom he has influence unless he can satisfy the court
that the contract is an advantageous one to the other party."
Mental distress
The last category of persons whose will is vulnerable to all sorts of influ-
ences is that of "persons in mental distress". A person is said to be in distress
when his mental capacity is temporarily or permanently affected. It may be
due to extreme old age or mental or bodily illness or any other cause. Such
a person is easily persuaded to give consent to a contract which may be
unfavourable to him. Accordingly, if a contract is made with him by taking
advantage of his distress, it is voidable on the ground of undue influence. In
a case, for example, before the Madras High Court, a poor Hindu widow,
who was in great need of money to establish her right to maintenance, was
persuaded by a moneylender to agree to pay 100 per cent rate of interest. 32
This is a clear instance of undue influence being exerted upon a person in
distress, and the court reduced the interest to 24 per cent.
was exerted on the father's mind was upon her. The presumption could not be dethroned and
therefore the settlement was liable to be set aside.

Urgent need of money, no distress
Undue influence 185
But mere urgent need of money on the part of the borrower is not, of
itself, a sufficient evidence of mental distress. Thus, where a person was
facing criminal prosecution at the instance of his father and borrowed on
exorbitant terms a sum of money to defend himself, it was held that he
was not in such mental distress as would enable a moneylender to dominate
his will. 33 Similarly, where a person, fearing the result of the prosecution
pending against him, enters into an agreement in favour of the complainant
in consideration of his abandoning the prosecution, it cannot be held sim-
ply upon these facts that the consent of such person was caused by undue
influence.34
Statutory compulsion, no distress
A contract made under statutory compulsion cannot be regarded as one
made under undue influence. In a case before the Supreme Court, a cane
grower had the freedom to offer canes to the factory of his area or not but if
he made an offer, the factory was bound under an Act to accept. The court
pointed out that in such a case the consent, though compulsory, is not caused
by undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake. The compulsion of
law is not coercion. "As a result of economic compulsions and changes in the
political outlook, the freedom of contract is now being confined gradually to
narrower and narrower limits. Here is a case where one party to contract of
sale is compelled to enter into it on rigidly prescribed terms and conditions
and has no freedom of bargaining. But, in the eyes of the law, the agree-
ment is freely made."35 Where the parties voluntarily executed a power pur-
chase agreement pursuant to an order passed by the Electricity Regulatory
Commission, avoidance of the agreement on the ground of duress, coercion
or undue influence was held to be not sustainable.36
Burden of proof
In an action to avoid a contract on the ground of undue influence the
plaintiff has to prove two main points. He must show, in the first place, that
the other party was in a position to dominate his will, and, secondly, that he
actually used his influence to obtain the plaintiff's consent to the contract:
The law says that: (1) not only must the defendant have a dominant position,
but (2) he must use it. 37 It is not enough, for a person to avoid the contract,

to show that the other party is his father who could have influenced him. He
must go further and show that his father actually did influence him.38
Presumption of undue influence
But in certain cases presumption of undue influence is raised. The effect
of the presumption is that once it is shown that the defendant was in a posi-
tion to dominate the will of the plaintiff it will be presumed that he must
have used his position to obtain an unfair advantage. It will be then for
the defendant to show that the plaintiff freely consented. For example, in
Lancashire Loans v Black:40
The defendant was a married girl of full age. She gave a security for
the loan which her mother took from a company. The only advice she had
was from the solicitor of the company.
SCRUTTON LJ held that "in the case of the benefit of contractual advan-
tage obtained from a person coming within certain defined relations, such as
the relation of parent and young child, solicitor and client, religious superior
that signatures were taken on blank papers and the agreement created, but this was not sup-
ported by pleadings. Under S. 102 of the Evidence Act, 1872, onus was upon him to prove the
facts alleged, but he could not do so, the agreement was enforceable.

SC 878: (1967) 1 SCR 331; Alec Lobb (Garages) Ltd v Total Oil Great Britain Ltd, (1983) 1
WLR 87 (Ch D). Every person occupying a position of influence does not necessarily abuse it.
Thus where finance was provided twice over to a garage subject to certain protective clauses
but with a genuine concern to help its business, no undue influence was found though a part
of the agreement was struck down as unreasonable restraint of trade. Afsar Sheikh v Soleman
Bibi, (1976) 2 SCC 142: AIR 1976 SC 163, the fact of undue influence must be made out of
the particulars pleaded by the plaintiff and not from the written statement. Where an ailing
father executed a sale deed in favour of his two sons who were caring for him and the third
living apart questioned validity, the court held that though the burden was on those who were
favoured, the transaction did not disclose any element of influence or fraud. Sukhdeo Rai v
Champa Devi, (1986) 34 BLJR 90, gift deed in favour of grandson upheld though executed
by the donor only a few days before his death. The court followed the remark in HALSBURY'S
LAWS OF ENLAND, Vol 17 (3rd Edn) 678, to the effect that: "There is no presumption of undue
influence in the case of gift to a son, grandson or son-in-law, although made during the donor's
illness and a few days before his death." Shrimati v Sudhakar R. Bhatkar, AIR 1998 Bom 122:
(1997) 4 Bom CR 237, the mere fact that the person in whose favour a property was gifted by
registered deed was the tenant of the owner was held to be not sufficient to shift the burden
of proof on the donee. Kartick Prasad Gorai v Neami Prasad Gorai, AIR 1998 Cal 278, there
was no consideration and the sale deed seemed to be fake, hence presumption and shifting of
burden of proof on to the beneficiary of the sale deed. Savithramma v H. Gurappa Reddy,

and inferior, by the related member of that class, it is enough to prove the
existence of such a relation to throw on the recipient of the advantage the
burden of proving independent advice to the donor and in other respects
justifying the transaction." His Lordship then pointed out that a married
woman is not necessarily independent of the influence of her mother. Such
cases should be dealt with on their own facts, and not on any general pre-
sumption. On the facts of the case the court found that she was under the
influence of her mother."
Similarly, where a parda lady of 70 years, having three daughters, was
supposed to have gifted her entire land to the defendant, who was the tenant
of that land, it was held that from the position of his possession of the land
he must have dominated the woman and burden lay upon him to show the
circumstances of the gift. He being not able to do so, the gift deed was set
aside.42
The presumption is raised at least in the following cases:
1. Unconscionable bargains, inequality of bargaining power or
economic duress
Unconscionableness
Where one of the parties to a contract is in a position to dominate the will
of the other and the contract is apparently unconscionable, that is, unfair,
the law presumes that consent must have been obtained by undue influence.
The burden is shifted to the stronger party to prove that he did nothing to
overbear the will of the other. An instructive illustration is the decision of
the Privy Council in Wajid Khan v Raja Ewaz Ali Khan:43
An old and illiterate woman, incapable of any business, conferred on
her confidential managing agent, without any valuable consideration, an
important pecuniary benefit under the guise of a trust.
Their Lordships said that "all the facts of the case go to show that there
was active undue influence. The onus is on the grantee to show conclusively
that the transaction is honest, bona fide, well-understood, the subject of
independent advice and free from undue influence".
Some instances of unconscionableness
The presumption of undue influence was raised where a poor Hindu
widow, having no means for maintenance, borrowed, in order to establish

(HP), old, illiterate lady was taken by her collateral, in whom she had confidence, to his house
and put under "dhooni" (somekind of smoke treatment), she said that in that state her signa-
tures were taken on two papers that were represented to her as pension papers, on realising
that papers were gift deeds, she promptly took action, gift deeds set aside.

her right to maintenance, a sum of money at 100 per cent rate of interest;"
where a person, without having the means of subsistence, in order to prefer
an appeal against a judgment, borrowed Rs 3700 on a bond promising to
pay Rs 25,000 within a year from recovery of the possession of an estate;
where a youth of 18 years of age, spendthrift and a drunkard, borrowed
Rs 900 on a bond bearing compound interest at 2 per cent per mensem
with monthly rests, the court saying that "the instrument itself bears upon
its face the impress of unconscionable dealing, the rate of interest charged.
being so exorbitant";" where a person of the age of some 28 years, the son
of a wealthy man, but of profligate habits and greatly in need of money, his
father having refused to supply him, executed a bond to secure a sum of
Rs 500 with 37 ½ per cent interest with six-monthly rests, the bond further
providing that the sum would not be repayable within three years and even
if it was repaid the interest would run for three years. In all these cases the
court gave relief by scaling down the rate of interest to what appeared to be
reasonable in the circumstances. Gift in favour of a religious organisation by
a person weak in mind and suffering in health has been held to be one which
carries the apparent impress of undue influence."
Unconscionableness in moneylending transactions
Unconscionable bargains have been witnessed mostly in moneylending
transactions and in gifts. But the principle is not confined to such transac-
tions only. In a case before the Bombay High Court," a poor farmer, being
unable to pay back a loan, executed a sale deed in favour of the creditor of
his property three times the value of the sum due, the court granted relief by
setting aside the sale and allowing the farmer to pay back the lender within
a fixed period.
Position of dominance necessary for presumption to arise
It should, however, be borne in mind that the presumption of undue
influence on the ground of unconscionableness of the bargain is raised only
when one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other.
As between parties on equal footing the mere unconscionableness of the
bargain does not create the presumption of undue influence. The mere fact
that the bargain is a hard one is no ground in itself for granting relief. This

was pointed out by the Privy Council in Raghunath Prasad Sahu v Sarju
Prasad Sabu, 50
The defendant and his father were equal owners of a vast joint family
property over which they had quarrelled. Consequently the father had
instituted criminal proceedings against the son. The defendant, in order
to defend himself, mortgaged his properties to the plaintiff and borrowed
from him about ten thousand rupees on 24 per cent compound interest.
In eleven years this rate of interest had magnified the sum covered by the
mortgage more than elevenfold, viz., Rs 1,12,885. The defendant con-
tended that the lender had, by exacting high rate of interest, taken uncon-
scionable advantage of his mental distress and, therefore, there should be
presumption of undue influence.
Their Lordships, however, held that there could be no such presumption
in the circumstances of the case. Referring to sub-section (3) of Section 16,
which provides for presumption of undue influence, Lord SHAW observed as
follows: "By this sub-section three matters are dealt with. In the first place,
the relations between the parties to each other must be such that one is in a
position to dominate the will of the other. Once that position is substanti-
ated the second stage has been reached, viz., the issue whether the contract
has been induced by undue influence. Upon the determination of this issue
a third point emerges, which is that of the onus probandi. The burden of
proving that the contract was not induced by the undue influence is to lie
upon the person who was in a position to dominate the will of the other.
Error is almost sure to arise if the order of these propositions be changed.
The unconscionableness of the bargain is not the first thing to be considered.
The first thing to be considered is the relations of these parties. Were they
such as to put one in a position to dominate the will of the other?"
The borrower failed to prove that the lender was in a position to dom-
inate his will. The only relation between the parties that was proved was
simply that they were lender and borrower. The first requirement of Section
16 was, therefore, not fulfilled and, therefore, the borrower got no relief."1
Unconscionable gifts
Where a person was suffering from a number of ailments which con-
fined him to a nursing-home and from there he made a deed gifting all his

was placed under the Court of Wards and was, therefore, under a peculiar disability. This
enabled the lender to dominate his will.

[S. 16]
properties to one of his sons to the exclusion of others, the Supreme Court
held that the presumption of undue influence was proper. Gifts of this kind
are often made under influence. In another case before the Privy Council:53
An old Malay widow, wholly illiterate, was the owner of considerable
rent-producing landed property. She gifted all her property to her nephew
who was helping her, leaving for her an income only of about 30 dollars.
The deed of gift was prepared with the help of a lawyer.
On these facts the Lord CHANCELLOR observed: "In the present case their
Lordships do not doubt that the lawyer acted in good faith, but he seems to
have received a good deal of his information from the respondent (nephew);
he was not made aware of the material fact that the property which was
being given away constituted practically the whole estate of the donor, and
he certainly does not seem to have brought home to her mind the conse-
quences to herself of what she was doing, or the fact that she could more.
prudently and equally effectively, have benefited the donee without undue
risk to herself by retaining the property in her own possession during her
life and bestowing it upon him by her will. In their Lordships' view the
facts proved by the respondent are not sufficient to rebut the presumption of
undue influence which is raised by the relationship proved to have been in
existence between the parties; and they regard it as most important from the
point of view of the public policy to maintain the rule of law which has been
laid down and to insist that a gift made under circumstances which gave rise
to the presumption must be set aside unless the donee is able to satisfy the
court of the facts sufficient to rebut the presumption."54
In another case of benefits without consideration and which was also
before the Privy Council, a woman, who was described as a submissive
wife and who at the bidding of her husband, gave security of her stridhan
(personal property), which comprised some land, to secure the growing
indebtedness of her husband, Lord GODDARD expressed the opinion that
"it is unnecessary to enter into a discussion as to the burden of proof in
such a case as this as the evidence here abundantly justifies a presumption
that she was acting under the influence of her husband for whose benefit the
mortgage was being executed". His Lordship continued: "It would certainly

not be true to say that there is a presumption in every case where a wife
confers a benefit on her husband without consideration. Equally it is not
necessary in order to establish the presumption that the parties should stand
in some particular category of relationship to each other. The presumption
no doubt can be more easily established and indeed may be assumed in such
cases as transactions between parent and infant child, solicitor and client, or
spiritual adviser and penitent, but it will arise in any case in which the facts
show that the circumstances are such that influence can fairly be inferred."
Relationship of blood, marriage or adoption not sine qua non
Thus, what is necessary to establish the presumption is not that the par-
ties should be related by blood, marriage or adoption, but that their rela-
tions are, or position towards each other is, such that one is in a superior
position over the other. Even where they are so related, the presumption
may not arise for the influence may as well be fairly and wisely exercised.
This has been pointed out by the Supreme Court in Subhas Chandra Das
Mushib v Ganga Prasad Das Mushib:57
Some agricultural property was gifted by a person to his only grandson
through one of his two sons to the total exclusion of his sons. Although
the donor was of great age, he was taking active interest in his property.
Four years after the gift he died and still four years after that the other
sons questioned the validity of the gift on the ground of undue influence.
The court approved the principles laid down by the Privy Council in
Raghunath Prasad Sahu v Sarju Prasad Sahu and also noted the fact that
Section 16 of the Contract Act is based on the English common law as noted
in the judgment of the Supreme Court in Ladli Prasad Jaiswal v Karnal
Distillery Co Ltd" and held that on the facts of the case no presumption
of undue influence could arise. "The circumstance that a grandfather made
a gift of a portion of his properties to his only grandson (on account of
natural love and affection) a few years before his death is not on the face
56. See, for example, Avon Finance Co v Bridger, (1985) 2 All ER 281 (CA). An elderly couple,
willing to purchase a retirement house, signed certain documents at the bidding of their son
which were prepared by the finance company's solicitors and executed at the solicitor's office,
the son acting as an agent to procure signature and did so by committing a fraud on his par-
ents, the Court of Appeal unanimously held that the charge should be set aside. Similarly, in
Kingsworth Trust Ltd v Bell, (1986) 1 WLR 119, the Court of Appeal set aside the transaction
of a mortgage which was executed by a wife upon her property under misrepresentation from
her husband whose company had been provided the loan and who was authorised by the lend-
ing company to get the documents executed.

of it an unconscionable transaction." Where, on the other hand, a person
made a very negligible provision for his third wife and the daughters borne
by her, and donated the whole of his property only to one of his grandsons,
the Supreme Court held that, in the absence of any explanation from the
side of the donor for the discrimination, the presumption of undue influence
arose.60
Inequality of bargaining power
The presumption of undue influence may also arise from the fact that
there is such an inequality of bargaining power between the parties that one
can cause economic duress to the other. The decision of the Court of Appeal
in Lloyds Bank v Bundy is a remarkable illustration of the concept of ine-
quality of bargaining power.
60. Lakshmi Amma v Talengalanarayana, (1970) 3 SCC 159: AIR 1970 SC 1367. See also Takri
Devi v Rama Dogra, AIR 1984 HP 11, where the donor was an illiterate lady separated from
her husband and the donee was her legal advisor, held, presumption of undue influence. Marci
Celine D'Souza v Renie Fernandez, AIR 1998 Ker 280, the person executing settlement of
property in favour of the defendants was ill and totally dependent on them for existence.
The defendants had no other claim to or interest in the property. Held, the document was
vitiated by undue influence. Kennedy Alemas v Executive Engineer, (1998) 2 Bom CR 320,
the doctrine of inequality of bargaining power does not apply where the Government is a
party to the contract. A tender for one-year supply system was approved for 3 months' sup-
plies with right to extend up to 12 months. No extension was granted after first extension.
No illegality on the part of the Government. The court distinguished the case from Central
Inland Water Transport Corpn v Brojo Nath Ganguly, (1986) 3 SCC 156: AIR 1986 SC
1571; Shrilekha Vidyarthi v State of U.P., (1991) 1 SCC 212: AIR 1991 SC 537 and LIC v

out exactly what advice had been given. Banco Exterior International v Mann, (1995) 1 All

The court said that the bank was not required to conduct a meticulous examination of the

solicitor, the bank was entitled to think that the solicitor's advice would be such as a reasona-
bly competent professional person would give. TSB Bank plc v Camfield, (1995) 1 WLR 430

**Undue influence 193
A contractor borrowed a sum of money from a bank. He could not pay
back in time. The banker pressed for payment or for security. He sug-
gested that his father might mortgage the family's only residential house.
The bank officer visited the father and obtained his signatures upon
readymade papers. The contractor still could not pay and the banker
sought to enforce the mortgage which might have meant throwing out of
the family from its only residence. Accordingly Mr Bundy relied upon the
unfair character of the mortgage.
He was allowed to set aside the mortgage. Lord DENNING MR tried to
locate the principle which runs through all the varied situations in which
relief is allowed on account of unequal bargaining power. He said: "English
law gives relief to one who, without independent advice, enters into a con-
tract upon terms which are very unfair, or transfers property for a consider-
ation which is grossly inadequate, when his bargaining power is grievously
impaired by reason of his own needs or desires, or by his own ignorance or
infirmity, coupled with undue influence or pressure brought to bear on him
by or for the benefit of the other."
The bank exploited the vulnerability of the father, caused by his desire
to help his son, to such an extent that he charged his house to his ruin for
a very short moratorium, which was a highly inadequate consideration for
the mortgage.
Influence distinguished from persuation
"Influence" has to be distinguished for this purpose from persuation.
This distinction was put to work by the Bombay High Court in a case in
which the only relationship between the parties was that the defendant was
a tenant of a part of the plaintiff's premises. The owner was an illiterate
widow, but she had been managing her agricultural property for over two
decades. The tenant treated her as his mother and persuaded her to gift to
him her entire property. The gift deed, as duly executed by her, was regis-
tered. The court felt that it could not be said that the tenant was in a position
to dominate her will. The gift deed was not the result of undue influence.
The court said: "Influence in the eyes of the law has to be contradistin-
guished with persuation. Every persuation is not the same thing as influence.
One may by his acts and conduct convince and persuade the other party to
do a particular act and if the other party does such an act freely and out of
own volition, may be to his prejudice or disadvantage or peril, it cannot be
said that such act was influenced by the other."64

194 Chapter 5 Free Consent
Economic duress by forcing renegotiation of terms
[S. 16]
The House of Lords in their decision in Universe Tankships Inc v
International Transport Workers' Federations allowed the shipping com-
pany to recover back from the Workers' Federation 80,000 US Dollars which
were paid under an agreement and which agreement the shipping company
had to execute because the workers did not permit the ship to leave with-
out signature. It amounted to economic duress upon the shipowners. The
conduct was so catastrophic as to amount to coercion of the shipowner's
will which vitiated their consent to those agreements and payments made
by them.
The Bombay High Court" followed this case so as to hold that where a
supplier of raw materials to the ONGC, which was an import substitution,
gave a bank guarantee to the ONGC, which was to be enforced only when
the customs duty paid by the supplier was refunded to him, and he was sub-
sequently asked to drop this condition and make the guarantee enforceable
absolutely and that the condition would be orally observed, it amounted
to economic duress and fraud. The court cited Lord DIPLOCK in Pao On v
Lao Yiu Long as saying that the rationale behind the developing law of
economic duress was that the apparent consent of the party aggrieved was
induced by pressure exercised upon him by the other party which the law
does not regard as legitimate with the consequence that his consent was
treated as revocable unless approbated expressly or by implication after the
illegitimate pressure had ceased to operate on mind." His Lordship took
specific precaution to distinguish the concept of economic duress from mere
help of an influential Watandar Patil, who started living with her in immorality. He drove
her out after obtaining from her the gift of her property. The court observed that the gift
was presumably obtained through undue influence. The court also distinguished Miti Bewa
v Daitari Nayal, AIR 1982 Ori 174, where the sale deed was executed by an illiterate lady
thinking that it was a power of attorney in favour of her son-in-law who was living with her
and managing her property. The burden was on the latter to prove that there was no undue
influence. Similarly in Takri Devi v Rama Dogra, AIR 1984 HP 11, an illiterate lady, living
separately from her husband, donated her apple orchard to her lover and the same was held
to be the result of undue influence. Annarpurna Barik Dei v Inda Bewa, AIR 1995 Ori 273,
deed executed by illiterate woman, burden is on the other party to prove that terms were fair
and equitable, that she had independent advice and that the document was explained to and
understood by her.

economic interest, he would be entitled to claim that money back.

payment was increased by 10 per cent. They made the final payment without protest and
thereafter claimed refund. But their conduct was held as amounting to ratification. The pres-
sure on mind had ceased to exist when final bills were under consideration.

commercial pressure which in some degree always exists whenever one
party to a commercial transaction is in a stronger bargaining position than
the other party. Commercial pressure by itself does not amount to economic
duress. In the view of the Privy Council, two elements were necessary to
constitute duress, i.e. (1) pressure amounting to compulsion of the will of
the victim, and (2) the illegitimacy of the pressure exerted. For all practical
purposes the victim of the duress must have no other choice.
In another case on the subject," a national road carrier backed out of the
contract already entered into and compelled the other side to renegotiate the
terms of the contract. The defendants were heavily dependent on the retail
chain's contract and were unable at the time to find an alternative carrier.
They agreed to the new terms but later on refused to pay at the new rate.
The court observed: "Where a party to a contract was forced by the other
party to re-negotiate the terms of the contract to his disadvantage and had
no alternative but to accept the new terms offered, his apparent consent to
the new terms was vitiated by economic duress."
The court cited the dictum of Lord DENNING in D.&C. Builders v Rees:
"No person can insist on a settlement procured by intimidation."
The party had to surrender to the demand of increased charges for car-
riage because they had to meet their commitment to customs. Accordingly,
there was no consideration for the promise to pay increased charges and the
same was held to be not enforceable.
Where a government department refused to extend time for completion
of the ongoing works unless the contractor agreed to do the same type of
further work at the old rates, the court said that it amounted to economic
duress."
Exploitation of needy
This approach has been used in some other cases also. One of them is A.
Schroeder Music Publishing Co v Macaulay:72
There was an agreement between a young songwriter and a music pub-
lishing company. The arrangement was to remain in force for 5 years
and was to be automatically extended for another five years should the
boy's royalty reach the figure of £5000. The company could terminate the
agreement at any time by a month's notice. The boy had no such right and
he wanted to get out of it.
The House of Lords ordered his liberation from the bond. The contract
was on the terms of company's standard terms and was, therefore, the result
of the company's dictation.

[S. 16]
A similar relief was allowed in a case where a songwriter's copyright was
purchased on terms that he was not to publish his songs through any other
company but the company had the right to reject his songs." "In determin-
ing the respective bargaining positions of the parties, the courts will look at
a number of factors, such as age, poverty, illiteracy and emotional state."74
With these should be contrasted National Westminster Bank P&C v
Morgan. A self-employed businessman's joint home with his wife was
mortgaged to a building society who were threatening foreclosure. A bank
provided him money with which he paid off the society and a new charge
on the house was created in favour of the bank for all his present and future
liabilities. When his wife was called upon to sign the papers, she was told
that it covered only the loan and not business liabilities. The House of Lords
were not able to relieve her from the consequences of her signature. The
charge had conferred reasonably equal benefit on both parties. The relation-
ship of banker and customer is not automatically characterised as one to
which the doctrine of undue influence attaches.
Technique of judicial intervention in unfair bargains
These developments show that undue influence or duress has become
a technique of judicial intervention in unfair bargains." The traditional
approach of confining duress to threats to the person and to goods is about to
undergo expansion to include other threats, particularly those forms of eco-
nomic coercion which force a person to enter or vary a contract against his
will." Forcing a person to accept less money than is due to him by exploiting
his economic stringency is an example of this kind.78 The principle has been

applied to grant of licences as a part of the principle of distributive justice.
In this case there was a large disparity in the bargaining power of the appli-
cant and the granting authority. The applicant had no choice but to give his
consent to the terms and conditions imposed by the authority. In such cases
most of the time applicants are expected to sign on dotted lines."
Rescuing employees and others from unreasonable terms
Picking up the meaning of the word "unconscionable" from a diction-
ary the Supreme Court has noted that it means something that shows no
regard for conscience and which is irreconcilable with what is right or rea-
sonable. The matter before the court was a service contract. 81 A clause in the
contract empowered the employer (a Government undertaking) to remove
an employee by three months' notice or pay in lieu. The employee, who
contested the validity of this clause, was removed by handing him over a
three months' pay packet. The Supreme Court regarded the clause to be
constitutionally as well as contractually void. The court added that any term
which is so unfair and unreasonable as to shock the conscience of the court
would be opposed to public policy and therefore also void under Section 23.
The contract was not based upon a real consent. It was rather an imposition
upon a needy person." The term was unconstitutional because it was so
absolute that any officer could be made a target irrespective of his conduct,
good or bad.
Commenting upon this expanding power of the court to relieve a party
from the consequences of his own contract, a learned writer says that "free-
dom of contract turns out to be a misleading guide when so many contracts
are not free in the economic sense. The notion of contract as private legisla-
tion appears less attractive when legislation is always drawn up one-sidedly.
Judges are empowered to read in terms which are not there, or read out
terms which are there. They are to impose reasonableness. Whatever is not.
reasonable is not law. If the parties have agreed to something unreasonable,
they should be treated as if they have not agreed at all and released."83

Natural justice
[S. 16]
The process of contracting has also been subjected to the requirements of
natural justice. The acceptance of a revised price by a low bidder without
giving any such opportunity to the highest bidder was held by the Supreme
Court to be a denial of natural justice rendering the auction to be void.³4
2. Contracts with pardanashin women
A contract with a pardanashin woman is presumed to have been induced
by undue influence. She can avoid the contract unless the other party can
show that it was her "intelligent and voluntary act". There is, however, no
statutory or judicial definition of the term "pardanashin woman". In the
opinion of the Bombay High Court a woman does not become pardan-
ashin simply because "she lives in some degree of seclusion". The concept
probably means a woman who is totally "secluded from ordinary social
intercourse". The following observation of the Privy Council explains the
concept to a certain extent." "It is abundantly clear that Mrs Hodges was
not a pardanashin. The term quasi-pardanashin seems to have been invented
for this occasion. Their Lordships take it to mean a woman, who not being
of the pardanashin class, is yet so close to them in kinship and habits, and so
secluded from ordinary social intercourse, that a like amount of incapacity
for business should be ascribed to her, and the same amount of protection.
which the law gives to pardanashins must be extended to her. The contention
is a novel one, and their Lordships are not favourably impressed by it. As
to a certain well-known and easily ascertained class of women, well-known
rules of law are established with the wisdom of which we are not now con-
cerned; outside that class it must depend in each case on the character and
position of the individual woman whether those who dealt with her are or
are not bound to take special precautions that her action shall be intelligent
and voluntary, and to prove that it was so in case of dispute."
In a case before the Bombay High Court:88
It was found that a lady appeared before the Registrar for registration
of certain documents, that she stood as a witness in the box in a suit, that
and the Law of Contracts, (1988) 32 Yale Law Journal 763. A person who would give away
too much of his own liberty must be protected from himself, no matter how rational his
decision or compelling the circumstances. Hamela v Jang Sher Singh, AIR 2002 P&H 147,
plaintiff, illiterate, old and sick lady, was taking guidance from the defendant consulting him
off and on, the court said that he must be taken to be in a position to influence her. She was
told that she was signing a one-year lease but the same was in fact for 99 years, consideration
was Rs 2500 per year and even that was not paid to her. The court rescued her by cancelling
the document.

she put in tenants and fixed and recovered rents from them in respect of
her house. The court held that she could not be treated as a pardanashin
lady.
Once it is shown that a contract is made with a pardanashin woman, the
law presumes undue influence. The burden lies on the other party to show
that no undue influence was used, that the contract was fully explained
to her and that she freely consented. The following statement of the Privy
Council in Kalibakhsh Singh v Ram Gopal Singh" explains the extent of
this onus: "In the first place, the lady was a pardanashin lady, and the law
throws around her a special cloak of protection. It demands that the burden
of proof shall in such a case rest, not with those who attack, but those who
found upon the deed, and the proof must go so far as to show affirmatively
and conclusively that the deed was not only executed by, but was explained
to, and was really understood by, the grantor. In such cases it must also, of
course, be established that the deed was not signed under duress, but arose
from the free and independent will of the grantor."
In this case:
About two months before her death, a Hindu widow (who was a par-
danashin woman) gifted half of her landed properties to the son of her
paramour, who was also the manager (mukhtar) of her estate.
This, it was contended, combined with the fact that she had no independ-
ent advice, was sufficient to show that the gift was the result of the influence
the mukhtar had over the lady. Their Lordships, however, held that there
is no rule of law which makes independent advice necessary in every case.
"The possession of independent advice, or the absence of it, is a fact to be
taken into consideration and will be weighed on a review of the whole of
the circumstances relevant to the issue of whether the grantor thoroughly
comprehended, and deliberately and of her own free will carried out the
transaction. If she did, the issue is solved and the transaction is upheld."90
The extent of burden was further explained by the Privy Council in more
concrete terms in Moonshe Buzloor Raheem v Shumsoonisa Begum." A
widow remarried and endorsed and delivered to her new husband certain
valuable Government papers. In an action to recover them back from him
she proved that she lived in seclusion and that she had given over the papers
to him for collection of interest. He contended that he had given her full con-
sideration for the notes. It was held that the mere fact of endorsement and
the allegation of consideration were not sufficient to lift the presumption of
undue influence. He should prove that the transaction was a bona fide sale and
that he gave full consideration for the paper which he received from his wife.

Rescission of contract for undue influence is allowed under the provisions
of Section 19-A.
S.19-A. Power to set aside contract induced by undue influence.-When
consent to an agreement is caused by undue influence, the agreement is a con-
tract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused.
Any such contract may be set aside either absolutely or, if the party who was
entitled to avoid it has received any benefit thereunder, upon such terms and
conditions as to the Court may seem just.
Illustrations
(a) A's son has forged B's name to a promissory note. B, under threat of prosecuting A's
son obtains bond from A for the amount of the forged note. If B sues on this bond, the Court
may set the bond aside.
(b) A, a moneylender advances Rs 100 to B, an agriculturist and, by undue influence,
induces B to execute a bond for Rs 200 with interest at 6 per cent per month. The Court may
set the bond aside, ordering B to repay Rs 100 with such interest as may seem just.

Definition
MISREPRESENTATION [S. 18]
A contract the consent to which is induced by misrepresentation is void-
able at the option of the deceived party. Misrepresentation means mis-
statement of a fact material to the contract. Misrepresentation is defined in
Section 18:
S. 18. "Misrepresentation" defined.-"Misrepresentation" means and
includes-
(1) the positive assertion, in a manner not warranted by the information of
the person making it, of that which is not true, though he believes it to be true;
(2) any breach of duty which, without an intent to deceive, gains an advan-
tage to the person committing it, or any one claiming under him, by misleading
another to his prejudice, or to the prejudice of any one claiming under him;
(3) causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement, to make a mistake
as to the substance of the thing which is the subject of the agreement.
The section includes the following types of misrepresentation:
1. Unwarranted statements
When a person positively asserts that a fact is true when his information
does not warrant it to be so, though he believes it to be true, this is misrep-
resentation." In a Bombay case for example:

Misrepresentation 201
The defendants chartered a ship from the plaintiffs, who stated that
the ship was certainly not more than 2800 tonnage register. As a matter
of fact the ship had never been in Bombay and was wholly unknown to
the plaintiffs. She turned out to be of the registered tonnage of more than
3000 tonnes.
It was held that the defendants were entitled to avoid the charterparty.
"There was the positive assertion by the plaintiffs about the size of the
ship an assertion not warranted by any information the plaintiff had at
the time, and which was not true."94
A statement is said to be warranted by the information of the person
making it when he receives the information from a trustworthy source. It
should not be a mere hearsay. In a Calcutta case:"5
B told the plaintiff that one C would be the director of a company. B
had obtained this information not from C direct, but from another per-
son, called L. The information proved untrue.
The judge said: "I am not inclined to think that if B relied on second-hand
information he derived from L, he was warranted in making the positive
assertion that C would be a director."
Where a representation acquires the status of being a term of the contract,
and it turns out to be untrue, the disadvantaged party may, not only avoid
the contract but also sue for damages for breach. Where in the course of
negotiations for the sale of lamb, the seller stated that the whole of the lot
was fully serviced, whereas this was not so, the buyer was allowed damages
for the breach of the warranty." In another case" the plaintiff was orally
assured that his containers would be carried under the deck, but by mistake
they were loaded on deck and were lost. The defendant was not allowed to
claim the protection of a clause in the contract limiting his liability only to
wilful misconduct. The oral assurance had overridden the written clauses.
A land was purchased expressly for the construction of a duplex. The
seller represented that he saw no difficulty in any such use of the land. But
a permission to build such a complex was refused unless a sewage cost-
ing some 3000 dollars was provided. Though the misrepresentation was

might have the opportunity of knowing what he was to get".

innocent, the buyer was allowed to avoid the sale. Where an advertisement
in a local newspaper said the land to be 9000/5600 square feet, and that
it had a "beautiful reflective pool", but it turned out that the property was
not beautiful and that the reflective pool showed a massive crack and water
seepage, the buyer was not allowed to rescind the option to purchase. The
court said that the statement in the advertisement had not become incorpo-
rated as an implied term of the option to buy and the plaintiffs had seen the
reflective pool before they made the offer to purchase.99
Where the seller of a car stated that the car had done only 20,000 miles,
the representation being untrue, the buyer was allowed to recover compen-
sation for the misrepresentation.100
2. Breach of duty
Any breach of duty which brings an advantage to the person commit-
ting it by misleading the other to his prejudice is a misrepresentation. "This
clause is probably intended to meet all those cases which are called in the

who derives a benefit from the transaction equally answerable in effect as
if he had been actuated by motives of fraud or deceit". In that case, for
example:
The plaintiff, having no time to read the contents of a deed, signed it.
as he was given the impression by the defendant that it contained nothing
but formal matters already settled between them. The deed, however,
contained a release in favour of the defendants.
Accordingly, the plaintiff was allowed to set aside the deed. "The defend-
ant," the court said, "was under no obligation, legally or morally, to com-
municate the contents of the deed. But the plaintiff placed confidence. It

101. It was observed in Dynamics Corpn of America v Citizens and Southern National Bank,
356 Fed Supp 991 that fraud had a broader meaning in equity than at law and an intention
to defraud or to misrepresent was not a necessary element. "Fraud, indeed, in the sense of
a court of equity includes all acts, omissions and concealments which involve a breach of
legal or equitable duty, trust or confidence justly reposed and are injurious to another or
by which an undue or unconscientious advantage is taken of another." Applying this to the
facts of a case before it, Dai-Ichi Karkaria P Ltd v Oil and Natural Gas Commission, AIR
1992 Bom 309, the Bombay High Court held that to force a person, at the pain of stopping
business with him, to change the conditions attached to the encashment of his bank guar-
antee was a fraud on him. Oil and Natural Gas Commission v Dai-ichi Karkaria (P) Ltd,
1994 Mah LJ 1084, no fraud or coercion could be proved, encashment of bank guarantee not
stayed.

then became his duty to state fully without concealment, all that was essen-
tial to a knowledge of the contents of a document."103
A female patient was told that her sterilisation would be irreversible, but
was not told that there was the minute risk (less than 1 per cent) of fail-
ure and of pregnancy. She conceived again, delivered a child and sued the
gynaecologist for his breach of contract. The representation that the opera-
tion was "irreversible" was held as not amounting to an express guarantee
that the operation was bound to achieve its acknowledged object of ster-
ilising the plaintiff. The representation meant no more than this that the
operative procedure in question was incapable of being reversed. The court
would be slow to imply a term that the expected result would actually be
achieved.104 Where, on the other hand, a husband undergoing vasectomy
operation was not warned that there was a slight risk of his wife becoming
pregnant, the surgeon was held responsible to the man and his wife for the
pains of unwanted pregnancy. The court said that the plaintiffs were entitled
to damages for distress, pain and suffering, since the personal distress of
both plaintiffs and the pain and suffering of the birth was a separate head
of claim which was not cancelled out by the relief and joy felt after the birth
of a healthy baby and there was no reason in principle why damages could
not be recovered for the discomfort and pain of a normal pregnancy and
delivery. 105
Persons of full age and understanding who subscribe their signature to
a document cannot be heard to say that they had affixed the signatures on
blank papers or that they signed without appraising themselves about the
recitals. Persons so imprudent as that have to take the consequences of such
imprudence.106
3. Inducing mistake about subject-matter
Causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement to make a mistake
as to the substance of the thing which is the subject of the agreement is also
misrepresentation. [S. 18(3)]

204 Chapter 5 Free Consent
[S. 18]
The subject-matter of every agreement is supposed by the parties to pos-
sess certain value or quality. If one of the parties leads the other, however
innocently, to make a mistake as to the nature or quality of the subject-mat-
ter, there is misrepresentation. For example, in a Bombay case:107
The directors of a company, while acting within their authority, sold on
the company's behalf a bill of exchange to a bank. The company denied
liability on the bill.
But the bank was held entitled to recover the amount of the bill from the
company as money received to the use of the bank. "The bill was different
from what it was expressly represented to be by the agents of the company."
The Government auctioned certain forest coupes. A part of the land was
occupied by tenants. The Forest Department knew this fact but did not dis-
close it to the purchaser. The contract was held to be vitiated by misrep-
resentation. The purchaser was allowed to recover damages for loss.108
A second-hand car dealer attached a disclaimer to the car under sale stat-
ing that the mileage reading was incorrect. The dealer knew the true mileage
of the car but did not disclose it. It was held that the dealer was bound to
disclose the real position because he knew it and also knew that the odome-
ter materially understated the mileage. The court said that although, in the
ordinary way, dealers were under no positive duty to disclose the defects
and disadvantages of their wares, they were required to volunteer the truth,
in so far as they knew it with regard to the inaccurate mileage reading. The
disclaimer seriously understated the fact. The defendants knew not only that
the reading was incorrect but that it was grossly and potentially mislead-
ingly so.109
Suppression of vital facts
Misrepresentation may also arise from suppression of vital facts. Cases
of concealment or suppression will fall either under sub-section (2), when
it amounts to a breach of duty or under sub-section (3) when it leads the
other party to make a mistake about the subject-matter of the agreement.
For example, in R. v Kylsant,110 the prospectus of a company stated that the
company had regularly paid dividends, which created the impression that
the company was making profits, whereas the truth was that the company
had been running into losses for the last several years and dividends could
only be paid out of wartime accumulated profits. The suppression of this
fact was held to be a misrepresentation. Similarly, where in the negotiations
for a marriage contract, those speaking for the girl failed to disclose that she

was suffering from epileptic fits, the engagement was held to be voidable, a
very material fact having been suppressed."11
The fact that the girl was married before and was a widow at the time of
remarriage was held to be a vital fact. Its non-disclosure enabled the hus-
band to get a decree of nullity.112
Of material facts
Misrepresentation should be of facts material to the contract. Mere
"commendatory expression" such as men of business will habitually make
about their goods are not sufficient to avoid the contract. In a sale of land,
for example, "a mere general statement that the land is fertile and improv-
able, whereas parts of it had been abandoned as useless, cannot, except in
extreme cases, as, for instance, where a considerable part is covered with
water, or otherwise irreclaimable, be considered such a misrepresentation as
to entitle a purchaser to be discharged."113 But, when, in the sale of a hotel,
the tenant was described "as a most desirable tenant", whereas his rent was
in arrears, this was held to be a material misrepresentation.114
In the matters of matrimony it has been held that qualifications of the
spouse are a material fact. Where the girl was in possession of high academic
qualifications and agreed to matrimony because she was told that her match
was in an attractive job whereas he was only an apprentice in a factory, the
court ruled that it was a misrepresentation and, therefore, annulment of the
marriage would have to be decreed. Where the fact suppressed was that
the girl was incapable of child bearing because of operation for excision of
fallopian tube, this was held to be a material misrepresentation enabling the
court to pass a decree of nullity.116

A fact is said to be material if it would affect the judgment of a reasona-
person in deciding whether to enter into the contract and, if so, on what

terms. Misrepresentation of the age of a car, showing it to be five years
younger, was held to be material because it affected the price which a will-
ing purchaser would have liked to pay for it. But putting forth exaggerated
measurement of land by 2.3 per cent was held to be not material. 117
Peptic ulcer is a common disease which appears and which gets cured on
proper treatment. This is not a serious disease which may result in death
and it is only in cases where proper care is not taken, it may prove fatal.
Therefore, non-disclosure by the assured deceased that at a particular point
of time, he was suffering from peptic ulcer did not amount to deliberate sup-
pression of material fact so as to enable the insurance company to repudiate
the contract.118
Expression of opinion
A mere expression of opinion cannot be regarded as a misrepresentation
of facts even if the opinion turns out to be wrong. But in some cases, a state-
ment of opinion may also amount to misrepresentation. One such situation
was stated by BOWEN LJ in Smith v Land & House Property Corpn19 "It
is often fallaciously assumed that a statement of opinion cannot involve a
statement of fact. In a case where the facts are equally well-known to both
parties, what one of them says to the other is frequently nothing but an
expression of opinion. But if the facts are not equally well-known to both
sides, then a statement of opinion by one who knows the facts best involves
very often a statement of a material fact, for he impliedly states that he
knows facts which justify his opinion."
This statement was affirmed by the Privy Council in Bisset v Wilkinson.120
Certain lands were sold. The seller was aware that the land was required
for sheep-farming and, therefore, expressed the opinion that "the land had
a carrying capacity of 2000 sheep". The land turned out to be unsuitable for
sheep-farming and the purchaser refused to pay the price.
Their Lordships found no ground for enabling the buyers to avoid the
agreement. Lord MERRIVALE felt that where relief is sought on the basis of
misrepresentation, it is necessary that there should be representation of a
specific fact. A representation of fact may be inherent in a statement of opin-
ion. But it depends upon the material facts of the transaction, the knowledge
of the parties respectively and their relative positions, etc. The most material
fact in the case was that both parties were aware that the vendor had not
and no other person had carried on sheep-farming in that unit of land. "In
these circumstances the purchasers were not justified in regarding anything

Misrepresentation 207
said by the vendor as to the carrying capacity as being anything more than
an expression of opinion on the subject."
Where a claim was made through an advertisement that the defendants
were the "top flight cabaret performers in Europe", the court said that it
was a statement of opinion. The hotel which engaged them on the basis of
the claim could not terminate the contract on the ground of misrepresenta-
tion. An advertisement for sale of residential property claimed that for-
eigners were eligible to purchase it. This was held to be the statement of an
existing fact. 122 "There is a difference between an indiscriminate praise and
specific promises or assertion of verifiable facts."123
Representation of state of mind
A representation of one's state of mind is also a representation of fact. In
Edgington v Fitzmaurice,124 the prospectus of a company misstated the pur-
pose to which the money to be borrowed by issuing debentures was going
to be applied. The directors contended that the representation related to the
state of their mind as to what use the money was going to be put and they
could change their mind and, therefore, it was not a misrepresentation of
a specific fact. The Court of Appeal, however, pointed out that the state
of a man's mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion. A misrep-
resentation as to the state of a man's mind is, therefore, a misstatement of
fact.
The intention of the parties is very important in the matter of contracting.
"The intention of the parties governs in the making and in the construction
of all contracts. If the parties so intend, the sale may be absolute, with a
warranty superadded or the sale may be conditional, to be null and void if
the warranty is broken."125
Change of circumstances
A petroleum company acquired a site on a main road for constructing a
petrol pump estimating its annual consumption to be 2,00,000 gallons from
the third year of operation. The planning authority, however, permitted the
pump to be erected only at the back side of the site which was accessible
only from the side streets and not at all visible from the busy main road
and this considerably affected the sale potential. But even so they failed to

that no sulphur had been used. After delivery the buyer found that sulphur had been used
in the cultivation of a portion of the hops only but the whole crop had become inseparably
mixed up. The buyer was allowed to reject all the hops. The court said that the intention of
the parties appeared to be that the contract should be null if sulphur had been used.

[S. 18]
point this out to the lessee of the pump who in consequence invested money
on the basis of the originally intimated estimates and suffered loss. They
were held liable for the plaintiff's loss. The court laid down that where dur-
ing the course of precontractual negotiations, one party, who had special
knowledge and expertise concerning the subject-matter of the negotiations,
made a forecast with the intention of inducing the other party to enter into a
contract, and the other party did so, the court can construe that the forecast
was not merely an expression of opinion but as constituting a warranty and
accordingly they were liable for the breach of the warranty. Every person
who offers an advice, information or opinion of this kind is under a duty of
reasonable care to see that it is true, and this duty was not limited to persons
carrying on the profession or business of giving advice.126
There is often a gap of time between the representation of a fact and the
ultimate conclusion of the contract. Any change of circumstances in the
meantime affecting the fact represented must be brought to the knowledge
of the other party. This was pointed out by the Court of Appeal in With v
O'Flanagan:127
In the negotiations for the sale of his medical practice, the defend-
ant represented that his practice had brought in £2000 per annum for
the preceding three years and that he had a specified number of patients
on his panel. Negotiations resulted in a contract in about five months.
During this time the defendant became ill and could not attend to his
practice. This resulted in a serious loss of practice, but the purchaser
could learn about it only after the completion of the sale. It was held that
the plaintiff was entitled to rescind the contract. The court emphasised
that the change of circumstances should have been brought to the notice
of the purchaser.128
Inducement
It is further necessary that misrepresentation must be the cause of the
consent, in the sense that but for the misrepresentation the consent would
not have been given.129 The explanation to Section 19 provides:

129. See Hims Enterprises v Ishak Bin Subari, (1992) 1 CLJ 132 (HC), Johor Bahru, where the
agreement between the parties was made on terms with which the plaintiffs were familiar,
as they were terms previously used by the plaintiffs in their earlier contracts, that being so,
the terms contained no surprise for the plaintiffs and hence no culpable misrepresentation.
County Nat West Ltd v Barton, (2002) 4 All ER 494 (CA) (Note), the appeal considered
issues concerning the rebuttable presumption that arises from the making of a fraudulent
representation, namely, that if a false statement is of such a nature that it would be likely to
play a part in the decision of a reasonable person, it will be presumed to have done so unless
the representor satisfies the court to the contrary.

Misrepresentation 209
A fraud or misrepresentation which did not cause the consent to a con-
tract of the party of whom such fraud was practised, or to whom such mis-
representation was made, does not render a contract voidable.
If the plaintiff would have consented in any case, he can hardly complain.
Again the representation must be made with the intention that it shall be
acted upon by the other party. The plaintiff must have been affected by
the false representation. There would be no misrepresentation, even if the
advertisement was false, if the buyer had inspected the goods before buying
them unless he was the victim of some concealed defect which could not
be known by external examination.130 If a person to whom the statement
was not addressed voluntarily chooses to act upon it, he is not entitled to
rescission,131
Means of discovering truth
A party cannot complain of misrepresentation if "he had the means of
discovering the truth with ordinary diligence." This is recognised by way
of an exception stated along with Section 19. The statement is as follows:
If such consent was caused by misrepresentation or by silence, fraudulent
within the meaning of Section 17, the contract, nevertheless, is not voidable,
if the party whose consent was so caused had the means of discovering the
truth with ordinary diligence.
A person who bought a quantity of rice, was precluded from alleging
misrepresentation about its quality because he lived very near the place
where the goods were lying and, therefore, might have discovered the truth
with ordinary diligence. 133 But where the truth cannot be discovered with
ordinary diligence, the party guilty of misrepresentation cannot rely on the
defence. Thus, for example, in a case the director of a company falsely
told a bank that the bill they were selling to the bank was one on which
the company was liable, it was held that "no ordinary diligence would have
enabled the bank to discover that the company was not liable on the bill."135

[S. 17]
A difficult question about this exception is that where a person has the
means of discovering the truth, but does not use them and contracts in reli-
ance upon the statements made to him, whether the contract would be void-
able? In such cases the principle seems to be that if he relies upon those
means he cannot afterwards complain of the misrepresentation. But if he
does not use the means and relies upon the statements made to him, he can
avoid. This was laid down by the Court of Appeal in Redgrave v Hurd.136
Here also a medical practice was under sale. The seller misrepresented the
income which it produced, but gave documents to the purchaser from which
he could have verified, but he did not do so and having only cursorily looked
at them, purchased the business. On learning the truth he sought to avoid
the contract and was allowed to do so. Sir GEORGE JESSEL MR remarked:
"If a man is induced to enter into a contract by false representation, it is not
sufficient answer to him to say: 'If you had used due diligence, you would
have found out that the report was untrue. You had the means afforded you
of discovering its falsity, which you did not choose to avail yourself of.' One
of the most familiar instances in modern times is this. Men issue a prospec-
tus containing false statements, and then say the contracts themselves may
be inspected at the office of the solicitors. It has always been held that those
who accept those false statements as true are not deprived of their remedy
merely because they neglected to go and look at the contracts themselves.
Another instance with which we are familiar is a false statement as to the
contents of a lease; in such a case as a man saying that there was no covenant
or provision in the lease to prevent the carrying on, in the house to be sold,
the trade which the purchaser was known by the vendor to be desirous of
carrying on therein. Although the lease itself might be produced at the sale
or might have been open to the inspection of the purchaser, it was held that
the vendor could not be allowed to say: 'You are not entitled to give credit
to my statement.' It is not sufficient, therefore, to say that a man has had the
opportunity of investigating the real state of the case, but has not availed.
himself of that opportunity."
FRAUD
Definition
Intentional misrepresentation of facts, speaking broadly is called "fraud".
According to Section 17:
S. 17. "Fraud" defined.-"Fraud" means and includes any of the following
acts committed by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent,
by fraud or misrepresentation. Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Gowramma, AIR 1994 Kant
29, motor vehicle insurance policy issued after due verification about the ownership of the
vehicle. After accident, the company was not allowed to take the plea that the policy was
obtained by misrepresentation and that the claimant was not the owner of the vehicle.
136. (1881) LR 20 Ch D 1.

Page 349

[S. 17]
with intent to deceive another party thereto or his agent, or to induce him to
enter into the contract—
(1) the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not
believe it to be true;
(2) the active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of
the fact;
(3) a promise made without any intention of performing it;
(4) any other act fitted to deceive;
(5) any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent.
Explanation. Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a per-
son to enter into a contract is not fraud, unless the circumstances of the case are
such that, regard being had to them, it is the duty of the person keeping silence
to speak, or unless his silence is, in itself, equivalent to speech.
Illustrations
(a) A sells, by auction, to B, a horse which A knows to be unsound. A says nothing to B about
the horse's unsoundness. This is not fraud in A.
(b) B is A's daughter, and has just come of age. Here, the relation between the parties would
make it A's duty to tell B if the horse is unsound.
(c) B says to A-"If you do not deny it, I shall assume that the horse is sound". A says noth-
ing. Here A's silence is equivalent to speech.
(d) A and B, being traders, enter upon a contract. A has private information of a change in
prices which would affect B's willingness to proceed with the contract. A is not bound
to inform B.
Assertion of facts without belief in truth
In English law "fraud" was defined in the well-known decision of the
House of Lords in Derry v Peek.137 Lord HERSCHELL said:
"Fraud is proved when it is shown that a false representation has been
made,-
(1) knowingly, or
(2) without belief in its truth, or
(3) recklessly careless whether it be true or false."
In this case:
A company's prospectus contained a representation that the company
had been authorised by a special Act of Parliament to run trams by steam
or mechanical power. The authority to use steam was, in fact, subject to
the approval of the Board of Trade, but no mention was made of this. The
Board refused consent and consequently the company was wound up. The
plaintiff, having bought some shares, sued the directors for fraud. But
they were held not liable.
They were not guilty of fraud as they honestly believed that once the
Parliament had authorised the use of steam, the consent of the Board was
137. (1889) LR 14 AC 337 at p. 374.
Fraud 211

212 Chapter 5 Free Consent
[S. 17]
practically concluded. It follows, therefore, that the person making a false
representation is not guilty of fraud if he honestly believes in its truth. Thus
intentional misrepresentation is of the essence of fraud. The first three
clauses of Section 17 deal with this kind of fraud.138
Active concealment
"Active concealment" is something different from mere "passive conceal-
ment". 139 Passive concealment means mere silence as to material facts. An
active concealment of a material fact is a fraud; mere silence, excepting the
few cases noted below, does not amount to fraud.
The expression "any other act fitted to deceive" naturally means any act
which is done with the obvious intention of committing fraud. For example,
a husband persuaded his illiterate wife to sign certain documents telling her
that by them he was going to mortgage her two lands to secure his indebt-
edness and in fact mortgaged four lands belonging to her. This was an act
done with the intention of deceiving her. Where a person surrendered his
land to the State which was accepted after inquiry, but the land had already
been acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, it was held that the fact of
inquiry could not wipe out the consequence of fraud. The transaction of
surrender was a nullity. Where the seller of property did not disclose to the
buyer pending litigation about the property, the buyer was allowed refund
of his money with 6 per cent interest.141
Mere silence is no fraud
False impression is ordinarily conveyed by deliberate misstatement of
facts. But it may also be done by active concealment of material facts. "I
do not care," said Lord HALSBURY, "by what means a false impression is
conveyed-by what trick or device or ambiguous language, all those are
expedients by which fraudulent people seem to think that they can escape
from the real substance of the transaction."12 Ordinarily, of course, mere
silence is no fraud, even if its result is to conceal "facts likely to affect the

is a facet of dishonesty, fraud in connection with letters of credit. Santhakumari v
Lakshmiammal, (2004) 2 CTC 259, a lessee in possession and who had put up a building
also and had purchased the lessor's interest was not allowed to say that the lessor had made
fraudulent misrepresentations. He could not recover back the money paid by him without
seeking cancellation of the sale deed.

willingness of a person to enter into a contract."143 A contracting party is
under no obligation to disclose the whole truth to the other party or to give
him the whole information in his possession affecting the subject-matter of
the contract. It is under this principle that a trader may keep silent about a
change in prices. A seller who puts forth an unsound horse for sale, but says
nothing about its quality, commits no fraud. In a case before the Supreme
Court, a candidate, who had full knowledge of the fact that he was short
of attendance, did not mention this fact in his examination form. This was
held to be no fraud, it being the duty of the University to scrutinise forms
and to call for verification or information in case of doubts. The University
having failed to do so, was estopped from cancelling the examination of the
candidate.
A house was let out for three years without disclosing to the tenant that
it was in such a ruinous and dangerous state as to be dangerous to occupy,
a fact in the landlord's knowledge. When the tenant discovered this fact he
applied to have the contract set aside, arguing that the landlord should have
disclosed the real state of the house. The court did not allow the relief. There
was no warranty that the house was fit for immediate occupation. No mis-
representation was made, nor it was the case that the plaintiff was acting on
the impression produced by any conduct on the part of the owner as to the
state of the house or that he was not to make investigation before he began
to reside in it. There was no obligation on the owner to say anything about
the state of the house.145
Misdeclaration in application form
In an application for dealership of petroleum products, the applicant
made a misdeclaration about his income in the application form. It was
held that cancellation of the letter of intent issued to him was proper. The
contention that the fact wrongly declared had no hearing on the eligibility
criterion was not accepted.146
When silence is fraud
But then how far may silence go? Silence may become deceptive in certain
cases.
1. Duty to speak (contracts uberrima fides)
The first such case is when the person keeping silence is under duty to
speak. Duty to speak arises where one contracting party reposes trust and
confidence in the other. A father, for example, selling a horse to his son must
tell him if the horse is unsound, as the son is likely to rely upon his father.

Fraud 213

214 Chapter 5 Free Consent
[S. 17]
But the principle is not so confined. The duty to disclose the truth will arise
in all cases where one party reposes, and the other accepts, confidence.147
Duty to speak also arises where one of the parties is utterly without any
means of discovering the truth and has to depend on the good sense of the
other party. An insurance company, for example, knows nothing about the
life or circumstances of the assured. It has to depend on the disclosures
made by the assured. It is, therefore, the duty of the assured to put the
insurer in possession of all the material facts affecting the risk covered. A
contract of insurance is, for this reason, called a contract of absolute good
faith, uberrima fides.14 Where false answers as to the state of health were
given in a proposal for life insurance, the policy was held to be voidable and
it was not material that the medical officer of the corporation had certified
the life assured as good. 149 Where a person got his motor vehicle insured in
the evening, when in the morning, the vehicle had met with an accident, the
policy was held to be not enforceable, the duty of the insurer to check the
vehicle notwithstanding,150 Burden of proof lies on the insurer to show that
the fact misstated or suppressed was of material nature to the risk covered
and that the same was done to cause misconception about the risk under-
taken by the insurer.
In the absence of any such relationship there is no duty to speak and mere
silence even if it amounts to misrepresentation, will be no fraud. For exam-
ple, in Haji Ahmad Yarkhan v Abdul Gani Khan:152
The plaintiff spent a sum of money to mark the engagement of his son.
He then discovered that the girl suffered from epileptic fits and so broke
off the engagement. He sued the other party to recover from them com-
pensation for the loss which he had suffered on account of their deliberate
suppression of a vital fact which amounted to fraud.
The court relied upon the decision of the House of Lords in Nocton v Lord
Ashburton 153 where it was pointed out that a mere passive non-disclosure of

"No" answer was given to the question of any treatment about the state of heart, the answer
being false, the claim failed.

India Insurance Co Ltd, (2005) 3 CCC 64 (Gau), non-disclosure that an earlier proposal
of insurance for the same property and on the same ground had been refused by the same
company, held suppression of material fact. The subsequent insurance was obtained by sup-
pressing that fact.

[S. 17]
the truth, however deceptive in fact, does not amount to fraud, unless there
is a duty to speak. Referring to the facts the court said that the law imposes
no general duty on anyone to broadcast the blemishes of his female relations;
not even to those who are contemplating matrimony with them. There was
no fiduciary relation between the parties. The engagement was, however,
held to be voidable by reason of the misrepresentation, but the plaintiff was
not entitled to recover any compensation under Section 75 of the Contract
Act.
2. Where silence is deceptive
Silence is sometimes itself equivalent to speech. A person who keeps silent,
knowing that his silence is going to be deceptive, is no less guilty of fraud.
Where, for example, the buyer knows more about the value of the property,
which is the subject of sale, but prefers to keep the information from the
seller, the latter may void the sale. [Illustration (d), S. 17]
3. Change of circumstances
Sometimes a representation is true when made, but, it may, on account
of a change of circumstances, become false when it is actually acted upon
by the other party. In such circumstances, it is the duty of the person who
made the representation to communicate the change of circumstances. In an
English case, for example:
154
A medical practitioner represented to the plaintiff that 'his practice
was worth £2000 a year'. The representation was true. But five months
later when the plaintiff actually bought the practice, it had considerably
gone down on account of the defendant's serious illness.
It was held that the change of circumstances ought to have been commu-
nicated. Similarly, in a case before the Madras High Court:155
"A company's prospectus represented that certain persons would be
the directors of the company. This was true. But before the allotment
took place, there were changes in the directorate, some directors having
retired."
That was held to be sufficient to entitle an allottee to avoid the allotment.
4. Half-truths
Even when a person is under no duty to disclose a fact, he may become
guilty of fraud by non-disclosure if he voluntarily discloses something and
then stops half the way. A person may keep silence, but if he speaks, a duty
arises to disclose the whole truth. "Everybody knows that sometimes half

[S. 17]
a truth is no better than a downright falsehood." In a US case,157 for
example:
The plaintiff purchased a tract of land. The contract of sale stated that
the land was subject to a right of the Borough to open two streets within
the area. But as a matter of fact the Borough had the right to open three
streets.
Holding that the plaintiff had the right of rescission, CORDOZO CJ said:
"We do not say that the seller was under a duty to mention the projected
streets at all. That question is not here. What we say is merely this, that
having undertaken or professed to mention them, he could not fairly stop
halfway."
As in misrepresentation, so in fraud by silence, if the plaintiff had means
to discover the truth by ordinary diligence, he cannot obtain rescission.
But in any other case the fraudulent party cannot say that the other could
have discovered the truth. In a case, for example, before the Gujarat High
Court:15
False estimates of the costs of construction were given in a tender. The
contractor agreed to some reduction on the belief that the estimate was
correct. The court held that the representations contained in the tender
were fraudulent and that it was no defence that the plaintiff could have
discovered the true costs by reasonable effort.
Promise made without intention of performing
To tie-up a person to a promise with no intention of performing from
one's side and with the intention of only preventing the other from deal-
ing with others, is an example of a promise made without the intention of
performing it. This is the third type of fraud included in the definition in
Section 17. A purchase of goods without any intention of paying the price is
a fraud of this species.159 A builder entered into a large number of bookings,
nearly three times the available units of accommodation and collected mon-
eys. This was held by the Supreme Court to be fraud because he should have
known that he would not be able to perform the contract with all of them.
There was no provision for interest on the deposit money. Inspite of this he
was held liable to pay interest. The Court said that there was fraud causing
inducement for booking by the purchasers: such fraud creates liability even
outside the agreement."

[S. 17]
Any other act fitted to deceive
The fourth kind of fraud identified by Section 17 is any act which is fitted
to deceive. In a case before the Calcutta High Court where a practitioner
cast aspersions on the court and also on the opposite lawyer, the court cited
generally the following statement about the concept of fraud: Fraud has been
defined in Section 17 of the Contract Act, 1872. As per interpretation of the
statute, two kinds of fraud are mentioned, (i) actual or positive fraud which
includes cases of intentional and successful employment of any cunning,
deception, or artifice, used to circumvent, cheat or deceive another; and (ii)
constructive or legal fraud which includes such contracts or acts as though
not originating in any actual evil design or contrivance to perpetrate a fraud
yet, by their tendency to deceive or mislead others, or to violate private
or public confidence, are prohibited by law (COMMENTARIES ON EQUITY
JURISPRUDENCE by Justice STORY). 161
Any act or omission specially declared to be fraudulent
The last category includes cases in which the law specially declares an act
or omission to be fraudulent. For example, the Insolvency Act and Companies
Act declare certain kinds of transfer to be "fraudulent preference"..
The fifth and the last category of frauds included in the definition of
Section 17 is intended to cover all such acts which under any other branch of
law are regarded as fraudulent. In insolvency law there is, for example, the
concept of fraudulent preference and in the Transfer of Property Act, there
is the concept of fradulent transfer.
These words seem to have been inserted for ensuring that all kinds of
intentional cheating is covered and nothing of the sort escapes.162
Distinction between fraud and misrepresentation
Misrepresentation and fraud have many points in common. For instance,
both render the contract voidable; there is a false representation in both; in
either case it is necessary that the consent should have been caused by the
fraud or misrepresentation and finally, where there is a fraud by silence, the
fact, that there were "means of discovering the truth by ordinary diligence",
is a good defence.163 This is so in misrepresentation also. Damages for loss
caused by innocent misrepresentation are assessed on the same principles as
in the case of a deliberate fraud.164 Yet the following points of distinction.
are also noticeable:

Fraud 217

218 Chapter 5 Free Consent
[Ss. 19 & 19-A]
Firstly, fraud is more or less an intentional wrong, whereas
mis-representation may be quite innocent.
Secondly, fraud, in addition to rendering the contract voidable, is a
cause of action in tort for damages. Simple misrepresentation is not a
tort but under Section 75 of the Contract Act, "a person who rightfully
rescinds a contract is entitled to compensation for any damage which he
has sustained through the non-fulfilment of the contract."165 The (English)
Misrepresentation Act, 1967, also enables the court to award damages.
instead of rescission. A person who purported to sell his wife's property
without obtaining her consent and she refused to sign the deed, was held
liable to the buyer for his loss. 167 A purchaser of premises completed the
purchase even after discovering that a tenancy agreement affecting one
of the flats was concealed from him. He was nevertheless allowed to sue
for damages for the loss caused to him, though he had in tort the right to
rescind.
Lastly, a person complaining of misrepresentation can be met with the
defence that he had "the means of discovering the truth with ordinary
diligence", [S. 17, Exception] but excepting fraud by silence, it does not
lie in the mouth of the person committing fraud to say that his victim was
too easily deceived or had the means of discovering the truth. "Fools have
to be protected against knaves."
Limits of rescission [Ss. 19 and 19-A]
A contract the consent to which is caused by coercion, undue influence,
fraud or misrepresentation is voidable at the option of the party whose con-
sent was so caused.170 Section 19 provides:
165. The section gives illustration [See under the Section]. There is no such right if the damage is
not.caused by non-fulfilment of the contract. See Haji Ahmad Yarkhan v Abdul Gani Khan,
AIR 1937 Nag 270.
166. S. 2(2). See William Sindall plc v Cambridgeshire County Council, (1994) 1 WLR 1016

notified by unauthorised functionaries of the State was set aside. P. Anasuyamma v Commr

sion is three years. A suit commenced 12 years after an assignment was quashed.

When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or misrep-
resentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party
whose consent was so caused.
The provision does not refer to "undue influence" because this is specially
dealt with by Section 19-A. Section 19 further goes on to provide something
special about the effect of fraud and misrepresentation. It says:
A party to a contract, whose consent was caused by fraud or misrepresenta-
tion, may, if he thinks fit, insist that the contract shall be performed, and that he
shall be put in the position in which he would have been if the representation
made had been true.
The party affected by the factors that make the contract voidable, has
to avoid it because otherwise it remains valid. It is not like that of a void
agreement that does not require to be avoided. 171 He has the option either
to avoid the contract or, alternatively, to affirm it. When fraud is proved,
the whole proceedings fails. The suit and execution proceedings are all a
nullity. The onus is on the plaintiff to prove fraud, etc. For this purpose
he has to plead the precise particulars which constitute the alleged fraud.
This onus is quite as high as the burden to prove in criminal law that the
accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.173 He can exercise his option
only once. If the contract is affirmed, it becomes enforceable by both the
parties and, if it is avoided, it becomes void as against both. The effect of
rescission is that the contract is set aside and the parties are restored to their
original position. Where a State Financial Corporation had taken over the
entitled to the same amount of protection as a pardanashin woman, namely, burden of proof
on the other party to prove fairness of the transaction. Upendra Mohant v Champa, 1996

unit of the borrower, but an offer was made to the defaulting borrower to
take back the unit on paying certain price which offer was accepted by his
widow by making the payment, but subsequently the Corporation came out
with a revised and a higher claim, it was held that the earlier figure was a
misrepresentation on which the widow acted. She had the right to have the
deal set aside and recover back the amount paid by her which could not be
considered as repayment of the loan.175 A purchaser of immovable property
who alleged that there were fraudulent statements in the sale deed was not
allowed to recover back the purchase money without having the documents
set aside because of fraud.176 Moreover, the right to rescind is subject to cer-
tain infirmities which defeat it in the following circumstances:
Loss of right of rescission
1. By affirmation
Where the party, after becoming aware of his right to rescind, affirms
the contract, the right of rescission is lost. Affirmation may be express or
implied. An implied affirmation takes place when he does some act incon-
sistent with his right to rescind, for example, where he appropriates to his
use the goods received under a voidable contract or has sold or attempted to
sell them. An interesting illustration of implied affirmation is to be found in
Long v Lloyd.177
The defendant induced the plaintiff to buy his lorry by falsely convinc-
ing him that it was "in excellent condition". On the very first journey the
plaintiff discovered serious defects, but accepted the defendant's offer to
bear half the cost of repairs. The lorry completely broke down on the next
journey and he then claimed rescission.
The court held that on the first breakdown the plaintiff came to know
that the representation was false. But, instead of asking for rescission then,
he accepted the offer of repair and sent the lorry on a second trip. This
amounted to "a final acceptance... for better or for worse and conclusively
extinguished any right of rescission remaining to the plaintiff after comple-
tion of the sale."178
Similarly, it has been observed by the Supreme Court that "if it can be
shown that the party defrauded has at any time after knowledge of the fraud
either by express words or by unequivocal acts affirmed the contract, his
election is determined forever. The party defrauded may keep the question

[Ss. 19 & 19-A]
open so long as he does nothing to affirm the contract. The provision
is not applicable to a concluded contract when the party challenging it
had voluntarily chosen to implement it knowing all the relevant facts and
circumstances. 180
2. By lapse of time
Rescission must be claimed within reasonable time after discovering the
misrepresentation. Thus where shares were allotted to a person on the basis
of a misleading prospectus in July and in December he moved to set aside
the contract, it was held that the unexplained delay of five months precluded
him from obtaining the relief.181
The challenge to an arbitration award on the ground of fraud is to be
established by filing an independent suit or filing an application under
Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. A writ petition on
the ground of fraud, that too after inordinate delay, created a question mark
about bona fides of the petitioner. The court refused to set aside the award
on the ground of fraud.12
In respect of defences of this nature, including that of mistake, it is nec-
essary that they should be raised while contracting or immediately thereaf-
ter. Once the contract has run its full period, such a plea may cease to be
available.183
3. Intervention of rights of third parties
The right of rescission is lost as soon as a third party, acting in good faith,
acquires rights in the subject-matter of the contract. Thus, where a person
obtains goods by fraud and, before the seller is able to avoid the contract,
disposes them off to a bona fide party, the seller cannot then rescind.
Mode of rescission
The usual method of rescinding a contract is by giving a notice to the
other party of the intention to rescind. But what should he do if the other
party cannot be contacted? The answer is to be found in Car & Universal
Finance Co Ltd v Caldwell:184
The plaintiff gave the possession of his car to a buyer for his cheque.
The cheque turned out to be worthless. The plaintiff wanted to give notice
to the buyer of his intention to avoid the contract and to take back his
car, but could not trace him. He thereupon informed the police and the

Automobile Association to trace his car. Sometime later the fraudulent
buyer sold the car to the defendant and the plaintiff sought to recover it.
It was held that by informing the police and the Association the plaintiff
had done an overt act clearly showing his intention to rescind and the sale
of the car after rescission could not convey to the defendant a good title. To
hold otherwise, said SELLERS LJ "would involve that the defrauding party, if
skilful enough to keep out of the way, would deprive the other party to the
contract of his right to rescind. That another innocent party or parties may
suffer does not justify imposing on a defrauded seller an impossible task. He
has to establish clearly and unequivocally that he terminates the contract
and is no longer to be bound by it. If he cannot communicate his decision
he may still satisfy a judge that he had made a final and irrevocable decision
and ended the contract."
A similar problem was before the Allahabad High Court in Official
Receiver v Jugal Kishore Lachhi Ram Jaina:185
Under an agreement for sale of certain goods, the plaintiff received
through a bank the railway receipts supposed to represent the goods
and obtained them from the bank after paying Rs 15,000. The amount
was sent to the seller's account at his place of business. Meanwhile the
plaintiff discovered that the railway receipts were bogus and immediately
informed the bank not to part with the amount which was accordingly
withheld. But before the plaintiff could inform either the fraudulent seller
or file a suit for rescission an insolvency judge ordered the bank not to pay
the amount to either party.
The plaintiff then filed a suit for declaration that he was entitled to his
money. The Full Bench was of the view that the plaintiff had parted with
his money under a fraud. Thus the money came into the insolvent's account
under a defeasible title and the plaintiff had defeated it when he directed the
banker to stop payment which was done before the insolvency judge's order.
Even if he had rescinded by filing the suit, he was entitled to the money,
because he had done nothing to affirm the contract.
Section 66 lays down the way in which the communication of rescission
is to be made effective.
S. 66. Mode of communicating or revoking rescission of voidable con-
tract. The rescission of a voidable contract may be communicated or revoked
in the same manner, and subject to the same rules, as apply to the communica-
tion or revocation of a proposal.
Restitution
Rescission is always subject to the condition that the party seeking rescis-
sion must be in a position to restore the benefits he may have obtained under
the contract. Section 64 requires him to do so.

S. 64. Consequences of rescission of voidable contract.-When a per-
son at whose option a contract is voidable rescinds it, the other party thereto
need not perform any promise therein contained in which he is promisor. The
party rescinding a voidable contract shall, if he has received any benefit there-
under from another party to such contract, restore such benefit, so far as may
be, to the person from whom it was received.
188
A person avoiding a loan bond on the ground of undue influence has to
pay back the loan, the court only reduces the rate of interest to what may
seem to be reasonable in the circumstances.16 A corporation supplied, after
taking payment in advance, a quantity of rapeseed oil which turned out to be
mixed with water, the corporation had to refund the money with interest.187
Even where the party seeking rescission is not in a position to restore to
the defendant his status quo ante, the court may allow rescission by doing
what is practically just in the circumstances. Thus, where a wife wanted
to set aside on the ground of misrepresentation the separation deed made
with her husband, under which she had already received some maintenance,
but she was not able to restore the money, the court allowed her relief hold-
ing that the money may be set-off against costs to which she was otherwise
entitled.189 SWINFEN EADY LJ said: "The general rule is that as a condition
of rescission there must be restitution in integrum, but at the same time the
court has the full power to make all just allowances. It was said by Lord
BLACKBURN in Erlangar v New Sombrero Phosphate Co,10 that the prac-
tice had always been for a court of equity to give relief by way of rescission
whenever by the exercise of its power it can do what is practically just,
though it cannot restore the parties precisely in the state that they were
in before the contract. On the other hand, where both parties had spent
money on the property in terms of the contract in such manner that resti-
tution was not possible, rescission was not allowed even though there was
innocent misrepresentation on the part of the seller of the property.151 The
position is thus summarised by Treital:192 "As in cases of misrepresentation,

the party seeking rescission must restore benefits that he has obtained under
the contract, but he is not required to make precise restitution: the principle
of allowing rescission for misrepresentation so long as equity can achieve a
result that is 'practically just' applies also where rescission is sought on the
ground of undue influence."
Following this position of law in a case, it was held that where a party
received nothing under the mortgage which was set aside on the ground of
undue influence, there was nothing for him to make restitution.
Damages for innocent misrepresentation
A person who is the victim of a fraud is entitled to sue for damages,
fraud being a tort also. But the victim of an innocent misrepresentation was
not allowed to recover any compensation for any loss that might have been
occasioned to him by the misrepresentation. Liability in tort for negligent or
innocent misrepresentation is still groaning for recognition. However, much
of the suffering of the victims of innocent misrepresentations have now been
relieved by the (English) Misrepresentation Act, 1967. Section 2 of the Act
provides:
(1) A person who has entered into a contract on account of a misrep-
resentation will have the same right to recover compensation for loss,
if any, caused to him as if the misrepresentation had been made to him
fraudulently. The defendant will not be liable if he had a reasonable
ground to believe and did up to the time of the contract believe that
the facts represented were true.
(2) Where it is alleged in any proceeding that the contract ought to be or
has been rescinded, the court may, instead, declare the contract to be
subsisting and award damages in place of rescission, if it is equitable
to do so.
(3) Provisions in the contract which exclude or restrict liability would be
of no effect, unless they are fair and reasonable in the circumstances
of the case.
The vendor of a property relied on her husband to deal with her business
affairs. The husband stated to the purchaser that to the vendor's knowledge
there was no dispute with any neighbour over boundary. In fact there was
a dispute of this kind, though the husband did not know it. His statement
amounted to an innocent misrepresentation. The purchaser was allowed
rescission and refund of deposit.
He was further entitled under Section 2(1) to an inquiry into damages
suffered arising out of the loss of interest for the period between the date of
deposit and its placement in an interest-earning account.199

Mistake
Definition of "consent" [S. 13]
The provisions of the Contract Act relevant to a study of the effect of
"mistake" upon a contract that the parties have purported to make may be
noted first. Mistake may operate upon a contract in two ways. It may, firstly,
defeat the consent altogether that the parties are supposed to have given,
that is to say, the consent is unreal. Secondly, the mistake may mislead the
parties as to the purpose which they contemplated.
The cases in which the consent is defeated or is rendered unreal fall under
Section 13. This section defines "consent" as follows:
Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same
thing in the same sense.
An agreement upon the same thing in the same sense is known as true
consent or consensus ad idem, and is at the root of every contract.
This seems to have been picked up from a passage¹ in the judgment of
Lord HANNEN in Smith v Hughes. "It is essential to the creation of a con-
tract that both parties should agree to the same thing in the same sense.
Thus if two persons enter into an apparent contract concerning a particular
person or ship, and it turns out that each of them, misled by a similarity
of name, had a different person or ship in mind, no contract would exist
between them: Raffles v Wichelhaus".³
Definition of "mistake"
Where the mistake does not defeat consent, but only misleads the parties,
Section 20 shall apply. This section provides:
1. Central National Bank Ltd v United Industrial Bank Ltd, AIR 1954 SC 181: 1954 SCR 391.
Once "consent" has been proved, it cannot be defeated by application of criminal law. See,
for example, Kaur v Chief Constable, Hampshire, (1981) 1 WLR 578, where it was held that
a mistake as to price induced by wrong marking was not so fundamental as to destroy the
validity of contract of sale.
2. (1871) LR 6 QB 597 (DC).
3. (1864) 2 H&C 906: 159 ER 375. If a thing is not understood by the parties in the same sense,
the agreement would be invalidated at the inception stage itself even if the communication gap
is discovered at a later stage, Tarsem Singh v Sukhminder Singh, (1998) 3 SCC 471: AIR 1998

Definition of "Mistake" 227
Where both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of
fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void.
Explanation.-An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms
the subject-matter of the agreement, is not to be deemed a mistake as to a
matter of fact.
Illustrations
(a) A agrees to sell to B a specific cargo of goods supposed to be on its way from England
to Bombay. It turns out that, before the day of the bargain, the ship conveying the cargo
had been cast away, and the goods lost. Neither party was aware of these facts. The
agreement is void.
(b) A agrees to buy from B a certain horse. It turns out that the horse was dead at the time
of the bargain, though neither party was aware of the fact. The agreement is void.
(c) A, being entitled to an estate for the life of B, agrees to sell it to C. B was dead at the time
of the agreement, but both parties were ignorant of the fact. The agreement is void.
Section 20 will come into play:
(1) when both the parties to an agreement are mistaken,
(2) their mistake is as to a matter of fact, and
(3) the fact about which they are mistaken is essential to the agreement.
Supplementary provisions
Two of these points are further supplemented by Sections 21 and 22.
Section 21 emphasises that mistake should be of fact and not of law.
S. 21. Effect of mistakes as to law. A contract is not voidable because it
was caused by a mistake as to any law in force in India; but a mistake as to a law
not in force in India has the same effect as a mistake of fact.
Illustration
A and B make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred
by the Indian law of limitation; the contract is not voidable.
Section 22 deals with a situation where only one party is mistaken:
S. 22. Contract caused by mistake of one party as to matter of fact.-A
contract is not voidable merely because it was caused by one of the parties to it
being under a mistake as to a matter of fact.
What facts are essential
What facts are essential to an agreement? The answer is naturally linked
with the nature of promise in each case. The plaintiff was a wholesale dealer
under a Rationing Order. He was entitled to transport charges variable
according to distance for collecting goods from Government godowns. He
was paid at the rate applicable to a zone less than 25 miles in distance. The
distance in fact, exceeded 25 miles but both parties were unaware of it. As
soon as the mistake was discovered future payments were made according
to the actual distance. The plaintiff's claim for the arrears up to the time of
rectification was dismissed, the court saying that the mistake did not relate

Page 366
https://t.me/LawCollegeNotes_Stuffs
228 Chapter 6 Mistake
[S. 22]
to an essential fact. Thus essentiality depends upon each case. In the above
case the mistake related to a minor distance. The fact would have become
more important and essential to the contract if a longer distance had been
involved. Speaking broadly, certain facts are essential to every agreement.
They are:
(1) The identity of the parties;
(2) the identity and nature of the subject-matter of the contract; and
(3) the nature and content of the promise itself.
The present study of the effects of mistake proceeds along these lines and
includes the combined effect of Sections 13 and 20.
MISTAKE AS TO IDENTITY
Assumption of false identity
Mistake as to identity occurs where one of the parties represents himself
to be some person other than he really is. Thus, for example, in Jaggan
Nath v Secy of State for India: A person, called S, a brother of the plaintiff,
represented himself as plaintiff, and thereby induced a Government agent to
contract with him.
The court, finding that the Government's agent was deceived by the con-
duct of the plaintiff and his brother as to the person with whom he was deal-
ing, held that there was no valid contract. The defendant's agent intended to
contract only with S's brother and not with S and S knew this.
In the above case, the Government's offer was meant for S and his brother
posing as S accepted it. This prevented real consent. It means that an offer
which is meant for one person cannot be accepted by another.
Mistake caused by takeover of business
In England there is a long line of cases on the subject. In Boulton v Jones
the mistake arose naturally in the course of business.
The plaintiff had taken over the business of one Brocklehurst. The
defendant used to deal with Brocklehurst and not knowing of the change
sent him an order for certain goods. The order was received by the plain-
tiff who sent the goods. The defendant came to know of the change only
when he received an invoice and by that time he had already consumed
the goods. The defendant had a set-off against Brocklehurst and, there-
fore, refused to pay the price. The plaintiff sued him.
Four unanimous judges held the defendant not liable. "Now," said
POLLOCK CB, "the rule of law is clear, that if you propose to make a contract

Mistake as to identity 229
with A, then B cannot substitute himself for A without your consent and
to your disadvantage, securing to himself all the benefit of the contract."
Similarly, BRAMWELL B said: "When anyone makes a contract in which the
personality, so to speak, of the particular party contracted with is impor-
tant, for any reason, whether because it is to write a book or paint a picture
or do any work of personal skill, or whether because there is a set-off due
from that party, no one else is at liberty to step in and maintain that he is
the party contracted with."
Mistake of identity caused by fraud
The principle of this case found further support in Hardman v Booth:
The plaintiffs, meaning to deal with Thomas Gandell & Sons, went
to their office and took an order from a person who represented himself
to be a partner in the firm. He told the plaintiffs that the goods should
be sent in the name of Edward Gandell & Sons. He received the goods,
carried them away and sold them to the defendant, a bona fide buyer. The
plaintiffs sued the defendant to recover their goods.
POLLOCK CB explained the principle thus: "There are some cases in which
it is very clear that there is no contract at all; and the present case seems to
be one of those cases. It is argued that the contract was made personally
with the particular individual who made the communication: it is very true
that the words were uttered by and to him; but what they imported was a
contract with Gandell & Co, the facts being that he was not a member of
the firm, and had no authority to act as their agent, and Gandell & Co,
therefore, were not the buyers; and, consequently, at no time were there two
consenting minds drawn together to the same agreement."
The principle established by this case was affirmed by the House of Lords
in James Cundy v Thomas Lindsay:"
The plaintiffs received orders in writing from a fraudulent man, called
Blenkarn. The order papers had a printed heading: 'Blenkarn & Co,
37 Wood Street'. There was a well-known and respectable firm, named
Blenkiron & Co in the same street. The plaintiff's believing that the
orders had come from this firm, sent a large quantity of handkerchiefs.
Blenkarn received the goods and disposed them of to the defendants, who
acted in good faith. The plaintiffs sued the defendants.
It was held that there was no contract between the plaintiffs and Blenkarn
and, therefore, he had no right to sell the goods. The plaintiffs intended to
contract with Blenkiron & Co and consequently no contract could have
arisen between them and Blenkarn. "Of him they knew nothing, and of
him they never thought. With him they never intended to deal. Their minds

never for an instant of time rested upon him, and as between him and them
there was no consensus of mind which could lead to any agreement or any
contract whatever. As between him and them there was merely one side
to a contract, whereas, in order to produce a contract, two sides would be
required."
Distinction between identity and attributes
A distinction has been made for this purpose between a person's identity
and his attributes and a mistake about the latter has been held not to avoid
the agreement. There can be a mistake of identity only when a person bear-
ing a particular identity exists within the knowledge of the plaintiff, and the
plaintiff intends to deal with him only. If the name assumed by the swindler
is fictitious, there will be no mistake of identity. For instance, in King's
Norton Metal Co Ltd v Edridge, Merrett & Co Ltd:10
A man named Wallis adopted the name of 'Hallam & Co', a non-existent
firm, and by letters placed order for some goods with the plaintiffs who
complied with the order by sending the goods. Wallis sold the goods to
the defendants, who acted in good faith. The plaintiffs sued the defend-
ants for the value of the goods.
The facts of this case were different from those of Cundy v Lindsay as in
that case Blenkiron & Co was a separate entity and the plaintiffs intended
to contract only with it. But in this case there was no separate Hallam &
Co Accordingly the court said: With whom did the plaintiffs contract to sell
the goods? Clearly with the writer of the letters. If it could have been shown
that there was a separate entity called Hallam & Co and another entity
called Wallis then the case might have come within the decision in Cundy
v Lindsay. The contract with Wallis was, therefore, only voidable for fraud
and it could not be disaffirmed after the defendants had acquired the prop-
erty in good faith.
The scope for operative mistake as to identity is further reduced when the
parties are in each other's presence. In Phillips v Brooks Ltd."
A man, called North, entered the plaintiff's shop and selected some
pearls and some rings worth £3000. He produced a cheque book and
wrote out a cheque for the amount. In signing it he said: 'You see who
I am, I am Sir George Bullough and finding on reference to a directory
that Sir George Bullough lived at the address mentioned, the plaintiff
let him have a ring. He promised to come for the other articles after the
cheque was cleared. Before the fraud was discovered he pledged the ring
with the defendants who advanced money bona fide, and without notice.
The plaintiff sued the defendants for the ring or its value.

Mistake as to identity 231
It as held that the plaintiff intended to contract with the person present
before him. HORRIDGE J said: "The following expressions used in the judg-
ment of MORTON CJ12 seems to me to fit the facts in this case: 'The minds
of the parties met and agreed upon all the terms of the sale, the thing sold,
the price and time of payment, the person selling and the person buying.
The fact that the seller was induced to sell by the fraud of the buyer made
the sale voidable, but not void. He could not have supposed that he was sell-
ing to any other person; his intention was to sell to the person present, and
identified by sight and hearing, it does not defeat the sale because the buyer
assumed a false name...'."13
The authority of this case seems to have been considerably shaken by the
decision of the Court of Appeal in Ingram v Little:"
Three ladies, the joint owners of a car, advertised it for sale. A person
called at their house and offered to pay an acceptable price. But, when he
pulled out a cheque book, the ladies told him that the deal was over as
they would not accept a cheque. He then persuaded them to believe that
he was one Hutchinson, a leading businessman, and quoted an address
and a telephone number. On verification of the particulars from a direc-
tory, the ladies gave him the car for a cheque. He resold the car to the
defendant and absconded. The cheque proved worthless and the plaintiffs
sued the defendant for the car or its value.
The defendant was held liable. In the opinion of the court the decision
must depend upon the intention of the ladies. The question was with whom
did they intend to contract, with the man present in their drawing room
or with the real Hutchinson? Did the identity of Hutchinson or the physi-
cal presence of the man in the room preponderate? Can it be said that the
prima facie predominance of the physical presence of the false Hutchinson
identified by sight and hearing was over-borne by the identity of the real
Hutchinson on the facts of the present case? In answer to these questions
the court said that there could be no doubt that the offer which the plaintiffs
made, was one made soley to, and one which was capable of being accepted
only by, the honest Hutchinson. So far as the rogue was concerned there was
no offer made to him and consequently there could be no contract with him.
His right to the car was no more than that of a thief or a finder and he could
not convey a good title to the defendant.15

Where fraud does not lead to mistake of identity
[S. 22]
In the dissenting judgment DEVLIN LJ emphasised the need for a new
approach. In his view cases like these pose a problem of practical justice, and
theoretical considerations such as whether the contract is void or voidable
should not stand in the way of doing practical justice. Why should the title
of the innocent buyer be made to depend on the state of a contract between
third parties? It was this approach that found favour with the Court of
Appeal in Lewis v Averay:1
Lewis, the plaintiff, had a car to sell. A man, described in the judg-
ment as 'rogue', came along and introduced himself as Richard Green, a
famous film actor. He tested and liked the car and offered a cheque. The
plaintiff told him to wait till the cheque was cleared, but when his resist-
ance was broken, he demanded proof of identity. The rogue produced a
special pass of admission to a film studio which showed his photograph
and the official stamp. This convinced the plaintiff and he allowed the car
to be taken away for the cheque. The rogue lost no time in disposing of
the car to an innocent buyer, the defendant. The worthless cheque came
back and the plaintiff sued the defendant to recover his car.
The Court of Appeal held that the car was delivered under a contract
voidable by reason of the fraud and the contract having not been avoided
before the car passed into the hands of an innocent buyer, he acquired a good
title. Lord DENNING felt that the facts of Phillips v Brooks Ltd, Ingram v
Little and those of the present case were indistinguishable and that the
contradictory decisions in these two earlier cases cannot be reconciled. In
each case, his Lordship pointed out, an innocent seller is visited by a rogue,
who by the usual tricks of his trade, convinces that he is a man of standing
and credit and thereby induces the seller to part with his possession for a
cheque. In each case he disposes of the goods to an innocent buyer. Whose
failure has brought about this misfortune upon the two innocent parties?
Should the title of the ultimate buyer be made to depend upon fine questions
as to whether the fraud was committed before or after the contract was
struck, or whether the mistake related to identity as opposed to attributes or
whether the contract was void or voidable? Referring to these needless sub-
tleties Lord DENNING said: "For instance, in Ingram v Little," the majority
of the court suggested that the difference between Phillips v Brooks Ltd 20
and Ingram v Little was that in Phillips v Brooks the contract of sale was
concluded after the rogue made the fraudulent misrepresentation² whereas
in Ingram v Little the rogue made the fraudulent representation before the

Mistake as to identity 233
contract was concluded. My own view is that in each case the property in
the goods did not pass until the seller let the rogue have the goods."
"Again it has been suggested that a mistake as to the identity of a per-
son is one thing; and a mistake as to his attributes is another. A mistake
as to identity, it is said, avoids a contract, whereas a mistake as to attrib-
utes does not. But this is a distinction without a difference. A man's very
name is one of his attributes. It is also a key to his identity. If then, he
gives a false name, is it a mistake as to his identity? Or, a mistake as to his
attributes? These fine distinctions do no good to the law.
As I listened to the arguments in this case, I felt it wrong that an inno-
cent purchaser (who knew nothing of what passed between the seller and
the rogue) should have his title depend on such refinements. After all he
has acted with complete circumspection and in entire good faith; whereas
it was the seller who let the rogue have the goods and thus enabled him to
commit the fraud. I do not therefore accept the theory that a mistake as
to identity renders a contract void."
When the parties are present face to face, the presumption is that the con-
tract is made with the person actually present, even though there is a fraudu-
lent impersonation by the buyer representing himself as a different man than
he is. This approach was heralded by PEARCE LJ and also by DEVLIN LJ in
Ingram v Little, in support of which DEVLIN LJ quoted not only the English
case of Phillips v Brooks Ltd, but also cases in the United States where:22
"The courts hold that if A appeared in person before B, impersonating C, an
innocent purchaser from A gets the property in the goods against B."
PHILLIMORE LJ and MEGAW LJ also subscribed to the view that there
was nothing in the conduct of the plaintiff to overthrow the presumption of
contracting with the person who was present in person.23
Where identity specially important
Where, however, the identity of the other party is of vital importance to
the offeror, a mistake as to identity will prevent an agreement from arising.
Importance of identity must depend upon the nature of the promise in each
case. In Said v Butt24, for example:
The plaintiff knew that on account of his adverse criticism of some
members of a theatre, he would not be allowed to be present at the first
performance of a play at the theatre. A ticket was obtained for him by one
of his friends without disclosing that it was for him. But the defendant,

the banker to issue a draft which was ultimately received by an innocent person and it was
held that the issuing bank must suffer this loss. Citibank N.A. v Brown Shipley & Co Ltd,

the managing director of the theatre, refused him admission on the night.
in question. And the plaintiff sued him for inducing breach of contract.
But it was held that there was no contract between him and the theatre.
"The non-disclosure of the fact that the ticket was bought for the plaintiff
prevented the sale of the ticket from constituting a contract, the identity of
the plaintiff being in the circumstances a material element in the formation
of the contract."
Yet another illustration is Sowler v Potter:25
The defendant was convicted for permitting disorderly conduct in
a cafe. She subsequently assumed a false name and obtained from the
plaintiff a lease of premises in the same neighbourhood with a view to
conducting a restaurant therein. The plaintiff contended that if he had
known her true identity he would never have granted the lease and the
same was therefore void for mistake.
It was held that the consideration of the person with whom the plaintiff
was entering into the lease was a vital element in that agreement so that the
plaintiff having been mistaken with regard to the identity of the defendant,
the lease was void ab initio.
In a German case, a room was booked in a private hotel. When the
plaintiff and his lady arrived, the hotelier discovered that they were affi-
anced but not married. The room was refused. The hotelier was held not
liable for damages for breach of contract: "The defendant, when accepting
the plaintiff's booking, had acted on the assumption that he and his lady
were a married couple, whereas in fact they were not. In view of the defend-
ant's own feelings and the effect which it might have on other guests if they
learned that the defendant rented out double rooms to unmarried couples,
the mistake was a material one and negated consent."
MISTAKE AS TO SUBJECT-MATTER
Another fact essential to every agreement is the identity or quality of the
subject-matter of the contract. Mistake as to subject-matter may take vari-
ous forms.
1. Non-existent subject-matter
In the first place, the subject-matter may have ceased to exist before the
contract was made. This happened in Gustavus Couturier v Robert Hastie:27
The defendant was employed to sell the plaintiff's cargo which was on
voyage. After the defendant had sold the cargo to a third person, it was
discovered that the cargo, having been damaged by bad weather, had

Mistake as to subject-matter 235
been sold at an intermediate port. The buyer repudiated the contract and
the defendant, being a del credere agent was sued for the price.
But he was held not liable. Lord CRANWORTH said: "The contract plainly
imports that there was something which was to be sold at the time of the
contract, and something to be purchased." But as the goods had been totally
lost before the contract was made, the contract was void ab initio (from the
very beginning). On the same principle, the sale of a horse which, unknown
to the parties, was dead at the time of the bargain and the sale of the life
estate of a person who, unknown to parties, was dead at the time of the sale,
would be void.
2. Mistake as to title or rights
"Corresponding to mistake as to the existence of subject-matter is mis-
take in cases where, unknown to the parties, the buyer is already the owner
of that which the seller purports to sell to him. The parties intend to effectu-
ate a transfer of ownership: such a transfer is impossible...."28
In such a case, however, equity only allowed the agreement to be set
aside. This was affirmed by the House of Lords in 1867 in the great case of
Cooper v Phibbs." In that case an uncle had told his nephew, not intending
to misrepresent anything but being in fact in error, that he (the uncle) was
entitled to a fishery, and the nephew, after the uncle's death, acting in the
belief of the truth of what the uncle had told him, entered into an agreement
to rent the fishery from the uncle's daughter, whereas it actually belonged to
the nephew himself. The House of Lords held that the mistake was such as
not only to make the agreement voidable, but also liable to be set aside on
such terms as the court thought fit to impose.
The principle was further explained by the Court of Appeal in Solle v
Buthcher where DENNING LJ stated the position thus:
"All previous decisions on this subject must now be read in the light
of Bell v Lever Bros Ltd". The correct interpretation of that case, to
my mind, is that once a contract has been made, that is to say, once
the parties, whatever their inmost states of mind, have to all outward
appearances agreed with sufficient certainty in the same terms on the
same subject-matter, then the contract is good unless and until it is set
aside for breach of some condition expressed or implied in it, or for fraud,
or on some equitable ground. Neither party can rely on his own mistake
to say it was a nullity from the beginning, no matter that it was a mistake
28. Lord ATKIN in Bell v Lever Bros Ltd, 1932 AC 161, 218 (HL). His Lordship cited Cooper v
Phibbs, (1867) LR 2 HL 149: 16 LT 678 (HL), "where A agreed to take a lease of fishery from
B, though contrary to belief of both parties at the time A was tenant for life of the fishery and
B appears to have had no title at all". The agreement was set aside. But the decision is criticised
by his Lordship.

which to his mind was fundamental, and no matter that the other party
knew he was under a mistake. A fortiori if the other party did not know
the mistake, but shared it."
In this case:
A landlord carried out repairs to a house which was with a tenant on
a standard rent fixed in 1939. The tenant expressed the opinion that after
the reconstruction the standard rent would not be applicable. If it was
applicable the landlord could have increased it by notice to the tenant
by taking into account the costs of improvement. Without giving such
notice the tenancy was renewed in favour of the tenant for seven years on
the increased rent. The tenant paid the increased rent for some time and
then started proceedings for restoring the original rent and for recovering
overpaid rent.
The court held that the standard rent was still applicable and the plaintiff
was prevented from giving notice by the misrepresentation made by the ten-
ant. It was liable to be set aside, but was not a nullity from the very begin-
ning. "The parties agreed in the same terms on the same subject-matter. It is
true that the landlord was under a mistake which was to him fundamental.
But whether it was his own mistake or a mistake common both to him and
the tenant, it is not a ground for saying that the lease was from the begin-
ning a nullity." His Lordship further pointed out that what the tenant said
was not merely an expression of opinion but an unambiguous statement as
to private rights and a misrepresentation as to private rights is equivalent to
a misrepresentation of fact for this purpose.
This opinion has been expressly disapproved by the Court of Appeal in
Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd.32 The
court applied the ruling in Bell v Lever Bros Ltd³3 to the facts of the case.
The facts and decision in the Great Peace case have been discussed under
the ruling in Bell case.
No contract would follow where though the buyer is not owner, the ven-
dor also does not have the right to sell and the parties have mistakenly
believed that he has the right. Where a vendor purported to sell all his
rights in a land, including the rights to mine minerals, the agreement was
held void when it was subsequently found that the vendor's rights simply did
not include the right to mine. Without this right the land was worthless for
the buyer whose only object was to work the mines.35 A mistake of this kind
must be reasonable in the circumstances. Where, for example, "the position
was too notorious and well-known to all concerned in the locality that the

Mistake as to subject-matter 237
tenants of an estate, which was the subject-matter of sale, had the right to
sell Tendu leaves to whomsoever they pleased", the buyer's ignorance of this
right was not reasonable and consequently the contract was valid. In a case
before the Bombay High Court:37
C mortgaged the property of his brother L.M. fraudulently represent-
ing himself to be L.M. The defendant, who was the mortgagee trans-
ferred his interest to the plaintiff. The plaintiff insisted that the owner of
the property should join the transfer and C again committing the same
fraud, executed the transfer. On discovering the fraud, the plaintiff sued
the defendant for the return of the purchase money.
It was held that he must succeed. "Both the parties being in the belief
that the real owner had joined in the transfer were under a mistake of fact
essential to the agreement which was, therefore, avoided under Section 20."
3. Different subject-matters in mind
Where the parties, due to a reasonable mistake of fact, have different
subject-matters in mind, the agreement will be void for want of true consent.
As, for example, in Raffles v Wichelhaus:38
The defendant bought of the plaintiff a quantity of Surat Cotton "to
arrive ex Peerless from Bombay". Two ships with the name Peerless sailed
from Bombay, one in October, which the defendant had in mind and the
other in December which the plaintiff had in mind.
The court said: "the defendant meant one Peerless and the plaintiff
another. That being so, there was no consensus ad idem and therefore no
binding contract."
Where the buyer believed that the land was being sold at the stated price
per bigha and the seller thought the price was applicable per kanal, it was
held that there was no agreement on the matter of an essential fact and,
therefore, no contract.39
4. Mistake as to substance of subject-matter
Another kind of mistake as to subject-matter may relate to its substance,
nature or quality. The parties may be mistaken as "to the existence of some
fact or facts forming an essential and integral element of the subject-matter."40

[S. 22]
The decision of the Privy Council in Seikh Bros Ltd v Ochsner," on appeal
from Kenya and decided under Section 20 of the Indian Contract Act, pro-
vides an instructive illustration.
The appellant-company, the lessor of a forest in Kenya, granted a
licence to the respondent to cut, process and manufacture all sisal grow-
ing in the forest. The respondent, in return, undertook to manufacture
and deliver to the appellant 50 tons of sisal fibre per month. But it turned
out that the leaf potential of the sisal area was not sufficient to permit the
manufacture of the stipulated quantity and the respondent was sued for
the breach.
The agreement was held to be void. Their Lordships, relying upon the
statements in Bell v Lever Bros Ltd, came to the conclusion that "having
regard to the nature of the contract, which was a kind of joint adventure,
it was the very basis of the contract that the sisal area should be capable of
producing an average of 50 tons a month throughout the term of the licence,
and the mistake was as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement”. 43
On the same principle an agreement for the sale of land was held void
as, unknown to the parties, the land had been notified for acquisition at the
time of the contract." An agreement to compromise a suit already decided
in favour of the plaintiff, but unknown to the parties, is void for the same
reason. The acquisition of a land, which is the subject-matter of a sale,
after the contract is made will not upset the contract, 46 so also a contract
for the sale of goods on certain price cannot be avoided by the seller on the
ground that a new excise tax has made the goods dearer and the buyer is
unwilling to pay the extra price. This will be so even if the parties have
made the bargain in the expectation that there will be no upward revision of
taxes.48 Where the expectations of the parties are frustrated by subsequent
events, their contract may fall under Section 56 but cannot be declared void
ab initio under Section 20.49 In such cases there is no mistake as to existing
facts. The distinction was emphasised by the Calcutta High Court" in a
case where a contract was entered into upon the assumption that the Jute
Control Order, which was due to expire, would be continued and extended,
but it was not extended. Rejecting the plea of mistake, HARRIES CJ observed
as follows: "The difference between a mistake as to an existing fact and a
mistake as to a future occurrence is clear and the consequences are very

different. A mistake as to an existing fact will render the contract void ab
initio. In short, if the parties have entered into a contract upon such a mis-
take, there is and never has been any contract at all between them. On the
other hand, if the mistake is as to some future event, a binding contract is
entered into between the parties. The contract may be avoided or rescinded
at some future date if the expected event does or does not happen."
The fact about which the parties are mistaken must be "essential" to their
agreement. A mistake as to a collateral fact, which leaves the subject-matter
substantially what it was supposed by the parties to be, does not negative
the contract. Thus the lease of a mining estate which was known by reputa-
tion to measure 100 bighas was not regarded as void on discovering that the
area was actually less. "The exact area of 100 bighas more or less was not
essential for the colliery purpose for which agreement was arrived at and,
therefore, there was no common mistake with regard to an essential fact."
Similarly, a contract for the sale of goods "to arrive by a certain ship" is
not void, if the ship does not bring the goods. Since, land acquired under
statutory power cannot be divested in favour of any person, much less in
favour of the person from whom it was acquired, any such divesting under
mistaken notion of the rights was held to be void. The agreement was also
opposed to public policy." Handing over by Zila Parishad of the right to
collect fee to the highest bidder was held to be against law."4
52
A road builder, while tendering, calculated his costs on the basis that
necessary material would be available from a nearby quarry. But that turned
to be wrong. He had to go to more distant quarry. That cost him more. The
court said that this was not a mistake which would enable him to avoid the
contract. A special clause in the contract carried a provision that the con-
tractor had to make his own arrangement for obtaining material.5
Mistake as to quality of subject-matter as distinguished from substance
A mistake as to the quality of the subject-matter as distinguished from
its substance may not render the agreement void. Smith v Hughes" is well-
known for this distinction between quality and substance.

The defendant wanted to buy old oats for his horses. The plaintiff
showed him the sample of the oats he had, but said nothing about their
age. The defendant kept the sample for twenty-four hours and then placed
an order for the oats. After a portion of them was delivered to him he
found that they were new and, therefore, rejected them on the ground
that he was mistaken about their quality.
But the court could find no ground entitling the buyer to reject. COCKBURN
CJ summed up by saying: "All that can be said is that the two minds were
not ad idem as to the age of the oats; they certainly were ad idem as to the
sale and purchase of them."57
The effect of mistake as to quality was further explained by the House
of Lords in Bell v Lever Bros Ltd 58 where Lord ATKIN said: "Mistake as to
quality of the thing contracted for raises more difficult questions. In such a
case a mistake will not affect assent unless it is the mistake of both parties,
and is as to existence of some quality which makes the thing without the
quality essentially different from the thing as it was believed to be." The
facts of the case were as follows:
Lever Bros. appointed one Bell as a managing director for five years on
an annual salary of £8000 to manage one of their subsidiaries in Africa.
Much before the expiry of this term his services had to be dispensed with
on account of the merger of the subsidiary with a third company. Bell
agreed to retire on a compensation of £30,000. After this sum was paid,
it was discovered that during his term of service, Bell had made secret
profits and was, therefore, guilty of breach of duty which entitled the
company to dismiss him without compensation. The company, therefore,
claimed the return of the money on the ground inter alia that it was paid
under a mutual mistake of fact.
But their action failed. It was held by a majority "that the mutual mis-
take related not to the subject-matter, but to the quality of the service con-
tract". The plaintiffs contended that they agreed to pay compensation on the
assumption that the service contract was one which could not be terminated.
without compensation, whereas the true fact was that the defendant could
have been dismissed without compensation. Referring to this contention,
Lord ATKIN said: "I have come to the conclusion that it would be wrong
to decide that an agreement to terminate a definite specified contract is void
if it turns out that the agreement had already been broken and could have
been terminated otherwise. The contract of release is the identical contract
in both cases, and the party paying for release gets exactly what he bargains
for. It seems immaterial that he could have got the same result in another
way, or that if he had known the true facts he would not have entered into

the bargain." The mistake was mutual as the jury found that at the time of
negotiating the compensation agreement the defendant had not in mind his
breaches of duty."
This ruling was applied by the Court of Appeal in Great Peace Shipping
Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd. In this case two vessels were
hired to reach for a stricken vessel to save the life of its crew. It was believed
at the time of the contract that the two vessels were in close proximity to
each other, located at a distance of 35 miles. Unknown to both the parties,
the two vessels were at a distance of 410 miles and it would have taken
39 hours for the rescue vessels to reach the stricken vessel. The defendants
looked for other vessels which they got and they cancelled the contract. This
was held to be a breach of the contract. The defence of mistake failed. The
court said that the mistake as to the distance between the two vessels had
not rendered the services that the distant vessel was able to provide some-
thing essentially different from those which the parties had agreed. The ves-
sel would have arrived in time to provide several days of escort service. The
fact that the vessels were further apart than both the parties had appreciated
did not mean that it was impossible to perform the contractual venture.
In a sale of table napkins under a mistake that they were of historic value,
it has been suggested that the transaction could be regarded in two ways:
"1. The parties have intended to buy and sell table-linen: in this case a
mistake as to its age or value would be irrelevant--it would be a mistake
as to quality and therefore not an operative mistake.
2. The parties may have intended to buy and sell a Carolean relic, i.e., a
mistake as to substance; in that case their mistake would be fundamental
and make the contract void."63
Misapprehension as to parties' respective rights
The Court of Appeal has reiterated in Magee v Pennine Insurance Co
Ltd that a common misapprehension either as to facts or as to the parties'
relative and respective rights will not make the contract void but only void-
able provided that the misapprehension was fundamental and that the party
seeking to set aside was not himself at fault. The facts of the case were:
The plaintiff bought a car for his 18-year-old son. The son had a provi-
sional driving licence. The proposal form for the insurance of the car was
filled by the manager of the firm from where the car was bought and he
happened to state that the plaintiff had a provisional driving licence when
in fact he had none. The son made an accident and the plaintiff claimed

The agreement of compromise was entered into under the common and
fundamental mistake that the original policy was valid and binding, when
in fact it was voidable for the misstatement. In Bell v Lever Bros, the origi-
nal contract of employment was supposed by the parties to be binding when
in fact it was terminable for the breaches of duty. The only difference was
that in Bell the compromise amount had already been paid. The Court of
Appeal held that the agreement was liable to be set aside on the ground that
the parties were mistaken as to a fundamental assumption.
In another similar case before the Court of Appeal after a contract had
been made for the purchase of a property at a relatively high price because
of its suitability for occupation and redevelopment, the property was listed
by the State as being of architectural or historic interest. The purchaser
sought to avoid the contract on the ground of common mistake because
unknown to the parties at the time of the contract the property was already
under consideration for the purpose of listing. But he was not allowed to
do so. The property was listed only after the contract had already been
signed. No relief was allowed under the doctrine of frustration also. Listing
was an inherent risk, of which every purchaser should be regarded as being
aware. The plaintiffs had been aware that the risk existed and it was a risk
they had to bear. It could not therefore be said that the performance of the
contract that would be called for would, in consequence of the listing, be
radically different from that which had been undertaken by the parties. The
principle would, therefore, seem to be that a contract is void ab initio if its
subject-matter is essentially and radically different from what both contract-
ing parties believed it to be, provided that the party relying on the mistake
has reasonable grounds for his mistaken belief."
To the same effect is the decision of the Supreme Court in Kalyanpur
Lime Works Ltd v State of Bihar:67
The State of Bihar granted the lease of a hill to one K. Co for quar-
rying limestone. The lease was not assignable to anyone else without the
approval of the Government. K. Co went into liquidation and its liquida-
tor assigned the lease to another without the approval of the State. This
provoked the State to forfeit the lease and to offer it to the plaintiffs for
a period of 20 years. K. Co started proceedings against the forfeiture
and the same was held by the Privy Council to be invalid. K. Co was

mistake as to the existence of a sewer.

restored to its lease and vacated after the expiry of its full term, that is
after about 11 years. The plaintiffs now claimed the lease in terms of the
agreement made before the forfeiture was declared to be invalid. But the
Government allotted the same to another person and the plaintiff started
the present proceedings. The Supreme Court held that the agreement was
not void by reason of any mistake. The Government had the right to for-
feit and to re-allot. The forfeiture having been declared void, its right was
not wholly gone; it was restricted only by reason of the lease which had
still several years to run. In these circumstances it might have been open
to the plaintiffs to repudiate the contract if they so liked, but the defend-
ant could not certainly plead that the contract was void on the ground of
mistake and refuse to perform that part of the agreement which it was
possible for it to perform.
Similarly, where the Government allotted certain plots assuming that the
sitting tenants would vacate them, but they refused to oblige, it was held by
the Allahabad High Courts that "Section 20 does not apply to a case where
the contracting parties have made no mistake as to any fact existing at the
making of the contract and it is complained that one of them is unable to
carry out his part of the contract on account of the unexpected refusal of a
third person to carry out his obligation under another agreement."
MISTAKE AS TO NATURE OF PROMISE
The principle is well established by authorities that when a deed of one
character is executed under the mistaken impression that it is of a different
character, then it is wholly void and inoperative. 69 Thus where a gift deed is
signed under the impression that it is only a power of attorney, the deed is
inoperative. If a mistake of this kind is common to both parties, the agree-
ment is void under Section 20, the parties being mistaken about the very
nature of the promise. But more frequently a mistake of this kind is brought
about by the fraud of one party. One of the parties, being under a duty to do
so, fails to disclose to the other the true nature of the document and thereby
induces him to sign the same under the belief that he is signing some other
instrument of a different nature. In such a case there is no real agreement
as the consent is nullified by the mistake. This distinction has been thus
indorsed by the Supreme Court:"1 "Though a contract or other transaction
induced by fraud is not void, but only voidable at the option of the party

defrauded, there is a clear distinction between fraudulent misrepresentation
as to the character of the document as opposed to its contents. While in the
former case the transaction is void, in the latter it is only voidable."
There is not the type of "consent" as is required by Section 13. In a case
of this kind before the Patna High Court:
The plaintiff appointed the defendant to look after his cultivation
and his affairs, as he had become too old to manage them himself. The
defendant asked him to grant him a lease of his land. The plaintiff agreed
to it and placed his thumb-impression upon a deed which was in fact a
gift of the land.
The court held the deed to be void ab initio.
In a similar case before the Madhya Pradesh High Court," an illiterate
lady who was the owner of farming land generally consulted her uterine
brother on all important matters. Once, finding that some strangers were
occupying her lands, she approached her brother, who advised that an appli-
cation should be made to the Collector. He took her to the Collector's office
and obtained her thumb-impressions upon some blank papers. These were
then registered as sale deeds in the name of some persons. On discovering
her mistake she challenged the transaction and obtained an order that the
transaction was void and that she was still the owner of her lands. The court
said: "There is a clear distinction between a fraudulent misrepresentation
as to the character of a document and as to its contents. Where the misrep-
resentation is as to the character of the document, the transaction is wholly
void."
This distinction was developed by the Supreme Court in Ningawwa v
Byrappa Shiddappa Hireknrabar" following the principle enunciated in
Foster v Mackinnon." Following these rulings again in another case of the
same kind, where an illiterate woman was called upon by her son-in-law and
his brothers to put her thumb-impression upon two stamp-papers telling her
that she was thereby gifting her agricultural land to her daughter, who was
her only child and one of the papers was a sale deed to them by which they
became the registered owners of the land, the Supreme Court held that the
document was a nullity by reason of the fraudulent misrepresentation as to
its character,
An agreement to pay money in final settlement under a contract of insur-
ance in which there were false statements has been held by the Court of
Appeal to be voidable at the option of the insurance company."

Mistake as to nature of promise 245
Where the contract fails to express parties' intention
Where an agreement as finally made fails to express or embody the agree-
ment between the parties as originally made, it can be had rectified so as to
bring it in accord with the intention of the parties. An easy illustration is the
decision of the Court of Appeal in Hartog v Colin and Sheilds:"
The defendants contracted to sell to the plaintiff 3000 Argentine hare
skins, but by a mistake they offered the goods at so much per pound
instead of so much per piece. The price per piece was roughly one-third
that of a pound. The negotiations preceding the agreement took place
on the basis of price per piece and that was also the usual practice of the
trade. The buyers sued for the goods.
SINGLETON LJ felt satisfied "that it was a mistake on the part of the
defendants which caused the offer to go forward in that way, and I am sat-
isfied that anyone with any knowledge of the trade must have realised that
there was a mistake. ... The offer was wrongly expressed, and the defend-
ants by their evidence, and by the correspondence, have satisfied me that the
plaintiff could not have reasonably supposed that the offer contained the
offeror's real intention."
If relief of this kind was not allowed the result would be that one party
would take an unconscentious advantage of the mistake of the other known
to him. The Calcutta High Court followed this principle in granting relief
in New India Rubber Works (P) Ltd v Oriental Fire & General Insurance
Co Ltd:79
A policy of insurance, which had expired, covered risks arising out
of fire, riot and strike. The company sent a renewal form to the assured
showing the premium for the above risks. The assured sent lesser amount
being equal to cover the fire risk only. The company issued a policy in
usual terms covering the risks of fire, riot and strike. The factory was
destroyed by fire due to riot. The company contended that in so far as
the policy purported to cover the risk of riot and strike, it was void for
mistake.
It was held that the company was entitled to raise this defence. The court
considered the principles of equity under which documents executed under
mistake are allowed to be rectified and that in reference to an insurance
policy such rectification would be possible even after the loss has occurred
because equity treats as done that which ought to have been done. The court
then considered the effect of Section 26 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, which
provides that an instrument can be rectified if through fraud or a mutual
mistake of the parties, the contract does not express their real intention. The
wrong marking was not so fundamental as to destroy the validity of the contract of sale, but
merely rendered it voidable.

246 Chapter 6 Mistake
[S. 22]
court held that where on account of an error on the part of a party a written
document fails to express their common intention it will be a case of mutual
mistake. The court further pointed out that the defence of mutual mistake
can be raised even where the document has become redundant by reason of
the occurrence of the loss and there is nothing left to be rectified, for other-
wise the assured will be allowed to take the advantage of a mistake which
if pointed out would have been rectified at the proper time. The court relied
upon its own earlier decision where the defendant was allowed to seek the
rectification of a conveyance in which he by mistake happened to include his
homestead when that was not the intention of the parties.
81
The principles relating to this matter have recently been re-examined by
the Court of Appeal in Joselyne v Nissen, where the court cited a passage
from an earlier judgment, wherein it was observed that "it is not sufficient
to show that the written instrument does not represent their common inten-
tion unless positively also one can show what their common intention was".
The facts of the case were:
The plaintiff, who shared a house with his daughter, proposed that
she should take over his car-hire business. It was made clear in the very
early stage of negotiations that if the proposal was accepted, the daughter
should pay all the household expenses, including the electricity, gas and
coal bills due in respect of the part of the house occupied by her father.
The written contract which followed from these discussions, however,
failed to impose any liability on the daughter in respect of the household
charges. After honouring the oral agreement for some time, she refused
to meet the expenses although she continued to draw the profits of the
business.
The plaintiff was held entitled to rectification so as specifically to impose
that liability on the daughter. One of the difficulties was the remarks of
DENNING LJ in an earlier case, 83 to the effect that mere common intention is
not sufficient, it must have found expression in an outward agreement. He
said: "There could be no certainty at all in business transactions if a party.
who had entered into a firm contract could afterwards turn round and claim
to have it rectified on the ground that the parties intended something differ-
ent. He is allowed to prove if he can, that they agreed something different."
Referring to this passage RUSSEL LJ commented that if this means to sug-
gest that an antecedent concluded contract is necessary, it would be contrary
to the views in Crane v Hegeman Harris Co Inc. The view supported by

other judgments is that there should be a convincing proof of an outward
expression of accord.
Centrovincial's solicitors invited Merchant Investors to agree to the
appropriate rental value of £65,000 per annum at the review date of 25
December 1982 which should have read £12,600 but Merchant Investors
were not aware of the mistake. Merchant Investors agreed to the figure of
£65,000 per annum. Centrovincial contended that no contract was formed
because of mistake and Merchant Investors contended that a contract had
been formed. It was held that it is a well-established principle that ordinar-
ily an offer, where unequivocally accepted according to its precise terms,
will give rise to a legally binding agreement as soon as acceptance is com-
municated to the offeror and cannot thereafter be revoked without the
consent of the other party. Although the law is concerned with the objec-
tive appearance as well as the actual fact of agreement, if the intention
of the parties is clear then their intention will prevail over any objective
appearance.
86
Where neither party had disclosed his intention as to the effect of the
agreement but coincidentally both entertained the same thought as to the
effect of their bargain, it was held that such undisclosed intention was
irrelevant for the purposes of interpretation of their contract. It is neces-
sary that each party should know what is agreed at the time the contract is
made.
Documents mistakenly signed or non est factum
The defence of non est factum enables a person who has signed a contract
to say that it is not his document because he signed it under some mistake.
It was evolved by the courts to relieve illiterate or blind people from the
effect of a contract which they could not read and which was not properly
explained to them. But subsequently it was extended to others. This exten-
sion occurred through the judgment of BYLES J in Foster v Mackinnon:
"It seems plain, on principle and on authority, that, if a blind man,
or a man who cannot read, or who for some reason (not implying negli-
gence) forbears to read, has a written contract falsely read over to him,
the reader misreading it to such a degree that the written contract is of a
nature altogether different from the contract pretended to be read from
the paper which the blind or illiterate man afterwards signs; then, at least
if there be no negligence, the signature so obtained is of no force. And it
is invalid not merely on the ground of fraud, where fraud exists but on
the ground that the mind of the signer did not accompany the signature;

in other words, that he never intended to sign and therefore in contempla-
tion of law never did sign, the contract to which his name is appended."
The learned judge did not make any distinction between mistake as to the
nature or character of the contract as opposed to its terms, for in a later part
of his judgment he said: "But the position that, if a grantor or covenantor be
deceived or misled as to the actual contents of the deed, the deed does not
bind him, is supported by many authorities."90
The facts of the case were that a person was induced to sign the back.
of a paper, the face of which was not shown to him, and he was told that
it was an ordinary guarantee the like of which he had signed before and
under which no liability came to him, when, in fact, the paper was a bill
of exchange and he was sued by a holder in due course as an indorser.
The court held that "the defendant never intended to sign that contract
or any such contract. He never intended to put his name to any instrument
that then was or thereafter might become negotiable. He was deceived not
merely as to the legal effect, but as to the actual contents of the document.
It was as if he had written his name on a sheet of paper for the purpose of
franking a letter, or in a lady's album, or on an order for admission to the
Temple Church, or on the flyleaf of a book, and there had already been,
without his knowledge, a bill of exchange or a promissory note payable to
order inscribed on the other side of the paper."
The principle of this case has been with some qualification affirmed by
the House of Lords in Gallie v Lee."
Mrs G, a widow, then aged seventy-eight years, wanted to help her
trusted nephew and intended to transfer to him her house on the condi-
tion that he was to permit her to reside there for the rest of her life and
she handed the title deeds to him. The nephew came to her with one Lee
and Lee told her to sign a document saying that it was a deed of gift to the
nephew and everything was in order. She had broken her spectacles so she
could not read. She put her signature which was witnessed by her nephew.
The document was an assignment in favour of Lee. He mortgaged the
house with the building society and, having defaulted in payment, the
society claimed possession. She pleaded non est factum.
The House of Lords, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, held
that she was bound by the contract. It was only voidable by reason of the
misstatements made by Lee, but it was too late to avoid once the building
society had advanced a sum of money on the house in good faith. In her
own statements to the court she said that she thought that her nephew and
Lee would raise money on the house and that she would do anything to
help her nephew. She was not, therefore, mistaken about the character of
90. See Edwards v Brown, (1863) 2 H&C 175: 9 LJ (OS) Ex 84.

the document. The only thing was that it was put to a use which she did not
expect. Relying on this evidence in the Court of Appeal SALMON LJ felt that
she would have executed the assignment to Mr Lee even if the transaction
had been properly explained to her. Lord DENNING MR reached the same
conclusion but was not prepared to be fettered by the distinction between
character and contents. But Lord HODSON was not prepared to accept this
rejection of a principle which is supported by authorities and is sound in
principle. "The distinction is a valid one in that it emphasises that points of
detail in the contents of a document are not to be relied on in support of a
plea of non est factum. Lord DENNING MR did, however, demonstrate that
using the words as terms of art for test purposes may produce ludicurous
results; e.g., a mistake as to the amount of money involved may be described
as a mistake as to contents although the difference between two figures may
be so great as to produce a document of an entirely different character from
the one the signer intended."
His Lordship further pointed out that the plea of non est factum, requires
clear and positive evidence before it can be established, and cited with
approval the statement of DENOVAN LJ that "the plea of non est factum
is a plea which must necessarily be kept within narrow limits". To take an
example, the man who in the course of his business signs a pile of documents
without checking them takes the responsibility for them by appending his
signature. It would be surprising if he was to be allowed to repudiate one of
those documents on the ground of non est factum. The person signing has
to take care.93
Lord WILBERFORCE emphasised that the law in this respect must retain
flexibility because it has to reconcile two conflicting objectives: relief to a
signer whose consent is genuinely lacking; and protection to innocent third
party who have acted on an apparently regular and properly executed docu-
ment. Trying to work out the principles on which the plea of non est factum
should be admissible, his Lordship said: "In my opinion, a document should
be held to be void (as opposed to voidable) only when the element of consent
to it is totally lacking, i.e. more concretely, when the transaction, which the
document purports to effect is essentially different in substance or in kind
from the transaction intended. Many other expressions, or adjectives could
be used basically', or 'radically' or 'fundamentally"."
His Lordship then added three qualifications to the principle. Firstly, in
the case of fraud, the principle of Foster v Mackinnon will apply and the
transaction would be void. Secondly, a man cannot escape from the conse-
quences, as regards innocent third parties, of signing a document, if being

93. The Supreme Court has similarly laid down in Bihar State Electricity Board v Green Rubber
Industries, (1990) 1 SCC 731: AIR 1990 SC 699 that a person who signs a document which
contains contractual terms is normally bound by them though he had not read them or was
ignorant of precise legal effects.

[S. 22]
a man of ordinary education and competence, he chooses to sign it without
informing himself of its purports and effect. Thirdly, there is the case where
the signer has been careless, in not taking ordinary precautions against
being deceived.94
Commenting on this case it is observed in CHITTY ON CONTRACTS: "The
law on this subject was completely reviewed and restated by the House of
Lords in Saunders v Anglia Building Society" and the distinction between
the character or nature of a document and the contents of the document was
rejected as unsatisfactory. It was stressed that the defence of non est factum
was not lightly to be allowed where a person of full age and capacity had
signed a written document containing contractual terms. But it was never-
theless held that in exceptional circumstances the plea was available so long
as the person signing the document had made a fundamental mistake as to
the character or effect of the document. Their Lordships appeared to have
concentrated on the disparity between the effect of the document actually
signed and the document as it was believed to be rather than on the nature
of the mistake, stressing that the disparity must be 'radical', 'essential', 'fun-
damental' or 'very substantial"."
The Supreme Court of India considered the principle of Foster v
Mackinnon in Ningawwa v Byrappa Shiddappa Hirekurabar" and con-
cluded on the facts that where a husband obtained the signature of his wife
to a gift deed without making any misrepresentation as to its character, but
subsequently included two more plots in the deed, the transaction was only
voidable and not void.
The Supreme Court did not approve the finding of the arbitrator that the
signature was mistakenly affixed on the document and therefore not bind-
ing. The court said that when a person signs a document, the presumption
is that he has read the document properly and understood it and only then
affixed his signature unless there is a proof of force or fraud. Such a pre-
sumption is stronger in the case of businessmen. There was no allegation of
force or fraud in the present case.⁹8

Limitations 251
[S. 22]
1. Mistake of both parties
Under Section 20 an agreement is void by reason of mistake when both
parties are mistaken as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement. This
is further supplemented by the declaration in Section 22 that "a contract is
not voidable merely because it was caused by one of the parties to it being
under a mistake as to matter of fact". Thus, where the Government sold by
auction the right of fishery and the plaintiff offered the highest bid under
the impression that the right was sold for three years, when in fact it was for
one year only, he could not avoid the agreement because it was his unilateral
mistake. As to what is the nature of a unilateral mistake as provided under
Section 22 of the Contract Act, would be best explained by the case of Haji
Abdul Rahman Allarakhia v Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Co.100
There the plaintiffs chartered a steamer which was to sail from Jedda on
"10th August, 1892 (fifteen days after the Haj)". The plaintiffs believed that
"10th August, 1892" corresponded with the fifteenth day after the Haj. The
defendant had no such belief and contracted only with respect to the English
date, viz., "10th August, 1892". The plaintiffs subsequently discovered that
their belief was mistaken inasmuch as fifteen days after Haj fell on a differ-
ent day and on the basis of that they sued the defendants for rectification
of the charterparty. The court held that it was a unilateral mistake and the
plaintiffs were not entitled to any relief. Similarly, where a tenderer, in calcu-
lating the price which he wanted to charge, happened, by mistake, to insert
wrong figures, and the authority accepted the tender without knowing the
mistake, no rectification was allowed.101
It should, however, be borne in mind that where the mistake, even if
it is of one party only, has the effect of nullifying consent as defined in
Section 13, no contract will arise. There is no real consent where mistake
prevents the parties from coming to an agreement upon the same thing in
the same sense. For an agreement to be avoided on the basis of unilateral
mistake, it must be shown: first, that one party erroneously believed that the
document sought to be rectified contained a particular term or provision, or
possibly did not contain a particular term or provision which, mistakenly,
it did not contain; second, that the other party was aware of the omission.
or the inclusion and that it was due to a mistake on the part of one party;
third, that the party who was aware of the mistake omitted to draw the
mistake to the notice of the other party and there must be a fourth element
involved, namely, that the mistake must be one calculated to benefit one
party. Applying these principles to the facts of the case in Thomas Bates

was prepared by the landlord did not contain that provision without the
knowledge of the landlord and though the lessee was aware of the omission
he did not draw it to the attention of the landlord, the landlord was entitled
to seek rectification of the document for inserting arbitration clause.
The mistake of both parties of which Section 20 speaks may be either
common or mutual. The classification of mistakes in terms of "common",
"mutual" and "unilateral" is adopted by Cheshire and Fifoot, THE LAW OF
CONTRACT. The expression "common mistake" is thus explained in this
learned work: "In common mistake both parties make the same mistake.
Each knows the intention of the other and accepts, but each is mistaken
about some underlying and fundamental fact. The parties, for example, are
unaware that the subject-matter of their contract has already perished."103
Common mistake will definitely render the agreement void if the parties
are mistaken about the existence of the subject-matter. This type of mistake
occurred in Couturier v Hastie 104 where the subject-matter unknown to the
parties was extinct at the time of the agreement; in Strikland v Turneros
payment of annuity upon the life of a person who was already dead; in
Pritchard v Merchants and Tradesmen Mutual Life Assurance Society,"
where a premium was paid for the revival of a lapsed policy at a time when
the assured was already dead; in Galloway v Galloway,107 where the parties
made a separation deed under the mistaken assumption that they were in
fact married.
106
The scope of this kind of mistake as to the validity of the contract has
been considerably reduced since the decision of the House of Lords in Bell v
Lever Bros Ltd¹08 and its interpretation by DENNING LJ in Solle v Butcher.109
Its operation has been growingly confined to cases where the subject-matter
does not exist or is vitally different in character (as opposed to quality) than
what it was supposed by the parties to be. Thus in McRae v Commonwealth
Disposals Commission,110 the defendants were not allowed to escape from
the consequences of selling a ship supposed to be stranded at a described
place when the plaintiff discovered at a considerable expense that there was
no such ship. The court cited DENNING LJ in Solle v Butcher to the effect:
"Neither party can rely on his own mistake to say it was a nullity from
the beginning." DENNING LJ reinforced his views in Leaf v International
103. LAW OF CONTRACT (8th Edn, 1972) 202. M. Rathnam v Susheelamma, AIR 2009 Kant 79,
both parties thought that Development Authority's letter of allotment was equivalent to title
to the property and they entered into sale transaction. The sale was held to be void because
the allottee was not at the time the owner.

Gallories. A picture was sold, the seller representing that it was by John
Constable, when it turned out to be different. The picture was thus essen-
tially different from what it was supposed to be, yet the contract was held
to be only voidable. In a still subsequent case Frederick E. Rose (London)
Ltd v William H. Pim. Junior & Co Ltd,113 where the parties were confused.
between "horsebeans" and "feveroles", DENNING LJ explained the effect of
common mistake in these words: "What is the effect in law of this common
mistake on the contract between the plaintiff and defendant? I am clearly
of opinion that the contract was not a nullity. It is true that both parties
were under a mistake and that mistake was of a fundamental character with
regard to the subject-matter. The goods contracted for-horsebeans-were
essentially different from what they were believed to be-'feveroles'-Ne
vertheless, the parties to all outward appearances were agreed. They had
agreed with the quite sufficient certainty on a contract for the sale of goods
by description, namely horsebeans."
The expression "mutual mistake" is thus defined in the same work:114
"In mutual mistake, the parties misunderstand each other and are at
cross-purposes. A, for example, intends to offer his Ford Cortina car for
sale, but B believes that the offer relates to the Ford Zephyr also owned by
A." Raffles v Wichelhauss involved a mistake of this kind.116
2. Erroneous opinion about value of subject matter
The explanation to Section 20 provides that "an erroneous opinion as
to the value of the thing which forms the subject-matter of the agreement
is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact". In a case before the
Travancore-Cochin High Court:117
A property which was subject to a subsisting lease was sold. The lessee
had the right to receive value of the improvements, but the agreement of
sale was silent about this. The buyer wanted to have the agreement set
aside on the ground of mistake about this right.
But the court held "that there was no mistake and that even if there was a
mistake it was not as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement for sale.
It could only be an erroneous opinion which the parties had formed as to the
real value of the subject-matter and would not be deemed to be a mistake
vitiating the agreement."

3. Mistake of fact and not of law
[S. 22]
Mistake should be of fact and not of law, for Section 21 declares that "a
contract is not voidable because it is caused by a mistake as to any law in
force in India". The section carries an illustration:
A and B make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a par-
ticular debt is barred by the Indian Law of Limitation; the contract is not
voidable.
A mistake as to the effect of registration upon the validity of a document
has been regarded by the Supreme Court as a mistake of law.118 But a mis-
take as to a foreign law will avoid. In the case of a Government grant, the
grantee claimed perpetual right of possession under the wrong assumption
of factual aspects. The court said that a mistake in construing the terms of
a grant could not be termed as "mistake of fact". The contract would not
be avoided.119

Legality of Object
The fourth and the last requirement for the formation of a valid contract
is that parties must contract for a lawful object. An agreement the object of
which is opposed to the law of the land may be either unlawful or simply
void, depending upon the provision of the law to which it is opposed.
UNLAWFUL AGREEMENTS
Section 23 renders certain considerations and objects as unlawful.
S. 23. What considerations and objects are lawful, and what not. - The
consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless-
it is forbidden by law; or
is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any
law; or
is fraudulent; or
involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or the Court
regards it as immoral, or opposed to public policy.
In each of these cases, the consideration or object of an agreement is said to
be unlawful. Every agreement of which the object or consideration is unlawful,
is void.
Illustrations
(a) A agrees to sell his house to B for 10,000 rupees. Here B's promise to pay the sum of
10,000 rupees is the consideration for A's promise to sell the house, and, A's promise to
sell the house is the consideration for B's promise to pay the 10,000 rupees. These are
lawful considerations.
(b) A promises to pay B 1000 rupees at the end of six months, if C, who owes the sum to B,
fails to pay it. B promises to grant time to C accordingly. Here, the promise of each party
is the consideration for the promise of the other party, and they are lawful considera-
tions.
(c) A promises, for a certain sum paid to him by B, to make good to B the value of his ship if
it is wrecked on a certain voyage. Here A's promise is the consideration for B's payment,
and B's payment is the consideration for A's promise, and these are lawful considera-
tions.
(d) A promises to maintain B's child, and B promises to pay A 1000 rupees yearly for the
purpose. Here, the promise of each party is the consideration for the promise of the
other party. They are lawful considerations.
(e) A, B and C enter into an agreement of the division among them of gains acquired, or to
be acquired, by them by fraud. The agreement is void, as its object is unlawful.

256 Chapter 7 Legality of Object
[S. 23]
(f) A promises to obtain for B an employment in the public service, and B promises to pay
1000 rupees to A. The agreement is void, as the consideration for it is unlawful.
(g) A, being agent for a landed proprietor, agrees for money, without the knowledge of
his principal, to obtain for B a lease of land belonging to his principal. The agreement
between A and B is void, as it implies a fraud by concealment, by A, on his principal.
(h) A promises B to drop a prosecution which he has instituted against B for robbery and
B promises to restore the value of things taken. The agreement is void, as its object is
unlawful.
(i) A's estate is sold for arrears of revenue under the provisions of an Act of the Legisla-
ture, by which the defaulter is prohibited from purchasing the estate. B, upon an under-
standing with A, becomes the purchaser, and agrees to convey the estate to A upon
receiving from him the price which B has paid. The agreement is void, as it renders the
transaction, in effect, a purchase by the defaulter, and would so defeat the object of the
law.
(j)A, who is B's Mukhtar, promises to exercise his influence, as such, with B in favour of C,
and C promises to pay 1000 rupees to A. The agreement is void, because it is immoral.
(k) A agrees to let her daughter to hire to B for concubinage. The agreement is void,
because it is immoral, though the letting may not be punishable under the Indian Penal
Code (XLV of 1860).
Object and consideration
The section covers the illegality of both the object of the contract and the
consideration for it. The "object" and "consideration" may in some cases
be the same thing but usually they are different. For example, where money
is borrowed for the purpose of the marriage of a minor, the consideration
for the contract is the loan and the object, the marriage. In a case of this
kind before the Madras High Court,' the court found that the marriage in
question was hit by the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act of
1929. "The purpose for which the guardian borrowed the money is to cele-
brate the marriage of a child which is an offence under the Act." Thus, the
object was to defeat the provisions of the Child Marriage estraint Act. The
court relied upon the earlier decision of the Calcutta High Court in Jaffar
Meher Ali v Budge Budge Jute Mills Co² where a debtor transferred certain
property to one of his creditors, the object being to give him preference
over other creditors and SALE J stated the difference between "object" and
"consideration":
The word 'object' in Section 23 of the Contract Act was not used in
the same sense as 'consideration', but was used as distinguished from con-
sideration and means 'purpose' or 'design'. If then the purpose of the
parties was to defeat the provisions of the Bankruptcy Law, there can be
1. Chandra Sreenivasa Rao v Korapatti Raja Rama Mohana Rao, AIR 1952 Mad 579. There is
no presumption of illegality. Such a presumption cannot be raised except where it is warranted
by rules relating to presumptions. A presumption of legality—not a presumption of illegality
is the rule. The mere possibility of transgression of law is not a ground for saying that the
agreement offends S. 23. The agreement must be shown to be ex facie illegal or capable of
being performed only through illegal means. Mathai George v Mathew Chacko, (1987) 1 KLT

Unlawful agreements 257
no doubt that the transfer would be inoperative under the provisions of
Section 6 of the Transfer of Property Act.
1. Forbidden by law
Where the object of an agreement is forbidden by law, the agreement is
void. "Law" in this connection means the law for the time being in force in
India and, therefore, includes Hindu and Mohammedan laws also and also
principles of unwritten law.³ A simple illustration is the sale of liquor with-
out licence. The sale is void and the price irrevocable.+
Violation of licences and permits
Cases on this point have mostly been found in agreements involving breach
of laws enacted for the protection or promotion of public interest. Reference
may be made to only one such case before the Madras High Court."
The plaintiff was licensed under an Excise Act to work a liquor shop.
The Act forbade the sale, transfer or sub-lease of the licence or the cre-
ation of a partnership to run the shop. The plaintiff took the defendant
into partnership.
The partnership was held void as it would defeat the policy of the law if
unapproved persons could find their way into working liquor shops. An
agreement indirectly defeating the provisions of an Act would be equally
void.' Much, however, depends upon the object of a particular statute and
the object of the agreement as interpreted by the court. If the intention of
Legislature is to forbid an act in public interest, an agreement to do the
forbidden act will obviously be void. But if the intention is merely to reg-
ulate an act by prescribing certain terms and conditions and formalities, a

[S. 23]
contract to do the act without fulfilling the statutory requirements may not
itself be void, even if the parties have to pay a penalty for the breach of the
statute. A Bombay High Court decision illustrates the point:
The plaintiff was a lessee of certain tolls under the Bombay Tolls
Act, 1875. One of the conditions of the lease was that the lessee should
not sublet the tolls to any other person without the permission of the
Collector. A fine of Rs 200 was payable for a breach of the condition. The
plaintiff contracted with the defendant to sublet the toll to him without
obtaining the necessary permission.
The question was whether the sub-lease was void. The court held that it
was not. The object of the statute was not to forbid such transactions. It was
"an Act passed for the benefit of the revenue and not an Act for the protec-
tion of public morals". The transaction may be void as against the Collector,
but between the parties it stands."
Where an Act or Rules made thereunder prohibit sale or transfer, the
licensee cannot form a partnership to work the licence as that also amounts
to a transfer. In a subsequent Full Bench decision the Madras High Court
further pointed out that "irrespective of the facts whether the contract for
partnership was entered into before the licence had been granted or subse-
quent to the issue of the licence, the result would be the same. The partner-
ship must be deemed to be void ab initio.
The decisions of the Bombay High Court, however, have struck a differ-
ent note. In Champsey v Gordhandas Kessowji, a licence granted under
9. See, for example, Amritsar Rayon & Silk Mills Ltd v Amin Chand Sajdeh, (1987) 2 PLR 253,
violation of the regulatory requirements of S. 299 of the Companies Act, 1956 does not make
the contract unlawful.

the Bombay Salt Act, 1890, which also prohibited transfer of every kind and
the licensee admitted his brothers into partnership with him to work the
licence, the court held "that the admission of a partner to share in the profits
could not be considered as a subletting or alienating a part of the privilege
unless there had been a document directly transferring to the partners a
part of the right to manufacture or vend". The authorities of this kind were
held by the Calcutta High Court to be not applicable to a case in which the
statute or the rules made under it provided expressly that the taking in of a
partner would amount to a deemed transfer of the licence.15
All such authorities were reviewed by the Calcutta High Court in
Mafizuddin Khan Chowdhury v Habibuddin Sheikh," where the court
emphasised that decisions must rest on the definiteness of prohibition
against sale etc. Here a licence was granted under the Bengal Silk Control
Order, 1945, to work raw silk because at that time the Order prohibited
working of raw silk without a licence. Although the licence was taken in one
name, the understanding was that it would be worked with another person
under partnership and that other person brought an action for accounts and
dissolution. The court allowed the action, because the Order did not impose
any restriction upon transfer etc. Where a party purchased a motor car in
the name of a permit-holder so as to make use of his permit, the arrange-
ment was held to be not a void one.17
Regulatory laws also give rise to the question whether a statute impliedly
prohibits the making of a contract. In Hughes v Asset Managers Plc:18
A transaction in securities was made through the medium of a person
whose firm was licensed but he himself did not hold the representative's
licence as required by the Prevention of Frauds (Investments) Act, 1958
(English).
It was held that the Act did not amount to automatically invalidating such
transactions because in that case public interest would suffer more instead
of being protected.

was made under protest.25 The Allahabad High Court held that a contract
to supply electricity on the condition that the consumer would be liable to

Assignment of copyright
The Copyright Act, 1957 permits assignment of copyright in any present

public policy because there are safeguards for the protection of the owner

Stay order
A stay order on construction which was obtained otherwise than under
the allegation that the object of the contract was unlawful was held as not
amounting to illegality of object. It may be that a construction under dis-
puted circumstances may not find buyers, yet the contractor cannot get rid
under the doctrine of illegality or impossibility.
2. Defeat any law
Sometimes the object of, or the consideration for, an agreement is such
that though not directly forbidden by law, it would, if permitted, defeat the
provisions of any law. Such an agreement is also void. Easy illustrations are
to be found in agreements relating to bail bonds.
An accused is required under the Criminal Procedure Code to furnish
a surety in the sum of five thousand rupees for his good behaviour. He
deposits the sum with the defendant and persuades him to become surety.
relinquishment of rights which requires stamp duty and registration is a violation of law if
not complied with, not enforceable. Shirish Finance and Investment P Ltd v M. Sreenivasulu,

Unlawful agreements 263
After the period of suretyship is over, the accused sues the defendant for
the amount. 35
The Allahabad High Court held the agreement void and the amount irre-
coverable. The intention in requiring a surety is that the surety shall at his
own risk see to the appearance of the accused. This purpose is definitely
defeated by an agreement of the above sort. A contract to indemnify the
surety against his liability is illegal for the same reason. 36
The debt of an agricultural borrower in respect of his agricultural land
became discharged by virtue of certain statutory provisions. Subsequent to
that, the same land was sold wherein the discharged debt was also treated
as a part of the consideration. The transaction was held to be unlawful as
it would have defeated the policy of relieving agricultural borrowers from
debt burdens. The fact that only a part of the consideration had the effect of
defeating law was not considered to be material because the transaction was
for one inseparable consideration.37
Where a statute provides penalty for an act, it is implicit that the statute
intends to forbid that act.38 A transaction for exchange of properties to be
performed after the compounding of a criminal case between the parties
was held to be not enforceable."
A person, who was elected as a sarpanch for a period of five years, made
an agreement with another member that the latter would be given two year
term and the elected one, the remaining three years. The agreement was held
to be void as it would have defeated the purpose and provisions of the Punjab
Panchayat Raj Act, 1994. An agreement to secure votes in favour of a per-
son to enable him to get elected to a statutory body in consideration of shar-
ing power or quiting office after specified period was held to be violation of
Section 8 of the Advocates Act which prescribes a five year term of office."
Law of friendly country
An agreement which defeats the law of a friendly country would be
equally void. An illustration is Ragazzoni v K.C. Sethia."
The Government of India had, by regulations made under the Sea
Customs Act, 1878, prohibited the export of goods to South Africa. The
plaintiff and the defendant, being aware of the prohibition and in a bid to
overcome the embargo, agreed that a larger quantity of jute bags would
be shipped from India and made available in Genoa for resale to South

African buyers. The defendant failed to deliver the goods and the plaintiff
sued for damages.
The Court of Appeal held that while the English courts will not enforce
foreign revenue or penal laws, they will not entertain an action based on a
transaction which is knowingly intended to involve a breach of such laws.
DENNING LJ said: "...if two people knowingly agree together to breach the
laws of a friendly country or to procure someone else to break them or to
assist in the doing of it, then they cannot ask this court to give its aid to the
enforcement of their agreement."
Another illustration is Foster v Driscoll. Here the agreement was to buy
whisky in Great Britain and to smuggle it into the United States against the
law of that country. The Court of Appeal held the agreement to be illegal.
It involved the commission of an offence in a foreign and friendly country
and so a breach of international comity. It did not matter that the parties
had not succeeded in their attempt and they could have lawfully taken their
goods to another country.
Innocent violations
Where the violation of a home or foreign law would not be an affront to
public conscience, enforcement may be allowed. Such a possibility was rec-
ognised by the Court of Appeal in Howard v Shirlstar Container Transport
Ltd."
The owner of an aircraft agreed to pay the plaintiff for successfully
removing his aircraft from Nigerian territorial airspace. The plaintiff
did so without permission of Nigerian authorities and landed it in Ivory
Coast. The plaintiff did so under the belief that there was imminent dan-
ger to life in Nigeria. The Ivory Coast Government returned the aircraft
to Nigerian authorities. But the plaintiff sued for his fee.
He was allowed to recover. He had done the job of removing and safe
landing and since his fee was payable on completion of the flight out of
Nigeria, he had earned his fee. As for the illegality involved, the court said
that although the court would not normally enforce a contract which would
enable a plaintiff to benefit from his criminal conduct, since to do so would
be an affront to the public conscience, there are circumstances where it
would be wrong to disqualify a plaintiff from recovering, even though his
claim was derived from conduct which constituted a statutory offence. One
such circumstance is where the plaintiff commits a criminal act in order to
escape danger to his life. Accordingly, although the plaintiff's claim would
otherwise be unenforceable in English courts because his breach of Nigerian
air traffic control regulations was central to the performance of his contract,
the public conscience would not be affronted if the contract was enforced

against the defendant because the plaintiff's conduct was designed to free
himself and his wireless operator from pressing danger.
Where a deposit of money was taken in excess of the Post Office Monthly
Income Rules, 1987 and interest paid on it, recovery of such interest amount
from the depositor was not allowed. There was nothing immoral or against
public policy. There was only the technical violation of a rule which it was
in the hands of the Central Government to waive or to alter. A bank was
allowed to recover back money lent without knowing whether the borrower
was licenced for his business or not and his guarantors were allowed to take
back their title deeds from the bank.47
Scope of the term "law"
"Law" in this connection means the rules of law for the time being in
force in India and includes Hindu and Muslim laws. The Bombay High
Court, for example, held in a case that according to the Mohammedan
Law, it is not competent to parties contracting a marriage to enter into a
separation deed by which the husband covenanted that his wife might live
with her parents. Similarly, accepting a son in adoption in consideration of
a sum of money is unlawful.49
Money and property involved in transactions defeating law
The Supreme Court considered this part of Section 23 in Surasaibalini
Debi v Phanindra Mohan Mazumdar, 50
The plaintiff, an employee of the Court of Wards, started the business
of running a boarding house. The rules of service prohibited him from
engaging in any trade or business. The premises were leased nominally
in the name of his father-in-law, but the management and finance was
the concern of the plaintiff. The business ran for quite a few years. The
plaintiff fell ill and had to leave Calcutta for some time. He transferred
the business wholly to his father-in-law on the understanding that on
his return, the father-in-law would hand back the business and would

also account for its profits. The plaintiff came back but his father-in-law
refused to oblige him.
The plaintiff brought an action to recover back his business. The defend-
ant contended that the business was illegal because it defeated the service
rules and also the Income Tax Act. The Supreme Court held that the service
rules were not statutory and, therefore, their violation did not render the
business illegal. The only other question was the evasion of income tax. On
this point, AYYANGAR J found that the law undoubtedly was that where a
benami transaction is entered into for the evasion of taxes, the law would
not give its help to either party and would leave them where they are. 51 In
such cases, recovery is possible only if either the illegal purpose has not
been carried out or the plaintiff has not to rely upon the illegal transac-
tion. The plaintiff had left the business in the hands of his father-in-law
on account of his illness and not because of the illegality. His action was to
enforce his ownership interest and for this purpose it was not necessary for
him to rely on the illegal transaction. Accordingly, he was allowed to recover
the possession of his business.
Money sent from abroad through unauthorised channels has been allowed
to be recovered.14
Agreement to evade taxes
An agreement between the partners of a firm to conceal income in certain
respects so as to evade income tax has been held to be unlawful. It has been
held that there is subterfuge in entering into a composite works contract
containing elements both of transfer of property in goods as well as labour
and services.56
Undercutting of statutory privileges
A term in a contract of carriage requiring that notice of loss must be given
within 30 days of the arrival of the goods has been held by the Supreme
Court to be contrary to and defeating Section 10 of the Carriers Act, 1865,
which prescribes a period of six months for the purpose."7
51. Apart from this, benami transactions are so common in India that there is no illegality in
itself, see Kedar Nath Matani v Prahlad Rai, AIR 1960 SC 213: (1960) 1 SCR 861.

Unlawful agreements 267
[S. 23]
3. Fraudulent
An agreement made for a "fraudulent" purpose is void. Where the par-
ties agree to impose a fraud on a third person, their agreement is unlawful.
Where, for example, a debtor agreed to pay a separate commission, or to
give preference to a creditor in order to induce his consent to a composi-
tion which is proposed with other creditors, the object of the agreement
is fraudulent. In another case, there were two decree-holders against the
debtor and one of them, the plaintiff, had the debtor's property attached
and brought to sale. The plaintiff agreed with the defendant, a prospective
buyer, that he would not bid against the defendant and that the defendant
would pay him off. The property was thus knocked down to the defendant
for a very small price. It was held that the whole object of the arrangement
was fraudulent as it deprived the other decree-holder of what he would have
got if the sale had been competitive. Accordingly, the plaintiff could not
recover anything from the defendant. Similarly, an agreement to defraud
creditors, or to give fraudulent preference to a creditor or to defraud revenue
authorities, or investors in a company," are illegal. A compromise decree
obtained by practising fraud on the court was held to be void.
"Intention to deceive" seems to be necessary for an agreement to fall in
this category. A decision of the English Court of Appeal, however, shows
that the same result may follow where one of the parties had no such inten-
tion, but made himself an innocent instrument of fraud at the suggestion of
the other party,43
A shipowner informed the shipper that the barrels containing the
orange juice were old and frail and that some were leaking and, there-
fore, a clean bill of lading could not be granted. The shipowner, however,
issued a clean bill after a promise of indemnity from the sender. The bill
stated that the barrels were shipped in good order and condition. On

arrival at the destination, the contents of the barrels had suffered consid-
erable leakage and the shipowner had to make good the loss thus caused
to the buyer of the barrels. The shipowner then sought to enforce the
indemnity against the sender.
It was held by a majority of two against one that the indemnity bond was
not enforceable. MORRIS LJ stated the effect of the agreement thus: If you
make a false representation that the goods have been received in good order
when you know that they are not so and which will deceive endorsees of the
bill, we will not indemnify you against consequences. Thus, the shipowner
had made himself a vehicle not merely for conveyance of goods but also for
carrying a false representation. This made the whole scheme unlawful dis-
entitling him from relying upon any part of it. The argument that it was a
common practice of the shipowners was shelved by the court by saying that
it may explain why he did what he did, but not make an unlawful thing law-
ful. Where the parties to a contract conspired to defraud an insurance com-
pany by agreeing to an inflated estimate for repair work in order to claim
a larger sum, it was held that the contract was vitiated by illegality. The
legitimate part of the claim could not be separated from the illegal portion
because it was a single indivisible arrangement, it could not be enforced.64
An agreement between two bidders not to bid against each other with an
understanding that the successful bidder would convey half the property to
the other, has been held to be not against public policy."
4. Injurious to person or property
An agreement between two persons to injure the person or property
of another is unlawful. In the same way, if the object of an agreement is
such that it involves or implies injury to the person or property of another,
the agreement is unlawful and void. A person borrowed a sum of hundred
rupees and executed a bond promising to work for the plaintiff without
pay for a period of two years. In case of default, the borrower was to pay
exorbitant interest and the principal sum at once. The court held that the
contract contained in the bond was indistinguishable from slavery, which
involves injury to the person and was, therefore, void. Similarly, a bond to
pay an exorbitantly high rate of interest, in case, the borrower left the lend-
er's service, has been held to be void.67 An agreement to commit a crime or
a civil wrong, for example, to assault or beat a person or to deceive him" or
to publish a libel against him, 69 all fall in this category.

Fruits of crime
Unlawful agreements 269
Law does not help a person to recover anything under his own crime.
The fruits of a crime are irrecoverable. No person is allowed to benefit from
his own crime. It is on this principle that a person is not permitted to par-
ticipate in a succession which he has brought about through murder." An
insured person committed suicide to enable his representatives to get the
insurance money, but they were not allowed to recover. It was an attempt to
confer a benefit through his own crime." This brought about an undeserved
punishment of the representatives. The position was, therefore, changed by
the Suicide Act, 1961 [English]. The principle was again applied to pre-
vent a person, who had taken out a policy in respect of liability for bodily
injury caused by accident, from recovering anything for liability for death
caused by him though involuntarily but as a result of an unlawful and vio-
lent attack." Criticising such results, it has been observed in Cheshire and
Fifoot: "The principle that no benefit can accrue to a criminal from his
own crime, however, must obviously not be pushed too far. Nowadays, there
are many statutory offences, some of them involving no great degree of tur-
pitude, which rank as crimes, and it has several times been doubted whether
they are all indiscriminately affected by the rule of which the Beresford case
is an example."74
5. Immoral
The law does not allow an agreement tainted with immorality to be
enforced. Consequently, every agreement the object of or consideration
for which is immoral, is unlawful. What is "immoral" depends upon the
standards of morality prevailing at a particular time and as approved by the
courts. But certain kinds of acts have been regarded as immoral since times
immemorial and will perhaps always be so regarded.
Interference in marital relations
One such act is interference with marital relations. Thus, where a married
woman was given money to enable her to obtain divorce from her husband,
the lender promising to marry her subsequently, it was held that the money
could not be recovered." Similarly, a promise to marry a married woman

[S. 23]
after the death of her husband or after she obtains divorce from him is
immoral. In the same way, a promise by a married man to marry a woman
after the death of his wife or after obtaining divorce from her is illegal. But
if she does not know the man to be married, she can bring an action for
breach." In Fender v John Mildmay77 the House of Lords had to face a dif-
ficult case on this point.
The defendant, who was a married man at the time, met the plaintiff at
a nursing home where she was a nurse. He told her that he was unhappy
with his wife and later asked her whether, if his wife divorced him, she
would marry him after the divorce. She consented and thereupon sex-
ual relations took place between them. The wife petitioned for a divorce
on the ground of this adultery and a decree nisi was pronounced. The
defendant then promised to marry the plaintiff as soon as the decree was
made absolute. But he committed breach of this promise by marrying
another woman. The plaintiff sued him.
The claim was resisted on the ground of immorality, but she was held enti-
tled to recover. What is immoral is interference with marital status, whereas,
in the present case, "after decree nisi the bottom has dropped out of mar-
riage: nothing but a shell is left". Accordingly, the circumstances which lead
to mischief were absent here.
Dealings with prostitutes
Dealings with prostitutes have always been regarded as immoral. “If arti-
cles are sold or something is hired to a prostitute for the purpose of enabling
her to carry on her profession, neither the price of the articles sold nor the
rent of the thing hired can be recovered."79 "If a woman takes a house in
order to live in it as the mistress of a man and to use it for that purpose, and
the landlord at the time when the lease is executed knows that it is taken for
that purpose, the landlord cannot recover the rent."80
Illegal cohabitation
A promise to pay for past sexual immorality or illegal cohabitation has
been held in England to be enforceable if under seal. If it is not under seal,
it cannot be enforced as past consideration is no consideration.

Unlawful agreements 271
Allahabad High Court allowed a woman to recover arrears of allowance
promised to her for past cohabitation. But in a subsequent decision, the
same High Court has held that where cohabitation is adulterous, that is
to say, where either party is married, whether past or future, it will not
support a promise. Adultery is not merely immoral, but is also illegal.83
Contrary views have also been expressed. "In Hussainali Casan v Dinbai,84
MACLEOD CJ and CRUMP J held that a contract which was immoral at the
time, and, therefore, could not support an immediate promise to pay, did
not become innocent by merely being past consideration. There can be no
difference whether A says to B: 'I will give you Rs 1000 a month if you live
with me for a year,' or 'I will give you Rs 1200 because you have lived with
me for a year'." The consideration, therefore, for past cohabitation is unlaw-
ful as being immoral or opposed to public policy,
A promise to pay for future cohabitation is unenforceable. A promise to
pay for past cohabitation for the purpose of securing the continuance of
the cohabitation is also unenforceable. Where a promise was given for past
cohabitation "with a view that she may continue in my service", it was held
to be opposed to public policy." But a promise to pay for past cohabitation
only is enforceable even if the circumstances do not rule out the continuance
of the cohabitation.87
The principles which have thus crystallised from the various High Court
decisions have been approved by the Supreme Court in Dwarampudi
Nagaratnamba v Kunuku Ramayya. 88 Certain properties were gifted in
consideration of past cohabitation. The Supreme Court found that the prop-
erties belonged to the joint family, which the Karta had no power to gift
and, therefore, the gift was void. But apart from this, BACHAWAT J recog-
nised past cohabitation as a good consideration. The Rajasthan High Court
has put the same thing on more rational basis.89 A gift deed was executed by
a person in favour of a woman with whom he had adulterous cohabitation.
Holding the gift deed to be enforceable, the court said that the word "object"
as used in Section 23 means purpose or design. Past cohabitation, even if
adulterous, is no longer the object of the gift. It only supplies a motive. Gift
is a transfer without consideration. Hence, no question of unlawful consid-
eration can arise.

Dancing girls
[S. 23]
Help given or promised to a dancing girl is not tainted with immorality,90
"Immorality" to be limited to sex outside marriage
The scope of the word "immoral" has been explained by the Supreme
Court in Gherulal Parakh v Mahadeodas" SUBBA RAO J (afterwards CJ) said:
The case-law both in England and India confines the operation of the
doctrine to sexual immorality. To cite only some instances: settlements
in consideration of concubinage, contracts of sale or hire of things to be
used in a brothel or by a prostitute for purposes incidental to her profes-
sion, agreements to pay money for future illicit cohabitations, promises in
regard to marriage for consideration or contracts facilitating divorce are
held to be void on the ground that the object is immoral.
The learned judge pointed out that the word "immoral", being a very com-
prehensive one, must be given restricted meaning and it has been restricted
to mean sexual immorality. Accordingly, the court held that a wagering,
agreement could not be regarded as immoral.
6. Public policy
An agreement is unlawful if the court regards it as opposed to public
policy. The term "public policy" in its broadest sense means that some-
times the courts will, on considerations of public interest, refuse to enforce
a contract. The normal function of the courts is to enforce contracts; but
considerations of public interest may require the courts to depart from their
primary function and to refuse to enforce a contract." Interpretation of
the concept of public policy is the function of the court and not that of the
executive. A State Amendment of the Registration Act, 1908 empowered
the Registrar to refuse registration of a power of attorney authorising the
attorney to transfer specified immovable properties because the registration
of such documents was opposed to public policy.95
Observations in English Law about public policy
The circumstances in which a contract is likely to be struck down as
one opposed to public policy are fairly well-established in England. "... So
a contract of marriage brokerage, the creation of a perpetuity, a contract
in restraint of trade, a gaming or wagering contract, or the assisting of the

King's enemies, are all unlawful things" on the ground of public policy.%
The ordinary function of the courts is to rely on the well-settled heads of
public policy and to apply them to varying situations.97 If the contract in
question fits into one or the other of these pigeon-holes, it may be declared
void. The courts may, however, mould the well-settled categories of public
policy to suit new conditions of a changing world." But may a court invent
a new head of public policy?
According to Lord HALSBURY, the categories of public policy are closed.100
"I deny", he said, "that any court can invent a new head of public policy".
"From time to time judges of the highest reputation have uttered warning
notes as to the danger of permitting judicial tribunals to roam unchecked
in this field." For example, a judge protesting against public policy in an
early case, said, "it is a very unruly horse, and when once you get astride
it, you never know where it will carry you".102 A few other opinions may be
cited. ""Public policy' is a vague and unsatisfactory term."103 "Certain kinds
of contracts have been held void at common law on this ground-a branch
of the law, however, which certainly should not be extended, as judges are
more to be trusted as interpreters of the law than as expounders of what is
called public policy."104 "Public policy' is always an unsafe and treacherous
ground for legal decisions, and in the present case it would not be easy to
say on which side the balance of convenience would incline."105 Yet the rule
exists. In the words of Lord ATKIN, "the doctrine should only be invoked in
clear cases in which the harm to the public is substantially incontestable, and
does not depend upon the idiosyncratic inference of a few judicial minds",106
Indian cases adopting English view
"The Indian cases also adopt the same view."107 The following words of
SUBBA RAO J (afterwards CJ) in Gherulal Parakh v Mahadeodasta enshrine
the present position of the doctrine of public policy in India:

274 Chapter 7 Legality of Object
[S. 23]
"The doctrine of public policy may be summarised thus: Public policy
or the policy of the law is an illusive concept; it has been described as an
"untrustworthy guide", "variable quality", "unruly horse", etc.; the primary
duty of a court of law is to enforce a promise which the parties have made
and to uphold the sanctity of contract which forms the basis of society; but
in certain cases, the Court may relieve them of their duty on a rule founded
on what is called the public policy; for want of better words Lord ATKIN
describes that something done contrary to public policy is a harmful thing;
but the doctrine is extended not only to harmful cases but also to harmful
tendencies; this doctrine of public policy is only a branch of common law,
and just like any other branch of common law, it is governed by precedents;
the principles have been crystallised under different heads and though it is
permissible for courts to expound and apply them to different situations,
it should only be invoked in clear and incontestable cases of harm to the
public; though the heads are not closed and though theoretically it may
be permissible to evolve a new head under exceptional circumstances of a
changing world, it is advisable in the interest of stability of society not to
make any attempt to discover new heads in these days."
Explaining the scope of the expression "public policy" and the role of the
judge, C. REDDY J of the Andhra Pradesh High Court observed:109 The twin
touchstones of public policy are advancement of the public good and pre-
vention of public mischief and these questions have to be decided by judges
not as men of legal learning but as experienced and enlightened members of
the community representing the highest common factor of public sentiment
and intelligence.
Endorsing this view, the Supreme Court added that going by prevailing
social values, an agreement having tendency to injure public interest or pub-
lic welfare is opposed to public policy.110
Surrender of rights
A wife who is entitled to maintenance can give up her right in considera-
tion of a lump sum payment, but the surrender of the right to claim revision
of the amount in the context of rising prices would be opposed to public
policy.111

Unlawful agreements 275
Giving effect to an agreement which overrides Section 125 CrPC would
tantamount to not only giving recognition to something which is opposed
to public policy but would also amount to negation of the statutory provi-
sions. The court said that public policy can broadly be equated with policy
of law. 112 A marriage was dissolved on consent terms, one of which was that
the wife would not claim alimony or maintenance. It was held that such
consent terms could not prevent the court from granting maintenance on the
application of the wife made subsequently. Such rights are the larger parts of
the right to life. It is against public policy to snatch them.113
An agreement to give up one's legal right is not hit by Section 23. The
agreement in question was between the landlord and tenant. It was entered
into during the pendency of eviction proceedings and stipulated that even if
an eviction order was passed, the landlord would not evict the tenant. This
was held to be not illegal or against public policy. 114 The court followed
the Supreme Court ruling to the effect that what makes an otherwise legal
agreement to be void is that its performance is impossible except by disobe-
dience of law.115
The Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 has been enacted for benefit of
all the workers covered by it. Its provisions are meant to protect employees
from employers. It is a matter of underlying public policy. Such beneficial
rights cannot be contracted out either by employers or employees' union.
Such contracts are void and unenforceable. Waiver of advantages conferred
by law is opposed to public policy,116
Marriage of minor girl
Where the consideration for a contract of sale was the expenses of the
marriage of a minor girl, the arrangement was held to be opposed to public
policy, being in violation of the Child Marriage Restraint Act.
Payment out of black money
The Delhi High Court has held that a contract for the sale of goods whose
tenor shows that the price was intended to be paid out of black money is not
opposed to public policy and is, therefore, valid and enforceable. 117 The con-
tract involved transfer of goods and payment of price and neither is opposed
become surrendered would be contrary to law if it is destructive of those rights without alter-
native security.

to public policy, nor can it be said to be designed to hoodwink the revenue.
And even if it could be so said, the seller who had delivered his goods, could
always call for payment out of the innocent money of the buyer. An agree-
ment to exclude the land of a company from notified urban areas has been
held to be not against public policy,118
Grabbing of privileges by extraneous influences
A sale of seats in a public institution, e.g., a medical college, is equally
opposed to public policy. The Supreme Court has held that charging of cap-
itation fee in consideration of admission to educational institutions is illegal
and impermissible as it amounts to denial of citizen's right to education and
is arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.119 The Madras
High Court did not permit the recovery of a sum of money paid to a per-
son to enable him to procure a seat in a medical college. Any attempt to
pervert selection by merit is highly injurious to public interest.120 Money
promised to a person to get the promisor declared as the heir of a wealthy
Nawab has been held to be not recoverable.121 The fulfilment of the promise
involved influencing statesmen for private gain, which is the same thing as
corruption. Money promised to be paid to a person for using his influence
for obtaining a Government order in favour of a manufacturer for supply of
spare parts, or to secure a mining right are in the same category. 122 A con-
tract between A and B for wielding influence with the Government author-
ities to secure a decision in favour of B has been held by the Supreme Court
to be opposed to public policy,123 Money paid under such a contract is not
allowed to be recovered.124
Price escalation and interest clauses
On account of price instabilities, it has become usual to allow suppliers
and project contractors the benefit of price adjustment where the market
price increases to such an extent that it would be unreasonable to ask any-
body to go on performing at the originally reserved prices. The Development
Authorities can make such adjustments according as the market of selling
plots or houses fluctuates. If an Authority is forced under a court order
to pay more compensation for acquisition, it can recoup from allottees
with whom the deal is still not finalised. The Authority can also categorise
the beneficiaries of its services, for example, into auction-purchasers and

allottees. Demanding more price from allottees only does not constitute a
discrimination. The allottees may be further categorised into economically
stronger or weaker sections. Lesser prices from weaker sections does not in
itself violate the constitutional guarantee of equality.125
Agreements contrary to public policy of friendly foreign state
The public policy of a friendly foreign country where the agreement in
question has to be performed can be taken into account while enforcing
the agreement in England. This principle was laid down by the court of
Queen's Bench Division in Lemenda Trading Co Ltd v African Middle East
Petroleum Co Ltd.126 An oil company in England wanted renewal of a sup-
ply contract with the Qatar National Oil Company. For this purpose, it
entered into an agreement with the plaintiff company which undertook to
bring about the renewal by using their influence with the officers of Qatar
and this, in return, for a commission on oil supplies. Such commission was
against public policy under the law of Qatar. The supply was renewed and
an action was commenced in England to recover the agreed commission.
The court said that recovery would not be allowed. The public policy of a
friendly foreign State cannot, of course, of itself prevent the enforcement
of a contract in England, but even so, an English court would not enforce
a contract related to a transaction which is contrary to English public pol-
icy founded on general principles of morality and the same public policy is
applicable in the friendly foreign country where the contract was to be per-
formed so that the contract would not be enforceable under the law of that
country, because in such circumstances the international comity combined
with the English domestic public policy would militate against enforcement.
Since a contract for the use of personal influence in return for money in cir-
cumstances where the person to be influenced is likely to be unaware of the
pecuniary motive involved is contrary to public policy in both England and
Qatar, such contract would not be enforced in England.127 The court cited
the following passage from the judgment of HALSBURY LC:128 "Where a

127. The court noted Norman v Cole, (1800) 3 ESP 253: 170 ER 606, money paid for using the

128. Missouri SS Co, re, (1889) LR 42 Ch D 321, 336 (CA). The court also cited Kaufman v
Gerson, (1904) 1 KB 591 (CA). In that case: "A Frenchman coerced a Frenchwoman into
signing a contract in France by the threat that if she refused to sign he would prosecute her
husband for a crime of which he was accused." The contract was valid by French law, but
an action brought for its breach in England was dismissed on the ground that to enforce it
"would contravene what by the law of this country is deemed an essential moral interest".
Presumably, therefore, an English court would apply the rule that has been laid down in the
United States of America and would refuse to enforce any contract which tended to promote

contract is void on the ground of immorality, or is contrary to such positive
law as would prohibit the making of such a contract at all, then the contract
would be void all over the world, and no civilised country would be called
on to enforce it."
Alienation of land by member of depressed class
A portion of land was assigned by the Government to a depressed class
member in fulfilment of its Constitutional obligation under Article 39(b).
The grant was subject to the specific condition that the land would not
be alienated. Because of the violation of this condition and because of the
public policy implication, the alienation of the land was held to be of no
effect.129 A land allotted on the basis of Scheduled Caste was put under 20
year restriction on disposal. This was held to be valid. A transfer in violation
of the applicable Rules was naturally invalid. The Rules permitted mortgage
in favour of banking companies and recognised financial institutions for
raising a loan.130
131
Such restrictions are in the interest of the assignees of lands and are based
upon public policy to meet guaranteed social needs. They do not operate as
a clog. They are intended to make assignees full owners. Any such restric-
tion which is not in the interest of the class to which the assignee belongs is
likely to be declared void.132
Chitty
The conduct of a chitty in violation of Acts enacted in the interest of
uniformity of practices was held to be not opposed to public policy within
the meaning of Section 23. The cheques issued under the scheme were found
to be issued for payment of legally enforceable debts. The dishonour of
such cheques amounted to an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, 1881.133

Arbitration award induced by fraud or corruption
An arbitration award induced by fraud or corruption has been held to be
against public policy. It is therefore liable to be set aside under Section 34(2)
(b)(11), Explanation of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.134
Things done under statutory provisions
Banking business includes recovery. The assignment of a debt and al
non-performing asset by SBI to a banking company under the provisions
of an Act with right to recover the debt was held to be a valid transaction.
The transaction in question was neither prohibited under the Transfer of
Property Act nor it was violative of public policy.135 Things expressly per-
mitted by law cannot be held as opposed to public policy. In this case there
was a transaction in derivatives, which is a financial instrument used to
transfer or hedge the risk. This was permitted by Master Circulars issued by
the Reserve Bank from time to time and Regulations framed under FEMA,
1999 136
Divorce by mutual consent.-The parties to a marriage entered into a
compromise over their marriage which had already suffered irretrievable
breakdown with no chance of reunion between them. According to the terms
of the settlement, the husband had already deposited the entire amount of
permanent alimony and returned all articles of streedhan to the wife. The
compromise was voluntary and without any coercion or undue influence.
The court granted divorce.137
Heads of public policy
1. TRADING WITH ENEMY
"The King's subjects cannot trade with an alien enemy, i.e. a person
owing allegiance to a Government at war with the King, without the King's
licence."138 "It is now fully established that the presumed object of war
being as much to cripple the enemy's commerce as to capture his property,
a declaration of war imparts a prohibition of commercial intercourse and
correspondence with the inhabitants of the enemy's country, and that such
intercourse, except with the licence of Crown, is illegal", "The doctrine
applies to all contracts which involve intercourse with the enemy or tend to
assist the enemy, even though no enemy be a party to the contract." 140

2. TRAFFICKING IN PUBLIC OFFICES
[S. 23]
An agreement by which it is intended to induce a public officer to act
corruptly is contrary to public policy. An agreement, for example, by which
a sum of money was provided to a charity on the condition that latter would
procure a knighthood for the plaintiff was held void and the money irre-
coverable. Similarly, an agreement to provide money to a member of
Parliament to influence his judgment is void." Sale of public offices, that is,
appointments in consideration of money, are also against public policy. The
sale of the office of a Shebait has been held invalid. Charging of capita-
tion fee for admission to prestigious educational institutions is contrary to
public policy. The Supreme Court has described it as unreasonable, unjust
and unfair.44
3. INTERFERENCE WITH ADMINISTRATION OF Justice
A contract, the object of which is to interfere with the administration of
justice, is obviously opposed to public policy. It may take any of the follow-
ing forms:
(a) INTERFERENCE WITH THE COURSE OF JUSTICE.-Any agreement which
obstructs the ordinary process of justice is void. 145 An agreement to delay
the execution of a decree,146 and a promise to give money to induce a person
to give false evidence, have been held void. An extreme illustration is an
agreement to perform "puja" to secure success to the defendant in a litiga-
tion, which was held void,348
(b) STIFLING PROSECUTION.-It is in public interest that criminals should be
prosecuted and punished. Hence, an agreement not to prosecute an offender
or to withdraw a pending prosecution is void if the offence is of public

nature. Such agreements are called agreements to stifle prosecution. "You
shall not make a trade of a felony.” 149 "No court of law can countenance
or give effect to an agreement which attempts to take the administration
of law out of the hands of the judges and put it in the hands of the private
individuals."150 However, the law allows compromise agreements in respect
of compoundable offences.151 But the compromise of a non-compoundable
offence is not allowed. An illustration is to be found in the decision of the
Supreme Court in Narasimharaju v Gurumurthy Raju.152
In the dissolution and settlement of accounts of a partnership firm, one
of the partners filed criminal complaints against his co-partners alleg-
ing forgery in and manipulation of accounts by taking in a fake partner.
Subsequently, the partners entered into an agreement to refer the matter
to arbitration in pursuance of which the complainant did not offer any
evidence and his complaint was accordingly rejected. When the question
of enforcement of the arbitrator's award arose, it was alleged that the ref-
erence to arbitration was the result of an agreement to stifle prosecution.
GAJENDRAGADKAR J (afterwards CJ) held the agreement to be opposed to
public policy. He said: "If a person sets the machinery of criminal law into
action on the allegation that the opponent has committed a non-compound-
able offence and by the use of the coercive criminal process, he compels the
opponent to enter into an agreement, that agreement would be treated as
invalid for the reason that its consideration is opposed to public policy". The
learned judge referred to the decision of the Privy Council in Bhowanipur
Banking Corpn Ltd v Durgesh Nandini Dassi,¹³ where a mortgage was
executed by the respondent as a part of the consideration for a promise
by the bank to withdraw criminal proceedings instituted by it against the
mortgagor's husband and the bond was held invalid, notwithstanding that
the debt itself was real and valid. Lord ATKIN observed:

282 Chapter 7 Legality of Object
[S. 23]
To insist on reparation as a consideration for promise to abandon
criminal proceedings is a serious abuse of the right of private prosecu-
tion. The citizen who proposes to vindicate the criminal law must do
so whole-heartedly in the interest of justice, and must not seek his own
advantage.114
Where a compromise agreement is made before any complaint is filed, it
would not amount to stifling prosecution, even if it is implemented after the
filing of a complaint which is then withdrawn. This was pointed out by the
Supreme Court in Ouseph Poulo v Catholic Union Bank Ltd.155
A bank found that the goods in a godown, which was pledged to it
against a loan, were either fraudulently overvalued or withdrawn in col-
lusion with bank officials. The borrowers agreed to make up for the defi-
ciency by hypothecating more property. Some delay having taken place in
the hypothecation, the bank filed a complaint which was withdrawn after
the hypothecation was completed.
GAJENDRAGADKAR CJ did not agree with the contention that the agree-
ment involved any idea of stifling prosecution. The agreement was entered
into before the complaint was filed, and so, it would be unreasonable to
suggest merely from the sequence of subsequent events that the documents
in question was executed with the object of stifling the criminal prosecution.
Approving cases of this kind in its decision in Union Carbide Corpn v
Union of India,156 the Supreme Court pointed out the distinction between
"motive" and "consideration" for withdrawing a prosecution. "Where
dropping of the criminal proceedings is a motive for entering into the agree-
ment and not its consideration-the doctrine of stifling of prosecution
is not attracted. Where there is also a pre-existing civil liability, the drop-
ping of criminal proceedings need not necessarily be a consideration for the
agreement to satisfy that liability.157 Where withdrawal of a prosecution is
the motive but not the object or consideration of the contract, public policy
is not affronted. The settlement of the Bhopal gas disaster was, therefore,
valid."
An agreement not to appear as a witness is void. 158

or otherwise to another person in a suit in which that third person has
himself no legal interest, for its prosecution or defence."159 "Champerty"
in its essence means "a bargain whereby one party is to assist the other
in recovering property, and is to share in the proceeds of the action".160
"Agreements by which a stranger advances money for maintenance of lit-
igation with a view to obtaining an unconscionable gain are called cham-
pertous agreements." The MP High Court observed that in India there
is no law prohibiting champertous agreements as that in England. But a
number of High Courts in India have been of the view that the English
principle is applicable. In Harilal Nathalal Talati v Bhailal Pranlal Shah
the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court dealt with an agreement in
which a person had agreed to give half share of the property to the finan-
cier, valued at Rs 30,000 from such property as he might get whether by a
suit or by private settlement or in any other manner from his father's estate.
The court held that the agreement was extortionate and unconscionable and
opposed to public policy. An agreement which provided that the financier
should get 34 of the property was not regarded as reasonable or fair. 164 A fair
agreement to assist a person in the enforcement of his legal rights may be
held valid even if the person providing the assistance is to be reimbursed out
of the proceeds of the action. 165 Much, however, depends upon the quantum
of share which the financier has stipulated to get in the fruits of the action.
A stipulation for 3/4th share in the property, if recovered, has been held to
make the agreement champertous.166 On the other hand, in Ram Swarup
v Court of Wards,167 which went up to the Privy Council, the agreement
provided that the financier should bear all the expenses of the case and in
return therefore get a three-anna share of the immovable property recovered
provided that it should be increased to four annas, should the case go to the

Privy Council, the agreement was held to be valid. Similarly, agreements to
pay 3/6th share; 1/4th share and 1/8th share have been upheld. But an
agreement to pay 1/6th part of the property to be inherited has been held
to be unlawful. The estate being very vast, even 1/6th would net Rs 3 lakhs
for the promisee and this is exorbitant." Principles that ensure justice, fair
play, transparency, objectivity and probity in discharging public functions
are facets of public policy, i.e. any rule, contract or arrangement that is in
public good and public interest. 172 An agreement to pay to the financier 40
per cent of the value of the property in question or its sale proceeds was
held to be of champertous nature. 173 Where the property forming the sub-
ject-matter of litigation is agreed to be sold to the financier, the mere fact
that the consideration for the sale is inadequate, may not render the agree-
ment champertous.14
An agreement by a client to pay his lawyer according to the result of the
case is against public policy. "It is professional misconduct for an advocate
to stipulate for or agree with his client to accept as his fee or remuneration a
share of the property sued or other matter in litigation upon the successful
issue thereof."175 An agreement for solicitor retainership on the basis that
the solicitors' standard remuneration would be paid on successful cases and
there would be 20 per cent reduction of their fee for lost cases has been held
to be champertous. Neither the amount not paid, could be recovered, nor
the fee amounts already paid could be claimed back. The court said that a
contingency fee which is contrary to public policy is not confined to a direct
or indirect share of the spoils but it includes a differential fee dependent on
the outcome of the litigation.17
4. MARRIAGE BROKAGE CONTRACTS
An agreement to procure the marriage of a person in consideration of
a sum of money is called marriage brokage contract. Such agreements are

Unlawful agreements 285
High Courts, an agreement to pay money to the parent of a minor to induce
him to give the minor in marriage is void. Where, however, the money has
already been paid, but the marriage fails to go through, it has been held in a
few cases that the money may be taken back.181
An attempt to make gain of material nature out of a marriage would be
equally opposed to public policy. When a father or other guardian of a boy
or girl has to betroth his ward, his primary and only consideration ought
to be happiness and welfare of the child. The stipulating for a monetary
payment for himself is an incentive to the parent or other guardian to have
regard to other considerations than the child's happiness in marrying him
or her into another family. Such an agreement would clearly be invalid. 182
A decision of the Orissa High Court provides a suitable illustration:183
The defendant proposed the marriage of his widowed niece to the
plaintiff and offered to give her gold and jewels and land. The marriage
took place, but the defendant refused to fulfil the rest of his promise.
The court observed: We would like to make it clear at the outset that if
gifts or presents to the groom or the bride are made voluntarily it cannot be
attacked as anything immoral or opposed to public policy. But if pecuniary
gain is made the consideration of marriage, it is bound to be condemned as
reprehensible to all sense of decent morals. In the present case, monetary
gain was the sole consideration for the marriage between the two.184
Inter-caste marriage arrangements have been held to be valid.185
5. UNFAIR, UNREASONABLE OR UNCONSCIONABLE DEALINGS
[Dealings with employees]
Where the parties are not economically on equal footing and there is a
wide gap in the bargaining power of the parties, where one of them is in a
position to exploit and the other is vulnerable and the contract made with
that other is apparently unfair, it can in circumstances be also regarded
as opposed to public policy. For example, the Supreme Court laid down
in Central Inland Water Transport Corpn v Brojo Nath Ganguly that

CASE PILOT
[S. 23]
a Government corporation imposing upon a needy employee a term that
he can be removed just by three months' notice or pay in lieu of notice
and without any ground is an exploitation and every ruthless exploitation is
against public policy, 187 The Allahabad High Court distinguished this case
in Jagat Bahadur v District Supply Officer, Allahabad 188 where the contract
was for the allotment of a fair price shop for distribution of foodgrains and
it contained a clause for termination of the agreement and withdrawal of
the privilege without assigning any reasons. The same was held to be neither
opposed to public policy nor violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. A
person aspiring for the grant of a fair price shop is perfectly free not to enter
into such a contract because he has all the opportunities of trading in the
free foodgrain market. His position cannot be compared with that of an
employee.189
A rule permitting administrators of Board of Control for Cricket in India
(BCCI) to have commercial interest in events conducted by BCCI was held
to be capable of defeating high ideals of fairness and objectivity in discharge
of a public function and therefore opposed to public policy. It is liable to
be struck down. The court said that principles that ensure justice, fair play,
transparency, objectivity and probity in discharge of public functions are
facets of public policy. A rule, contract or arrangement which is in public
good and interest cannot be regarded as opposed to public policy.10
Surreptitious transfer of shares
In reference to the conduct of public financial institutions holding shares
in companies, it has been held by the Supreme Court that a surreptitious
transfer of a bulk of shares in one company without caring to see whether it
would result in the creation of a monopoly adverse to public interest, if it is
done with a mala fide intention, the deal would be illegal.191
(Guj), the courts would strike down and refuse to enforce contracts which are unfair and
unreasonable and employee is not in apposition of an equal bargaining power. A term which
prevents an employee from enforcing his legal rights is taken to be contrary to public policy.

Parties with matching bargaining powers
As between parties whose bargaining power is fairly matched and the
standard contract with all its clauses has not only been duly signed but also
is one which has been widely used over the years, this will create a presump-
tion of fairness.192 Where experienced businessmen are involved in a com-
mercial contract and there is no inequality of bargaining power, the agreed
terms must ordinarily be respected as the parties must be taken to have had
regard to the matters known to them. The sellers and buyers in this case
were businessmen and they had agreed on all the terms on the basis that they
were in conformity with international trade and commerce. The clause for
reimbursement for or repayment of the price if the seller could not deliver
the goods within the specified time was neither unreasonable nor unjust.
It was also not extravagant. The Supreme Court said that the arbitration.
award on its basis could not be regarded as contrary to public policy,193
A clause enabling the contracting authority to vary the quantum of work
upwards or downwards to be computed by adding up all variations both
upwards and downwards has been held to be based on good reasons and
there is nothing unconsionable if the power is exercised for legitimate caus-
es. 194 A clause in a contract of hiring of three vessels for a period of three
years entitled the hirer to terminate the agreement after one year without
assigning any reason. The clause was held to be not unconscionable or
opposed to public policy. It was also covered by Section 14(1)(c) and (e) of
the Specific Relief Act, 1963.195
In the opinion of the Karnataka High Court 1% in order to attract
Section 23 of the Act, it is not necessary that the contract should be tainted
with illegality. It would be enough if it contains terms which are so unfair
and unreasonable that they shock the conscience of the court. But this gen-
eral observation has been held to be not applicable where a guarantor agrees
not to claim the benefit of Sections 133, 134, 135, 139 and 141 of the Act
which give to the guarantor certain protective rights. Such rights being var-
iable with the consent of the surety, there is no violation of the Act if he
agrees not to claim any of those rights. 197

VOID AGREEMENTS
Giving the meaning of a void agreement, the Act says in Section 2(g):
An agreement not enforceable by law is said to be void.
The following types of agreement are declared to be void:
(1) Agreements of which consideration and objects are unlawful in part,
[S. 24]
(2) Agreements without consideration, [S. 25]
(3) Agreements in restraint of marriage, [S. 26]
(4) Agreements in restraint of trade, [S. 27]
(5) Agreements in restraint of legal proceedings, [S. 28]
(6) Unmeaning agreements, [S. 29]
(7) Wagering agreements, [S. 30] and
(8) Agreements to do impossible acts. [S. 56]
Agreements in which a part of consideration or object is unlawful
S.24. Agreements void, if considerations and objects unlawful in
part. If any part of a single consideration for one or more objects, or any one
or any part of any one of several considerations for a single object, is unlawful,
the agreement is void.
236, assignment of copyright is permissible even under the Copyright Act and, therefore,
there was nothing contrary to public policy in such assignments. Thakar Kanaiyalal Rasiklal
v State of Gujarat, AIR 2003 Guj 14, under a settlement, the plaintiffs were allowed to
perform pooja for 20 years in a temple. They enjoyed that right but after the expiry of 20
years, they claimed a hereditary right to continue pooja. The court said that the claim was
barred by Order 23, Rule 1, CPC and was also against the principles of public policy. K.E.
Aboobacker v Vasu P.P., 2004 AIHC 551 (Ker): AIR 2004 NOC 262 (Ker) demand of pre-
mium (pakidi) by landlord for giving premises was held to be not only penal but also against
morals and public policy. Rohit Dhawan v G.K. Malhotra, AIR 2002 Del 151, doctrine of

Void agreements 289
Illustration
A promises to superintend, on behalf of B, a legal manufacturer of Indigo, and an illegal
traffic in other articles. B promises to pay A, a salary of 10,000 rupees a year. The agreement is
void, the object of A's promise, and the consideration for B's promise, being in part unlawful.
The working philosophy behind the provision was stated by WILLES J
in these words:201 Where you cannot sever the illegal from the legal part of
a covenant the contract is altogether void, but where you can sever them
whether the illegality be created by statute or by common law, you may
reject the bad part and retain the good.
The section comes into play when a part of the consideration for an object
or more than one objects of an agreement is unlawful. The whole of the
agreement would be void unless unlawful portion can be severed without
damaging the lawful portion. A promises to pay a fixed sum of money on
monthly basis to a married woman for living in adultery with the prom-
isor, which is unlawful, and for keeping his house, which is lawful, the
whole agreement was held to be void because it was impossible to apportion
the single lump sum between the lawful object and the unlawful one. 202 A
licence was granted to a person for sale of opium and ganja with this restric-
tion that he would not take any partner in the ganja business without the
permission of the collector. Without such permission he admitted a partner
into the whole business on receiving from him a fixed sum as his share of
capital. Differences arose between them. The new entrant filed a case for
dissolution and refund of his money. His claim was not allowed. The court
said that "it is impossible to separate the contract or to say how much capital
was advanced for the opium and how much for the ganja".203 A Municipal
Corporation granted to a contractor for a lump sum the licence to collect toll
from pilgrims and vehicles and animals. It had no power to authorise col-
lection of fees from pilgrims. The whole transaction was held to be void.204
Where the legal part of an agreement is severable from the illegal, the
former would be enforced. A Muslim husband agreed by a registered deed
to handover to his wife the totality of his earnings and not to do anything
without her permission and, if he did so, she would be at liberty to divorce
him. The latter part of the agreement was unlawful. It was severed from
that part under which he promised to handover all earnings and this part
was enforced giving it this meaning that he was bound to give only mainte-
nance amount and not every bit that he might earn. 205 Transactions arising

separately from the illegal act, they would be valid, they would remain valid
and enforceable notwithstanding the illegality of the agreement. 206
A prohibition of forward transactions in securities was held to be not
applicable upon that part of the transaction which was for ready delivery
(spot delivery), this part being separable from the other part.207 If a contract
is, on the face of it, capable of legal performance, the fact that one party
was entertaining an undisclosed intention of performing it unlawfully or of
using it as a part of an unlawful scheme, would not disentitle the other party
from enforcing it. If there is any doubt about the real nature or purport of
the agreement, that construction should be preferred which admits of lawful
performance. The fact that one party entertains the motive of defeating the
execution of the decree which may be passed against him is immaterial.208
Agreements without consideration [S. 25]
Section 25 declares that an agreement without consideration is void. This
is, of course, subject to a few exceptions, which have already been consid-
ered along with "consideration".
Restraint of marriage [S. 26]
S. 26. Agreement in restraint of marriage void.-Every agreement in
restraint of the marriage of any person, other than a minor, is void.
It is the policy of law to discourage agreements which restrain freedom
of marriage. The restraint may be general or partial, that is to say, the party
may be restrained from marrying at all, or from marrying for a fixed period,
or from marrying a particular person, or a class of persons, the agreement
is void. The only exception is in favour of a minor.209
A penalty upon remarriage may not be construed as a restraint of mar-
riage. Thus, an agreement between two co-widows that if any of them
remarried, she should forfeit her right to her share in the deceased hus-
band's property has been upheld, the court pointing out that no restraint
was imposed upon either of the two widows for remarriage. "All that was
provided was that if a widow elected to remarry, she would be deprived of
her rights."210 Similarly, agreements that upon remarriage, the widow would
lose the right to maintenance and upon the husband marrying a second
wife, the first would get the right to divorce him, have been upheld.212

Restraint of trade 291
RESTRAINT OF TRADE [S. 27]
S. 27. Agreement in restraint of trade void.-Every agreement by which
any one is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of
any kind, is to that extent void.
Exception 1.-Saving of agreement not to carry on business of which
goodwill is sold.-One who sells the goodwill of a business may agree with
the buyer to refrain from carrying on a similar business, within specified local
limits, so long as the buyer, or any person deriving title to the goodwill from
him, carries on a like business therein:
Provided that such limits appear to the Court reasonable, regard being had
to the nature of the business.
Protection of freedom of trade and commerce
Freedom of trade and commerce is a right protected by the Constitution
of India. Just as the Legislature cannot take away individual freedom of
trade, so also the individual cannot barter it away by agreement. "The prin-
ciple of law is this: Public policy requires that every man shall be at liberty to
work for himself, and shall not be at liberty to deprive himself or the State of
his labour, skill or talent, by any contract that he enters into."213 "Every man
should have unfettered liberty to exercise his powers and capacities for his
own and the community's benefit."214 Section 27, therefore, declares in plain
terms that: Every agreement by which any one is restrained from exercising
a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is, to that extent, void. 215
All restraints covered whether partial or general
Madhub Chander v Raj Coomar216 is the first case in which the scope of
the section came up for consideration before the Calcutta High Court.
The plaintiff and the defendant were rival shopkeepers in a locality in
Calcutta. The defendant agreed to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff if
he would close his business in that locality. The plaintiff accordingly did
so, but the defendant refused to pay.
The plaintiff sued him for the money contending that the restraint in
question was only partial as he was restrained from exercising his profession
only in one locality and that such restraints had been upheld in English law.
COUCH J, however, held the agreement to be void and laid down: The words
"restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business", do not

mean an absolute restriction, and are intended to apply to a partial restric-
tion, a restriction limited to some place. 217
The learned judge drew support from the use of the word "absolutely"
in Section 28, which deals with restraint of legal proceedings. As this word
is absent from Section 27, therefore, he concluded, that it was intended to
prevent not merely a total restraint but also a partial restraint. This interpre-
tation of the section has been generally accepted. "The section has abolished
the distinction between partial and total restraints of trade. Whether the
restraint is general or partial, unqualified or qualified, if the agreement is in
the nature of a restraint of trade, it is void." Thus, an agreement to close a
mill for 3 months in a year,218 and an agreement that one party would sell
beef for 14 days in a month and the other for the rest of the month, 219 have
been held void.
Developments in English Law
In England the law relating to restraint of trade was elaborately consid-
ered by the House of Lords in Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns &
Ammunition Co.220
The case involved a sale of goodwill by an inventor and a manufacturer
of guns and ammunition who agreed with the buyer company: (1) not to
practise the same trade for 25 years, and (2) not to engage in any business
competing or liable to compete in any way with the business for the time
being carried on by the company. He afterwards entered into agreement
with another manufacturer of guns and ammunition and the company
brought an action to restrain him.
It was held that first part of the agreement was valid being reasonably
necessary for the protection of the purchaser's interest. But the rest of the
covenant by which he was prohibited from competing with the company
in any business that the company might carry on was held as unreasonable
and, therefore, void. Lord MACNAGHTEN laid down: "The public have an
interest in every person's carrying on his trade freely: so has the individual.
All interference with individual liberty of action in trading, and all restraints.
of trade of themselves, if there is nothing more, are contrary to public pol-
icy and, therefore, void. That is the general rule. But there are exceptions.
Restraint of trade... may be justified by the special circumstances of a par-
ticular case. The only justification is that the restriction should be reason-
able-reasonable in reference to the interest of the parties and reasonable
in reference to the public interest. The restriction should be so framed and

guarded as to afford adequate protection to the party in whose favour it is
imposed while at the same time it is in no way injurious to the public."
General principle in India and England same
Thus both in England and in India the general principle is the same,
namely, that all restraints of trade whether partial or total, are void. 221 The
only difference is that in England a restriction will be valid if it is reasonable.
In India it will be valid if it falls within any of the statutory, or judicially cre-
ated exceptions. To the extent to which these exceptions are an embodiment
of the situations in which restraints have been found reasonable in England,
the two laws are identical and not "widely dissimilar",222 The English law
may be a little more flexible as the word "reasonable" enables the courts to
adapt it to changing conditions. As Lord WILBERFORCE remarked in Esso
Petroleum Co Ltd v Harper's Garage (Stourport) Ltd223 "the classification
(of agreements in restraint of trade) must remain fluid and the categories
can never be closed". The following passage in a judgment of the Supreme
Court 224 shows the effect of absence of the test of "reasonableness": "The
question of reasonableness of restraint is outside the purview of Section 27
of the Contract Act and need not be gone into. Therefore, the present case
has to be proceeded on the basis that an enquiry into reasonableness of
the restraint is not envisaged by Section 27. On that view, instead of being
required to consider two questions225 as in England, the courts in India have
221. See, for example, Chitty on CONTRACT (GENERAL PRINCIPLES) (21st Edn) 481-82, where
the learned writer says that "all contracts in restraint of trade are prima facie void, unless
they are reasonable." For Indian authority see PIGOT and MCPHELSON JJ in Nur Ali Dubash
v Abdul Ali, ILR (1892) 19 Cal 765, 773, "S. 27 does away with the distinction between
partial and total restraints of trade."
222. MOOKERJEE and CARNDUFF JJ in Sk Kalu v Ram Saran Bhagat, (1909) 8 CWN 388, 392.
The learned Judges said that as a result of the decision in the Nordenfelt case "the rule as
embodied in S. 27 presents an almost startling dissimilarity to the most modern phase of the
English rule on the subject".

224. Gujarat Bottling Co Ltd v Coca Cola Co, (1995) 5 SCC 545; AIR 1995 SC 2372: (1995) 84
Comp Cas 618.
225. The following passage in the judgment of the Supreme Court (ibid.) explains the position
of two questions under English law: "Under the common law in England traditionally the
doctrine of restraint of trade applied to covenants whereby an employee undertakes not to
compete with his employer after leaving the employer's service and covenants by which a
trader who has sold his business agrees not thereafter to compete with the purchaser of the
business. The doctrine is, however, not confined in its application to these two categories but
covenants falling in these two categories are always subjected to the test of reasonableness.
The general principle once applicable to agreements in restraint of trade has consequently
been considerably modified by later decisions in England. The rule now is that restraints,
whether general or partial, may be good if they are reasonable and any restraint on the
freedom of contract must be shown to be reasonably necessary for the purpose of freedom of
trade. A covenant in restraint of trade must be reasonable with reference to the public policy
and it must also be reasonably necessary for the protection of the interest of the covenantee
and regard must be had to the interests of the covenantor. Contracts in restraint of trade
are prima facie void and the onus of proof is on the party supporting the contract to show
that the restraint goes no further than is reasonably necessary to protect the interest of the

[S. 27]
only to consider the question whether the contract is or is not in restraint of
trade."
"Profession, trade or business"
But the Indian courts have not been rendered entirely sterile in the mat-
ter. 226 Thus, for example, where it was necessary to do so, the High Court
of Kutch regarded an agreement to monopolise the privilege of performing
religious services in a village as being opposed to public policy and void
under Section 27,227 though it may be doubted whether the words "profes-
sion, trade or business" as used in the section were intended to cover the
religious services of a priest. On the other hand, the Allahabad High Court
in Pothi Ram v Islam Fatima228 upheld as valid a restrictive covenant on
the ground that the activity restrained was not in the nature of "profession,
trade or business".
Two landlords in the same neighbourhood, in order to avoid competi-
tion, agreed that a market for sale of cattle shall not be held on the same
day on the lands of both of them.
The High Court said: "It seems to us that a landlord who in return for
tolls or fees, allows a cattle market to be conducted on his land is not thereby
exercising trade or business of selling cattle. He is only a landholder and an
agreement on his part not to use the land on a certain day for a certain pur-
pose does not amount to restraint of 'profession, trade or business"."
The strange contrast in these two cases is that while letting out land for
commercial purposes is not a "profession, trade or business", the perfor-
mance of religious services is.
The Madras High Court took the lead provided by the Allahabad High
Court and came to the conclusion that submission of tenders for the purpose
of obtaining a contract is not "a trade or calling".229
covenantee and if this onus is discharged the onus of showing that the restraint is neverthe-
less injurious to the public is on the party attacking the contract. The court has to decide, as
a matter of law, (i) whether a contract is or is not in restraint of trade, and (ii) whether, if in
restraint of trade, it is reasonable. Instead of segregating two questions, (i) whether the con-
tract is in restraint of trade, (ii) whether, if so, is it 'reasonable', the courts have often fused
the two by asking whether the contract is in 'undue restraint of trade' or by a compound
finding that it is not satisfied that this contract is really in restraint of trade at all but, if it is,
is it reasonable." Another aspect of this case was, that one of the terms of the agreement with
the company was that its shareholders would not transfer their shares during the currency of
the agreement. This was held to be not hit by S. 27 because shareholders were not parties to
the agreement and the company had no means to prevent them from selling their shares.
226. See, Sandhya Organic Chemicals P Ltd v United Phosphorus Ltd, AIR 1997 Guj 177, where
the court observed that the principles of English common law can be used where the statu-
tory provisions cannot be understood without the aid of English law, but not beyond that.

Restraint of trade 295
A postal authority invited tenders for licence for carrying mails.
The plaintiff, a bus owner, abstained from tendering on the promise of
the defendant, another bus owner, to pay him some money. The latter
obtained the contract but refused to pay the money.
The court said that tendering to obtain a contract is not in the nature of
a trade or calling. The court compared the case with an agreement between
intending bidders and said that such an agreement was considered as being
not opposed to public policy in a few previous cases. 230 Special stress was
laid upon a decision of the Privy Council where it was held that a court
sale by public auction does not become void if a person had deterred others
from bidding,231 But, it is submitted with respect, that the decision is not
an authority for the proposition that the collusion agreement between the
bidders is itself valid and enforceable. In the United States such agreements
have been held illegal.232
When the Madras High Court faced a problem of this kind again in a sub-
sequent case, it reluctantly held that "the precedents are far too numerous
to be got over, even if one should be disposed to disagree with the underly-
ing reasoning therein". The facts were that on an auction sale of fishery, the
villagers colluded that only one of them shall bid for all of them and thereby
the public authority was misguided as to the real value of the fishery. The
agreement between the villagers was held to be valid.234
All these matters had subsequently to be taken in the light of the provi-
sion in Section 33(1)(b) of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices
Act, 1969 [now repealed] to the effect that an agreement as to making of
bids, or excluding a person from bidding, at an auction for sale of goods,
shall be a restrictive trade practice and, therefore, void unless it was neces
sary in public interest as spelled out in Section 38 of that Act. Now by the
virtue of this clause, such collusive agreements can be held to be void unless
they are necessary in public interest within the meaning of Section 38. The
clause is wide enough to cover cases of secret agreements as to participation

232. See RESTATEMENT OF THE LAW OF CONTRACT, Ch. 18, p. 1002, where the rule is thus stated:
"A bargain not to bid at an auction, or any public competition for a sale or contract, having
as its primary object to stiffle competition, is illegal". Illustration 1 given in the Restatement
is as follows: "A and B attending an auction of curious, make mutual promises by which
each agrees to refrain from bidding for specified articles in order that the other may acquire
them too cheaply. The agreement is illegal." Illustration 4 comes very close to the facts of
the Madras case: "A advertises for bids for the construction of a building. B, a contractor,
promises $1000 each to C and D if they will refrain from bidding. They do so. The bargains
are illegal."
233. Pattipati Ramalingaiah v Nagulagunta Subbarami, AIR 1951 Mad 390.
234. Following this, it has been held by the P&H High Court in Sujan Singh Sadhana v Mohkam
Chand Jain, AIR 1983 P&H 180, that an agreement between two bidders not to bid against
each other with an understanding that the successful bidder would convey half the property
to the others is not against public policy.

in an auction according to pre-planned terms. Though collusive tendering
has not been specifically included in the clause, it is likely to be covered by
the wide ambit of the clause because it is often difficult to distinguish an
auction from a tender when secret bids are invited in the shape of tenders.
For example, in the Perfect Circle Victor Ltd case235 the MRTP Commission
issued cease and desist orders against three respondents manufacturing gas-
kets who were acting in concert by quoting the same or identical prices
against tenders floated by the Director General of Supplies and Disposals.
Though the MRTP Act has been repealed, these decisions are likely to
remain valid because of the parallel provisions in Sections 3 to 6 of the
Competition Act, 2002 which is a replacement of its predecessor MRTP Act.
Knock-out agreements
In United Kingdom, the "knock-out" agreements are covered by the
Auctions (Bidding Agreements) Act, 1927. The Act provides that if any
dealer agrees to give or gives or offers any gift or consideration to any other
person as an inducement or reward for abstaining or having abstained from
bidding at a sale by auction, either generally or for any particular lot or if
any person agrees to accept or accepts or attempts to obtain from any dealer
any such gift or consideration as aforesaid, he shall be guilty of offence
under the Act. There is no special provision relating to collusive tender-
ing or bidding in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1976. But it seems
clear that such bid agreements fall within Sections 6(1)(a) and 11(2)(a) of the
Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1976, as relating to the prices to be quoted
for goods or services.236 The agreement by which parties confer authority
upon an association, or an individual, to adjust prices which they are to
quote are also within these provisions.
In a case of this kind, P&H High Court stated thus:237
"An agreement between 'A' and 'B' to purchase certain property at an
auction sale jointly and not to bid against each other at the auction is per-
fectly lawful, though the object may be to avoid competition between the
two. However, if there is an agreement among all the competing bidders
at the auction and they formed a ring to peg down price and to purchase
the Government largess at knock-out price, the purpose or design of the
agreement is to defraud the Government and then it can be said that there

53, three respondents who were major manufacturers of aluminium phosphide quoted iden-
tical rates in response to tenders floated by Food Corporation of India and reduced the rates
by an identical amount during negotiations, the Commission passed cease and desist orders.
236. The report of the UK Monopolies Commission noted that any communication of prices
between competitors and still more any adjustment of the amounts of tenders by arrange-
ment between bidders would frustrate the purpose of the system of tendering. Since such
tenders cease to be independent offers as they are held out to be, the practices are prima facie
contrary to public interest.

is an implied injury to the Government. The public policy is not static.
It is variable with the changing times and the needs of the society. The
march of law must match with the fact situation. A contract which does
not cause any loss to the Government or the public authority, nor there is
anything to infer that the bidders had formed a ring to peg down the price
at an auction sale, the auction cannot be invalidated or cannot be said to
be injurious to public interest or public welfare or fraudulent to defeat the
rights of the Government or the local authority."
In the US the practice of collusive tendering attracts the general provision
of Section 1 of the Sherman Act which provides that every contract, combi-
nation or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce is illegal.
Restrictions for long period
The principle of the Nordenfelt case was applied by the House of Lords in
McEllistrim v Ballymacelligott Coop Agricultural & Diary Society where
an agreement contained in the rules of a society by which a former member
agreed that for an unlimited time he would sell all the milk he produced to a
creamery run by the society was held to be invalid. The doctrine of restraint
of trade has been reconsidered by the House of Lords in Esso Petroleum
Co Ltd v Harper's Garage (Stourport) Ltd.239 In this case, their Lordships
struck down an exclusive dealing agreement because it extended to a period
of 21 years, which was unreasonable. A five-year period would have been
held to be reasonable. In holding that the doctrine applied to exclusive deal-
ing agreements they opened up the possibility that it might be extended to
every sort of contract because all contracts must need involve a restraint of
some sort. They said that the doctrine applied only if a man contracted to
give up some existing freedom which he had, 240
Restriction upon use of trade mark
A restraint upon the use of a trade mark does not attract Section 27, it
being not a restriction upon carrying on any trade or business. The trade
mark was the subject-matter of the dispute. 241
Restrictions in lease
Restrictions contained in a lease agreement as to the uses to which the
premises can be put and what business would be done and in what name and
style have been held to be not violative of Section 27,242

298 Chapter 7 Legality of Object
EXCEPTIONS
[S. 27]
There are two kinds of exceptions to the rule, those created by statutes
and those arising from judicial interpretation of Section 27.
Statutory exceptions
1. Sale of goodwill
The only exception mentioned in the proviso to Section 27 of the Contract
Act is that relating to sale of goodwill. It is thus stated:
One who sells the goodwill of a business may agree with the buyer to refrain
from carrying on a similar business, within specified local limits, so long as the
buyer, or any person deriving title to the goodwill from him, carries on a like
business therein:
Provided that such limits appear to the court reasonable, regard being had to
the nature of the business.
Apparently the object is to protect the interest of a purchaser of goodwill.
"It is difficult to imagine that when the goodwill and trade of a retail shop
were sold, the vendor might the next day set up a shop within a few doors
and draw off all customers."243 Therefore, some restriction on the liberty of
the seller becomes necessary. Indeed, the restriction is the only "means by
which a saleable value is given to the goodwill of a business".244 Far from
being adverse to public interest, the restriction, by giving a real marketable
value to the goodwill of a business, operates as an additional inducement to
individuals to employ their skills and capital in trade and thus tend to the
advantage of public interest.
MEANING OF GOODWILL.-There should be a real goodwill to be sold.
"Goodwill" being an abstract property, is not easy to define. In the words
of Lord ELDON:
The goodwill which has been the subject of sale is nothing more than
the probability that the old customer will resort to old place.245
But in the opinion of Lord MACNAGHTEN, as expressed in a subsequent
case, goodwill means much more than this: Often it happens that goodwill
is the very sap and life of the business, without which the business would
yield little or no profits. It is the whole advantage, whatever it may be, of the
reputation and connection of firm, which may have been built up by years
of honest work or gained by lavish expenditure of money, 246

Exceptions 299
These opinions were adopted by the Judicial Committee in an appeal
from a decision of the Calcutta High Court. 247
The plaintiff and the defendant were carrying on business as carriers
of passengers by boats. The plaintiff sold his business to the defendant for
a sum of money and agreed to abstain from carrying on a boat business
there for a period of three years.
The suit was brought to recover the promised sum. Allowing the plain-
tiff's action Lord HALDANE said: "Their Lordships entertain no doubt that
what took place was the sale of goodwill within the meaning put on the
expression in such cases as Trego v Hunt."
Where the aim of an agreement is prevention of competition, it will be
void even if its nakedness is concealed behind the "imposing facade of a
sale" of goodwill. An attempt of this kind was in evidence in Vancouver
Malt & Sake Brewing Co Ltd v Vancouver Breweries Ltd.24
A company was licensed to manufacture liquor and beer but it con-
fined its business to produce only 'sake', a Japanese liquor made from
rice. Its only customer was the Government. It entered into an agreement
with another wine and beer manufacturing company by which it sold its
business and goodwill of manufacturing wine and beer, but not the right
to produce sake.
The agreement was held to be devoid of any content. "The only business
in which it was engaged was the brewing of sake, and the goodwill of its
licence so far as relating to sake was expressly excluded from sale. It had
no goodwill to sell so far as regards the brewing of beer. Nothing has been
sold. It is simply a case of the appellant undertaking to the respondent in
consideration of a sum of money that it will not for 15 years carry on a
particular branch of business. If there was any sale, it was a sale by the
appellant of its liberty to brew beer and a purchase by the respondent of pro-
tection against the possible competition of the appellant in the brewing of
beer." Lord MACMILLAN then referred to the judgment of Lord Chancellor
BIRKENHEAD in McEllistrim v Ballymacelligott Coop Agricultural & Dairy
Society, 29 that "the respondents were not entitled to be protected against
mere competition", and continued to say that "covenants restrictive of com-
petition which have been sustained have all been ancillary to some main
transaction, and have been found justified because they were reasonably
necessary to render that transaction effective.
LIMITS OF RESTRAINT.-The agreement has to specify the local limits.
of the restraint. The seller can be restrained within certain territorial or
geographical limits and the limits must be reasonable. Reasonableness of

restrictions will depend upon many factors, for example, the area in which
the goodwill is effectively enjoyed and the price paid for it.250
The seller can only be restrained from carrying on a similar business and
also only for such period for which the business sold is actually carried on
either by the buyer or by any person deriving title to the goodwill from him.
2. Partnership Act
There are four provisions in the Partnership Act which validate agree-
ments in restraint of trade. Section 11 enables partners during the continu-
ance of the firm to restrict their mutual liberty by agreeing that none of them
shall carry on any business other than that of the firm. 25: Section 36 enables
them to restrain an outgoing partner from carrying on a similar business
within a specified period or within specified local limits. Such agreement
shall be valid if the restrictions imposed are reasonable. A similar agreement
may be made by partners upon or in anticipation of dissolution by which
they may restrain each other from carrying on a business similar to that of
the firm,252
It is necessary for the validity of a restraint under Section 36 or 54 that--
(1) the agreement should specify the local limits or the period of
restraint, and
(2) the restriction imposed must be reasonable. 253
An agreement by a retiring partner not to carry on similar business on the
land belonging to him and adjoining the factory of the firm, has been held
to be reasonable and binding on the persons buying the land from him.254
Under judicial interpretation
1. Trade combinations
It is now almost a universal practice for traders or manufacturers in the
same line of business to carry on their trade in an organised way,255 Thus,
there are combinations of ice manufacturers, 256 grain merchants, sugar pro-
ducers,217 etc. The primary object of such associations is to regulate busi-
ness and not to restrain it. Combinations of this kind are often desirable.
in the interest of trade itself and also for the promotion of public interest.

Exceptions 301
They bring about standardised goods, fixed prices and eliminate ruinous
competition. Thus, "regulations as to the opening and closing of business
in the market, licensing of traders, supervision and control of dealers and
the mode of dealing are not illegal, "258 even if there is incidental deprivation
of trade liberty. But the courts would not allow a restraint to be imposed
disguised as trade regulations. Thus, an agreement between certain persons
to carry on business with the members of their caste only, and an agree-
ment to restrict the business of a sugar mill within a zone allotted to it, have
been held void. 240 An agreement between two companies that one would not
employ the former employees of the other has been held to be void by reason
of its generality. This was the situation in Kores Mfg Co Ltd v Kolok Mfg
Co Ltd,261
Both companies were engaged in manufacturing similar products
involving technical processes in which the employees were likely to
acquire knowledge of trade secrets and confidential information. The
companies agreed that neither would employ, without the written consent
of the other, any person who had been the employee of the other for any
time during the previous five years.
Though the agreement was between two employers who were dealing at
arm's length and on equal terms, it was held to be void. It prohibited the
appointment of any person by any one company or the other who had been
in the service of one or the other for any period, however short, and in any
capacity, however humble. The ban was applicable as much to an unskilled
manual labourer who might have been employed even for a single day as to
a highly skilled and long-term employee, as much to a dismissed servant as
to one who might have resigned; as much to a lay employee as to one who
might have acquired confidential knowledge.
Agreements as to regulation of prices and output are generally upheld as
valid. Thus in a Bombay case:262
Four ginning factories entered into an agreement fixing uniform rate
for ginning cotton, and pooling their earnings to be divided between
them in certain proportions.
The action was for division of profits and there being nothing in the
agreement against Section 27, it was allowed.
Referring to the other part of the agreement, which fixed uniform rates,
FARREN CJ said that an agreement of this description whereby traders agree
amongst themselves to sell their wares at a fixed price, or labourers so agree
to labour only at the stipulated wage have in the English courts usually been

held void. But CANDY J disagreed with him. He believed that the apparent
object was to prevent competition.263
The question again arose in S.B. Fraser & Co v Bombay Ice Mfg Co.264
An agreement between certain ice manufacturers fixed the minimum
price for sale of ice, the proportion of the manufacture which each was
to bear and of profits which each was to receive, some of them were
restrained from selling at Poona and some others at steamers.
RUSSEL J held that the agreement was not within the terms of Section 27,
the whole object being to regulate business and not to restrain it.265
The Allahabad High Court faced the problem in Bhola Nath Shankar
Das v Lachmi Narain, 266
The rules of an association of traders and weighmen provided that
members shall not deal with outsiders, the penalty for breach being fine
and expulsion. The legality of the association was attacked on the ground
that its objects and methods were unlawful as it aimed at the creation of a
monopoly by shutting out all competition and was a defiance of the spirit
of Sections 23 and 27.
Rejecting this contention, SEN J quoted Baron ALDERSON in Hilton v
Eckersley267 as saying: "prima facie it is the privilege of a trader in a free
country in all matters not contrary to law, to regulate his own mode of car-
rying it on according to his own discretion and choice."264
2. Solus or exclusive dealing agreements
Another business practice in vogue is that a producer or manufacturer
likes to market his goods through a sole agent or distributor and the latter
agrees in turn not to deal with the goods of any other manufacturer. A pro-
ducer may, for example, agree to sell all his output to one consumer who, in
turn, agrees not to buy his requirements from any other source. As long as
the negative stipulation is nothing but an ordinary incident of or ancillary
to the positive covenant, there is hardly anything obnoxious to Section 27.

McGregor Gow & Co, (1889) LR 23 QBD 598 (CA), "it seems it was no more in restraint of
trade than if two tailors in a village agreed to give their customers five per cent in their bills
on Christmas on condition of their customers dealing with them and them only". Followed
by the Allahabad High Court in Kubernath v Mohate Ram, ILR (1912) 26 ILR All 587. Now
this has to be taken in the light of the provisions of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade
Practices Act, 1969, [now repealed] which provide in S. 33(1)(d) that price fixation for goods
or service is deemed to be a restrictive trade practice unless it was saved by S. 38 of that Act
which permits certain restrictions in public interest. MRTP Act has now been superseded by
the Competition Act, 2002. Ss. 3 to 6 are now the relevant provisions.

Exceptions 303
Indeed "in one sense, every agreement for sale of goods whether in esse or
in posse is a contract in restraint of trade for, if AB agrees to sell goods to
CD, he precludes himself from selling them to anybody else",269 Thus, an
agreement by a manufacturer of dhotis to supply 1,36,000 pairs of certain
description to the defendant and not to sell goods of that kind to any other
person for a fixed period; an agreement by a person to sell all the salt
manufactured by him to a firm for five years;271 an agreement by a person
to send all the mica produced by him to the plaintiffs, and not to send them
to any other firm, nor to keep any in stock272 and an agreement by a buyer
of goods for Calcutta market, not to sell them in Madras, have all been
held to be outside the scope of Section 27 and therefore valid. Such negative
stipulations do not have the effect of restraining the manufacturer. "On the
contrary, he is encouraged to exercise his business because he is assured of a
certain market for the products of his labour."273
But where a manufacturer or supplier, after meeting all the requirements
of a buyer, has surplus to sell to others, he cannot be restrained from doing
so. The buyer cannot restrain the seller from dealing with others unless he
can acquire the whole stock during the period of the agreement. The court
may not countenance the agreement particularly where the buyer intends to
corner or monopolise the commodity so that he may resell at his own price
or where he binds the seller for an unreasonable period of time. Thus, in
Shaikh Kalu v Ram Saran Bhagat:275
A seller of combs entered into an agreement with all the manufacturers
of combs in the city of Patna whereby the latter undertook during their
lifetime to sell all their products to R.S., and to his heirs and not to sell
the same to any one else.
Holding the agreement void under Section 27, the court said: "It bound
the manufacturers from generation to generation; it was unrestricted both as
to time and place; it was oppressive; it was intended to create a monopoly."276
The House of Lords has held that 21-year period of exclusive dealing
would be unreasonably long. The case before their Lordships was Esso
Petroleum Co Ltd v Harper's Garage (Stourport) Ltd.277
Esso Co had an agreement with two garages which was to bind one for
about four and a half years and the other for 21 years. During this period

they had to buy the whole of their requirements from Esso and to operate
the garages in accordance with Esso co-operation plan. The garage which
was bound for 21 years was also mortgaged to Esso against a loan which
was repayable in instalments lasting for 21 years and not earlier.
The House of Lords unanimously held that the agreement fell within the
sphere to which the doctrine of restraint applies and the period of 21 years
being not reasonable, it was void, but the tie with the other garage for four
years and five months was reasonable. Lord PEARCE laid down: "The doc-
trine does not apply to ordinary commercial contracts for the regulation
and promotion of trade during the existence of the contract provided that
any prevention of work outside the contract viewed as a whole is directed
towards absorption of the parties' services and not their sterilisation. Sole
agencies are a normal and necessary incident of commerce, and those who
desire the benefit of a sole agency must deprive themselves the opportunities
of other agencies. So too, in the case of a film star who may tie himself to at
company in order to obtain from them the benefits of stardom."278
Where a contract is reasonable and fair at the beginning, but circum-
stances have arisen which show that it is being enforced by one party in a
manner which is prejudicial to the interest of the other, the courts will hold
the agreement to be unenforceable, though not void or invalid. This opinion
has been expressed by the Court of Appeal in Shell U.K. Ltd v Lostock
Garages Ltd.279
A petrol pump was tied to Shell for a period which the court found to
be reasonable. Subsequently, on account of a sharp rise in petrol prices
sales suffered and in order to counteract this, some of the petroleum com-
panies encouraged their pumps to cut prices. The Shell Company did not
do so, but instead adopted a support plan to compensate their pumps for
losses suffered by them in selling at competitive prices. This support plan
did not apply to Lostock because his sales had not suffered to the extent
contemplated by the support plan. Lostock attempted to get supplies from
other companies and an injunction was sought against him. No injunc-
tion was, however, granted.
Lord DENNING MR first remarked that "it is now settled beyond doubt
that a solus agreement is a contract in restraint of trade. As such it comes
within that special class in which the courts can investigate the terms of the
contract and see whether they are fair and reasonable. If they are unfair and
unreasonable, the courts may refuse to enforce them". His Lordship found
that there was nothing unreasonable in the contract, it being only for five
years. "At that time the parties did not anticipate that circumstances would
arise in which Shell would subsidise neighbouring garages to such an extent

as to force Lostock to trade at a loss. That contingency was so improbable
and extravagant that it would not invalidate the tie at the time it was made."
His Lordship then laid down that the court should not enforce a covenant
in restraint of trade if circumstances afterwards arise in which it would be
unreasonable or unfair to enforce it.
An agency for sale of the goods of a German company in India which
carried a term restraining the Indian company from selling goods for five
years after the termination of the contract was held to be not enforceable. 280
An agreement of this kind was okayed by the Supreme Court where it was
confined to the currency of the agreement. The case before the court was
Gujarat Bottling Co Ltd v Coca Cola Co. 281
An agreement for grant of franchise by Coca Cola Co to Gujarat Bottling
Co to manufacture, bottle, sell and distribute beverages under trade marks
held by the franchiser contained the negative stipulation restraining the fran-
chisee to "manufacture, bottle, sell, deal or otherwise be concerned with the
products, beverages of any other brands or trade marks/trade names during
subsistence of this agreement including the period of one year's notice". It
was held that the negative stipulation was intended to promote the trade.
Moreover, operation of the stipulation was confined only to subsistence of
the agreement and not after termination thereof. Hence stipulation could
not be regarded as in restraint of trade.
The court proceeded as follows:
"A stipulation in a contract which is intended for advancement of trade
shall not be regarded as being in restraint of trade. Similarly, except in
cases where the contract is wholly one-sided, normally the doctrine of
restraint of trade is not attracted in cases where the restriction is to oper-
ate during the period the contract is subsisting and it applies in respect of
a restriction which operates after the termination of the contract."
"There is a growing trend to regulate distribution of goods and ser-
vices through franchise agreements providing for grant of franchise by
the franchiser on certain terms and conditions to the franchisee. Such
agreements often incorporate a condition that the franchisee shall not
deal with competing goods. Such a condition restricting the right of the
franchisee to deal with competing goods is for facilitating the distribution
of the goods of the franchiser and it cannot be regarded as in restraint of
trade.
The agreement in question in this case was an agreement for grant of
franchise by Coca Cola to GBC to manufacture, bottle, sell and distribute
the various beverages for which the trade marks were acquired by Coca
Cola. It was thus, a commercial agreement whereunder both the par-
ties have undertaken obligations for promoting the trade in beverages for

their mutual benefit. The purpose of the negative stipulation contained
in the agreement was that GBC will work vigorously and diligently to
promote and solicit the sale of the products/beverages produced under
the trade marks of Coca Cola. This would not be possible if GBC were to
manufacture, bottle, sell, deal or otherwise be concerned with the prod-
ucts, beverages or any other brands or trade marks/trade names. Thus,
the purpose of the said agreement is to promote the trade and the neg-
ative stipulation seeks to achieve the said purpose by requiring GBC to
wholeheartedly apply to promote the sale of the products of Coca Cola.
Moreover, since the negative stipulation is confined in its application to
the period of subsistence of the agreement and the restriction imposed
therein is operative only during the period the agreement is subsisting, the
said stipulation cannot be held to be in restraint of trade so as to attract
the bar of Section 27 of the Contract Act."
3. Restraints upon employees
RESTRAINTS DURING EMPLOYMENT.-Agreements of service often contain
negative covenants preventing the employee from working elsewhere during
the period covered by the agreement. "Trade secrets, the names of custom-
ers, all such things which in sound philosophical language are denominated
as objective knowledge-these may not be given away by a servant; they
are his master's property, and there is no rule of public interest which pre-
vents a transfer of them against the master's will being restrained."282 A
servant may, therefore, be restrained from.taking part in any business in
direct competition with that of his employer. 283 Thus, in Charlesworth v
MacDonald:284
A agreed to become assistant for three years to B who was a physician
and surgeon practising at Zanzibar. The appointment was subject to the
clause against practising. A left the service within a year and began to
practise there on his own account.
282. Herbert Morris Ltd v Saxelby, (1916) 1 AC 688, 714 (HL), per Lord SHAW.
283. Electrosteel Castings Ltd v Saw Pipes Ltd, (2005) 1 CHN 612, where an employee agrees
with his employer, e.g. to work with him faithfully for five years and not to work with any
competitor during that period. The court said: The clause is a good one, because it is not in
restraint of any profession, trade or business. The restriction against working with a com-
petitor during the period of one's parent employment is not a restriction against profession
but it is a restriction against breach of faith and loyalty. A whole-time employee, if he is to
be diligent and loyal, can obviously serve only one master. The clause only enforces this con-
dition of employment and is not in reality restrictive. VFS Global Services (P) Ltd v Suprit
Roy, 2007 SCC OnLine Bom 1083: (2008) 3 Mah LJ 266, a clause prohibiting an employee
from disclosing commercial or trade secrets is not in restraint of trade because the employee
is not thereby restrained from carrying on any lawful profession, trade or business.
284. ILR (1898) 23 Bom 103. See further Sociedade De Fomento Industrial Ltd v Ravindranath
Subraya Kamat, (2000) 1 Mah LJ 148, a contract of retainership contained a clause that up
to the currency of the engagement the employee would not undertake directly or indirectly
by himself or by family members or by any person as his agent any activity competing with
the business of the plaintiff companies; this was held to be not void.

Exceptions 307
But he was restrained from doing so during the period of three years.
FARRAN CJ explained the principle thus: "An agreement of this class does
not fall within Section 27. If it did, all contracts of personal service for a
fixed period would be void. An agreement to serve exclusively for a week,
a day, or even for an hour, necessarily prevents the person so agreeing to
serve from exercising his calling during that period for anyone else than the
person with whom he so agrees. "285
The principle was applied by KANIA AG CJ (as he then was) of the Bombay
High Court in V.N. Deshpande v Arvind Mills Co Ltd. 286
The defendant took employment as a weaving master in a mill and
agreed not to serve in that capacity for three years for anyone else in any
part of India. An injunction was granted to restrain him in terms of the
agreement, 247
Agreements for protection of confidentiality and trade secrets are not
one-sided or unfair or unreasonable. Any breach of such clauses on the part
of the employee can also be treated as a misconduct. The petitioner was
in this case, after resignation, working for a competitor. The possibility of
using the client lists and confidential information just cannot be ruled out.
Though, there is no direct evidence on record but in view of the admitted
breach and facts and circumstances the petitioner is liable to pay lump sum
damages/compensation. It is clear breach of the agreed clauses as confiden-
tial information/data must had traversed out of the private domain to the
competitor's domain through the petitioner. The sufferer needs to be com-
pensated in view of the admitted breach itself. The element of breach relating

brought by the company from England to work for them for five years. In case of his leaving
employment earlier he was to pay damages of £100. He left employment and refused to pay
damages. The Court did not permit him to continue his work with the new employer. The
Court opined that the employee, could not act in such an overbearing manner. The Court
proceeded on the illustrations (c) and (d) of S. 57 of the earlier Specific Relief Act, 1877. It
did not advert to S. 27 at all. Niranjan Shankar Golikari v Century Spg & Mfg Co Ltd, AIR
1967 SC 1098: (1967) 2 SCR 378, a restraint during five years' term of service, held reason-
able. Numeric Power Systems Ltd v Mohd. Muzaffar, 2006 SCC OnLine Mad 697: (2006)
4 LLN 385, a negative covenant can be enforced during the continuance of the employment
and it continues for this purpose till the employee is released. The stipulation in the con-
tract that the negative covenant was to bind the employee for one year after termination of
employment was not enforced. Nazir Maricar v Marshalls Sons & Co (India) Ltd, (2005)
2 CTC 478, section comes into play even when there is only a partial restriction. Justifiable
restrictions are permissible. Training expenses were incurred, employee put on five year
term, Rs 30,000 payable if he left earlier. He worked for 18 months. Rs 30,000 would have
to be reduced proportionally.

to confidential information with other elements of loss of profit, etc., just
cannot be overlooked. As there is legal injury, it should be compensated. 288
RESTRAINTS AFTER TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.-But an agreement to
restrain a servant from competing with his employer after the termination
of employment may not be allowed by the courts. Thus, in Brahmaputra
Tea Co Ltd v E. Scarth, 289 where an attempt was made to restrain a servant
from competing for five years after the period of service, the court observed:
"Contracts by which persons are restrained from competing, after the term
of their agreement is over, with their former employers within reasonable
limits, are well known in English law, and the omission to make any such
contract an exception to the general prohibition contained in Section 27
indicates that it was not intended to give them legal effect in this country."
The principles thus established have been approved by the Supreme Court
in Niranjan Shankar Golikari v Century Spg & Mfg Co Ltd.290
A company manufacturing tyre cord yarn was offered collaboration
by a foreign producer on the condition that the company shall maintain
secrecy of all the technical information and that it should obtain corre-
sponding secrecy arrangements from its employees. The defendant was
appointed for a period of five years, the condition being that during this
period he shall not serve anywhere else even if he left the service earlier.
SHELAT J held the agreement to be valid. The defendant was accordingly
restrained from serving anywhere else during the currency of the agreement.
"The evidence is clear that the appellant has torn the agreement to pieces
only because he has been offered a high remuneration. Obviously he cannot
be heard to say that no injunction should be granted against him to enforce
the negative covenant which is not opposed to public policy. The injunction
issued against him is restricted as to time, the nature of employment and
as to area and cannot therefore be said to be too wide or unreasonable or
unnecessary for the protection of the interest of the respondent company."
The learned judge distinguished the case from the decision of A.N. RAY
J (as he then was) of the Calcutta High Court in Gopal Paper Mills Ltd v
Surendra K. Ganeshdas Malhotra291 where an injunction to enforce a nega-
tive covenant during the period of employment was refused as the agreement

2 CTC 684: (2004) 2 CCC 565, so as to hold that such injunctions are allowable. The court
said in this case that no injunction could be granted against an employee after termination
of his employment restraining him from carrying on competitive trade. The order restraining
him from joining the new employer could not be sustained, his termination being the result
of a breach of agreement. Ambiance India (P) Ltd v Naveen Jain, (2005) 81 DRJ 538: (2005)
122 DLJ 421 (Short Notes, Case 70), the employment being determinable, the employee left,

caused to the young employee whereas the employer could be compensated for breach, if any,
in terms of money.

was for a period of twenty years and its terms were also unconscionable.
SHELAT J said:
The period of contract there was as much as 20 years and the contract
gave the employer an arbitrary power to terminate the service without
notice... such a contract would clearly be held void as being one-sided.
A service contract carried a clause to the effect that the employee was not
to disclose confidential information to any person after cessation of employ-
ment with the employer (applicant) and was not to take up any employment
or involve himself with any other person a body corporate in similar field
of activity which was of competitive nature. This was held to be contrary to
the provisions of Section 27. An order of injunction could not be granted to
enforce it at the interim stage itself. 292
In England the position of such restrictive covenants has been described
to be "still an uncertain field". Lord WILBERFORCE observed in the Esso
Petroleum case:
Certain contracts of employment, with restrictions appropriate to their
character against undertaking other work during their currency may be
acceptable. Here too, however, if it is found that the restriction is purely
limitative or sterilising, it may be subject to examination.
Recovery of training expenses
The agreement was that the employee would put in service for a period of
five years after returning from training abroad at the cost of the employer.
An indemnity clause quantified damages at Rs 30,000 if the service was
left earlier. The employee left after 18 months. The trial court awarded to
the employer the whole amount of Rs 30,000. The High Court reduced the
amount to Rs 20,000 keeping in mind the proportionate recovery already
effected during the actual period of service. Such agreements, the court said,
are for the benefit of employees because training provided to them increases
their acceptability in the job market. There is no restraint also because the
employee is free to go away after paying unrecovered portion of expenses of
training. 293
PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS.-One of the principles is that a master
is not entitled to restrain his servant after the termination of employment
from offering competition, but he is entitled to reasonable protection against
exploitation of trade secrets.294 In Mason v Provident Clothing and Supply
Co Ltd the House of Lords did not allow an employer to restrain his

canvasser for a period of three years after the termination of his service.
Viscount HALDANE LC pointed out that capacity for canvassing is a natural
gift and not due to special training provided by the employer. "Had they
been content with asking him to bind himself not to canvass within the area
where he had actually assisted in building up the goodwill of their busi-
ness, or in an area restricted to places where the knowledge which he had
acquired in his employment could obviously have been used to their preju-
dice, they might have secured a right to restrain him within these limits."
On the other hand, in Fitch v Dewes 2% the House of Lords allowed a
covenant by which a solicitor's clerk was restrained from practising within
7 miles of the city, it being reasonably necessary for protecting the interest
of both parties. But in no case the court would allow covenants against
competition. In Attwood v Lamont 297 the employer was running several
departments in connection with tailoring etc. and the employee was the
superintendent only of the tailoring department. The agreement with him
was that after ceasing to be an employee he would not engage himself within
10 miles in any of the business being run by the employer in addition to
tailoring. The Court of Appeal held the agreement not only to be unnatu-
rally wide but also in restraint of competition. YOUNGER LJ cited the fol-
lowing passage from the speech of Lord PARKER in Morris v Saxelby;298
"The reason and the only reason for upholding such a restraint on the part
of an employee is that the employer has some proprietary right, whether
in the nature of the trade connection or in the nature of trade secrets, for
the protection of which such a restraint, is, having regard to the duties of
an employee, reasonably necessary. Such a restraint has never been upheld,
if directed only to the prevention of competition or against the use of the
personal skill and knowledge acquired by the employee in his employer's
business."
In a subsequent case:299
The defendants were employed by the plaintiffs as agents for debt col-
lection for the city of Birmingham. A clause of the agreement provided:
"For a period of six months after the determination of employment the
trade. It was far wider than was really necessary for protecting the employer's clientage. The
restriction was preventive of competition over a much wider range than was necessary. The
employer was permitted to forfeit his arrears of commission. Sandhya Organic Chemicals P

defendants would not solicit business from any person, firm or compa-
nies who shall at any time have been a client." The defendants left and
started a debt collection agency of their own. The plaintiff prayed for an
injunction.
It was held that the injunction would not be granted, for the covenant was
far too wide and was an unreasonable restraint of trade, since it extended
to the whole area of the plaintiffs' operation whereas the defendants were
employed in Birmingham alone.
A restraint upon a ladies' hair dresser that she should not work after the
termination of her employment at a competitive place for 12 months and

In a Canadian case: 301
The defendants were employees of a company which carried on a
topographical survey business. During their service they attempted to
obtain a valuable contract for the plaintiff company, but failed to do so.
Thereafter, the defendants resigned and obtained the contract for them-
selves, but without using any confidential information of the plaintiff.
The court held that there is an implied term in a contract of employment
that a former employee may not make use of his former employer's trade
secrets, but with this exception, he is entitled to compete and that even if the
contract of employment had contained a covenant not to compete in respect
of possible future contracts, such covenant would have been an unreasona-
ble restraint of trade and void. 302

[S. 27]
A restriction, even when otherwise justified, for a period of five years
was held to be unreasonable in the case of an employee who earned only a
modest wage. 303 A rule in the terms of employment providing that in case a
servant took employment with a competitor his pension benefits would be
forfeited has been held to be void. 304 Within three months of leaving employ-
ment, the defendant joined the competitor. The court said that the right of
employees to seek employment and right of livelihood must prevail. The
agreement was to restrain employment with an employer dealing in com-
petitive business for a period of two years. Such restraint was not allowed.
There could be injunction only to restrain the defendant from approaching
the plaintiff's suppliers and customers for soliciting their business.305
Negative covenants tied up with positive covenants during the subsist-
ence of the contract, be it of employment, partnership, commerce, agency
or like, are not normally regarded as being in restraint of trade, business.
or profession unless the same are unconscionable or wholly one-sided. No
employee can be put in a situation where he has either to stay with the pres-
ent employer or face idleness.306
The principle envisaged under the section is applicable to all types of
contracts or transactions and not merely to contracts of employment. 307 The
court further said that in construing such covenants or restrictions neither
the test of reasonableness nor the fact of partial restriction is applicable. The
case should fall within the exception engrafted in Section 27.
AGREEMENT BETWEEN EMPLOYERS.-An agreement between two employ-
ers that neither would employ any person who had been the other's employee
within a period of five years has been held to be void as it imposed too wide
and unreasonable restriction upon freedom of employment.308 An agree-
ment between two employers that on cessation of their relationship, neither
Mad 697: (2006) 4 LLN 385, one Bank cannot restrain another bank from dealing with its
customers. The court said: Information will only be protected if it can properly be classified
as a trade secret or as material which, while not properly to be described as a trade secret, is
in all the circumstances of such a highly confidential nature as to require the same protection
as a trade secret. Electrosteel Castings Ltd v Saw Pipes Ltd, (2005) 1 CHN 612 that the
restriction against working with a competitor during the period of one's parent employment
is not a restriction against profession, it is a restriction against breach of faith and loyalty.

would induce or solicite the employees of the other to leave jobs and join
pre-offered jobs in other competing firms was held to be not falling within
the scope of Section 27 as it did not envisage any restriction on employers.
The employees were free to move out of their jobs and join rivals and no
injunction could be issued against the other party restraining it from taking
in such turn-away employees. If the employees can leave here and go there
without solicitation, how can there be an injunction when they do so on
solicitation.309
EFFECT OF PREMATURE REMOVAL. —-A restriction of this kind will cease to
be effective against an employee who has been prematurely removed with-
out his fault.310 The Supreme Court also pointed out that a restraint beyond
the term of service would be prima facie void and that the only ground on
which it could be justified is by bringing it within the scope of the exception,
that is, by showing that it is necessary for the protection of the employer's
goodwill. The court further said that even if such a restraint is valid, it
will only apply after the expiry of the term in its natural course, and not
when the employee is wrongfully dismissed earlier. It could also apply if the
employee left his service earlier. But leaving a service is different from pre-
mature termination. The restraint clause became inapplicable.31:
No restriction was allowed to be imposed upon an employee when his
term of employment was not for a specified period and he had left the job.312
An employee of Star TV wanted to resign, but his resignation was not being
accepted. On the contrary, a case was filed against him for a declaration
that he had no right to resign or to join a rival firm. The court refused to
issue an injunction for enforcing a negative covenant. The court said that the
question whether the employee had gained knowledge of some trade secrets,
whether he was imparted special training and was in possession of confiden-
tial information were matters which could be determined at the trial and till
all this was sorted out, a negative covenant in matters of personal service
could not be enforced. Freedom of contract includes freedom of occupation.
There was nothing to suggest that the employer was likely to suffer irrepa-
rable loss without the injunction. Merely because the employer could face

some inconvenience or competition was not a ground for enforcing a nega-
tive covenant. It is not in public interest to restrain healthy competition.313
Restraint of legal proceedings [S. 28]
It is a well-known rule of English law that "an agreement purporting to
oust the jurisdiction of the courts is illegal and void on grounds of public
policy",314 Thus, any clause in an agreement providing that neither party
shall have the right to enforce the agreement by legal proceedings is void.315
An arrangement may, however, stipulate that there is no intention to con-
tract, or that it is only a gentleman's agreement. In such a case, no action is
possible under the agreement.16
Section 28 of the Indian Contract Act renders void two kinds of agree-
ment, namely:
(1) An agreement by which a party is restricted absolutely from enforcing
his legal rights arising under a contract, by the usual legal proceedings
in the ordinary tribunals.
(2) An agreement which limits the time within which the contract rights
may be enforced.
S. 28. Agreements in restraint of legal proceedings void.-[Every
agreement,-
(a) by which any party thereto is restricted absolutely from enforcing his
rights under or in respect of any contract, by the usual legal proceedings
in the ordinary tribunals, or which limits the time within which he may
thus enforce his rights; or
(b) which extinguishes the rights of any party thereto, or discharges any
party thereto from any liability, under or in respect of any contract on
the expiry of a specified period so as to restrict any party from enforcing
his rights,
is void to that extent.]
Exception 1.--Saving of contract to refer to arbitration dispute that
may arise.-―This section shall not render illegal a contract, by which two or
more persons agree that any dispute which may arise between them in respect
of any subject or class of subjects shall be referred to arbitration, and that only
the amount awarded in such arbitration shall be recoverable in respect of the
dispute so referred.

arisen. Nor shall this section render illegal any contract in writing, by which
two or more persons agree to refer to arbitration any question between them
which has already arisen, or affect any provision of any law in force for the time
being as to references to arbitration.

which any bank or financial institution stipulate a term in a guarantee or any
agreement making a provision for guarantee for extinguishment of the rights
or discharge of any party thereto from any liability under or in respect of such
guarantee or agreement on the expiry of a specified period which is not less
than one year from the date of occurring or non-occurring of a specified event
for extinguishment or discharge of such party from the said liability.
Explanation.-() In Exception 3, the expression "bank" means-
(a) a "banking company" as defined in clause (c) of Section 5 of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949);
(b) "a corresponding new bank" as defined in clause (da) of Section 5 of the
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949);
(c) "State Bank of India" constituted under Section 3 of the State Bank of
India Act, 1955 (23 of 1955);
(d) "a subsidiary bank" as defined in clause (k) of Section 2 of the State Bank
of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959 (38 of 1959)
(e) "a Regional Rural Bank" established under Section 3 of the Regional Rural
Bank Act, 1976 (21 of 1976);
(f) "a Co-operative Bank" as defined in clause (cc) of Section 5 of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949);
(g) "a multi-State co-operative bank" as defined in clause (ccilia) of Section 5
of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949); and
(ii) In Exception 3, the expression "a financial institution" means any public
financial institution within the meaning of Section 4-A of the Companies Act,
1956 (1 of 1956).J
Restriction on legal proceedings
Explaining the section, GARTH CJ of the Calcutta High Court observed
in Koegler v Coringa Oil Co Ltd:20 "This section applies to agreements
which wholly or partially prohibit the parties from having recourse to a
court of law. If, for instance, a contract were to contain a stipulation that no

[S. 28]
action should be brought upon it, that stipulation would... be void, because
it would restrict both parties from enforcing their rights under the contract
in the ordinary legal tribunals."
The right to appeal does not come within the purview of the section. A
party to a suit may agree not to appeal against the decision. 21
Compromise outside court
The claim in question was under the Recovery of Debts due to Banks
and Financial Institutions Act, 1993. The parties entered into a compromise
outside the court regarding withdrawal of proceedings. The court said that
it was not hit by Sections 28, 57 and 59 of the Contract Act because no
restraint was being placed upon institution of proceedings. 322
Limitation of time
Another kind of agreement rendered void by the section is where an
attempt is made by the parties to restrict the time within which an action
may be brought so as to make it shorter than that prescribed by the law of
limitation. According to the Limitation Act, 1963, for example, an action
for breach of contract may be brought within three years from the date
of breach. If a clause in an agreement provides that no action should be
brought after two years, the clause is void. Thus, a clause in a policy of life
insurance declaring that "no suit to recover under this policy of life insur-
ance shall be brought after one year from the death of the assured" was
held void. 323 Similarly, clauses in the standard fire insurance policy of the
insurer curtailing limitation to 12 months of the occurrence of the event or
3 months of the rejection of the claim by the insurer were not permitted to
be invoked to bar the claim filed within three years. However, in a similar
case before the Bombay High Court, a clause providing that "no suit shall
be brought against the company in connection with the said policy later
than one year after the time when the cause of action accrues was held valid,
the court saying that the effect of the agreement was not to limit the time but
to provide for the surrender of rights if no action was brought within that

been affirmed by the Supreme Court in Vulcan Insurance Co Ltd v Maharaj
Singh,37 where the court observed that "it has been repeatedly held that
such a clause is not hit by Section 28 and is valid". This was further affirmed
in National Insurance Co Ltd v Sujir Ganesh Nayak & Co.328 The clause in
question provided that "in no case whatsoever shall the company be liable
for any loss or damage after the expiration of 12 months from the happen-
ing of loss or damage unless the claim is the subject of pending action or
arbitration". The claimant notified the insurer regarding the strike which
caused the loss, but did not commence proceedings within the stipulated
time. The court reversed the decision of the Kerala High Court and held
that the clause was valid and its operation had ended the plaintiff's claim.329
A suit was filed for recovery of the amount due under an insurance policy.
A clause in the policy provided that suits must be filed within 12 months
from the date of disclaimer. The clause was held to be not valid. A suit filed
within three years from that date was held to be maintainable.330
Effect of amendment
The amendment of the section in 1997 has brought about this change that
all clauses which reduced the normal period of limitation would be void to
that extent. Thus, the artificial distinction between a clause cutting short
the period of limitation and a clause providing for extinction of rights after
a specified period has been eliminated.331

318 Chapter 7 Legality of Object
Forfeiture and surrender of rights
[S. 28]
Cases of this sort have been distinguished from those which provide for
surrender or forfeiture of rights if no action is brought within the stipulated
time. A clause in a policy of life insurance provided:
If a claim be made and rejected and an action or suit be not com-
menced within three months after such rejection... all benefits under the
policy shall be forfeited. 332
334
The clause was held valid. Similarly, a clause that the company shall not
be liable if no suit were brought within 12 months after the occurrence of
the loss; and a clause in a bill of lading providing that "in any event the
carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all liability in respect of loss.
or damage unless a suit is brought within one year after the delivery of the
goods, have been upheld. The reason why clauses of this kind have been
allowed is that the extent of loss or damage can be measured with a certain
amount of accuracy when the matters are fresh. "Lapse of time in such cases
may result in all kinds of claims which are not capable of determination
with any amount of exactitude and when memories of men may become
rather hazy,"335
The Jammu and Kashmir High Court extended the same principle to
Government contracts. In a case before it:336
A clause in a Government contract provided that the President of India
shall be discharged from all liability under the contract unless an arbi-
tration or a suit is commenced within six months from the expiration of
the period.
The clause was held to be valid. Explaining the distinction between
extinction of rights and limitation of time, the court said:37 "The distinc-
tion may be a fine one but it is nonetheless a fundamental distinction. The

arrangement in the one case takes it for granted that the right as well as the
liability exists, but the time for enforcing it is sought to be limited. While in
the other case, the parties agree that the right as well as liability shall stand
extinguished if a specified event occurs."
"What Section 28 forbids, is not extinguishment of the rights or lia-
bilities of a party to a contract on the happening of a specified event, but
the limiting of the time within which a party may enforce his rights. It
is obvious that a party will have no right to enforce, if the rights have
already been extinguished under the contract. In such a case, there can
be no question of the time for the enforcement of the rights being limited.
What happens is that the right itself ceases to exist."
Where the need for reduction of time to sue has already been taken care
of by a statute, there cannot be further reduction. Under Section 10 of the
Carriers Act, 1865 notice of loss or damage must be given within six months,
otherwise the right to sue is lost. A contract provided that such notice must
be given within 30 days of the arrival of the goods. This being contrary to
statutory provisions was held to be void. 338
"Absolutely": partial restriction as to jurisdiction
Section 28 will come into play when the restriction imposed upon the
right to sue is "absolute" in the sense that the parties are wholly precluded
from pursuing their legal remedies in the ordinary tribunals. 339 A partial
restriction will be valid. 340 An illustration of partial restriction is the deci
sion of the Calcutta High Court in Continental Drug & Co Ltd v Chemoids
& Industries Ltd. 341
The contract in question fell under the concurrent jurisdiction of both
the Bombay and Alipore courts, but the contract provided that "any dis-
pute arising between the parties, settlement of the same legally or other-
wise, will be decided in Bombay.

between the parties that the suit should be instituted in one of those two
courts cannot be said to be an absolute restriction on the right of taking

that such an agreement does not contravene the provisions of Section 28 if
the chosen court has jurisdiction to try the suit under ordinary law."342

agreement to confer jurisdiction on a court, which it does not possess under
the Civil Procedure Code. 345 But where two courts or more have under the
Code of Civil Procedure jurisdiction to try a suit, an agreement between the
parties that the dispute between them shall be tried in one of such courts
is not contrary to public policy. Such an agreement does not contravene
Section 28 of the Contract Act."146
Generally, three jurisdictions are available: the place of the making of
a contract, that of its performance and the defendant's place of business
or residence. If, out of these three jurisdictions, at least one is left open,
competent under the Civil Procedure Code it will not offend Section 28,
provided that the jurisdiction which is left open is a convenient one, i.e.
available at reasonable expense and not inaccessible. 347 A clause of an
various types of exclusion clauses and their consideration surveyed by the Supreme Court in
the judgment in this case. R.K. Maheshwari v. Nagarjun Construction Co Ltd, AIR 2007
NOC 1119 (MP), suit for recovery of dues, work order was delivered at a place at which the
payment was also settled to be made. The defendant was not able to prove that the contract
was made at some other place. The court said that parties cannot confer jurisdiction by
agreement on a court in which there is no jurisdiction. It was wrong for the trial judge to hold
that the court at the place of delivery of order and payment had no jurisdiction.
345. Relied upon in Patel Roadways Ltd v Prasad Trading Co, (1991) 4 SCC 270: AIR 1992 SC
1514 so as to hold that if the carrier has a subordinate office at the place where the goods
were delivered for transport and the cause of action also arose there because the goods were
destroyed by fire at that place, an action would lie only there and not at the company's head
office as provided in the contract because the courts there would have had no jurisdiction.
Ranjana Nagpal v Devi Ram, AIR 2002 HP 166, the agreement cannot vest jurisdiction in
a court which otherwise does not have it. The agreement related to immovable property. The
suit could be filed before the court where the property was situate and nowhere else, what-
ever may be the agreement between the parties.
346. The principle enunciated in this case can also be seen at work in the following cases: L.T.

agreement between the parties provided that the venue of arbitration was to
be Hyderabad and courts there would have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudi-
cate the dispute between the parties. The court said that parties cannot law-
fully confer jurisdiction on a court which it does not possess under the Civil
Procedure Code. The clause was void. No cause of action or even a part of
the cause of action had arisen at Gujarat and therefore only the competent
court there had jurisdiction. A bilateral agreement under which an option
is provided for choosing the jurisdiction of a particular country was held to
be not opposed to public policy.39
It is necessary that serious terms of this nature must be specifically
brought to the notice of the parties whose rights are sought to be cur-
tailed.30 Something more must be done than merely printing the terms on
consignment documents. The law requires that before making a person
bound by any such term (a clause in a consignment note as to exclusive juris-
diction) it must be proved that the same was brought to the knowledge of
the consignor in such a way that it should seem to be the result of a mutual
assent. Where a consignment way bill contained the words "subject to
Calcutta jurisdiction", the court ignored it since it was not one to which the
plaintiff assented. 353 Where the original contracting party, i.e. the consignor
were executed. An application for stay of enforcement could not be filed at any other place.
Rajaram Maize Products v M.P. Electricity Board, AIR 1999 MP 44, the contract provided
for settlement of disputes only at place "J" which was one of the possible jurisdictions. A suit
filed at another place was held to be not proper though the cause of action had arisen at that
place. A.V.M. Sales Corpn v Anuradha Chemicals (P) Ltd, (2012) 2 SCC 315: (2012) 1 SCC
(Civ) 809, the agreement provided for jurisdiction at Calcutta Courts excluding Vijayawada
Courts, but even so a Vijayawada Court entertained the suit, the Supreme Court directed it
to be transferred to Calcutta Court.

to exclusion of the jurisdiction of courts are very strictly construed. The exclusion is not

law was to apply to the interpretation of their agreement. Hari Shanker Jain v Sonia Gandhi,

has been adequately informed, it will be a question of fact in each case
whether the parties subsequently acquiring his rights will also be bound
by the notified terms. The carrier would have no opportunity of knowing
about him and much less of giving him any notice. A Bench of the Andhra
Pradesh High Court, therefore, came to the conclusion that the consignee to
whom the booking documents are indorsed to enable him to obtain deliv-
ery at the destination would also be bound by the terms. If the original
party is not bound by those terms, neither would be those who acquire their
rights under the document. 355 Following these principles in another case, the
Andhra Pradesh High Court came to the conclusion that a term as to the
place of suit was not binding on the insurer who had paid out the consignee
and who was then suing the carrier for the negligent loss of the goods unless
it could be proved that the insurer too was made or was otherwise aware of
the terms. 356
An agreement made subject to the jurisdiction of a stated court would not
have the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of other courts.357 An ouster clause
in a contract can oust the territorial jurisdiction only of a civil court but not
that of a High Court.358 The fact that the contract clause does not use the
word "alone", "only" or "exclusively" does not ipso facto warrant that there
was no intention to provide for exclusive jurisdiction of the court specified
in the clause. The court must consider all the facts and circumstances while
construing the clause. 359
Where the terms and conditions attached to the quotation contained an
arbitration clause provided that: "any order placed against this quotation
shall be deemed to be a contract made in Calcutta and any dispute arising
therefrom shall be settled by an arbitrator to be jointly appointed by us", it
was held that it merely fixed the situs of the contract at Calcutta and it did
not mean to confer an exclusive jurisdiction on the Court at Calcutta, and
when a part of the cause of action had arisen at Salem, the Court there had
also jurisdiction to entertain the suit under Section 20(c) of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 360
The Supreme Court in Angile Insulations v Davy Ashmore India Ltd,361
held as under:
the same effect is Road Transport Corpn v Kirloskar Bros Ltd, AIR 1981 Bom 299. The

"So, normally that Court also would have jurisdiction where the cause
of action, wholly or in part, arises. But it will be subject to the terms of
the contract between the parties. In this case, Clause (21) read thus:
'This work order is issued subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court
situated in Bangalore in the State of Karnataka. Any legal proceeding
will, therefore, fall within the jurisdiction of the above Court only."
A reading of this clause would clearly indicate that the work order
issued by the Appellant will be subject to the jurisdiction of the High
Court situated in Bangalore in the State of Karnataka. Any legal pro-
ceeding will, therefore, be instituted in a Court of competent jurisdiction
within the jurisdiction of High Court of Bangalore only."
An ouster clause becomes effective when a contract is formed. It remains
ineffective when the contract formation process ends prematurely. The
tender which was submitted by the contractor along with earnest deposit
permitted jurisdiction of courts at two places and at no other place. But
this particular tender was not accepted. No contract came into being. The
contractor was free to file his case at all places available under the Civil
Procedure Code, 362
Where the contract provided for jurisdiction in respect of purchase orders
at the court in Pune, and the plaintiff filed a case there which was of compos-
ite nature, because it included disputes not arising out of purchase orders,
it was held that the Pune court acquired jurisdiction to try the whole case
because of the joinder of causes of action.363
Right to approach courts on matters of compensation
A provision in a supply agreement was that the purchaser would have uni-
lateral right to determine the amount of liquidated damages which would be
recoverable and that such quantification would be final and not challengable
by the supplier. The court said that the provision was clearly in restraint of
legal proceedings. It was an attempt to oust the jurisdiction of the courts
and the right of the party to seek judicial adjudication.364
Provision for foreign jurisdiction
A contract stated to be an international commercial contract contained at
clause which provided for dispute redressal mechanism through arbitration
and that the contract to be construed and governed by English law. The
court said that the effect of the provision was that only English courts would
have exclusive jurisdiction. The Indian party was thus deprived of its rights
Civil Procedure Code was allowed where the jurisdiction clause in the contract was found to
be ambiguous.

to proceed before courts in India. The court could not permit it because it
violated Section 28 of the Contract Act. 365 The court cited one of its own
earlier decisions. 366 The provision in the contract was for reference to arbi-
tration by the company before an arbitrator to be appointed by the company
but the award was to be binding on both parties. The court said that the
effect of the clause was that it was a unilateral agreement and consequently
not enforceable through a court of law.
In the case of a contract, the available jurisdiction was either at Chennai
or Hyderabad. The contract had nothing to do with Delhi and yet Delhi was
the only permitted jurisdiction. A proceeding instituted in Lok Adalat at
Hyderabad was held to be valid because Lok Adalat, being not a court, the
restriction was not applicable to it.367
Exceptions
1. Reference of future disputes to arbitration
The section does not render void a contract by which two or more per-
sons agree that any dispute which may arise between them shall be referred
to arbitration and that only the amount awarded in the arbitration shall be
recoverable. An agreement between the parties to refer disputes to arbitra-
tion is perfectly valid. Thus in Koegler v Coringa Oil Co Ltd:³
A clause in an agreement that all disputes would be referred to arbitra-
tion of two competent London brokers and their decision would be final,
was held valid.
GARTH CJ said: "If a contract were to contain a double stipulation that
any dispute between the parties should be settled by arbitration, and that
neither party should enforce his rights under it in a court of law, that would
be a valid stipulation so far as regards its first branch, viz., that all disputes
between the parties should be referred to arbitration, because that of itself
would not have the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the courts, but the
latter branch of the stipulation would be void because by that the jurisdic-
tion of the courts would be naturally excluded."
The right to proceed against the arbitrator's award, for example, to have
it set aside, cannot be excluded by contract.

[S. 28]
A provision in a contract that the decision of the conservator of forests
shall be final371 and a clause in a contract of insurance that arbitration would
be a condition precedent for any action against the company, have been held
to be valid.372 An arbitration clause remains binding even where the contract
has ended by breach or otherwise. It is, therefore, theoretically possible that
a contract may come to an end, and that arbitration agreement may not. It
is also possible that the arbitration clause may not be valid but the rest of
the contract may be valid.373 It has been held by the Supreme Court that
expressions any dispute "arising out of" or "concerning" or "in connection.
with", or "in consequence of" or "relating to" this contract, are sufficiently
wide to compel parties to refer even this matter to arbitration whether the
contract is itself valid,374
A clause providing for arbitration and declaring that the Arbitration Act
would not apply was held to be void. The arbitration clause was held to
be valid. The part which excluded the application of the Arbitration Act
being severable from the rest of the agreement was alone struck down.375 A
contract clause provided that the right to claim arbitration would come to
an end after the expiry of 90 days from the date of intimation of the final
bill being ready for payment. The matter was raised within the designated
time. The award did not contain a decision on merits. It was held that the
right of the contractor to seek arbitration remained alive. The award was
set aside. The arbitrator was asked to decide the claim of the petitioner on
merits.376
Where the head office of the institution was situate at Delhi and the con-
tract provided for resolution of disputes by arbitration, an interim relief
obtained by filing a suit at Chennai was held to be an abuse of the judicial
process and, therefore, against public policy. A suit could be instituted only
at the place of the registered office. 377

arbitration, they were held to be bound to do so. The fact that the arbitrators
were situated in a foreign country could not by itself be enough to nullify the
arbitration when the parties accepted the arrangement with their eyes wide
open and willingly. More so when the parties appointed arbitrators and
participated in proceedings. 379
Uncertain agreements [S. 29]
S. 29. Agreements void for uncertainty.-Agreements, the meaning of
which is not certain, or capable of being made certain, are void.
Illustrations
(a) A agrees to sell to B "a hundred tons of oil". There is nothing whatever to show what
kind of oil was intended. The agreement is void for uncertainty.
(b) A agrees to sell to B one hundred tons of oil of a specified description, known as an
article of commerce. There is no uncertainty here to make the agreement void.
(c) A, who is a dealer in coconut oil only, agrees to sell to B "one hundred tons of oil". The
nature of A's trade affords an indication of the meaning of the words, and A has entered
into a contract for the sale of one hundred tons of coconut oil.
(d) A agrees to sell to B "all the grain in my granary at Ramnagar". There is no uncertainty
here to make the agreement void.
(e) A agrees to sell to B "one thousand maunds of rice at a price to be fixed by C". As the
price is capable of being made certain, there is no uncertainty here to make the agree-
ment void.
(f) A agrees to sell to B "my white horse for rupees five hundred or rupees one thousand".
There is nothing to show which of the two prices was to be given. The agreement is
void. 380
The reason why certainty is necessary appears from the following state-
ment of the House of Lords:
It is a necessary requirement that an agreement in order to be binding
must be sufficiently definite to enable the court to give it a practical mean-
ing. Its terms must be so definite, or capable of being made definite with-
out further agreement of the parties, and that promises and performances
to be rendered by each party are reasonably certain.
An interesting illustration is Guthing v Lynn. 382 A horse was bought for
a certain price coupled with a promise to give £5 more if the horse proved
lucky. The agreement was held to be void for uncertainty. The court has no
machinery to determine what luck, bad or good, the horse had brought to
the buyer. Such cases have generally arisen in connection with sale of goods,
there being uncertainty as to the price. For example, where goods are sold,

such price as should be agreed upon between the parties,385 the agreement
in each case was held to be void for uncertainty as to price. Where the price
is left to be fixed by a third party, there is no uncertainty and the agreement
will be enforceable. Similarly, if the agreement is totally silent as to price, it
will be valid, for, in that case, Section 9 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 will
apply and reasonable price shall be payable.386
Agreement to agree or negotiate
An agreement to agree in the future is void, for there is no certainty
whether the parties will be able to agree.387 In the words of Anson:388
The law is generally anxious to uphold the contract wherever possible
lest it should incur the reproach of being the destroyer of bargains;389 but
the court must be satisfied that the parties have in fact concluded a con-
tract and not merely agreed to contract in the future.

There was an agreement for the sale of tentage with a stipulation that
the price, dates of payment and manner of delivery "shall be agreed upon
from time to time".
The agreement was held to be void for uncertainty. Lord BUCKMASTER
remarked: "It has long been a well-recognised principle of contract law that
an agreement between two parties to enter into an agreement in which some
critical part of the contract matter is left undecided is no contract at all.... It
is not open to them to agree that they will in the future agree upon a matter
which is vital to the arrangement between them and has not yet been deter-
mined." The law requires for the making of a good contract a concluded
bargain, "and a concluded contract is one which settles everything to be
settled and leaves nothing to be settled by agreement between the parties".
Thus, if the execution of a further contract is a condition or term of the
bargain, no contract arises because the law does not recognise a contract to
enter into a contract. 391 This view finds further support in the decision of
the Court of Appeal in Courtney & Fairbairn Ltd v Tolaini Bros (Hotels)
Ltd,392
A property owner and a property developer-cum-building contrac-
tor sat together to arrange a collaboration between them. The contrac-
tor wrote a letter to the owner that he was willing to introduce persons
who would finance the development of the site and that his own interest
was only in the building work. The letter concluded that if a successful
arrangement was made with the financiers introduced by him, the owner
will enter into negotiations for a fair and reasonable building contract.
The negotiations broke down because of a disagreement as to the price.
The owner then entered into building contracts with others while still
using those very sources of finance.
The contractor sued for the breach of the contract which had either been
made or was contracted to be made. The Court of Appeal did not accept his
case. Price is a very important term of every contract and the parties in this
case neither could agree upon it nor did they lay down any means by which
it could be ascertained. Lord DENNING emphasised that there could neither
be a contract to enter into a contract nor a contract to negotiate.
P contracted to purchase supplies of propane from D and voluntarily
offered to pay a higher price "on the understanding that they would be
able to renegotiate a new contract for the following year based on eco-

higher price in accordance with P's offer. D refused to renew P's contract.

excess payment in trust to the use of P. It was held that no binding con-
tract regarding the renegotiation of the original contract ever came into
existence. A fundamental term was to fix the price in terms of "economic
value" which had a different meaning to each party. Therefore, there was
no acceptance by D of P's offer. P was entitled to recover the amount of
overpayment. 393
Where at the time of the agreement for sale of property, a portion of the
property was likely to be acquired for road widening and the agreement
fixed the price per square yard for whatever area was left after the acquisi-
tion, it was held that the agreement suffered from no uncertainty and was,
therefore, specifically enforceable.4
Undefined property
The land promised to be sold was to be out of the land still to be acquired
or out of the existing property upto the value of one lakh rupees. The price
was to be agreed upon at a later date. There was still no certainty upto
the time of the suit for specific performance as to identification of the land
and price fixation. The agreement was held to be void for uncertainty,395
The court said in another case that for seeking specific performance, the
contract in question must be correct and precise. The plaintiff had failed
to identify the property by giving its Khasra number or boundary number.
The agreement of sale being void for uncertainty, it could not be specifically
enforced.3%

Preliminary negotiations taking definite shape
Where, on the other hand, the preliminary negotiations have crystal-
lised into a definite shape, the parties can be compelled to contract on those
terms. This is borne out by the following two decisions. One of them is that
of the House of Lords in Hillas & Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd. 397
The contract was to purchase for the year 1930 "22,000 standards of
soft wood goods of fair specification", with an option to buy 1,00,000 for
the year 1931. When the option for 1931 was sought to be exercised, the
seller said that this part of the agreement was not enforceable because it
did not specify any particulars.
The agreement was, however, allowed to be enforced. The dealing for the
previous year indicated the intention to have a similar dealing and also made
it unnecessary for the particulars to be repeated.
The other case is Mallozzi v Carapelli. 398
The contract was for the sale of oats and maize to be shipped from
Argentina to the West Coast of Italy. The port of discharge was to be
agreed between the parties when the ship would cross the Straits of
Gibraltar. The seller ordered, without consulting the buyer, the cargo to
be discharged at Naples. The buyer suffered two-fold loss, viz., owing to
congestion at that port and further transport. The seller contended that
that term being left to future agreement the contract was void.
But the court saw no element of uncertainty. There was a definite agree-
ment that the port of discharge would be settled by mutual agreement and it
was this agreement which the seller had broken.
In a similar case before a Canadian court 399 a motor vehicle dealer was
negotiating with his manufacturer for shifting his agency to larger premises.
As a part of these negotiations the manufacturer undertook to absorb the
dealer's losses till their new arrangement was concluded. How the losses
would be absorbed was not stated. Even so the agreement was held to be
binding. How the losses would be absorbed was the manufacturer's concern
and not that of the dealer. The manufacturer had committed himself to a
definite obligation.
With this should be contrasted the case400 in which a sum of money was
deposited with a car dealer for purchasing a used car which the depositor
was ultimately unable to buy. The parties then agreed that the dealer should
hold the amount till the depositor was able to buy a car at a stated price or
more. The depositor then sought refund of his deposit and was allowed. The
type of car, the time of purchase, the mode of finance were all uncertain and
these uncertainties prevented the parties from being bound. A document for

sale of certain lands provided that the sale and purchase agreement was to
be signed on or before the specified date and it was to incorporate all the
terms of the sale and other usual terms and conditions and that if the agree-
ment was not signed by the cut-off date, the amount of deposit was to be
refunded. The court said that the document did not mature into a contract.
No specific enforcement of the sale could be ordered.401
Partial uncertainty: "Capable of being made certain"
Where only a part or a clause of the contract is uncertain, but the rest
is capable of bearing a reasonably certain meaning, the contract will be
regarded as binding. In a contract to sell 3000 tons of steel reinforcing bars,
the buyer accepted, but subject to "the usual conditions of acceptance only".
There being no evidence of any such usual conditions, the buyer was held to
be bound by the rest of the contract.402
In a contract for the purchase of land, the price was payable in three
phases and the land was also to be released for further construction in three
phases. The contract was held to be void by reason of uncertainty as to
which part of the land was to be released in the successive phases. Should
the power be vested in the purchaser, the vendor might be seriously preju-
diced by the manner in which the power was exercised. In the absence of
any express term as to how the land to be included in each phase was to be
selected, the contract was void for uncertainty. But in a contract for sale

of "one acre of front land", out of a tract of 5 acres, the contract was held to
be not uncertain, it being possible to find out what was the meaning of the
parties by the words "front land",404 At the time when the agreement to sell
a property was made, it was known that a portion of the property was likely
to be acquired for road widening. The agreement, therefore, stipulated that
whatever property was left behind after acquisition would be sold at agreed
rate. The agreement was held to be capable of performance. The relief of
specific performance was allowed.405 A person wished to purchase corn feed
pellets and his brokers carried out negotiations with a seller through inter-
mediary brokers. There were various telex messages pursuant to which the
seller contended that a binding contract had been concluded, but the buyer
contended that many points had still to be settled. The court said that the
parties were ad idem as to the main terms of the proposed contract and it
was perfectly possible for parties to make an interim agreement for the sale
of goods which required further negotiations to iron out the less important
details of the transaction.406 Where an agreement provided that a property
in joint names should be sold at a price agreed between the owners, and if
not sold within six months, should be placed at auction, it was necessary to
imply a term that the agreed price should be a reasonable price. The contract
was clear and workable in its existing form.407 Where the vital terms of the
contract like the price and the area of land and the time for completion of
sale were all fixed, the Supreme Court held that the mere fact that the mode
of payment of the price was not settled did not render the contract to be
ineffective. Where a contract for the sale of bearing springs over a course
of time gave latitude to the seller as to quantity of delivery in each instal-
ment, it did not make the agreement uncertain.409 Sometimes the principle
of business efficacy is used to lend support to the agreement to make it effec-
tive in consonance' with the parties' intention. This can be done only when

the agreement or its terms are either ambiguous or not clear.410 Contracts
are not readily declared to be invalid for uncertainty or vagueness. The
court found in the case before it a contract which was for sale of immovable
property but the parcel of land was not identified, nor it was ascertainable.
Hence there was no contract which could be enforced. 411 In a case before
the Allahabad High Court, the facts and decision appear from the following
passage: 412
The terms of the agreement were that the tenant was to construct a sit-
ting place and install a new gate and deduct the cost from rent which was
enhanced from Rs 5 to Rs 11/8 per month. The cost of construction was
not known to the parties at the time, but it is obvious that they agreed
that the entire cost, whatever the amount, would be adjusted against rent.
The agreement was, therefore, capable of being made certain and did in
effect become certain when the constructions were completed and the
amount spent was known. The purpose of Section 29 is to ensure that the
parties should be aware of the precise nature and scope of their mutual
rights and obligations.
Agreement to increase wages
An act of the State to increase wages of its employees is a welfare meas-
ure. When such increase takes place with retrospective effect, its validity can
be upheld because it is for the benefit of its employees. Such a gesture could
not be enforced against a licencee of the State. The licencee would have been
bound if there was a specific term in the licence to that effect. Section 29
would not permit enforcement of the terms of a scheme which are so vague
and indefinite that it may not be possible to ascertain with reasonable cer-
tainty the intention of the parties. The meaning of a contract must be clear
on its face. Furthermore, whatever increase was agreed to be given in this
case had already been granted. A new liability cannot be enforced under a
contract which had already been worked out.413
Agreement not capable of being enforced
This happens when the agreement is in the state of a mess. The plaintiff
in this case was the owner of two houses which were not constructed by him
with his own funds and he permitted his brother (defendant) to occupy one
of the houses. The defendant pleaded about an agreement which contained

a term that the construction was carried out with contributed funds and the
plaintiff agreed to transfer one house to the defendant on a settlement of
the account. An endorsement was made in the agreement that the plaintiff
relinquished his share in the property in favour of his mother. The mother
executed a will bequeathing the property in favour of two sons, plaintiff and
defendant. Thus the agreement became inexecutable.44
Lock-out agreement
A lock-out agreement by which one party for good consideration agrees
for a specified period of time, not to negotiate with anyone (sale of business
and premises in this case) except the other party for the sale of his property,
can constitute an enforceable agreement. Such an agreement enables the
would be buyer to purchase, for a price, an exclusive right of negotiations
for finalising the deal. However, an agreement to negotiate in good faith for
an unspecified period is not enforceable and nor can a term to that effect be
implied in a lock-out agreement, since the vendor is not obliged under such
an agreement to conclude a contract with the purchaser. He would not be
able to know when he can withdraw from on-going negotiations. The court
cannot also be expected to decide whether, subjectively, a proper reason
existed for the termination of negotiations.415
Option for renewal of tenancy
An option for renewal of a tenancy or lease is an enforceable option.416
But an option clause which provides for renewal of a lease on such terms.
as may be agreed upon by the parties at the time of renewal would make it.
invalid and unenforceable for uncertainty.417
Contract linked with repeal of an Act
Where the performance of an agreement could be demanded only on the
repeal of an Act, which prevented fragmentation of holdings, the same was
held to be void because repeal was an uncertain event and the object was in
violation of an existing Act.418

Requirements of definition
Section 30 only says that "agreements by way of wager are void". The
section does not define "wager". SUBBA RAO J (afterwards CJ) in Gherulal
Parakh v Mahadeodas said: "Sir William Anson's definition of "wager"
As a promise to give money or money's worth upon the determination
or ascertainment of an uncertain event, brings out the concept of wager
declared void by Section 30 of the Contract Act."
The most illustrative definition of "wager" is that given by HAWKINS J in
Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.420
A wagering contract is one by which two persons professing to hold
opposite views touching the issue of a future uncertain event, mutually agree
that, dependent on the determination of that event, one shall pay or hand
over to him, a sum of money or other stake; neither of the contracting par-
ties having any other interest in that contract than the sum or stake he will
so win or lose, there being no other real consideration for the making of
such contract by either of the parties. It is essential to a wagering contract
that each party may under it either win or lose, whether he will win or lose
being dependent on the issue of the event, and, therefore, remaining uncer-
tain until that issue is known. If either of the parties may win but cannot
lose, it is not a wagering contract.421
This statement has the merit of bringing out all the essential features that
make a transaction a wager.
1. Uncertain event
The first thing essential to wager is that the performance of the bargain
must depend upon the determination of an uncertain event. A wager gen-
erally contemplates a future event; but it may even relate to an event which
has already happened in the past, but the parties are not aware of its result
or the time of its happening.22

2. Mutual chances of gain or loss
The second essential feature is that upon the determination of the con-
templated event each party should stand to win or lose. If there are no such
mutual chances of gain or loss, there is no wager. Thus, in Babasaheb v
Rajaram:23
Two wrestlers agreed to play a wrestling match on condition that the
party failing to appear on the day fixed was to forfeit Rs 500 to the oppo-
site party, and the winner was to receive Rs 1125 out of the gate money.
The defendant failed to appear in the ring and the plaintiff sued him for
Rs 500.
It was held that the agreement could not be looked upon as one of wager-
ing in law. "It is of the essence of wager that each side should stand to win
or lose according to the result of the uncertain event." In the present case
neither side stood to lose according to the result of the wrestling match.
"The stakes did not come out of the pockets of the parties, but had to be
paid from the gate money provided by the public."425 The prize would not
have been recoverable if it was to be subscribed by the competitors them-
selves. Accordingly, where each of the parties deposited £200 with a stake-
holder to abide the issue of a walking match and the loser was to forfeit
his £200, and where each party deposited £100 to abide the result of
a billiard match,427 the agreements were held to be of wagering nature. In
contrast to it the transaction in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co was held to
be not a wager. The company had no chance of winning, neither Mrs Carlill
any chance of losing.428
A chit fund does not come within the scope of "wager". It is no doubt
true that some chance gain may come to some of the members, but none
of them stands to lose his money, for his periodical deposits are refunded
to him at the end of the scheme. This was so held by the Madras High
Court in Narayana Ayyangar v K. Vallachami Ambalam. 429 RAMESAM J
said: "It is true that in most chit fund transactions, no subscriber loses the
money he has contributed; and so long as getting back the actual amount of
subscription is assured, the interval of time, however long it may be, is
immaterial."

The transaction being valid, a member was allowed to recover his sub-
scriptions when the organisers refused to run the scheme up to the promised
schedule.
3. Neither party to have control over the event
Thirdly, neither party should have control over the happening of the event
one way or the other. "If one of the parties has the event in his own hands,
the transaction lacks an essential ingredient of a wager."
4. No other interest in the event
Lastly, neither party should have any interest in the happening of the
event other than the sum or stake he will win or lose. This is what marks
the difference between a wagering agreement and contract of insurance.
Every contract of insurance requires for its validity the existence of insurable
interest. An insurance effected without insurable interest is no more than a
wagering agreement and, therefore, void. 431 "Insurable interest" means the
risk of loss to which the assured is likely to be exposed by the happening
of the event assured against. In a wager, on the other hand, neither party
is running any risk of loss except that which is created by the agreement
itself.432
Whether an agreement is of a wagering nature depends upon the sub-
stance and not the words of the agreement. 33 The real object of the parties
must be discovered. "It makes no difference that there was real intention to
part with the goods. If a horse of £100 is to be sold and the buyer and seller
agree that upon one event the price shall be nothing and upon another £200,
that is a wager, though there may be real intention of selling the horse."434
The facts of the case 435 in which the above passage occurs were that a
seller and buyer disagreed respecting whether or not payment had been made
for some goods in the past. They mutually agreed that one price would be
payable if the buyer was correct and another price would be paid if the seller
was correct. The seller's memory proved better, but he could not recover
anything from the buyer as the court held the arrangement to be of wagering
nature.
Right to seek performance
Where the contract conferred the right to seek actual delivery of goods
and, therefore, the plaintiff could compel actual performance, the court said

that the contract could not be termed as a wager. Common intention of the
parties to enter into a wagering transaction is a sine qua non for a transac-
tion to be dumped as wager.436
Speculative transactions
An agreement to settle the difference between the contract price and mar-
ket price of certain goods on a specified day has been repeatedly held to
be a wager. But, as transactions of this kind are always expressed in the
form of an agreement for the sale or purchase of goods, it often becomes
difficult to ascertain the real object of the parties. Yet the intention of the
parties is the only deciding factor, for the Privy Council ruled in 1901 in an
appeal from Burma 37 under Section 30 of the Contract Act that "where the
circumstances as to contracts for sale, purchase and delivery of goods are
such as to warrant the legal inference that the parties never intended any
actual transfer, but only to pay or receive differences, the contracts must be
deemed to be by way of wager".438 "Thus, there must be from the outset a
common intention of both the parties to make and accept no delivery and
to deal only in differences. From the mere fact that the delivery of the goods
was not taken, no inference can be drawn that the contract was a wagering
contract. If it is intended and is possible that the goods contracted for can
be delivered then, the mere fact that in certain circumstances either party
would be liable to make good to the other the difference in price, cannot
make it a wager.* 440
Wagering agreements are speculative in nature but every speculation need
not necessarily be wager. Derivatives contracts satisfy first ingredient as
there are two parties. Second ingredient that one may stand to lose may be
absent as plaintiff in event of losing in the underlying contract on account of
currency fluctuation may get compensated by hedging and vice versa. Third
test of wager is absent as both parties definitely have actual interest in rate.
of exchange hitting high or low. Derivatives transaction resembles contract
of insurance. In a wager there must be common intention to wager and such
intention is absent in derivatives contracts. Derivatives transactions follow
scientific pattern on basis of financial mathematics. Derivatives contracts
are not wagering contracts.441
The intention of the parties is gathered from the circumstances surround-
ing their agreement. Thus, where a rice mill owner agreed to sell 1,99,000

bags of rice, worth about a crore of rupees, when his actual capacity was
much less, the Privy Council held the agreement to be a wager.442 Their
Lordships said: "Now the output of the firm itself would not be much over
60,000 bags during the currency of the contracts. The capital of the com-
pany was a trifle more than a lakh of rupees. The cost of goods would be
that amount multiplied by five hundred fold. It is possible for traders to
contemplate transactions so far beyond their basis of trade but it is very
unlikely. In point of fact, they never completed nor were they called on to
complete any one of the ostensible transactions. The rational inference is
that neither party ever intended completion."
Similarly, where a contract was made for the sale of certain goods in
a market where such goods never appeared, it was held that the common
intention was to wager.443
446
In another Privy Council decision, delivery orders having been issued
which could have been converted into actual delivery if a party so desired, it
was held that the transaction could not be described as a wager.*** Similarly,
where out of a large number of transactions, the court found that on occa-
sions delivery of goods was made and accepted, making it difficult to know
beforehand which way a particular transaction was going to end, the inten-
tion to wager was held to be not established.445 In an Andhra Pradesh case,44
a pucca addatia, whom the court found to be an independent contractor
and not an agent, received orders from his principal to purchase certain
goods. He contracted to do so but subsequently settled the difference with
the seller and claimed the loss and his commission from the principal. The
court said: The circumstances do not warrant the inference that the plaintiff
intended to deliver or the defendant intended to take delivery of the wagon
of groundnut oil. In fact the defendant had no shop or godown at Adoni and
is not even a resident of the place.
Accordingly, no action lay for the enforcement of the transaction.+7
Effects of wagering transactions
A wagering agreement being void cannot be enforced in any court of law.
Section 30 expressly declares that "no suit shall be brought for recovering
anything alleged to be won on any wager, or entrusted to any person to
abide the result of any game or other uncertain event on which any wager
is made". Thus the amount won on a wager cannot be recovered. In a case

Two persons entered into wagering transactions in shares and one
became indebted to the other. A promissory note was executed for the
payment of that debt.
The note was held to be not enforceable.449 A subsequent substituted
agreement of the same consideration, namely, the amount won on a wager,
is also not enforceable. 450 In other words, a new promise to pay money won
upon a wager is equally void. Similarly, money deposited with a person to
enable him to pay to the party winning upon a wager cannot be recov-
ered. The winner cannot recover the money, but before it is paid to him,
the depositor may recover from the stakeholder. But where the money has
already been paid over, it cannot be recovered back.452
Collateral transactions
It has been laid down by the Supreme Court, following previous authori-
ties, in Gherulal Parakh v Mahadeodas that "though a wager is void and
unenforceable, it is not forbidden by law". Hence a wagering agreement is not
unlawful under Section 23 of the Contract Act,454 and, therefore, the trans-
actions collateral to the main transaction are enforceable. "Accordingly an
agent who paid the losses on wagering transactions was allowed to recover
the amount paid by him from his principal. Similarly, in another case,
"the plaintiff who lent money to the defendant to enable him to pay off
a gambling debt was given a decree to recover the same from the defend-
ant". 456 "Where two partners entered into a contract of wager with a party
and one partner had satisfied his own and his co-partner's liability under
the contract, the Nagpur High Court 57 held that the partner who paid the
amount could legally claim the other partner's share of the loss." Similarly,
the Supreme Court held in Gherulal Parekh v Mahadeo458 that for a part-
nership to enter into wagering transactions is not illegal under Section 23 of
the Act and therefore a partner who has paid the losses on wagering trans-
actions may recover proportionate indemnity from his co-partners.

2. Crossword competitions and lottery
"If skill plays a substantial part in the result and prizes are awarded
according to the merits of the solution, the competition is not a lottery.
Otherwise it is.49 Thus, literary competitions which involve the application
of skill and in which an effort is made to select the best and most skilful
competitor, are not wagers.460 But where prizes depend upon a chance, that
is a lottery. The Madhya Pradesh High Court has characterised lotteries.
as wager. An agreement for payment of prize money on a lottery ticket came
within the category of wagering agreement as contemplated by Section 30.
The court further said that the provisions of neither a Central Act nor that
of a State Act controlling the activities relating to lottery would change the
basic nature of the transaction.42 A suit for recovery of the prize money was
not allowed. The lottery in question was organised by the Raffle Committee,
Indore, for raising funds for a Table Tennis Trust with due permission from
the State Government.
ILLEGAL AND VOID AGREEMENTS
The Contract Act draws a distinction between an agreement which is
only void and the one in which the consideration or object is also unlawful.
"Section 23 points out in what cases the consideration of an agreement is
unlawful, and in such cases the agreement is also void, that is, not enforce-
able at law. 463 Sections 25 to 30 refer to cases in which the agreement is
only void, though the consideration is not necessarily unlawful. An illegal
agreement is one which is actually forbidden by the law; but a void agree-
ment may not be forbidden, "the law may merely say that if it is made, the
courts will not enforce it".464 Thus, every illegal contract is also void, but

In that case (Shekhar Chand Jain) it was a state lottery and a suit founded on a ticket sold in
the lottery was dismissed holding that though the State lottery was not illegal, it was none-
theless in the nature of a wager. The court cited the decision of the Supreme Court in B.R.
Enterprises v State of U.P., (1999) 9 SCC 700: AIR 1999 SC 867, the Supreme Court refused
to recognise lottery as a trade or profession. Even the State sponsored lotteries have the same
element of chance as private lotteries, there being no application of skill in either case. The
State sponsorship only creates public confidence by ruling out fraud, etc. Imposing a tax on
lottery does not give it the status of a trade or profession.

Illegal and void agreements 343
a void contract is not necessarily illegal. However, the distinction is not
always clear.
Main transaction void in either case
Another similarity between an illegal and a void agreement is that in
either case, the main or the primary agreement is unenforceable. Nothing
can be recovered under either kind of agreement and if something has been
delivered or some payment made, it cannot be recovered back.
No action under the main transaction
As laid down by the Supreme Court:
The principle of public policy is this: ex dolo mala non oritur actio.
No court will lend its aid to a man who found his cause of action upon an
immoral or an illegal act. If the cause of action appears to arise ex turpe
cause, or the transgression of a positive law, there the court says that he
has no right to be assisted.465
Thus, a guilty party has no right of action on an illegal contract. A person
who contracted to hire a premises, unknown to the landlord, for holding
a meeting for a blasphemous purpose, was not allowed to sue the land-
lord for breach of contract when the landlord, on learning the real pur-
pose, refused to give the premises.466 Money lent for an illegal purpose is
irrecoverable. A renewed promise to pay an illegal debt will be equally
tainted by the illegality. In such cases the law leaves the parties where it
finds them. "The court will help neither party. 'Let the estate lie where it
falls." Where a person paid a sum of money to a charitable organisation
and promised to pay more if a knighthood was procured which never mate-
rialised, he could not recover back the money.70 Where a sum of money
was paid to secure a Government job through high-profile political leaders
and there being no success, an attempt was made to take back the money.
The recipient issued a cheque in refund. The payment of the cheque was
not allowed to be enforced. No prosecution under Section 138 Negotiable
Instruments Act was allowed because there was no legally enforceable debt
or liability. Where a contract is lawful at its inception, but is performed.
in an unlawful manner, no recovery may be allowed. Thus, in a contract of
transport, the lorry was overloaded, which was an offence under the Road
Traffic Act, 1988 and the goods having been damaged during the journey,

the consignor was not allowed to recover the loss. His manager had knowl-
edge of the overloading.72
"When it is apparent on the face of a contract that it is unlawful, it is the
duty of the judge himself to take an objection and that too, whether or not
the parties take or waive the objection. It is, therefore, open to the court
even without a pleading to consider the question whether the agreement
relied on or proved in the case is immoral."73
Exceptions
1. Where the contract is still executory
Where the contract is still executory, in the sense that no part of the ille-
gal purpose has been carried into effect, the money paid or goods delivered
under it may be recovered. "But if he waits till the illegal purpose is carried
out, or if he seeks to enforce the illegal transaction, in neither case can he
maintain an action." In that case,474 a debtor executed a transfer to deceive
his creditors, but before any creditor could be deceived, he repented and
sought to recover back the property, which he was allowed to do. It seems
that the repentance of the debtor was due to the failure of his design. After
executing the transfer he had summoned a meeting of his creditors to effect
a compromise, but the creditors did not turn up. In subsequent cases the
principle of locus poenitentiae has been confined to cases where the repent-
ance is not due to the failure of the illegal object, but occurs much before
any attempt is made to carry out the illegality.475 This seems to emerge from
Bigos v Bowsted476 where the court did not allow certain share certificates
to be recovered which were delivered as a security under an agreement to
exchange privately the English currency with Italian, one party having
backed out. PRITCHARED J stated the effect of the authorities in the fol-
lowing words: "The defendant and the plaintiff were in pari delicto, which
means that they were equally guilty. The law is that the court will help a per-
son who repents, provided his repentance comes before the illegal purpose
has been substantially performed."
The learned judge then pointed out that the present case showed frustra-
tion, not repentance.
Where money is paid to a person to induce him to commit a crime, can it
be recovered before he does anything to commit the crime? In such cases, the
answer will depend upon the degree of criminality. It is suggested in Anson:

Illegal and void agreements 345
"It seems highly unlikely that the court will allow any locus poenitentiae
at all in the most serious cases of moral reprehensibility, as for example,
where money is paid to another to commit murder."477
The parties' conduct and relative moral capability could be relevant in
determining whether, as a matter of public policy, the court would take
notice of the illegality. On the facts of the case the court disregarded the
plaintiff's illegality because he had an unanswerable claim against the
defendant for fraudulent misrepresentation and because the defendant's own
moral culpability greatly outweighed that of the plaintiff's.478
Where a father transferred some of his shares to his son without receiving
any price, for the purpose of defeating his creditors, and the son refused to
return the shares to the father, the father was allowed recovery. The court
said that one of the major exceptions to the pari delicto rule arises where the
transferor repents before the transaction is carried into effect. In this case,
the illegal purpose was to defraud the creditors but no creditor could be
defrauded. Accordingly, it was not too late for the father to change his mind
and recover the shares from his son. 479
2. Parties not "in pari delicto"
It is settled law that where the parties are not in pari delicto the less guilty
may be able to recover money paid, or property transferred, under the con-
tract. This possibility may arise in three situations:
First, the contract may be of a kind made illegal by a statute in the interest
of a particular class of persons of whom the plaintiff is one.
Secondly, the plaintiff must have been induced to enter into the contract
by fraud or strong pressure.
Thirdly, there is some authority for the view that a person who is under
a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff will not be allowed to retain property,
or to refuse to account for money received, on the grounds of an illegal
transaction.480
One illustration is the decision of the Privy Council in Mistry Amar Singh
v Kulubya.481 Certain land was given to a non-African under a lease in viola-
tion of a law for the protection of Africans in Uganda. The action was by the
African party for recovery of rent and possession. The other party pleaded
illegality. Allowing the action, their Lordships quoted the following passage
from the judgment of Lord MANSFIELD in Browning v Morris:462
But where contracts or transactions are prohibited by positive statutes
for the sake of protecting one set of men from another set of men, the
one, from their situation and condition, being liable to be oppressed or

imposed upon by the other; there, the parties are not in pari delicto; and
in furtherance of those statutes, the person injured may bring his action
and defeat the contract.
Where one of the parties was induced by a fraud to make payments under
a contract, which, unknown to him was of champertous nature, 483 and
where an agent of an insurance company fraudulently induced a woman to
take out an illegal insurance, in either case the payments were allowed to
be recovered back. The result would have been otherwise if no fraud was
involved. Where payment was made in advance for purchasing a paddy
crop not knowing that a control order was being violated, it was allowed to
be recovered. Where additional payment was made to a creditor to induce
him to accept a scheme of compromise because his acceptance would have
influenced the other creditors, the debtor was allowed to recover back the
same. The court said:87 "It is said that both parties are in pari delicto. It is
true that both are in delicto, because the act is a fraud upon the other credi-
tors, but is not par delictum, because, one has the power to dictate, the other
no alternative, but to submit."
488
Payments obtained by a person in breach of his fiduciary duty can also
be recovered back even if the transaction involved illegality. Thus, a law-
yer would be bound to refund the money obtained by him from his client
under a champertous agreement. In an export transaction, the goods were
falsely invoiced to enable the buyer to evade import tax. The consignment
was stolen. The insurer's attempt to escape liability because of the illegality
involved did not succeed. There was no deception towards the insurer, nor
was the insurance claim based upon the illegal contract.489
The Supreme Court refused to interfere in a matter of rent fixation
because it was found that whatever rent the parties were paying and accept-
ing was the result of their voluntary understanding. "There is no element of
compulsion or exploitation and both parties have by consensus contravened
the provisions of law for their mutual advantage."450
Cause of action under void contract
A party to a void contract is entitled to file a suit for its enforcement
and in the alternative to pray for refund of money paid under the contract.
It cannot be said that the plaint under such a contract does not disclose a
cause of action or that it should be rejected or not entertained. The court

There can be decision on voidness or illegality only after taking the suit on
record,491
3. Where recovery possible without relying on illegal contract
Transactions arising out of an agreement to do an illegal act, if they are
such that when taken separately from the illegal act, they would be valid,
they would remain valid and enforceable notwithstanding the illegality of
the agreement. In Mistry Amar Singh v Kulubya93 where the action was
to recover possession of property leased out in violation of a statute, their
Lordships of the Privy Council observed: "He would have presented his
claim without being under any necessity of setting up the unlawful agree-
ments in his plaint. He required no aid from the illegal transaction in order
to establish his case. It was sufficient for him to show that he was the reg-
istered proprietor of the plots of land and that the defendant was in occu-
pation, without possessing the consent in writing of the Governor for such
occupation, and, accordingly, the defendant had no right to occupy."
Similarly, machine tools delivered under an illegal sale were allowed
to be recovered.44 The Court of Appeal laid down that a man's right to
his property will be enforced as against a person in possession even if he
obtained possession under an unlawful agreement. The Supreme Court
of India applied this principle in Surasaibalini Debi v Phanindra Mohan
Mazumdar. 195 The court allowed a person to recover possession of his prop-
erty and business, which he had made over to his brother-in-law for evasion.
of taxes. In a case before the Privy Council on appeal from Malaya:46
The plaintiff purchased a lorry from the defendant and operated it
on his own account. But it had to be registered in the defendant's name
because only he had a haulage licence in respect of it. The defendant
snatched the lorry from the plaintiff without the latter's consent and the
plaintiff sued him to recover back his possession.
The action was allowed. Lord DENNING said: "Although the transaction
between the plaintiff and the defendant was illegal, nevertheless it was fully
executed and carried out; and on that account it was effective to pass the

recovery allowed without bringing in the unlawful agreement. Ghanshyambhai Dattaram v
Babubhai Shankarlal, 1984 GLH 247, allowed a landlord to sue for eviction of a tenant who
entered premises by paying additional consideration in violation of an Act. Tinsley v Milligan
(1994) 1 AC 340 (HL), held by a majority that where a property is transferred by one person
to another in pursuance of an unlawful purpose, the transferor can recover back the property
under the doctrine of resulting trust and without having to rely on the transaction which is
illegal.

property in the lorry to the plaintiff. There are many cases which show that
when two persons agree together in a conspiracy to effect a fraudulent or
illegal purpose and one of them transfers the property to the other in pur-
suance of the conspiracy-then, as soon as the contract is executed and the
fraudulent or illegal purpose is achieved, the property which has been trans-
ferred by one to the other remains vested in the transferee, notwithstanding
its illegal origin. The reason is that the transferor, having fully achieved his
unworthy end, cannot be allowed to turn round and repudiate the means
by which he did it-he cannot throw over the transfer. And the transferee,
having obtained the property, can assert his title to it against all the world,
not because he has any merit of his own, but because there is no one who
can assert a better title to it. The court does not confiscate property because
of illegality-it has no power to do so."
When a contract is repudiated on account of its illegality, the innocent
party may recover compensation "proportionate to the amount of work
done". In Clay v Yates,497 a book having been printed, the printer refused
to print the dedication because it was libellous, it was held that the painter
could recover on quantum meruit basis for the work done by him.
4. Collateral transactions
The only material difference between an illegal and void agreement
relates to their effect upon the collateral transactions. A collateral transac-
tion means a transaction subsidiary to the main transaction. For example,
where money is given to a person to enable him to pay a wagering debt, the
wager is the main transaction and the loan is subsidiary to it. If the main
transaction is illegal, for example, smuggling, a collateral transaction like
money given to enable a person to smuggle, will also be tainted with the
same illegality and the money will be irrecoverable.498 But if the main trans-
action is only void, its collateral transaction will remain enforceable. Thus,
in Gherulal Parakh v Mahadeodas,499 the Supreme Court allowed a partner
to recover from his co-partner his proportionate indemnity for losses suf-
fered by him in entering into wagering transactions on behalf of the firm,
wagering being only void.
The Supreme Court has also emphasised that a landlord and his tenant
cannot be regarded as on par in all respects and, therefore, where the ten-
ant had to pay Rs 2000 to the landlord to secure possession, in contraven-
tion of the Rent Act, the landlord's assurance that the amount would be
adjusted towards rent was binding on him. 500 The court, however, took care
to point out that the doctrine of in pari delicto would not be attracted when

there is no element of compulsion or exploitation and both parties have by
consensus contravened the provisions of law for their mutual advantage.
Following this, the Supreme Court did not allow adjustment for an amount
which the tenant had been paying in addition to the standard rent. There
was no evidence of any compulsion.501
5. Severance
Where an agreement is only partly illegal, the court will enforce the part
which is not illegal provided that it is severable from the rest of the agree-
ment. Where a partnership was created in a truck alongwith a route per-
mit which amounted to a part sale of both, the court held that the whole
agreement was vitiated, although it was only the sale of permit which was
illegal but that was not severable from the rest of the agreement. 502 A con-
tract to provide money to a person to enable him to establish his share in
an estate in return for a promise to pay back the money, and also a share in
the amount that would be recovered from the estate, has been held by the
Supreme Court to be a composite contract for one consideration making the
two types of payment not severable.503
In many cases of contracts relating to trade or legal proceedings the courts
knock out the objectionable clause of the agreement and allow the rest to
be enforced. For example, Section 27 says that the agreement shall be void
to that extent, i.e. to the extent of unreasonable restraint. In Nordenfelt v
Maxim Nordenfelt Guns & Ammunition Cos that part of the contract was
held to be not binding which imposed unreasonable restraint. Similarly, in
two cases relating to separation deeds between a husband and wife which
imposed restraint upon legal proceedings, the Court of Appeal struck out
the restraining part.
Applying these principles to the facts, the Court of Appeal held that the
wife's covenant not to sue was the only consideration she gave for the hus-
band's promise of annuity, the whole of the agreement became void.
Where the contract is severable, it would make no difference that the
parties had knowledge of the fact that their contract contained an illegal
element.
A house was leased out on rent subject to the condition that the lessee,
in addition to paying the controlled rent, would also purchase certain
chattels from the lessor for an agreed price. The price, being much more
than the natural value of the goods, the transaction in essence amounted
to paying a premium for the possession of the house. The lessee occupied
the premises but offered to pay only the natural price of the goods.

[S. 30]
The lessor sought eviction on the ground that the whole agreement was
unlawful. The court did not agree with him. The arrangement had two
aspects, namely, the agreement of lease and the promise to pay a premium.
The latter part was unlawful and it being severable from the rest, the lease
was valid. 506
In another case,507 a husband promised to his wife separate maintenance,
she agreeing on her part not to sue him as long as he paid, nor to sue for
divorce even if he lived in adultery. The husband defaulted with the pay-
ments and contended, as against the wife's action, that, owing to the exon-
eration for adultery, the whole agreement was unlawful. The court allowed
the wife's action saying that only that clause of the agreement was unlawful
by which the husband had bought his freedom from the consequences of
adultery, 508
To secure the performance of a contract for purchase of shares, a guaran-
tee and mortgage were provided by way of additional security. They turned
out to be illegal. Since they were collateral and, therefore, severable, the
main transaction remained enforceable. 509

Discharge of Contract
Modes of discharge
After the formation of a contract, the next stage is reached, namely, the
fulfilment of the object the parties had in mind. When the object is fulfilled,
the liability of either party under the contract comes to an end. The contract
is then said to be discharged. But "performance" is not the only way in
which a contract is discharged. A contract may be discharged:
(1) by Performance; [Ss. 31-67]
(2) by Impossibility of Performance; [S. 56]
(3) by Agreement; [Ss. 62-67] and
(4) by Breach."
Definition
PERFORMANCE OF CONTINGENT CONTRACTS
The expression "contingent contracts" is defined in Section 31 of the
Contract Act:
S. 31. "Contingent contract" defined.-A "contingent contract" is a con-
tract to do or not to do something, if some event, collateral to such contract,
does or does not happen.
Illustration
A contracts to pay B Rs 10,000 if B's house is burnt. This is a contingent contract.
Conditional contract
It is a sort of a conditional contract and the condition is of uncertain
nature. A contract which is subject to a certain or an absolute type of condi-
tion cannot be regarded as a contingent contract. A contract, for example, to
pay a sum of money on the expiry of a time or on the death of a person is not
a contingent contract because these events are of a certain nature. The time
or the person in question will definitely expire and the money will become
1. Ss. 39 and 73. Expiry of the period of limitation for enforcement of rights and obligations
under a contract is not a mode of discharge recognised by the Contract Act. Lapse of time does
not put an end to rights and obligations under the contract, Mahadeo Nathuji Patil v Surjabai

payable. When the condition is of uncertain nature, then only the contract
can be regarded as truly contingent. For example, a contract to pay a sum
of money on the destruction of a premises by fire, is a contingent contract,
for that contingency may or may not happen. From this point of view, all
contracts of insurance, are contingent contracts. Ordinarily, therefore, a
contingent contract will contemplate a future event. But a contract may also
relate to an event which has already happened and the only thing uncertain
being that the parties do not know which way it happened.
Contingency to be collateral to contract
The section emphasises that the contingency contemplated by the contract
must be collateral to the contract. It means that a contract has already arisen
or a subsisting contract is there, but its performance cannot be demanded
unless the contemplated event happens or does not happen. Such a contract
has to be distinguished from a proposal which does not result in a contract
unless the condition is first fulfilled. For example, an offer to pay a sum of
money on the discovery of a missing dog is not a contract at all. It becomes
a contract only when the dog is searched out and then it is no more contin-
gent. On the other hand, a contract to pay a sum of money on the loss of a
ship is a contingent contract. The contract is already there and is not to arise
on loss, but the performance can be demanded only on the loss of the ship.
A contract to pay a sum of money in return for some work or labour is also
not contingent, no contract exists and no wages can be demanded without
performing the work first. In an agreement for sale of land, the condition
was that the sale deed would be executed after the seller obtained permis-
sion for use of the land as village land. It was held that the contract was not
contingent. The agreement matured into a binding contract once permission.
was obtained. It was specifically enforceable. The suit filed within three
years after obtaining permission was not time barred."
A contract to buy land which is under dispute made with a party to the
dispute and to become operative if he wins the case, is a contingent contract,
its performance being wholly dependent upon the result of the litigation. A
contingent contract failed because permission was required (environmental
permission) from the authority concerned but was not granted. The neces-
sity of such clearance was clearly anticipated in the contract as a prerequisite
to its performance. The Supreme Court held that consequent restoration
of the parties to the position in which they were before the contract was

payable on success of litigation, this part was held to be a contingent contract. N. Peddanna
Ogeti Balayya v Kotta V. Srinivasayya Setti Sons, AIR 1954 SC 26. A contract of life insurance
is also a contingent contract. See Commr of Excess Profits Tax v Ruby General Insurance Co
Ltd, AIR 1957 SC 669. Parvathamma v Uma, AIR 2011 Kant 58, a contract for transfer of a
fragmented piece of land to be implemented on the repeal of an Act which prevented fragmen-
tation was held to be void because the contingency was of an uncertain nature.

Performance of contingent contracts
proper. The court distinguished such failure from impossibility of perfor-
mance. The failure of a contingent contract is due to non-happening of an
anticipated event. Whereas impossibility is due to happening of an unantic-
ipated event. A contract for sale of property was subject to the condition
that it would be approved by the seller's labour. No such approval became
available. The contract failed. Earnest money directed to be refunded with
18 per cent interest.6
A, whose property was attached, contracted to sell the same to B and
undertook to apply to the court for the approval of the sale. A did apply
to the court in the performance of his undertaking, but the court rejected
his application. Thereupon A sold the land to C. B sued him for the land.
It was held that the contract of sale to B was a contingent contract, being
subject to the approval of the court, and that approval having not been
given, the contingency did not happen and hence its performance could not
be demanded. A contract to sell a piece of agricultural land which was the
subject-matter of the ongoing consolidation proceedings was held to be of
contingent nature because nobody could tell beforehand to whom the land
might become allotted. It was not enforceable until and unless the consoli-
dation would leave the land in the hands of the seller."
Contingency depending upon will of a person
A contract will be no less contingent where the happening or non-hap-
pening of the contingency depends upon the will of a party. A contract the
performance of which depends upon the promisee's marriage is a contingent
contract, though his marriage is a contingency exclusively within his con-
trol. A situation of this kind was before the Madras High Court in Secy of
State for India v A.J. Arathoon. The case involved supply of timber to a
Government Department. The timber was to be approved by the superinten-
dent of a factory. He did not approve the timber actually supplied. The sup-
plier sued the Government for breach of contract contending that the timber
corresponded with its description in the contract and, therefore, it should
have been approved. There are two possible approaches to the solution of a
problem of this kind. One is to regard the contract as absolute subject only

[S. 31]
to approval, in which case the court should be able to see whether the goods.
answered their description in the contract and the rejection being arbitrary,
it should be set aside. An argument in the support of this approach is that
if goods can be rejected arbitrarily at one's own pleasure and sweet-will,
then it can as well be said that there is no contract at all. The so-called
contract would reduce itself to this that the Government would buy if the
Superintendent so likes. This can hardly be described as a contract. Hence,
to give some meaning to the contract, it would be necessary to hold that
approval should not be arbitrarily refused.
The second possible approach is to regard the contract as contingent. The
fact of approval being collateral to the performance of the contract, its per-
formance could not be demanded till such approval. The trial court adopted
the first approach. It felt that the Superintendent being himself a party to the
contract, his decision could be biased and, therefore, his decision should not
be final. But the Madras High Court rejected this approach and followed
the other approach of regarding the contract as contingent. The contingency
was not fulfilled and hence there was no question of any action for breach.
The position would be different where the goods have already been sup-
plied and the only thing that the contract says is that buyer shall pay when
he is in a position to pay. This is not a contingent contract. The liability to
pay has already arisen. The making of payment at one's ease was only a
personal concession and it would have been an abuse of this concession to
prolong the payment for an unreasonable time. Hence, the money was pay-
able within reasonable time.
A contract for sale of goods prescribing the condition that the goods
would be inspected before despatch was held to be a firm contract. The
import of materials pursuant to such a contract was valid."
Contingency to be condition precedent
Generally, the condition which is collateral to the performance of a con-
tract is a condition precedent, that is, it has to be satisfied first and then
performance can be demanded. It has to be distinguished from a condition
subsequent, namely, a condition which has to be satisfied after the forma-
tion of the contract. Where, for example, a person applied for shares in a
company subject to his being appointed as a cashier in the company, it was
held that shares could not be allotted to him without first making him a
cashier. On the other hand, where the application for shares was subject to
the condition that the applicant would pay nothing until the company paid
dividends, the contract was held to be not a contingent contract. A valid
contract had arisen already; only the payment under it was deferred to the
fulfilment of a condition. Where a person agreed to transfer his vehicle and
permit, it was held to be a valid contract and not contingent or incomplete

only because permission under the Motor Vehicles Act was necessary. He
becomes bound to sign papers for applying for transfer."
Similarly, where a valid contract has arisen but is liable to be defeated
on the happening of some subsequent condition, it will not be a contingent
contract. Where, for example, certain land is sold subject to a condition of
repurchase on the happening of some event, it is not a contingent contract.
The Supreme Court has laid down that a contract, stipulating that on the
day of the redemption of the mortgaged house by the plaintiff, the defendant
would execute a sale deed of the house in favour of the plaintiff, is a typical
illustration of a contingent contract within the meaning of Section 31.12
A contract for the sale of an unspecified share in property; the sale deed
to be executed on actual partition of the property has been held to be not a
contingent contract and is, therefore, capable of specific enforcement." In
an auction of mining leave, the statutory provision was that bidders should
first get approval of the competent authority. A bid was accepted subject to
the condition of approval. It was held that the non-approval of the bidder
prevented a contract from arising making it not enforceable."
Where enforcement depends upon happening of an event [S. 32]
S. 32. Enforcement of contracts contingent on an event happen-
ing. Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncertain future
event happens, cannot be enforced by law unless and until that event has
happened.
If the event becomes impossible, such contracts become void.
Illustrations
(a) A makes a contract with B to buy B's horse if A survives C. This contract cannot be
enforced by law unless and until C dies in A's lifetime.
(b) A makes a contract with B to sell a horse to B at a specified price, if C, to whom the horse
has been offered, refuses to buy him. The contract cannot be enforced by law unless
and until C refuses to buy the horse.
(c) A contracts to pay B a sum of money when B marries C. C dies without being married to
B. The contract becomes void.
The section lays down two basic principles. First, a contract to do an act
on the happening of a future uncertain condition cannot be enforced unless
and until that event happens. Second, if the happening of that event has
become impossible, the contract becomes void. The illustrations appended
to the section clarify both the principles. An option to buy shares of a bank
if and when the bank is converted into a financial corporation is a contingent

contract of this kind, namely, which is to be performed on the happening of
a future uncertain event. 16 A contract for the sale of land with a factory was
to be performed only if the labour unions agreed to the sale and further if
the change of land use was approved by the appropriate authority. None of
these contingencies could be fulfilled because neither there was approval by
the labour unions nor by the relevant authority. The contract was accord-
ingly not allowed to be enforced against the seller."
The contract would also not be enforceable where the event does not
happen in the way contemplated by the contract. Where a car was insured
against loss in transit, the car was damaged without being put in the course
of transit, the insurer was held to be not liable. Once the event has hap-
pened, the contingent contract ripens into an absolute one."
When performance depends upon non-happening of an event [S. 33]
S. 33. Enforcement of contracts contingent on an event not happen-
ing. Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncertain future
event does not happen, can be enforced when the happening of that event
becomes impossible, and not before.
Illustration
A agrees to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship does not return. The ship is sunk. The
contract can be enforced when the ship sinks.
Where the performance of a contract depends upon the non-happening of
an event, naturally the parties have to wait till the happening of that event
becomes impossible. When such circumstances come to pass that show that
the event can no more happen, then only the performance of the contract can
be demanded. The illustration appended to that section makes the sense of
the section clear. An agreement to sell land provided that the earnest money
would be returned in case the land is notified for acquisition. Unknown to
the parties, the land was already under notification. The contract became
impossible of performance and, therefore, void on declaration under Section
6 of the Land Acquisition Act.20
Events linked with human conduct [S. 34]
S. 34. When event on which contract is contingent to be deemed
impossible, if it is the future conduct of a living person.-If the future event
on which a contract is contingent is the way in which a person will act at an
unspecified time, the event shall be considered to become impossible when

such person does anything which renders it impossible that he should so act
within any definite time, or otherwise than under further contingencies.
Illustration
A agrees to pay B a sum of money if B marries C. C marries D. The marriage of B to C must
now be considered impossible, although it is possible that D may die, and that C may after-
wards marry B.
When the event for which the parties are waiting is linked with the future
conduct of a person, that is to say, where the contract is enforceable if a cer-
tain person is to act in a certain way, the event shall be considered to have
become impossible if that person does something which makes it impossible
that he should act in that way in any definite time or without further con-
tingencies being fulfilled. For example, in Frost v Knight, the defendant
promised to marry the plaintiff on the death of his father. While the father
was still alive, he married another woman. It was held that it had become
impossible that he should marry the plaintiff and she was entitled to sue him
for the breach of the contract. Similarly, where a person promised to sell
certain land to the plaintiff within a certain time, but sold to another within
that time, it was held that the performance had become impossible or was
possible only upon the further contingency of the defendant buying back the
land in order to perform his contract with the plaintiff.
Where there was a written agreement to buy the benefits of plaintiff's
invention if it was approved by the engineer, it was held that there was no
concluded contract because the invention was not approved by the engineer.22
S. 35. When contracts become void, which are contingent on happen-
ing of specified event within fixed time.-Contingent contracts to do or
not to do anything if a specified uncertain event happens within a fixed time,
become void if, at the expiration of the time fixed, such event has not happened,
or if, before the time fixed, such event becomes impossible.
When contracts may be enforced, which are contingent on specified
event not happening within fixed time.-Contingent contracts to do or not
to do anything, if a specified uncertain event does not happen within a fixed
time, may be enforced by law when the time fixed has expired and such event
has not happened, or, before the time fixed has expired, if it becomes certain
that such event will not happen.
Illustrations
(a) A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship returns within a year. The contract
may be enforced if the ship returns within the year, and becomes void if the ship is
burnt within the year.
(b) A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship does not return within a year. The
contract may be enforced if the ship does not return within the year, or is burnt within
the year.

[Ss. 36-37]
S.36. Agreements contingent on impossible events, void.-Contingent
agreements to do or not to do anything, if an impossible event happens, are
void, whether the impossibility of the event is known or not to the parties to the
agreement at the time when it is made.
Illustrations
(a) A agrees to pay B 1000 rupees if two straight lines should enclose a space. The agree-
ment is void.
(b) A agrees to pay B 1000 rupees if B will marry A's daughter C. C was dead at the time of
the agreement. The agreement is void.
These provisions are self explanatory.
PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS
Section 37 says that "the parties to a contract must either perform or
offer to perform, their respective promises...." Thus, each party is bound
to perform his obligation under the contract, unless the performance is dis-
pensed with or excused under the provisions of the Contract Act, or of any
other law. 23 Section 37 which lays down the obligation to perform proceeds
as follows:
S. 37. Obligation of parties to contracts.-The parties to a contract must
either perform, or offer to perform their respective promises, unless such per-
formance is dispensed with or excused under the provisions of this Act, or of
any other law.
Promises bind the representative of the promisors in case of the death of
such promisors before performance, unless a contrary intention appears from
the contract.
Illustrations
(a) A promises to deliver goods to B on a certain day on payment of Rs 1000. A died before
that day. A's representatives are bound to deliver the goods to B, and B is bound to pay
Rs 1000 to A's representatives.
(b) A promises to paint a picture for B by a certain day, at a certain price. A dies before the
day. The contract cannot be enforced either by A's representatives or by B.
Obligation of parties to perform
The buyer of property retained some money so as to compel the seller to
perform certain obligations, like evicting tenants and handing over vacant
possession. The relevant document revealed the transaction to be a sale with
consensus ad idem. The court said that non-payment of a part of the sale
consideration could not give a cut at the very root of the contract, since it
23. S. 37. Performance may be dispensed with, for example, by agreement [S. 62] or it may be
excused under S. 56 by supervening impossibility of performance. Syndicate Bank v R.
Veeranna, (2003) 2 SCC 15: (2003) 5 Kant LJ 1, the bank had the right under the agreement
to vary interest upwards up to a certain percentage. The exercise of this power did not require
that the borrower should have been put on notice.

Performance of contracts 359
was a concluded contract. An agreement was signed by the parties and
fully acted upon without the need for executing any further documents. The
agreement was described at its foot as a preliminary and tentative draft for
discussion purposes only. It was held to be a complete agreement entitling
the claimant to relief. 25
Submission of tender is proposal
When a tender is submitted in response to an invitation it is a proposal
and not a contract. It requires to be accepted. The validity period of the
tender as specified in the tender itself was four months. Naturally no accept-
ance could be made after expiry of such period. The forfeiture of the secu-
rity deposit amount by accepting the tender after validity period and failure
of performance by tenderer was not proper.2
Promises bind representatives
The proviso to the section says that a promise binds the representatives
of the promisors in case of his death, unless a contrary intention appears
from the contract. The Cuttack High Court came to the conclusion that
this principle would apply even if the promisor has left behind no legal heir.
The court said: "If the contract is legal, and enforceable, then even if one of
the parties to the contract dies leaving no heir, the persons, who acquired
interest over the subject-matter of the contract through that deceased party
would be bound by the contract and specific performance can be enforced
against such persons." However, this legal proposition in no way helped the
appellant as she had failed to establish existence of the alleged agreement.
Clause for renewal
A contract contained a clause for renewal. The party having the right
to do so under the contract, invoked the renewal clause. The other party

performance.

Supplier delayed deliveries because of expectation that escalated prices would be paid. Agreed
penalty amount charged and not damages for breach, deduction from bills held to be proper.
SBI v Lalsangbera, AIR 2015 Gau 67, the bank had the right under the loan agreement to
publish the names of defaulting buyers. The court said that this did not include the right to
publish photograph of the defaulter also. Photograph was capable of doing greater damage.

refused to accept renewal. The Supreme Court said that the best course for
the party was to get the right of renewal declared and enforced by a court
of law or to get a declaration that the agreement stood renewed as contem-
plated by the renewal clause. 28
Offer of performance [S. 38]
The promisor, must offer to perform his obligation under the contract to
the promisee. This offer is called "tender of performance". It is then for
the promisee to accept the performance. If he does not accept, "the promisor
is not responsible for non-performance, nor does he thereby lose his rights
under the contract". In other words, the tender of performance, if rejected
by the other party, excuses the promisor from further performance and enti-
tles him to sue the promisee for breach of the contract. Thus, a tender of
performance is equivalent to performance. This is the effect of Section 38.
S. 38. Effect of refusal to accept offer of performance.-Where a prom-
isor has made an offer of performance to the promisee, and the offer has not
been accepted, the promisor is not responsible for non-performance, nor does
he thereby lose his rights under the contract.
Every such offer must fulfil the following conditions-
(1) it must be unconditional;
(2) it must be made at a proper time and place, and under such circum-
stances that the person to whom it is made may have a reasonable
opportunity of ascertaining that the person by whom it is made is able
and willing there and then to do the whole of what he is bound by his
promise to do;
(3) if the offer is an offer to deliver anything to the promisee, the promisee
must have a reasonable opportunity of seeing that the thing offered is
the thing which the promisor is bound by his promise to deliver.
An offer to one of several joint promisees has the same legal consequences
as an offer to all of them.

29. A party who promised to sell property on obtaining permission from Income Tax Authorities
was not excused from offering performance by saying that he could not manage the clearance
certificate. The contract remained alive and enforceable. The buyer had been put in possession
of a part of the premises. The seller could not be allowed to take advantage of his own wrong.

Performance of contracts 361
Illustration
A contracts to deliver to B at his warehouse, on the 1st March, 1873, 100 bales of cotton
of a particular quality. In order to make an offer of performance with the effect stated in this
section, A must bring the cotton to B's warehouse, on the appointed day, under such circum-
stances that B may have a reasonable opportunity of satisfying himself that the thing offered
is cotton of the quality contracted for, and that there are 100 bales. .
The tender of performance, in order to have his effect, must fulfil the
following conditions:
1. Tender of performance must be unconditional [S. 38(1)]
The tender of performance must be unconditional. A tender becomes con-
ditional when it is not in accordance with the terms of the contract. For
example, a tender of an amount less than what is due under the contract is
not an effective tender. 30
2. The tender of performance must be made at proper time and place,
and under such circumstances that the person to whom it is made
may have a reasonable opportunity of ascertaining that the person
by whom it is made is able and willing there and then to do the
whole of what he is bound by his promise to do
Often the time and place of performance are fixed by the parties in their
contract. The tender of performance must be made within the time and at
the place so fixed. If it is so made, the promisor is under no further respon-
sibility, if the tender is not accepted. This was established as early as 1843
in Startup v Macdonald:32
The defendant bought of the plaintiff ten tons of linseed oil to be deliv-
ered within the last 14 days of the month of March. The plaintiff ten-
dered on the last of the fourteen days at 9 o'clock at night. The defendant
refused to accept owing to the lateness of the hour.
He was held liable for the breach as the jury found that, though the hour
was unreasonable, yet there was time for the defendant to have taken in and
weighed the goods before midnight. He should, therefore, have accepted
the tender and "then no doubt, the contract would have been literally
performed"
Where in an international trade contract, the agreement was that pay-
ment should reach on the 14th of the month, the court held that before

of the best figure thus obtained was held to be not arbitrary. Food Corporation of India v

[S. 40]
repudiating the contract the defendant should have waited up to midnight
of the 14th.33
Further, the tender must be made under such circumstances that the other
party gets a reasonable opportunity of ascertaining whether the person mak-
ing the tender is able and willing to fulfil the whole of his obligation under
the contract. If the tenderer has to deliver something to the promisee, the lat-
ter must have a reasonable opportunity of seeing that the thing offered is the
thing which the promisor is bound by his promise to deliver. In other words,
the goods tendered must be of the contract description, otherwise the tender
is not valid. If there are several joint promisees, it is not necessary for the
promisor to offer performance to every one of them. A tender made to any
one of them has the same legal consequences as a tender to all of them. 35
In the case of an obligation to pay a debt, the mere fact that the payment
was tendered and refused does not discharge the debtor from his liability
to pay the debt. 36 This principle of old standing has been indorsed by the
Supreme Court in a case" where the debtor had the right on paying back his
loan to recover vacant possession of his premises, and his tender having been
refused, the court held that he was not discharged from his obligation to pay
before he could recover his possession.
Obligation to return security documents on payment
A loan transaction was brought to an end by repayment. It then becomes
the duty of the lender to return the security documents. He was not allowed
to retain them on the ground that some litigation was pending between the
parties.38
Obligation to return security money on rejection of bid
Where a bid was rejected after an unreasonable period of two years and
only then the security deposit was refunded, the court directed payment of
interest at 12 per cent p.a.39
By whom contracts must be performed [S. 40]
S. 40. Person by whom promise is to be performed.-If it appears from
the nature of the case that it was the intention of the parties to any contract that
any promise contained in it should be performed by the promisor himself, such

Performance of joint promises 363
promise must be performed by the promisor. In other cases, the promisor or his
representative may employ a competent person to perform it.
Illustrations
(a) A promises to pay B a sum of money. A may perform this promise, either by personally
paying the money to B, or by causing it to be paid to B by another; and if A dies before
the time appointed for payment, his representatives must perform the promise, or
employ some proper person to do so.
(b) A promises to paint a picture for B. A must perform this promise personally.
S. 41. Effect of accepting performance from third person.-When a
promisee accepts performance of the promise from a third person, he cannot
afterwards enforce it against the promisor.
If there is something in the contract to show that personal performance
was intended, then the contract will have to be performed by the promisor
himself. Sometimes the nature of the promise is an indication by itself that
the promisor must perform personally. This usually happens in cases where
the use of the personal skill of the promisor is involved, for instance, a con-
tract to paint, sing or marry and contracts of technical nature. In such cases
the death of the promisor puts an end to the contract. The promise cannot
be enforced against his legal representatives, neither can they enforce the
promise.
Ordinarily, however, the rule as laid down in Section 37 is that "prom-
ises bind the representatives of the promisors in case of the death of such
promisors before performance". Thus, unless a contrary intention appears
from the contract, a promise can be enforced against and also by the legal
representatives of the seller or the buyer. There is nothing personal in the
sale of goods or payment of price.40
"There is some English authority to the effect that discharge of a contract
by a third person is effectual only if authorised or ratified by the debtor.
In India, however, the words of Section 41 of the Contract Act leave no
room for doubt that when the appellants have accepted performance of the
promise from a third person, they cannot afterwards enforce it against the
promisor."
PERFORMANCE OF JOINT PROMISES
According to English law, if one of the several joint promisors dies, the
rights and liabilities under the contract devolve upon the surviving joint
promisors. The representatives of the deceased promisor neither obtain any
rights nor assume any liability, unless they are the representatives of the last
surviving promisor. This rule may sometimes cause injustice, inasmuch as

[Ss. 42-43]
the creditor loses the security of the solvency of a promisor. Section 42 of the
Contract Act, therefore, lays down a different rule:
Devolution of liabilities
S. 42. Devolution of joint liabilities.-When two or more persons have
made a joint promise, then, unless a contrary intention appears by the contract,
all such persons, during their joint lives, and, after the death of any of them, his
representatives jointly with the survivor or survivors, and, after the death of the
last survivor, the representatives of all jointly, must fulfil the promise.
According to this section joint promisors must, during their joint lives,
fulfil the promise. And if any of them dies, his representatives must, jointly
with the surviving promisors, fulfil the promise and so on. On the death of
the last survivor, the representatives of all of them must fulfil the promise.
But this is subject to any private arrangement between the parties. They may
expressly or impliedly prescribe a different rule.42
Another important aspect of joint promises is codified in Section 43.
Joint and several
S.43. Any one of joint promisors may be compelled to perform.- When
two or more persons make a joint promise, the promisee may, in the absence
of express agreement to the contrary, compel any (one or more) of such joint
promisors to perform the whole of the promise.
Each promisor may compel contribution.-Each of two or more joint
promisors may compel every other joint promisor to contribute equally with
himself to the performance of the promise, unless a contrary intention appears
from the contract.
Sharing of loss by default in contribution.-If any one of two or more
joint promisors makes default in such contribution, the remaining joint promi-
sors must bear the loss arising from such default in equal shares.
Explanation.-Nothing in this section shall prevent a surety from recover-
ing, from his principal, payments made by the surety on behalf of the principal,
or entitle the principal to recover anything from the surety on account of pay-
ments made by the principal.
Illustrations
(a) A, B and C jointly promise to pay D 3000 rupees. D may compel either A or B or C to pay
him 3000 rupees.
(b) A, B and C jointly promise to pay D the sum of 3000 rupees. C is compelled to pay the
whole. A is insolvent, but his assets are sufficient to pay one-half of his debts. C is enti-
tled to receive 500 rupees from A's estate, and 1250 rupees from B.

Performance of joint promises 365
(c) A, B and C are under a joint promise to pay D 3000 rupees. C is unable to pay anything
and A is compelled to pay the whole. A is entitled to receive 1500 rupees from B.
(d) A, B and C are under a joint promise to pay D 3000 rupees. A and B being only sureties
for C. C fails to pay. A and B are compelled to pay the whole sum. They are entitled to
recover it from C.
This section lays down three rules:
Any one compellable to perform
Firstly, when a joint promise is made, and there is no express agreement
to the contrary, the promisee may compel any one or more of the joint prom-
isors to perform the whole of the promise.43 "A, B and C jointly promise
to pay D, 3000 rupees. D may compel either A or B or C to pay him 3000
rupees" 44
Right of contribution [S. 43 (Para 2)]
Secondly, a joint promisor who has been compelled to perform the whole
of the promise, may require the other joint promisors to make an equal
contribution to the performance of the promise, unless a different intention
appears from the agreement. A, B and C are under a joint promise to pay D,
3000 rupees. D recovers the whole amount from A. A may require B and C
to make equal contributions.
Sharing of deficiency [S. 43 (Para 3)]
Thirdly, if any one of the promisors makes a default in such contribution,
the remaining joint promisors must bear the deficiency in equal shares. A, B
and C are under a joint promise to pay D, 3000 rupees. C is unable to pay
anything. The deficiency must be shared by A and B equally. If C's estate is
able to pay one-half of his share, the balance must be made up by A and B
in equal proportions.45
The first rule is at variance with the English Common Law. Referring
to the English rule as laid down in R. v Hoare" and Kendall v Hamilton"
STRACHEY CJ of the Allahabad High Court said, as explained in those judg-
ments the doctrine that there is, in the case of a joint contract, a single cause

366 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
[Ss. 44-45]
of action which can only be once sued on, is essentially based on the right of
joint debtors in England to have all their co-contractors joined as defendants
in any suit to enforce a joint obligation."
But Section 43 allows an action to be brought against any one of the
joint promisors without impleading the others as defendants. Suppose now
that the creditor sues only one joint promisor, can he subsequently sue the
others? According to English Law he cannot. What is the position in India?
According to STRACHEY CJ there is no such bar in the words of Section 43
and, therefore, a subsequent suit against other promisors should be allowed
to proceed." Pollock and Mulla observe: "the reasoning of STRACHEY CJ
seems to us conclusive."49 But some other High Courts have disallowed such
actions.50
Release of one joint promisor
The creditor is also given the right to release anyone of the joint promisors
from his liability and this does not discharge the others from their liability.
Section 44 is as follows:
S. 44. Effect of release of one joint promisor.-Where two or more per-
sons have made a joint promise, a release of one of such joint promisors by the
promisee does not discharge the other joint promisor or joint promisors; nei-
ther does it free the joint promisor so released from responsibility to the other
joint promisor or joint promisors.
This also marks a departure from the English Common Law, according
to which a discharge of one joint promisor amounts to a discharge of all,
unless the creditor expressly preserves his rights against them.
Joint promisees [S. 45]
Devolution of joint rights is governed by almost the same kind of princi-
ples as the devolution of joint liabilities. When a promise is made to more
than one person jointly, the right to claim performance rests with all of them
jointly. If anyone of them dies, it rests with his legal representatives jointly,
with the survivors and after the death of the last survivor, with the repre-
sentatives of all jointly. Section 45 is as follows:
S. 45. Devolution of joint rights.-When a person has made a promise
to two or more persons jointly, then, unless a contrary intention appears from
the contract, the right to claim performance rests, as between him and them,
with them during their joint lives, and, after the death of any of them, with the

and after the death of the last survivor, with the representatives of all jointly.
Illustration
A, in consideration of 5000 rupees, lent to him and B and C, promises B and C jointly to
repay them that sum with interest on a day specified. B dies. The right to claim performance
rests with B's representative jointly with C during C's life, and, after the death of C, with the
representatives of B and C jointly.
The Supreme Court has held that where a joint promisee refuses to join
as a co-plaintiff, he should be taken on record as pro-forma defendant. The
court cannot compel any person to be a plaintiff if he does not want to be
SO. 51
The joint promisee and not the legatee under a will was held entitled to
the amount payable under a joint term deposit."2
Either or survivor saving account
The saving account was originally opened by the husband and wife on
either or survivor basis. Subsequently this mandate of either or survivor was
withdrawn because of strained relations. The husband died. The bank did
not allow the wife to operate the account without succession certificate.
The court said that there was no illegality in it. If the legal heirs consented
on an affidavit to permit their mother to withdraw the amount, the bank
should allow it. Banks are supposed to have a human face and also adopt a
consumer friendly approach.53
Time and place for performance [Ss. 46-50]
S. 46. Time for performance of promise, where no application is to be
made and no time is specified.-Where, by the contract, a promisor is to per-
form his promise without application by the promisee, and no time for perfor-
mance is specified, the engagement must be performed within a reasonable
time.
Explanation.-The question "what is a reasonable time" is, in each particular
case, a question of fact.
S. 47. Time and place for performance of promise, where time is speci-
fied and no application to be made.--When a promise is to be performed on
a certain day, and the promisor has undertaken to perform it without applica-
tion by the promisee, the promisor may perform it at any time during the usual
hours of business on such day and at the place at which the promise ought to
be performed.

368 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
[Ss. 48-50]
Illustration
A promises to deliver goods at B's warehouse on the 1st January. On that day A brings the
goods to B's warehouse, but after the usual hour for closing it, and they are not received. A
has not performed his promise.
When a promise has to be performed within a certain time, it must be
performed on any day before the lapse of that time. Where no time was
specified for performance of the promise, the court said that in such cases.
performance must be offered within reasonable time. The period of three
years as prescribed in Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963, can be taken
as reasonable time. 55
S. 48. Application for performance on certain day to be at proper time
and place. When a promise is to be performed on a certain day, and the
promisor has not undertaken to perform it without application by the promi-
see, it is the duty of the promisee to apply for performance at a proper place and
within the usual hours of business.
Explanation.-The question "what is a proper time and place" is, in each par-
ticular case, a question of fact.
S. 49. Place for performance of promise, where no application to be
made and no place fixed for performance.-When a promise is to be per-
formed without application by the promisee, and no place is fixed for the per-
formance of it, it is the duty of the promisor to apply to the promisee to appoint
a reasonable place for the performance of the promise, and to perform it at such
place.
Illustration
A undertakes to deliver a thousand maunds of jute to B on a fixed day. A must apply to B
to appoint a reasonable place for the purpose of receiving it, and must deliver it to him at
such place.
Debtor to seek his creditor
The common law rule is that a debtor should seek his creditor and pay
him. In keeping with thibts rule the section imposes a duty on a promiser to
apply to his promisee for fixing a reasonable place for performance. Under
the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, it is the duty of the payee (promisee)
to present the instrument for payment.56
S. 50. Performance in manner or at time prescribed or sanctioned by
promisee. The performance of any promise may be made in any manner, or
at any time which the promisee prescribes or sanctions.

credit, and this is done by C. Afterwards, and before A knows of the transfer, C fails.
There has been a good payment by B.
(b) A and B are mutually indebted. A and B settle an account by setting off one item against
another, and B pays A the balance found to be due from him upon such settlement. This
amounts to a payment by A and B, respectively, of the sums which they owed to each
other.
(c) A owes B 2000 rupees. B accepts some of A's goods in reduction of the debt. The deliv-
ery of the goods operates as a part payment.
(d) A desires B, who owes him Rs 100, to send him a note for Rs 100 by post. The debt is
discharged as soon as B puts into the post a letter containing the note duly addressed
to A.
Where no time specified and performance is to be without application
The first principle as laid down in Section 46 is that where the promisor is
to perform without any application by the promisee, and no time for perfor-
mance is specified, the engagement must be performed within a reasonable
time. The explanation to the section says that "what is a reasonable time"
is, in each particular case, a question of fact."
Unreasonably long delay cannot be regarded as reasonable. Thus, where a
person undertook to discharge the debt of another but no time for payment
was fixed, it was held that the offer of payment after three years was too
late. That amounted to breach. A contract to keep a ship insured was held to
have been broken although there was only a delay of three days. In the case
of a ship much can happen in three days. But in a contract of sale of shares
two months' time was held to be reasonable for completing it.
Usual business hours
The second general principle is stated in Section 47. Where the promisor
has undertaken to perform without any application from the promisee, but
the day of performance is fixed, the promisor may perform the promise dur-
ing the usual business hours of the day and at the place where such promise
ought to be performed. Since only the day of performance is stated but not
the place, the promise should be performed at the place where its nature
demands, that is, where it ought to be performed. In a promise, for example,
to deliver goods at the buyer's warehouse, the tender of performance must
be made at that place. The promisor should bring the goods at that place
during the usual business hours. If he brings the goods after the business-
hours and they are not received, it cannot be said that the promise has been
performed. When the day on which a promissory note or bill of exchange is
at maturity is a public holiday, the instrument shall be deemed to be due on
the next preceding business day. But in other cases much depends on the
usages of the particular trade. If such usage allows performance on the next
succeeding day, it will be quite reasonable to offer performance on that day.

formance within reasonable time. Hungersford Investment Trust Ltd v Haridas Mundhra,

370 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
Application for performance to be at proper place and time
[S. 50]
The third general principle is to be found in Section 48. Where the day
of performance is fixed, but the promisor has not to perform without
application from the promisee, it is the duty of the promisee to apply for
performance at a proper place and within the usual business hours. The
explanation to the section says that "what is a proper time and place" is a
question of fact in each case.
Application for reasonable place of performance
The fourth general principle is in Section 49. When a promise is to be
performed without any application by the promisee, and no place is fixed
for performance, it is the duty of the promisor to apply to the promisee to
appoint a reasonable place for the performance of the promise, and to per-
form it at such place. The illustration appended to the section supposes a
case in which there is a contract to supply a quantity of jute on a fixed day.
The seller must apply to the buyer to appoint a reasonable place for the per-
formance of the promise and then to perform the promise at such a place.
A promissory note executed at Bangalore stated that it would be payable
at Bangalore or at any place in India. The payee settled in New Delhi and
demanded payment at New Delhi. It was held that under Section 49 it was
the duty of the debtor to seek his creditor and to pay him there."
Time and manner of performance, promisee's choice
The next general principle is stated in Section 50. The section leaves the
whole question as to the time and manner of performance upon the choice
of the promisee. It says that the performance of any promise may be made in
any manner, or at any time which the promisee prescribes or sanctions. The
illustrations appended to the section deserve to be noted. If a person owes
another a sum of money and the creditor tells him to pay the amount into his
account in a bank, which is done; and afterwards, before the creditor comes
to know of the fact of payment, the bank fails, so that the creditor does not
get the benefit of the payment; even so the debtor is discharged from his
liability. Where two persons are mutually indebted and they agree to set off
their debts against each other, the balance being paid off by one to the other.
Both stand discharged from their respective liability. Where the creditor
accepts goods from the debtor in payment, the debtor stands discharged to
the extent of the value of the goods. Where the creditor desires the debtor to
send the money by post, the debtor will be discharged as soon as he posts a
properly addressed and stamped letter containing the money.60

Performance of joint promises 371
Performance of reciprocal promises [Ss. 51-54]
When a contract consists of an exchange of promises, they are called
reciprocal promises. Section 2(f) say that "promises which form the con-
sideration or part of the consideration for each other, are called reciprocal
promises. When such promises have to be simultaneously performed, the
promisor is not bound to perform unless the promisee is ready and willing
to perform his promise. This principle is laid down in Section 51.
S. 51. Promisor not bound to perform, unless reciprocal promisee
ready and willing to perform.-When a contract consists of reciprocal prom-
ises to be simultaneously performed, no promisor need perform his promise
unless the promisee is ready and willing to perform his reciprocal promise.
Illustrations
(a) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B to be paid for by B on delivery.
A need not deliver the goods, unless B is ready and willing to pay for the goods on
delivery.
B need not pay for the goods, unless A is ready and willing to deliver them on payment.
(b) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B at a price to be paid by instalments, the
first instalment to be paid on delivery.
A need not deliver, unless B is ready and willing to pay the first instalment on delivery.
B need not pay the first instalment, unless A is ready and willing to deliver the goods on
payment of the first instalment.
In a contract, for example, for the sale of goods on payment of price, the
seller need not deliver the goods unless the buyer is ready and willing to
pay for the goods on delivery. Similarly, the buyer need not pay unless the
seller is ready and willing to deliver the goods on payment. If the price is
to be paid in instalments and the first instalment is payable on delivery, the
seller need not deliver unless the buyer is ready and willing to pay the first
instalment and the buyer need not pay the instalment unless the seller is
ready and willing to deliver the goods. Certain material was supplied. The
terms and conditions of the supply order stated that 90 per cent of the cost of
the material was to be paid on delivery and the remaining 10 per cent after
a favourable test report about the material was received from the Indian
Institute of Packaging. A negative report was received, in the form of a copy
as the original was not available. The copy of the report showed tampering.
Evidence also showed that testing rules of the Institute were not followed.

Hence, it could not be said that the report was negative. The defendant was
bound to pay the balance of the price.62
There was an agreement for reconstruction of the tenanted premises with
the additional feature of providing a toilet. The tenant agreed to pay higher
rent on reconstruction. Reconstruction was over but toilet facility was not
provided. The Supreme Court held that the tenant was not obliged to pay
higher rent though he was put in possession of the reconstructed premises.63
Order of performance
The order in which reciprocal promises must be performed may be fixed
by the contract and the order so fixed must be followed. But where the order
is not expressly fixed, they will have to be performed in the order which the
nature of the transaction admits. The relevant provision is Section 52.
S. 52. Order of performance of reciprocal promises.-Where the order
in which reciprocal promises are to be performed is expressly fixed by the con-
tract, they shall be performed in that order; and where the order is not expressly
fixed by the contract, they shall be performed in that order which the nature of
the transaction requires.
Illustrations
(a) A and B contract that A shall build a house for B at a fixed price. A's promise to build the
house must be performed before B's promise to pay for it.
(b) A and B contract that A shall make over his stock-in-trade to B at a fixed price, and
B promises to give security for the payment of the money. A's promise need not be
performed until the security is given, for the nature of the transaction requires that A
should have security before he delivers up his stock.
In a case before the Allahabad High Court:64
The defendant took a lease of land from the Municipality of a town on
condition that he pays Rs 630 for levelling charges and possession was to
be delivered after levelling. The question arose whether the sum was to be
paid before or after the levelling. The agreement was silent on the point.
The court held that "in the ordinary course of business work is not usu-
ally paid for before it is done. It is the custom in some cases for payment
to be made in instalments as the work progresses but the person for whom
work is done is not expected to pay the entire cost in advance without an
express agreement to that effect".

Performance of joint promises 373
Section 53 lays down the principle that where one of the parties to recip-
rocal promises prevents the other from performing his promise, the contract
becomes voidable at the option of the party so prevented; and he is entitled
to compensation from the other party for any loss which he may sustain in
consequence of the non-performance of the contract.
S. 53. Liability of party preventing event on which contract is to take
effect. When a contract contains reciprocal promises, and one party to the
contract prevents the other from performing his promise, the contract becomes
voidable at the option of the party so prevented; and he is entitled to compen-
sation from the other party for any loss which he may sustain in consequence of
the non-performance of the contract.
Illustration
A and B contract that B shall execute certain work for A for a 1000 rupees, B is ready and
willing to execute the work accordingly, but A prevents him from doing so. The contract
is voidable at the option of B; and, if he elects to rescind it, he is entitled to recover from A
compensation for any loss which he has incurred by its non-performance.
Liability of party preventing performance
The same result would follow where the obstruction to performance is
caused by the inadequacy of the machinery or material supplied by one of
the parties. For example, in a case before the Privy Council," where in order
to get his mine cleared of a rock, the defendant had to supply a crusher. The
crusher supplied was too inadequate for the job. This was held to be such an
obstruction to performance as enabled the contractor to recover his expenses
and loss of profits. Similarly, in a case before the Supreme Court, 66 a bidder
to whom a coal mine was knocked down was allowed to have refund of his
deposit when the coal commissioner refused to permit him to take the coal
to U.P., any such restriction being not present in the terms of the auction.
Where the contract was for making a canal and the promisee department
had to supply cement, etc., and while the contractor had started digging,
the material was not supplied nor he was permitted to purchase in the open
market, the working stopped. The department considered this as a breach.
The security deposit and earnest money was forfeited. The payment for
work already done was withheld. All this was held to be wrong. The amount
forfeited and withheld payment were ordered to be released with interest at
9 per cent. 67

374 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
[S. 54]
Where the nature of the reciprocal promises is such that one cannot be
performed, or its performance cannot be claimed unless the other party
performs his promise in the first place, then if the latter fails to perform, he
cannot claim performance from the other, but must make compensation to
him for his loss. Section 54 incorporates this principle.
S. 54. Effect of default as to that promise which should be first per-
formed in contract consisting of reciprocal promises.When a contract
consists of reciprocal promises, such that one of them cannot be performed, or
that its performance cannot be claimed till the other has been performed, and
the promisor of the promise last mentioned fails to perform it, such promisor
cannot claim the performance of the reciprocal promise, and must make com-
pensation to the other party to the contract for any loss which such other party
may sustain by the non-performance of the contract.
Illustrations
(a) A hires B's ship to take in and convey, from Calcutta to the Mauritius, a cargo to be pro-
vided by A, B receiving a certain freight for its conveyance. A does not provide any cargo
for the ship. A cannot claim the performance of B's promise, and must make compensa-
tion to B for the loss which B sustains by the non-performance of the contract.
(b) A contracts with B to execute certain builders' work for a fixed price, B supplying the
scaffolding and timber necessary for the work. B refuses to furnish any scaffolding or
timber, and the work cannot be executed. A need not execute the work, and B is bound
to make compensation to A for any loss caused to him by the non-performance of the
contract.
(c) A contracts with B to deliver to him, at a specified price, certain merchandise on board a
ship which cannot arrive for a month, and B engages to pay for the merchandise within
a week from the date of the contract. B does not pay within the week. A's promise to
deliver need not be performed, and B must make compensation.
(d) A promises B to sell him one hundred bales of merchandise, to be delivered next day,
and B promises A to pay for them within a month. A does not deliver according to his
promise. B's promise to pay need not be performed, and A must make compensation.
Effect of one party's default
Another illustration is the Supreme Court decision in Nathulal v
Phoolchand:68
The plaintiff was the owner of a ginning factory constructed on agri-
cultural land and nominally held in the name of his brother. He sold
the factory to the defendant who paid half the price at once and was
put in possession, the balance being payable on a fixed date. The buyer
defaulted in paying up on that date and the seller rescinded the contract
and brought an action for possession.

Performance of joint promises 375
SHAH J speaking for himself and HEGDE J held that the nature of the
contract required the seller to have had his own name recorded as the owner
and have obtained permission from the State Government for transfer of
the agricultural land, before he could claim the final payment. If, therefore,
under the terms of the contract the obligations of the parties have to be
performed in a certain sequence, one of the parties to the contract cannot
require compliance with the obligation by the other party without in the
first instance performing his own part of the contract which in the sequence
of obligations is to be performed by him earlier. So long as Nathulal (seller)
did not carry out his part of the contract, Phoolchand could not be called
upon to pay the balance of the price."
The offer to perform a reciprocal promise in different terms than con-
templated by the contract, for example, an offer of payment before the time
fixed, is not valid performance so as to demand performance from the oppo-
site side.70
Under a contractual arrangement the plaintiff-respondent was to supply
to the other defendant-appellant TV signals and the appellant was to supply
them to cable operators after decoding. The appellant informed the supplier
that it was discontinuing the service to cable operators because of non-pay-
ment by them and that it would also not be able to pay to the supplier. Because
of this the supplier stopped sending the signals. The supplier subsequently
brought an action for damages for the unexpired period of the agreement
which was not used by the appellant. The court said that Section 54 would
not help the supplier. He acquiesced in the act of the appellant and stopped
sending signals. He had the full right to rescind the contract and bring an
action for breach, but he did not adopt this course."1
Where the contractor had to submit a bank performance guarantee
within a certain time, and only then the other party could be called upon
to perform his part of the contract, but he failed to do so and the letter of
credit submitted by him was also conditional, it was held that since the other
party had not ended the contract, it remained alive for the benefit of both
parties. There was no breach and no dispute. This aspect was not referable
to arbitration.72

premium for its insurance came back dishonoured and the insurer neither

cancelled the policy nor sent any information to the owner about the dis-
honour of his cheque, it was held that the insurer could not deny liability to
indemnify the insured for loss caused to the vehicle. The insurer had given no
opportunity to the owner to make payment after dishonour of his cheque."
Promises comprising of legal and illegal parts
S. 57. Reciprocal promise to do things legal and also other things ille-
gal.-Where persons reciprocally promise, firstly to do certain things which are
legal, and, secondly, under specified circumstances to do certain other things
which are illegal, the first set of promises is a contract, but the second is a void
agreement.
Illustration
A and B agree that A shall sell B a house for 10,000 rupees, but that, if B uses it as a gam-
bling house, he shall pay 1,50,000 rupees for it.
The first set for reciprocal promises, namely, to sell the house and to pay 10,000 rupees
for it, is a contract.
The second set is for an unlawful object, namely, that B may use the house as a gambling
house, and is a void agreement.
Section 57 applies to cases where two sets of promises are distinct. When
the void part of an agreement can be properly separated from the rest, the
latter does not become invalid. The ready-forward transaction consists of
two parts. In the ready leg there is a purchase or sale of securities at a stated
price which is executed on payment of consideration for spot delivery of the
security certificates together with transfer forms. The full and absolute own-
ership of the title in securities vests in the purchaser, the entire property in
the security passing immediately upon such delivery and payment. The seller
is divested of all the rights, title and interests in the securities. The forward
leg is to be performed at a later date on the stated price being paid. The
securities are to be delivered back when the title in interest therein would
pass to the original seller."
S. 58. Alternative promise, one branch being illegal.--In the case of an
alternative promise, one branch of which is legal and the other illegal, the legal
branch alone can be enforced.
Illustration
A and B agree that A shall pay B 1000 rupees, for which B shall afterwards deliver to A
either rice or smuggled opium.
This is a valid contract to deliver rice, and a void agreement as to the opium.75

lation of the policy.

TIME FOR PERFORMANCE [S. 55]
Time for performance 377
Sometimes the parties to a contract specify the time for its performance.
Ordinarily it is expected that either party will perform his obligation at the
stipulated time. But if one of them fails to do so, the question arises what is
the effect upon the contract. Section 55 contains the answer.
S. 55. Effect of failure to perform at fixed time, in contract in which time
is essential.-When a party to a contract promises to do a certain thing at or
before a specified time, or certain things at or before specified times, and fails
to do any such thing at or before the specified time, the contract, or so much
of it as has not been performed, becomes voidable at the option of the promi-
see, if the intention of the parties was that time should be of the essence of the
contract.
Effect of such failure when time is not essential.-If it was not the inten-
tion of the parties that time should be of the essence of the contract, the con-
tract does not become voidable by the failure to do such thing at or before the
specified time; but the promisee is entitled to compensation from the promisor
for any loss occasioned to him by such failure.
Effect of acceptance of performance at time other than that agreed
upon. If, in case of a contract voidable on account of the promisor's failure
to perform his promise at the time agreed, the promisee accepts performance.
of such promise at any time other than that agreed, the promisee cannot claim
compensation for any loss occasioned by the non-performance of the promise
at the time agreed, unless, at the time of such acceptance, he gives notice to the
promisor of his intention to do so.
Factors which make time of essence
According to this section, if the intention of the parties was that time
should be the essence of the contract, then a failure to perform at the agreed
time renders the contract voidable at the option of the opposite party. "Time
is generally considered to be of the essence of the contract in the following
three cases:
(1) Where the parties have expressly agreed to treat it as of the essence of
the contract;
(2) Where delay operates as an injury;
(3) Where the nature and necessity of the contract requires it to be so
construed, for example, where a party asks for extension of time for
performance."%
76. See R.K. PRASAD J, Orissa Textile Mills Ltd v Ganesh Das, AIR 1961 Pat 107. Unless the
contract prescribes a time for performance, there is no question of any particular moment
of time being regarded as of the essence of the contract, D.S. Thimmappa v Siddaramakka,
(1996) 8 SCC 365: AIR 1996 SC 1960. The mere fact of time being mentioned with a state-
ment that delay would have to be compensated does not of itself make time of the essence,

378 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
The well known authority is Bhudra Chand v Betts."
[S. 55]
The plaintiff stipulated with the defendant to engage his elephant for
the purpose of Kheda operations (to capture wild elephants). The con-
tract provided that the elephant would be delivered on the 1st October,
1910; but the defendant obtained an extension of time till the 6th October
and yet did not deliver the elephant till the 11th. The plaintiff refused to
accept the elephant and sued for damages for the breach.
He was held entitled to recover as the parties intended that time should
be of the essence of the contract. "This conclusion is confirmed by the cir-
cumstance that the defendant obtained an extension of the time; if the time
were not of the essence of the contract, he need not have asked for extension
of time."78
non-performance on the stipulated date did not give the party the right to treat the contract as
ended and forfeit earnest money. Thakorlal V. Patel v Lt. Col. Syed Badruddin, (1993) 1 Guj
LR 28. The court said (at p. 35): "The language of the agreement must show in most unmis-
takable terms that the intention of the parties was to make their rights to depend upon the
observation of the time-limit. Intention may also be inferred from the nature of the property-
to be sold and the conduct of the parties and the surrounding circumstances at or before the
contract and not what takes place after the contract has been entered into. Even where the
parties have expressly provided that time is of the essence of the contract, other provisions
may exclude the inference that the completion of the work by a particular date was intended
to be fundamental, for example, if the contract were to include clauses providing for extension
of time in certain contingencies or for payment of fine for every day or week the work remains
unfinished, such clauses would be construed as rendering ineffective the express provision
relating to the time being of the essence of the contract." The court picked up these obser-
vations from the decision of the Supreme Court in Gomathinayagam Pillai v Palaniswami
Nadar, AIR 1967 SC 868: (1967) 1 SCR 227. Vairavan v K.S. Vidyanandam, AIR 1996 Mad
353, sale of immovable property with no stipulation that time was of the essence, there was
stipulation for completion within six months failing which the advance paid was not to be
returned. The court said that this would not make time of the essence. Recovery of property
allowed by order of specific performance. Badru Nisha v Yogendra Prasad Sinha, AIR 2006
Pat 71: (2006) 1 BLJR 637 (Pat), in a contract for sale of immovable property, the date of
performance was fixed with a provision for penalty if there was failure to keep the time, time
was held to be the essence. Next day after the expiry of the date, purchaser sent a notice to
the seller. Thus the conduct of the parties also showed that they attached importance to time.
Haryana Telecom Ltd v Union of India, AIR 2006 Del 339, supply of cables, failure, the
department claimed damages for non-supply, procured from other sources at cheaper rates,
award of damages was set aside. Time was of the essence because there was a clause that every
delay would be liquidated damages clause. Coromandel Indag Products (P) Ltd v Garuda
Chit & Trading Co (P) Ltd, (2011) 8 SCC 601, the seller of property was in need of money,
only short term extension was allowed, this showed that the short term period allowed for
paying the price constituted time as of the essence.

Time for performance 379.
In business matters time generally of essence
Businessmen attach importance to time
The matter depends upon the intention of the parties. Even where "a spe-
cific date is mentioned for the completion of the contract," one has not to
look at the letter but at the substance of the agreement in order to ascertain
the real intention of the parties". "In commercial contracts time is ordi-
narily of the essence of the contract."81 This is so because the business world
requires certainty and also because "merchants are not in the habit of
placing upon their contracts stipulations to which they do not attach some
value and importance". Thus, in a contract to supply imported goods in
October or November;" in a contract for the purchase of chassis for a diesel
truck to be supplied within two months and in an auction purchase, where
the price was to be paid within 15 days, time was held to be of the essence
of the contract. Similarly, in a contract for the sale or purchase of goods the
prices of which fluctuate rapidly in the market, the time of delivery and of
payment are considered to be of the essence. In Mahabir Prasad Rungta v
Durga Datt the Supreme Court held on the facts of the case that time of
payment was of the essence of the contract. The facts of the case were that a
transporter contracted with Rungta, a colliery owner, to transport coal from
a colliery to the railway station. The colliery-owner had to keep the road in
repair and to arrange for petrol. He had also to pay for the transportation.
on the 10th of the next month. It was alleged that these things were not
done in time and, therefore, the transporter could not go on with his work.
The transporter rescinded the contract and brought an action for damages.
It was held that in commercial transactions time is ordinarily of the essence
of the contract. In this contract the time of payment and of arranging other
things was, particularly, such an important condition of the contract that
79. Hence it becomes a mixed question of law and fact. MCD v Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar, (1987)

80. See Sachidananda Patnik v G.P. & Co, AIR 1964 Ori 269. State of Karnataka v Coimbatore
Premier Constructions, (1988) 1 Kant LJ 249, where though time was described as of the
essence, additional work allotted to the contractor was more extensive than the main work,
the stipulated time lost its character of being essential. U.K. Ramakrishnan v R. Raveendran,
(2004) 1 KLT (SN 7) 6 (Ker), where time, though specified, is not of the essence, performance
must be offered within reasonable time. Lakshmi Amma v Ayyappan, (2003) 3 KLT 577,
stipulation was that the plaintiff could file a suit within one week of the date of expiry of the
agreement. The court said that this could not deprive the plaintiff of the right to file a suit
within the period of limitation. S. 55 takes note of the effect of time as to performance and
not as to filing of suits.

[S. 55]
Section 55 could be invoked by the aggrieved party and the transporter was
entitled to rescind the contract.
Construction contracts
Time schedule in a construction contract is likely to be of the essence
because construction is a commercial service. Where 24 months' time was
given to the builder with a stipulation that if he failed to deliver within
the stated time, he would pay 10 per cent per annum of the purchase price
measured by the period of delay, time was held to be of the essence entitling
recovery of the stipulated amount. Similarly, where a builder's commit-
ment with a bank was that he would make their building ready within six
months, but could not do so, the bank was allowed to terminate the con-
tract. The fact that the bank exercised this right after about two months
after the expiry of the stipulated time did not amount to an extension of
time,89
The termination of a contract was held to be proper where the contractor
was not able to do anything to carry out the repair of a flood-protection
dam inspite of the extension of time. The matter of time was a very impor-
tant factor in the contract." The Supreme Court observed that in construc-
tion contracts, the time of completion would be of the essence when special
features exist."
In a joint venture agreement, one of the clauses was that the defendants
were to perform certain formalities within five years, and that, on failure to
do so, the agreement was to become null and void. Neither any approval was
obtained within that time, nor sanction of the building plan. The defend-
ants could not start the construction within time. The court said that the
provision in the contract for penalty and extension of time was of no use.
The contract had ended by the efflux of time.92 Where the construction of a
warehouse could not be completed within the stipulated time and extensions
were granted several times and even so the work could not be completed, it
was held that the party could put an end to the contract at the end of the last
extension if the work was still not completed."

[S. 55]
Sale transactions
The courts would have to see on the facts of each case involving a sale
transaction whether time factor was essential to performance or not. In a
contract of sale of goods, the time of shipment is of the essence. There is
a considerable authority in support of this rule and it has been recognised
and accepted in Bowes v Shand." Here in a contract of sale of rice to be
shipped at Madras during March or April, 1874, by a ship of the name of
Rajah of Cochin, the stipulation in regard to shipment was held to be a
condition of the contract and the contract was held to be not satisfied by
shipment a month earlier, that is, in February. A contract for sale of goods
required fifteen days' loading notice. The court regarded it as a condition of
the contract. The courts require precise compliance with stipulations as to
time whenever the circumstances of the case indicate that that would fulfil
the intention of the parties and that, in general, time is of the essence in
mercantile contracts.95
A leading Supreme Court authority is China Cotton Exporters v Beharilal
Ramcharan Cotton Mills Ltd." The appellants who carried on an import
business at Bombay contracted to supply to the respondent mill a quantity
of Italian staple fibre cotton. The shipment was to take place in October or
November. The contract concluded by the remark: "This contract is subject
to import licence and therefore the shipment date is not guaranteed". A part
of the goods were supplied and accepted, but the rest were not supplied in the
time mentioned. The buyer wanted to avoid the contract on this ground. It
was held that in spite of the remark that shipment date was not guaranteed,
time was of the essence and the buyer was entitled to avoid the contract.
DAS GUPTA J said: Remembering, as we must, that in commercial contracts
time is ordinarily of the essence of the contract and giving the word "there-
fore" its natural grammatical meaning, we must hold that what the parties
intended was that to the extent that delay in obtaining licence stands in the
way of keeping to the shipment date, October/November, 1950, this ship-
ment date was not guaranteed, but with this exception, October-November,
1950, was guaranteed. The sellers contended that the parties were mention-
ing only one of the many reasons which might cause delay in shipment and
the conjunction "therefore" was used only to show the connection between
one of the many reasons-by way of illustration and a general agreement
that the shipment date was not guaranteed. We do not consider this expla-
nation of the use of the word "therefore" acceptable. If the parties intended
that quite apart from delay in obtaining import licence, shipment date was
2016 SC 553, in a contract with fixed time frame, there was change in the nature of work and
also involvement of additional work admitted by the parties. It was held that the parties could
not be expected to go into a fresh round of negotiations and reframe terms of the contract. The
suit was pending for over two decades.

not guaranteed, the natural way to expressing such intention would be to
say: "The contract is subject to import licence and the shipment date was
not guaranteed." The ordinary rules of grammar would not use the word
"therefore" in such a context except to mean that only to the extent that
delay was due to delay in obtaining import licence, shipment time was not
guaranteed.
The delay in this case was due to the failure of the seller's own supplier to
supply in time. This cannot be a defence unless it was a condition of the con-
tract that the goods would be supplied only when received from the sources
of supply. In a similar case before the Gujarat High Court:97
The undertaking was to ship by a particular ship in August, 1954.
The plaintiff failed to ship in August and on their request the defendants
extended the time to September 10. The plaintiffs failed to make good
their default even within the extended time and, therefore, the defendants
finally repudiated the contract. The plaintiff sued them for breach.
BHAGWATI J, following China Cotton Exporters, above, held that the
time of shipment was of the essence and it was the plaintiff and not the
defendants who were guilty of breach.
An application for extension of time does not take effect unless accepted
and the fact that an extension for a week was offered would not amount to
a waiver within the meaning of Section 63 of the right to insist upon the
stipulated time.
There was a contract for the sale of red oxide of quality and quantity stip-
ulated within 45 days, the time was described to be as of the essence. There
were provisions for repudiation on default and also for liquidated damages
and penalty. Considering these terms as also the commercial nature of the
contract, the time was held to be as of the essence. 98 The contract was with
a public sector undertaking for supply of iron ores. The petitioner was inti-
mated to pay the consideration within seven days of the letter of intent. He
could not do so. In the meantime iron ore prices increased considerably. Thus
time was held to be of the essence. The action of the respondent to release
supplies at increased rates could not be questioned in a writ petition."
Land and property dealings
In a contract for the sale of land or immovable property, the Supreme
Court has laid down that "it would normally be presumed that time was not
of the essence of the contract. Mere incorporation in the written agreement
of a clause imposing penalty in case of default does not by itself evidence an

Time for performance 383
intention to make time of the essence".100 In such cases, therefore, the time
factor would not be of essence for obtaining the relief of specific perfor-
mance. Intention of the parties can be ascertained from factors like nature
of the property agreed to be sold, the possibility of price fluctuation, the
need for entering into the contract, conduct of the parties before, at the time
of and subsequent to the contract and other surrounding circumstances. A
declaration that the stipulated time shall be of the essence would have to
be taken in the light of other provisions and such other factors may either
exclude or strengthen the inference that time was to be of the essence.102
Where the agreement in clear terms provided that it was to be performed
within six months elsè the earnest money would stand forfeited. The time
was held to be of the essence. 103 In a contract for sale of land there was
an express stipulation that time was of the essence. The consequences of
non-performance within time were also stipulated. There was some surplus

1005; Ram Kishan Dass v Bhavi Chand Sharma, AIR 1988 Del 20. In a contract for the sale
of plots of land, 30 months' time was reserved by the seller for obtaining planning permis-
sions, that was considered to be a sufficiently long period to disentitle the vendor from seek-
ing any further time. Mohd Nazran v Al-Ekhwan Construction, (1991) 3 Current LJ 2324,
High Court, Singapore. E.S. Rajan v R. Mohan, 1995 AIHC 3218 (Kant), the mere fact that
time for performance is specified does not make it of the essence of the contract. Certain acts
may be of such a nature that they may or may not be completed within the specified time.
Tatavarthi Jagannadham v Akkineni Radhakrishna, (1997) 6 ALD 261 (DB). Jayalakshmi
v Anilkumar, 1996 AIHC 4353 (Ker), in a sale of immovable property, the performance of
the contract was dependent upon the fulfilment of certain requirements, and, therefore, it
was held that the time reserved for completion of the transaction could not be of the essence
of the bargain. Ranganatha Gounder v Sahadeva Gounder, AIR 2004 Mad 520, the time
limit specified in the agreement cannot be regarded as irrelevant and can be ignored with
impunity. But even so time cannot be regarded as of the essence in toto because the discre-
tion vested in the court under Ss. 10 and 20 of the Specific Relief Act would be nullified.
Amteshwar Anand v Virender Mohan Singh, (2006) 1 SCC 148: AIR 2006 SC 151, parties
never treated time to be an important factor. Payments under the agreement were asked for
much after the dates had expired. Time was held to be not of the essence. Yogesh Mehta v
Custodian, (2007) 2 SCC 624, balance amount of consideration under terms of the contract

land which required permission. The purchaser was put under the obliga-
tion to get permission. He could not do so. The court said that time being
of the essence, the purchaser was not entitled get the decree of specific
performance,104
In an agreement to sell land there was a stipulation that the sale deed
would be executed within one month of the date of securing permission
from the Land Ceiling Authorities, but there was no stipulation as to the
effect of failure of keeping the date. It was held that the vender was entitled
to specific performance. The stipulated time was not of the essence.10 In
another case the agreement which specified a date for performance was sub-
stituted by a new agreement which did not mention any date for execution
of the sale deed. The agreement was made to depend upon the result of a
case which was filed against the vendor by his brother and sister. No time.
was fixed for execution of the sale deed after decision in the suit. The court
naturally said that time was not of the essence of the contract. The vendee
served notice. The vendor refused. Suit filed within three years after such
refusal was held to be within time.106 The contract provided that the vendors
would I get the leasehold property converted into freehold prior to execution
of sale deed. But they failed to fulfil this obligation. The court said that time
of getting the property converted into freehold was not of the essence. The
buyers could not be called upon to pay the balance price till them.107
Where in an agreement for sale of immovable property, there was no
mention originally of the time of performance being of the essence and the
buyer was ready and willing and had already paid two instalments, it was
held that a unilateral attempt on the part of the vendor to make time as of
the essence, was improper. 108 As against this, a contract provided that the
balance amount has to be paid and sale deed registered within a particular
time and in no case the time would be extended. But the vendee failed to
pay. The vendor gave him notice giving ten days further time for payment
of the balance amount failing which the agreement would stand cancelled.
Even so, the vendee failed to keep the date of payment. The vendee served on
him the final notice of cancellation. The court said that the time of payment
was of the essence. The defaulting vendee was not entitled to ask for specific
performance.109

Time for performance 385
The Supreme Court has taken note of changed circumstances and
observed that the age-old principle that in a contract relating to immova-
ble property, time is not of essence requires to be revisited in view of the
changed circumstances created by inflation and steep increase in the price
structure of such properties (obiter). The contract contained a schedule spec-
ifying the periods for payment of consideration. The clause also provided
that payment would be made on the next date if the date specified turned
out to be a holiday. The execution of sale deed was delinked from the time
schedule for payment. The court said that parties intention must have been
to treat time of payment as of the essence.110
Where a decision was taken to sell a house immediately to raise urgently
needed funds and six months' time was specified for payment, it was held
that time of payment was of essence. The vendee's failure to make payment
in time disentitled him from claiming specific performance."!!
Under the agreement, the purchaser had to pay the balance amount of
consideration at any time after the agreement within the outer limit of one
year. Thereafter his right under the agreement to pay within one year was to
cease and he was to lose all rights under the agreement. The court said that
the agreement showed that the parties intended that time was of essence.
Suit filing after seven years from the date of the agreement was held to be
time barred.112
The vendors pleaded that they were in dire need of money and that is
why they were selling, but they failed to adduce any evidence about the
pressing need which goaded them to enter into the contract. Their conduct
showed that they were not attaching any importance to time. The vendee
showed sufficient balance in account to pay the balance money. Specific per-
formance was not refused.113
The conduct of the parties plays an important role in determining impor-
tance of time of performance. Where both the parties seemed to have ignored
the failures on the part of each other in the matter of implementation of their
agreement, the court was of the view that it could not be said about such
parties that they considered time to be of the essence.114
Allotment of plots
A Development Authority allotted plots through auction sale. The auc-
tion-purchaser was granted time to make a late payment with interest. Even
then he could not make it. The payment made by him after the expiry of
was a clear stipulation that the sale should be completed within the specified time limit, no
evidence to show that the plaintiff was ready and willing to complete her part, no specific
performance.

time with interest was accepted by the Authority. The court said that there
was a deemed extension of time. The cancellation of the whole thing was
not proper."
115
Right of renewal and other personal privileges
But the renewal of a lease is something different from sale of immovable
property. This was pointed out by the Supreme Court in Caltex (India) Ltd
v Bhagwan Devi Marodia:
In this case, the lessee of a petrol pump had to apply for the renewal of
the lease within a time fixed by the contract. He was late by ten days in
his application for renewal. The landlord refused to renew.
The court held that the time so fixed was of the essence of the bargain.
Equity would not relieve him of the consequences of his own neglect:
"An option for the renewal of a lease, or for the purchase or repurchase
of a property, must in all cases be exercised strictly within the time lim-
ited for the purpose, otherwise it will lapse. The reason is that the renewal
is a privilege and if the tenant wishes to claim the privilege he must do
so strictly within the time-limit for the purpose. In such cases relief is
not given in equity save upon the ground of unavoidable accident, fraud,
surprise, ignorance (not wilful) or inequitable conduct on the part of the
lessor precluding him from refusing to give the renewal."117
Agreement of reconveyance
Similarly, a stipulation in a contract of sale of property that the buyer
would reconvey the property to the seller if the latter refunded the con-
sideration within a stipulated time, would constitute the time schedule to
be of the essence and the right of reconveyance would be lost if the time is
missed.

essence.
117. A property was transferred with a condition of reconveyance and that if reconveyance was

because of the expiry of time. The court cited with approval the Federal Court decision in
Shanbhusham Pillai v Annalakshmi Ammal, AIR 1950 FC 38: 1949 FCR 441 where it was
held that in contracts relating to reconveyance of property, time factor has always been held
to be of the essence of the contract. Citing HALSBURY'S LAWS OF ENGLAND, Art. 281 (Vol 3,

of property, must in all cases be exercised strictly within the time limited for the purpose,
otherwise it will lapse." Quoted with approval in Hare v Nicoll, (1966) 2 QB 130, 145:

Carriage by air
Time for performance 387
A complainant under the Consumer Protection Act alleged that his
cargo was not airlifted by the carrier within the time-limit. The National
Commission agreed with the airliner that weighty cargo blocks could not
be carried in time because the safety of the aircraft was an important factor
at all times. The complainant had failed to establish that time was of the
essence of the contract.119
Completion of term
A licence was granted to run a telephone booth in a central bus termi-
nus. The grant was for a limited period. At the time of the limited period
allotment, the allottee made no grievance. On the expiry of the term the
Corporation invited fresh bids. The existing licencee's challenge to this pro-
cedure was held to be not tenable.120
Sale of shares
A transaction for sale of shares is of commercial nature. The time of
completion of the transaction is likely to be an important factor. Where the
agreement was for the sale of shares of unquoted private companies trading
in a volatile sector, it was held that if a completion date had been named in
the agreement, that would have been of the essence. Therefore, as soon as
the scheme was prepared and completion could take place, it was open to
the party to give notice to the other to complete the transaction specifying
a reasonable time for completion. Thus, where time would have been of the
essence if specified, there one party can make time of the essence by serving
a reasonable notice upon the other to complete. 121
Time of reporting
A singer agreed to perform at a threatre for a certain season and to be
present at least six days before the commencement of the engagement. But
he reported only two days before. The theatre owner sought to put an end
to the contract. But he was not allowed to do so. It was only a breach of a
warranty and not of a term or condition which touched the substance of the
contract. Hence, the plaintiff could only recover compensation for loss, if
any, suffered by him.12

Non-commercial matters
[S. 55]
"In cases other than commercial contracts the ordinary presumption is
that time is not of the essence of the contract." 123 Accordingly, "in a contract
for the sale of immovable property, time would not be regarded as of the
essence unless it is shown that the parties intended so."124
Extension of time
The Supreme Court held in a case before it that the time of performance
was extended by the parties and therefore it was not to be considered as of
the essence of the contract.125
The contract was to provide a rig for a certain period which was to be
extended in case of any breakdown in working. The rig broke down for some
time and, without taking this into account, the owner of the rig wanted to
withdraw it on the expiry of the period. The court said that though there
cannot be unilateral extension of time, in this case, there was the agreement
that the period would be extended so as to cover the breakdown period. The
owner of the rig could not say that he should be permitted to withdraw the
rig subject to his liability for damages. The machinery in question was rare
and not easily available. Compensation would have served no purpose."
126
Where a road building contract could not be completed in time due
to security reasons and abnormally bad weather, among others, and the
Authority refused to extend time despite the fact that the contractor was
ready to give the undertaking that he would complete the project within one
month of extension of time, the court said that extension should be granted
because the only other alternative was cancelling the contract and retender-
ing, which was likely to take five months. The contractor's work was found
to be satisfactory,129

1 SCR 227. In construction contracts also time is generally of the essence. Since construction
involves several factors, one of which may operate to cause delay, the contract often contains
fenced-round provisions for extension. This does not diminish the importance of the time of
completion. It remains of the essence unless extended. See N.N. Chowdhary v Hindustan
Steel Works, AIR 1934 AP 110. The mere fact, however, that the contract provides a pen-
alty for delay is not sufficient in itself to show an intention to make time as of the essence.

[S. 55]
Consequences of failure
Section 55 further declares that "if it was not the intention of the parties
that time should be of the essence of the contract, the contract does not
become voidable by the failure to do such things at or before the specified
time". It means that the innocent party will have to accept performance
even if it is delayed. He does not have the right to reject. But he may sue
the other party for any loss caused by the delay. In an Andhra Pradesh
case, 128 there was some delay on the part of a contractor to supply to the
State Electricity Board certain goods by the prescribed date and the court,
finding no evidence whatsoever of the parties' intention to regard time as
of essence, held that the Board was bound to accept delayed deliveries. The
right to recover compensation for the delay would be there. The Supreme
Court has held that no notice would be necessary for exercising the right to
seek compensation.129
Where, on the other hand, the time of performance is of the essence of
the contract, any delay will render the contract voidable at the option of the
other party. He may reject the performance and immediately sue for the
breach. But he may at his option accept the delayed performance. If he does
so he cannot afterwards recover compensation for the delay, "unless, at the
time of such acceptance, he gives notice to the promisor of his intention to
do so.130 Delay by itself does not put an end to the contract.131 In a case

be any presumption about extension. It has to be fixed or refixed in categorical terms. In this

of the essence of the contract. The contractor was given the facility to seek
extension of time in advance on reasonable grounds, failing which a penalty
was payable for each day of default. These stipulations were construed by the
court as not making time to be of the essence. The contractor's application
for extension was rejected and, on his failure to complete the works within
the specified time, the Department rescinded the contract. The rescission
was not approved by the Supreme Court. Some further period should have
been allowed to the contractor telling him that the extended time would be
of the essence and that it would neither be extended, nor excusable on pay-
ment of fine. Then only it would have been possible to rescind the contract.
In a contract for sale of land the vendor wanted payment to be made
within a week, but on the insistence of the vendee, 10 days' period was
agreed upon. The vendee offered money after ten days. The vendor refused.
The court allowed no remedy to the vendee.133
IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCE AND FRUSTRATION
Initial impossibility [S. 56]
Section 56 first lays down the simple principle that "an agreement to do
an act impossible in itself is void". For example, an agreement to discover a
treasure by magic, being impossible of performance, is void.
Subsequent impossibility [S. 56]
The second paragraph of Section 56 lays down the effect of subsequent
impossibility of performance. Sometimes the performance of a contract is
quite possible when it is made by the parties. But some event subsequently
happens which renders its performance impossible or unlawful. In either
case the contract becomes void. Where, for example, after making a contract
of marriage, one of the parties goes mad, or where a contract is made for
the import of goods and the import is thereafter forbidden by a Government
Order, or where a singer contracts to sing and becomes too ill to do so, the
contract in each case becomes void.134
S. 56. Agreement to do impossible act.-An agreement to do an act
impossible in itself is void.
Contract to do act afterwards becoming impossible or unlawful.-A
contract to do an act which, after the contract is made, becomes impossible,
case the contract was for supply of imported sugar. The buyer gave no response to the seller's
request for extension, nor rescinded the contract. The effect was that the buyer lost the right
to insist upon time to be of the essence.

General principle of judicial non-interference
In the first-known English case of Paradine v Jane¹³ it was pointed out
that subsequent happenings should not affect a contract already made:
There the defendant had taken an estate on lease from the plaintiffs.
The defendant was dispossessed of it by alien enemies for some time and,
therefore, refused to pay the rent for the period of dispossession.
It was held that "when the party by his own contract creates a duty, he
is bound to make it good, if he may, notwithstanding any accident by inev-
itable necessity, because he might have provided against it by his contract;
though the land be surrounded or gained by the seas, or made barren by
wildfire, yet the lessor will have his whole rent".
In the subsequent case to Taylor v Caldwell BLACKBURN J laid down
that the above "rule is only applicable when the contract is positive and
absolute, and not subject to any condition either express or implied".
In this case, the defendants had agreed to let the plaintiffs the use of
their music hall between certain dates for the purpose of holding a con-
cert there. But before that first day on which a concert was to be given,
the hall was destroyed by fire without the fault of either party.
The plaintiffs sued the defendants for their loss. It was held that the con-
tract was not absolute, as its performance depended upon the continued

CASE PILOT
[S. 56]
existence of the hall. It was, therefore, "subject to an implied condition that
the parties shall be excused in case, before breach, performance becomes
impossible from the perishing of thing without default of the contractor".
With this decision began the struggle between the two principles, namely,
the principle of sanctity of contract which supports the principle of absolute
liability and the principle that a contract be discharged when the shared
contractual assumption has been destroyed by change of circumstances.137
Frustration
In the above case the performance of the contract had become physi-
cally impossible because of the disappearance of the subject-matter. But the
principle is not confined to physical impossibilities. It extends also to cases
where the performance of the contract is physically possible, but the object
the parties had in mind has failed to materialise. The well-known corona-
tion cases of which Krell v Henry139 is one, illustrates this:
The defendant agreed to hire from the plaintiff a flat for June 26 and
27, on which days it had been announced that the coronation procession
would pass along that place. A part of the rent was paid in advance.
But the procession having been cancelled owing to the King's illness, the
defendant refused to pay the balance.
It was held that the real object of the contract, as recognised by both con-
tracting parties, was to have a view of the coronation procession. The taking
place of the procession was, therefore, the foundation of the contract. The
object of the contract was frustrated by non-happening of the coronation
and the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the balance of the rent.140
Thus, the doctrine of frustration comes into play in two types of situa-
tion, first, where the performance is physically cut off, and, second, where
the object has failed. The Supreme Court of India has held that Section
56 will apply to both kinds of frustration. Referring to the section, B.K.
MUKHERJEA J of the Supreme Court observed in Satyabrata Ghose v
Mugneeram Bangur & Co¹¹ as follows: "This much is clear that the word
'impossible' has not been used here in the sense of physical or literal impos-
sibility. The performance of an act may not be literally impossible but it
may be impracticable and useless from the point of view of the object and
purpose which the parties had in view; and if an untoward event or change
of circumstances totally upsets the very foundation upon which the parties

rested their bargain, it can very well be said that the promisor finds it impos-
sible to do the act which he promised to do."142
Explaining the concept "frustration of the contract" in Cricklewood
Property & Investment Trust Ltd v Leighton's Investment Trust Ltd
Viscount SIMON LC said that it means “occurrence of an intervening event
or change of circumstances so fundamental as to be regarded by the law
both as striking at the root of the agreement, and as entirely beyond what
was contemplated by the parties when they entered into the contract". To
the same effect is the following statement of Lord WRIGHT:14 "The word
frustration is here used in a technical legal sense. It is a sort of shorthand:
it means that a contract has ceased to bind the parties because the common
basis on which by mutual understanding it was based has failed. It would
be more accurate to say, not that the contract has been frustrated, but that
there has been a failure of what in the contemplation of both parties would
be the essential condition or purpose of the performance."
This principle was applied by TEJA SINGH J of the Punjab High Court in
Parshotam Das v Municipal Committee, Batala.45
A Municipal Committee leased out certain tonga stands to the plaintiff
for Rs 5000. But no tonga driver came forward to use the stand through-
out the year and the plaintiff could not realize anything. He sued for the
refund of his money.
It was held that "the plaintiff obtained the lease and the committee
granted the same to him on the assumption that the tonga stands would be
used by drivers and the plaintiff would recover fees from them, but for rea-
sons which both sides could not help the drivers did not use the stands, the
doctrine of frustration applied with full force".
A contract for sale of land for non-agricultural use was held to have frus-
trated when the application for such use was rejected by the authorities.146
142. These principles have been affirmed by the Supreme Court in Dhruv Dev Chand v
Harmohinder Singh, AIR 1968 SC 1024, where SHAH J (afterwards CJ) held that the doc-
trine does not apply to completed transfers. Indian Rare Earth Ltd v Southern Electric

394 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
Commercial hardship
[S. 56]
The alteration of circumstances must be "such as to upset altogether the
purpose of the contract. Some delay or some change is very common in all
human affairs, and it cannot be supposed that any bargain has been made
on the tacit condition that such a thing will not happen in any degree" 147
This makes the court rather cautious in discharging parties from their con-
tract. An illustration in line is the decision of the Calcutta High Court in
Sachindra Nath v Gopal Chandra.148
The plaintiff let certain premises to the defendant for a restaurant at
somewhat higher rent. The defendant agreed to pay high rent because the
British troops were stationed in the town and a clause in the agreement
specially provided that "this agreement will remain in force so long as
British troops will remain in this town". After some months, the locality
was declared out of bounds to the British troops.
The question was whether this frustrated the contract. HENDERSON J
relied upon the above cited passage of Lord LOREBURN and held that though
it was possible that the defendant would not have paid such a high rent apart
from the expectation of deriving high profits from the British troops, that
was not sufficient to make out a case of frustration.
A situation like this has been described as one of commercial hardship,
which may make the performance unprofitable or more expensive or dila-
tory, but is not sufficient to excuse performance, for it does "not bring about
a fundamentally different situation such as to frustrate the venture".149 The
doctrine of frustration or impossibility does not apply to a situation so as to
excuse performance "where performance is not practically cut off, but only
rendered more difficult or costly.150 Such cases may not fall within the pur-
view of Section 56 and this is amply shown by the Privy Council decision in
Hurnandrai Fulchand v Pragdas Budhsen.151
By a contract in writing the plaintiff bought of the defendants a num-
ber of dhotis to be manufactured by specified mills and to be delivered
as and when the same may be received from the mills. The sellers deliv-
ered only part of the goods owing to the mills failing to perform their

contract with the defendants as they were engaged in fulfilling certain
Government contracts. The defendants pleaded frustration.
The Privy Council held that the adventure was not frustrated, as the stip-
ulation as to delivery did not make delivery by the mills a condition prec-
edent. It was a simple case of breach. "The closing or even the destruction
of the mills would not affect a contract between third parties, which is in
terms absolute."
"It was suggested that the words 'as and when the same may be received
from the mills', should be construed as if they were 'if and when the same
may be received from the mills'. This is to convert words, which fix the
quantities and times for deliveries by instalments into a condition precedent
to the obligation to deliver at all, and virtually make a new contract. The
words certainly regulate the manner of performance, but they do not limit
the sale to such goods as the mills might deliver."
The principle of this case was followed by the Supreme Court in Ganga
Saran v Firm Ram Charan Ram Gopal.152
A contract was made for supplying certain bales of cloth manufactured
by the New Victoria Mills, Kanpur. The contract added: "We shall go on
supplying goods to you of the Victoria Mills as soon as they are supplied
to us by the said mills." The mill failed to supply the goods to the sellers
and, therefore, the sellers pleaded frustration.
But they were held liable: "The agreement does not seem to us to convey
the meaning that the delivery of the goods was made contingent on their
being supplied to the respondents by the Victoria Mills. We find it difficult
to hold that the parties ever contemplated the possibility of the goods not
being supplied at all. The words 'prepared by the Mills' are only a descrip-
tion of the goods to be supplied, and the expression 'as soon as they are
prepared' and 'as soon as they are supplied to us by the said Mills', simply
indicate the process of delivery."
It was accordingly held that the contract was neither contingent under
Section 32, nor did it fall within the second paragraph of Section 56.153
To the same effect is the decision of the Madras High Court in Samuel
Fitz & Co v Standard Cotton and Silk Wvg Co.154
The defendants placed an order with the plaintiffs for the supply of
tapestries of certain kind, making it clear that they intended to sell them
in Australia. But the Australian Government prohibited the import of
such goods. The defendants lost their market and, therefore, cancelled
their order.

396 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
CASE PILOT
[S. 56]
In an action for breach of contract, HORWILL J held that the courts
should not read into a contract an implied term that the enforceability of the
contract was dependent upon the ability of the purchaser to find customers
for the goods. "We are unable to say that the foundation of the contract
was that these goods should be resold by the defendants to their clients in
Australia."
Similarly, a contract by a Hindu father to give his daughter in marriage to
the plaintiff was held by the Bombay High Court to be not frustrated simply
because the girl had expressed her unwillingness to marry the plaintiff. The
defendant had to pay damages for the breach. In the same way, where
the performance of a contract for the sale of grain was made more difficult
by Government restrictions on sale and storage imposed subsequently;156 a
contract given by an authority to a contractor of the right to collect tolls at
the ghats of a bridge and the Government subsequently prohibited the traffic
of foodgrains over the bridge resulting in loss to the plaintiff;157 the tempo-
rary suspension of traffic on a bridge owing to breakdown;158 in a contract
to supply a ship, the increase in shipping rates; in a contract for the sale
of land, the local officer's insistence that State permission for the transfer
should be obtained;160 the workers of toddy shops going on strike after the
contractor had obtained by bidding at an auction the licence to run the
shops; in a contract for supply of machinery, the failure of the source from
which the supplier sub-contracted to purchase; failure to supply the con-
tracted quantity in assorted variety of eucaplyptus firewood owing to the
forest, which was under the supplier's lease, not helping him up to the requi-
site quantity, aggravated further by shortage of labour and transport facility
in the area, all these were things which the contractor should have con-
sidered before giving his commitments; and, therefore, in all these cases
the performance was held not to have become impossible. "Disappointed
expectations do not lead to frustrated contracts."164

Specific grounds of frustration
Impossibility of performance and frustration 397
"The principle of frustration of contract, or of impossibility of perfor-
mance is applicable to a great variety of contracts. It is, therefore, not pos-
sible to lay down an exhaustive list of situations in which the doctrine is
going to be applied so as to excuse performance. The law upon the matter is
undoubtedly in process of evolution."165 Yet the following grounds of frus-
tration have become well-established.
1. Destruction of subject-matter
The doctrine of impossibility applies with full force "where the actual
and specific subject-matter of the contract has ceased to exist",166 "Taylor v
Caldwell 167 is the best example of this class." There, a promise to let out a
music hall was held to have frustrated on the destruction of the hall. Another
illustration is Howell v Coupland.168
The defendant contracted to sell a specified quantity of potatoes to be
grown on his farm, but failed to supply them as the crop was destroyed
by a disease.
Delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, MELLISH LJ said:
"Suppose the potatoes had been fully grown at the time of the contract,
and afterwards the disease had come and destroyed them; according to
the authorities it is clear that the performance would have been excused;
and I cannot think it makes any difference that the potatoes were not then
in existence.... Here there was an agreement to sell and buy two hundred
of supplying to the Government milk containers quoted with that material. C.T. Xavier v
P.V. Joseph, AIR 1995 Ker 140, delay in construction of godowns for Food Corpn, clause for
extension of time was there, no evidence that the Corpn would not have taken the godowns
even if provided late, this cannot be described as impossibility so as to enable any party to
get rid of the contract. C.J. International Hotel Ltd v NDMC, AIR 2001 Del 435, a licence
land for hotel premises taken at an open auction, the licencee was not allowed to say that
licence fee should be reduced because the project was not economically viable. The Authority
was not restrained from taking any coercive action. Gujarat Housing Board v Vipul Corpn,
AIR 2004 Guj 319, contract for water proofing work of houses, contractor had knowledge
that the houses were in possession of allottees, the court did not regard denial of access by
allottees as an impossibility. N.G. Vigneshawara Bhat v P. Srikrishna Bhat, AIR 2006 Ker

tons out of a crop to be grown on a specific land, that it is an agreement
to sell what may be called specific things; therefore neither party is liable
if the performance becomes impossible."
A parallel decision under Section 56 is that of the Madras High Court in
V.L. Narasu v P.S.V. Iyer where a contract to exhibit a film in a cinema
hall was held to have become impossible of performance when on account
of heavy rains the rear wall of the hall collapsed killing three persons and its
licence was cancelled until the building was reconstructed to the satisfaction
of the chief engineer. The owner was under no liability to reconstruct the
hall and even if he did reconstruct and it took him some time, by that time
the film would have lost its appeal.
Where the tenanted premises comprised land and building, the court
said that once the structure was completely destroyed, the tenancy ceased.
No right was available to the tenant to apply for possession if the landlord
re-constructed the premises.170
172
The same result followed where a ship ran aground.171 The result would
also be the same where the subject-matter of the contract though intact has
ceased to be available to the parties. Thus, where a ship was chartered for
twelve months to run from April to April and before it could be delivered, it
was requisitioned and was released only in September, the House of Lords
held that the charterparty had frustrated, for a September to September
term was not contemplated by the parties. Where the parties can still
perform their main obligation despite the fact that the subject-matter has
gone out of their hands, frustration may not follow. Thus, where a ship was
chartered for five years and three years after that, it was requisitioned by the
Government, the latter paying more money than the freight agreed between
the parties, it was held that the contract was not frustrated. The charterer
was bound to pay the freight and that he could still pay and, therefore,
he was entitled to collect the money from the Government. Similarly, an
agency for dealing with the goods "manufactured or sold" by the principal
was not frustrated when the principal's factory was destroyed, for the agent
could still deal with the goods sold by the principal.14

but no action was taken to go to the nearest port to have the vessel berthed
and the condition of the vessel checked. Instead of that, after pumping out
water, the vessel attempted to continue on its course. The court said that
the sinking of the vessel could not be described as an inevitable accident.
Reasonable care had not been taken to prevent the sinking of the vessel. The
defence of frustration failed.175
2. Change of Circumstances
A contract will frustrate "where circumstances arise which make the per-
formance of the contract impossible in the manner and at the time contem-
plated. 176 KAPUR J of the Punjab High Court in Pameshwari Das Mehra v
Ram Chand Om Prakash explained the principle thus: "It is clear that
if there is entirely unanticipated change of circumstances the question will
have to be considered whether this change of circumstances has affected the
performance of the contract to such an extent as to make it virtually impos-
sible or even extremely difficult or hazardous. If that be the case, the change
of circumstances not having been brought about by the fault of either party,
the courts will not enforce the contract." In that case:
A contracted to supply to B certain classes and quantities of American
piece goods. The contract was c.i.f. Karachi. The goods arrived there
after some delay. B refused to accept on the ground that both the qualities
and quantities offered for delivery were not according to the particular
contract. A called upon B to refer the dispute to the nominated arbitrator
who was residing at Karachi. Then came partition which made it impos-
sible for non-Muslims to go to Karachi.
Holding that the contract was not thereby frustrated, the court said: "If
it was necessary for the parties to go to Karachi and to take witnesses there,
the performance of the arbitration agreement would have been rendered
impossible. But, as going to Karachi was not necessary, the change of cir-
cumstances did not have a material effect on the contract."178
As against this, where a ship was chartered to load a cargo but on the day
before she could have proceeded to her berth, an explosion occurred in the
auxiliary boiler, which made it impossible for her to undertake the voyage
at the scheduled time, the House of Lords held that frustration had, in fact,
occurred in the circumstances.179

CASE PILOT
[S. 56]
But "there is no general liberty reserved to the courts to absolve a party
from liability to perform his part of the contract merely because, on account
of an uncontemplated turn of events, the performance of the contract may
become onerous",180 "The parties to an executory contract are often faced,
in the course of carrying it out, with a turn of events which they did not at
all anticipate a wholly abnormal rise or fall in price, a sudden depreciation
of currency, an unexpected obstacle to execution, or the like. Yet this does
not in itself affect the bargain they have made."181 The Supreme Court laid
down this principle in Alopi Parshad & Sons Ltd v Union of India. 182
The plaintiffs were acting as the agent to the Government of India for
purchasing Ghee for the use of army personnel. They were to be paid
on cost basis for different items of work involved. The performance was
in progress when the Second World War intervened and the rates fixed
in peace time were entirely superseded by the totally altered conditions
obtaining in war time. The agents demanded revision of rates but received
no replies. They kept up the supplies. The Government terminated the
contract in 1945 and the agents claimed payment on enhanced rates.
But they could not succeed. "Ghee having been supplied by the agents
under the terms of the contract, the right of the agents was to receive remu-
neration under the terms of that contract."
Law has to adapt itself to economic changes. Marginal price rise may
be ignored. But when prices escalate out of all proportion from what could
have been reasonably expected by the parties and making performance so
crushing to the contractor as to border virtually on impossibility, the law
would have to offer relief to the contractor in terms of price revision. The
Supreme Court has recognised this in Tarapore & Co v Cochin Shipyard
Ltd. 183
In this case there is no room for doubt that the parties agreed that the
investment of the contractor (for import of equipment and know-how, in
foreign exchange) would be two crores and the tendered rates were pred-
icated upon and co-related to this understanding. When an agreement
is predicated upon an agreed fact situation, and that situation ceases to
exist, the agreement, to that extent, becomes irrelevant or otiose. The
rates payable to the contractor were related to the investment of Rs2
crores by the contractor. Once the rates became irrelevant on account of
circumstances beyond the control of the contractor, it was open to him to
make a claim for compensation.

prepared to participate in the reauction. His suit was dismissed.

Impossibility of performance and frustration 401
Another case of commercial hardship of this kind was before the House
of Lords in Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban Distt Council. 184
There was a contract to build certain houses for a council for a fixed
price and to be completed within eight months. Bad weather and labour
strikes intervened and it took twenty-two months to complete and at a
cost much more than the contract price. The contractor claimed that the
contract was discharged on account of inordinate delay and, therefore, he
should be paid on quantum meruit basis, that is, his actual costs should
be paid.
But the House of Lords did not agree with him. Lord RADCLIFFE, after
reviewing the authorities and anthology of circumstances in which frus-
tration is deemed to occur, observed: "So, perhaps, it would be simpler to
say at the outset that frustration occurs whenever the law recognises that,
without default of either party, a contractual obligation has become impos-
sible of being performed because the circumstances in which performance
is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which was
undertaken by the contract. 'The data for decision are, on the one hand, the
terms and conditions of the contract, read in the light of the surrounding
circumstances, and, on the other hand, the events which have occurred.' It is
not hardship or inconvenience or material loss itself which calls the principle
of frustration into play. There must be as well such a change in the signifi-
cance of the obligation that the thing undertaken would, if performed, be
a different thing from that contracted for. If this is the law, the appellants'
case seems to be a long way from a case of frustration."
The ruling in this case was applied in CTI Group Inc v Transclear SA,185
The defendant contracted in unqualified terms to supply a cargo of cement
f.o.b. on the claimant's vessel in Far East. The defendant made arrangement
with local suppliers to provide the cargo. The suppliers decided not to make
the cargo available owing to the commercial pressure applied by another
supplier. The defendant had no other source for supply of cement in the Far
East. The question was whether the supplier's failure to make goods avail-
able constituted a frustrating event. The court did not accept the argument
that this could be so because where the delivery remained physically and
legally possible but the seller's suppliers chose, for whatever reason, not to
make the goods available, the contract was not frustrated. Accordingly, the
suppliers' choice not to make the cargo available had not discharged the
defendant's obligation to procure delivery of it.
Where there was a 400 per cent escalation of prices owing to a war as
compared with the original prices on which certain transformers were under-
taken to be supplied on a firm basis, the contract was held to have ended.186

402 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
[S. 56]
Where the possibility of alteration of circumstances was within the con-
templation of the parties at the time of the contract, they can hardly complain
of any such alteration. Thus, where a railway company accepted goods for
transport and happened to convey them to a wrong destination, which on
account of partition fell in Pakistan and the railways could not bring them
back into India, they were not permitted to plead frustration to their liability
to pay for the loss of the goods.188 MEHAR SINGH J said: "When the defend-
ant accepted the goods, there was no such legal impediment, and since the
date of partition was known at that time, such a contingency cannot be said
to be outside the contemplation and foresight of the parties."
The learned judge, with respect, should not have taken support of the
fact "that there was no such legal impediment at the time", for in applying
the doctrine of frustration the courts have to go by the impediments arising
subsequently. The decision is, however, just because it was the railway's own
fault that the goods were carried to a wrong point.
3. Non-occurrence of contemplated event
Sometimes the performance of a contact remains entirely possible, but
owing to the non-occurrence of an event contemplated by both parties as
the reason for the contract, the value of the performance is destroyed. Krell
v Henry 189 is an apt illustration. There, a contract to hire a room to review
a proposed coronation procession was held to have frustrated when the pro-
cession was postponed. For this result to follow it is necessary that the hap-
pening of the event should be the foundation of the contract. This is shown
by Herne Bay Steam Boat Co v Hutton 190 which also arose from the post-
ponement of the coronation. The Royal Naval Review was proposed to be
held on the occasion. The defendant chartered a steamboat for two days "to
take out a party of paying passengers for the purpose of viewing the naval
review and for a day's cruise round the fleet". But the review was cancelled.
and the defendant had no use of the ship. Yet he was held liable to pay the
unpaid balance of the hire less the profit which the plaintiff had made by the
use of the ship in the ordinary course. VAUGHAN WILLIAMS LJ said: "I see
nothing that makes this contract differ from a case where, for instance, a
person has engaged a brake to take himself and a party to Epsom to see the
races there, but for some reason or other, such as the spread of an infectious
disease, the races are postponed. In such a case it could not be said that he
should be relieved of his bargain. So in the present case it is sufficient to

measures were taken anticipating such rain and flood.

say that the happening of the naval review was not the foundation of the
contract."
4. Death or incapacity of party
"A party to a contract is excused from performance if it depends upon
the existence of a given person, if that person perishes" or becomes too ill
to perform. Thus, where the nature or terms of a contract require personal
performance by the promisor, his death or incapacity puts an end to the
contract. Robinson v Davison is the well-known authority.
There was a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant's wife,
who was an eminent pianist, that she should play the piano at a concert
to be given by the plaintiff on a specified day. On the morning of the day
in question she informed the plaintiff that she was too ill to attend the
concert. The concert had to be postponed and the plaintiff lost a sum of
money.
The plaintiff's action for breach of contract failed. The court said that
under the circumstances she was not merely excused from playing, but she
was also not at liberty to play, if she was unfit to do so. The contract was
clearly subject to the condition of her being well enough to perform: "The
whole contract is based on the assumption of the continuance of life, and on
the conditions which existed at the time. That assumption is made by both;
it is really the foundation of the contract. It does not require close reasoning
to prove that if the foundation fails, the whole contract must fail. Here the
foundation was wanting for there was on Mrs Davison's part an entire and
total incapacity to do the thing contracted for."
In another case:192
A
person entered into service as manager for ten years, and undertook
not to undertake any professional engagement without the consent of the
employer. Before the expiry of ten years he was called up for military ser-
vice. After the war he undertook professional engagements and was sued
by the employer for breach of contract.
It was held that the contract of service had frustrated when his services
were requisitioned for military purposes and thereafter he was free from the
covenants of the contract.
APPLICATION TO INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.-The application of the doctrine
of frustration to industrial relations was examined by the (English) National

giving usual benefits. M had still to undergo an operation before he could
resume work.
Even so it was held that the contract of service had not frustrated. The
President of the court pointed out that in considering whether further per-
formance has become impossible, regard must be had to the terms of the
employment, the nature of the illness, its duration and prospects of recovery,
and the period of past employment:
Where the contract provided for sick pay, there could not be frustra-
tion if the employee appeared likely to return to work within the period
in which sick pay was payable. Where the employee occupied a key post
which had to be filled on a permanent basis if his absence was prolonged,
it was easier to infer frustration if the employee was one of the many in
the same category. Again, a relationship of long standing was not so eas-
ily destroyed as one which had but a short history.
The present contract provided that no wages were payable during sick-
ness. It was not the company's policy to dismiss employees on the ground
of sickness. There was no medical evidence that M was permanently inca-
pacitated or as to how long he would be away from work. In those cir-
cumstances, there was no ground for holding that further performance of
his obligation in the future would be either impossible or a thing radically
different from that which he had accepted under his contract of employ-
ment. Accordingly, the contract had not frustrated.
In a similar case before the Court of Appeal:154
S was employed as a works manager under a five-year contract. After
two years he became ill and was absent from work for five months. The
employer terminated the employment after four months of absence and S
sued for breach of contract.
It was held that a five-year term contract of service could not be deemed
to have frustrated by five months' illness.
5. Government, administrative or legislative intervention
A contract will be dissolved when legislative or "administrative interven-
tion has so directly operated upon the fulfilment of the contract for a spe-
cific work as to transform the contemplated conditions of performance".195
Thus, where a vendor of land could not execute the sale-deed because he
ceased to be the owner by operation of law, it was held that the contract

had become impossible of performance.19 In another case, a contract by the
State to give a monopoly was held to have become void on the enforcement
of the Constitution. 197 Similarly, a contract between certain parties for the
sale of the trees of a forest was discharged when the State of Rajasthan for-
bade the cutting of trees in the area. 198 A well-known English authority is
Metropolitan Water Board v Dick Kerr & Co Ltd.199
By a contract made in July 1914, a firm of contractors contracted with
a Water Board to construct a reservoir to be completed within six months.
But by a notice issued under the Defence of the Realm Acts, the contrac-
tors were required to cease work on their contract and they stopped the
work accordingly. They claimed that the effect of the notice was to put an
end to the contract.
The House of Lords held that the interruption created by the prohibi-
tion was of such a character and duration so as to make the contract when
resumed a different contract from the contract when broken off, and that
the contract had ceased to be operative. 200
But an intervention of a temporary nature which does not uproot the
foundation of the contract will not have the dissolving effect. This is shown
by the decision of the Supreme Court in Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram
Bangur & Co.201
The defendant company started a scheme for the development of a
tract of land into a housing colony. The plaintiff was granted a plot on
payment of earnest money. The company undertook to construct the
roads and drains necessary for making the lands suitable for building
and residential purposes and as soon as they were completed, the pur-
chaser was to be called upon to complete the conveyance by payment of
the balance of the purchase money. But before anything could be done, a
considerable portion of the land was requisitioned by the State during the
Second World War for military purposes.
The company attempted to cancel the contract on the ground that by
reason of the supervening events its performance had become impossible.
MUKHERJEA J held that the contract was not frustrated. The learned judge
said: "Undoubtedly the commencement of the work was delayed but was the

delay going to be so great and of such a character that it would totally upset
the basis of the bargain and the commercial object which the parties had
in view? The requisition orders, it must be remembered, were, by their very
nature, of a temporary character...."202
"If there was a definite time-limit agreed to by the parties within which
the construction work was to be finished, it could be said with perfect pro-
priety that delay for an indefinite period would make the performance of
the contract impossible within the specified time and this would seriously
affect the object and purpose of the venture. But where there is no time-limit
whatsoever in the contract, nor even an understanding between the parties
on that point and when during the war the parties could naturally anticipate
restrictions of various kind which would make the carrying out of these
operations more tardy and difficult than in times of peace, we do not think
that the order of requisition affected the fundamental basis upon which the
agreement rested or struck at the roots of the adventure."
The effect of an administrative intervention has to be viewed in the light
of the terms of the contract, and, if the terms show that the parties have
undertaken an absolute obligation regardless of administrative changes,
they cannot claim to be discharged. This has been so held by the Supreme
Court in Naihati Jute Mills Ltd v Khyaliram Jagannath:203
There was an agreement to purchase raw jute to be imported from East
Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The buyer was to supply the import licence
within November, failing which it was to be supplied within December at
the pain of a little more price and if he failed in December he was to pay
the difference between the contract and market prices. The buyer applied
for a licence which was refused because he had stock in his mill sufficient
for two months. He applied again. He was advised this time that the
rules had been changed and to obtain a licence he must show that he had
used an equal quantity of Indian jute. Thus the buyer failed to supply the
licence and was sued for breach. He pleaded frustration caused by the
change in Government policy.
But he was held liable. SHELAT J pointed out that if the Government had
completely forbidden imports, Section 56 would have applied. But the pol-
icy of the Government was that the licensing authority would scrutinise the
case of the each applicant on its own merit. Referring to the terms of the
contract, the learned judge said:204 "These clauses clearly indicate that the
appellants were conscious of the difficulty of getting the licence in time.

Impossibility of performance and frustration 407
The question would depend upon whether the contract which the appel-
lants entered into was that they would make their best endeavours to get
the licence or whether the contract was that they would obtain it or else be
liable for breach of that stipulation. There is nothing improper or illegal for
a party to take upon himself an absolute obligation to obtain a permit or a
licence and in such a case if he took the risk, he must be held bound to his
stipulation."
The Learned Judge relied upon the following observation of Lord SUMNER
in Bank Line Ltd v Arthur Capel & Co:205 "Where the contract makes pro-
vision (that is, full and complete provision, so intended) for a given contin-
gency, it is not for the court to import into the contract some other different
provisions for the same contingency called by different name."
Where the intervention makes the performance unlawful, the courts will
have no choice but to put an end to the contract. This kind of situation was
before the Supreme Court in Boothalinga Agencies v V.T.C. Poriaswami
Nadar,206
The defendant had a licence to import chicory for manufacturing cof-
fee powder. The licence was subject to the condition that he would use
the chicory only in his factory. He agreed to sell the whole shipload to the
plaintiff. Before the arrival of the ship, the sale of such imported goods
was banned.
The contract was accordingly held to have become void. "It was, how-
ever, argued on behalf of the respondent that, in any event, the appellant
could have purchased chicory from the open market and supplied it to the
respondent in terms of the contract." RAMASWAMI J rejected this argument:
Under the contract the quality of chicory to be sold was the chicory
of specific description-"Egberts chicory, packed in 495 wooden cases,
each case containing 2 tins of 56 lb nett". It is manifest that the contract
was for the sale of certain specific goods and it was not open to the appel-
lant to supply chicory of any other description.207

6. Intervention of war
Intervention of war or warlike conditions in the performance of a con-
tract has often created difficult questions. The closure of the Suez Canal
following the Anglo-French war with Egypt, for instance, interrupted the
performance of many contracts. One such case was Tsakiorglou & Co Ltd
v Noblee & Thorl GMBH.209 The following statement of facts was given by
Lord REID:
The appellants agreed to sell to the respondents three hundred tons
of Sudan groundnuts c.i.f. Hamburg. The usual and normal route at the
date of the contract was via Suez Canal. Shipment was to be in November/
December, 1956, but, on November 2, 1956, the Canal was closed to
traffic and it was not reopened until the following April. It is stated that
the appellants could have transported the goods via the Cape of Good
Hope. The appellants refused to ship goods via the Cape. The question
now is whether by reason of the closing of the Suez route, the contract
had been ended by frustration.
The appellant's argument was that it was an implied term of the contract
that shipment should be via Suez. But it was held that such a term could not
be implied. The customary or usual route via the Suez Canal being closed,
the appellants were bound [by the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, S. 32(2)] to ship
the groundnuts by a reasonable and practical route and, though the appel-
lants might be put to greater expense by shipping the groundnuts via the
Cape of Good Hope, that did not render the contract fundamentally or rad-
ically different, and there was not, therefore, frustration of the contract.210
If the intervention of war is due to the delay caused by the negligence of a
party, the principle of frustration cannot be relied upon. 211
If there are more than one ways of performing a contract and the war
cuts off only one of them, the party is still bound to perform by the other
way, however inconvenient or expensive. This appears from the decision of
the Privy Council in Twentsche Overseas Trading Co Ltd v Uganda Sugar
Factory Ltd. 212 There was a contract for supplying "Krupps" steel rails. The
rest of the facts appear from the following words of Lord WRIGHT: "The

appellant claimed that the rails specified under the contract were to be rails
manufactured by a German firm and by that firm only. On this they based
their claim to be excused from their failure to deliver the goods because to
do so would have involved a dealing with alien enemies due to the outbreak
of World War II and hence the performance of the contract became impos-
sible and illegal."
Their Lordships held that it was not open to the supplier to invoke the
doctrine of frustration. There was nothing in the contract which called for
the rails to be obtained from Germany only. The reference to "Krupps" did
not indicate a source of supply, but merely a specification of the rails. There
were many other sources of supply, and the contract left the supplier with a
free hand in the matter.
In a case before the Patna High Court, 213 the further performance of a
contract of life insurance had become impossible because the insurer was a
German company and on the outbreak of war its business was closed by the
Government of India and the disposal of pending policies was handed over
to a firm of chartered accountants. The assured was accordingly allowed to
recover the money paid by him under the policy. In a Calcutta case, a con-
tract of carriage by river was intercepted by the enemy seizing the boat along
with cargo during hostilities between India and Pakistan. The court allowed
the carrier the plea of impossibility, 214
7. Application to leases
ENGLISH CASES.-The question whether the doctrine of frustration applies
to a lease of land is not yet finally settled in England. In the leading case of
Crickelwood Property & Investment Trust Ltd v Leighton's Investment
Trust Ltd 215 which came before the House of Lords, the decision was unan-
imous that on the facts of the case, irrespective of any controversy, frus-
tration would not have arisen because a lease for 99 years cannot be said
to have been upset by a few years' disturbance, but contradictory opinions
were expressed.
A building lease was executed for ninety nine years, more rent being
payable after erection of buildings. But before any could be erected and
while the lease had still 90 years to run, building activity was suspended
by the Government because of the war.
Viscount SIMON LC said:
The lease at the time had more than ninety years to run, and though
we do not know how long the present war, and the emergency regulations
which have been made necessary by it, are going to last, length of the
interruption so caused is presumably a small fraction of the whole term.

410 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
[S. 56]
Here, the lease itself contemplates that rent may be payable although
no building is going on, and I cannot regard the interruption which has
arisen as such as to destroy the identity of the arrangement or to make it
unreasonable to carry out the lease according to its terms as soon as the
interruption in building is over.
But his Lordship was not prepared to accept the view that because a lease
is more than a contract and amounts to an estate, therefore, it can never end
prematurely by frustration, for example, where the subject-matter of the
lease is swallowed by some vast concussion of nature or buried in the depth
of the sea. "Suppose, for example", his Lordship continued, "that legislation
were subsequently passed which permanently prohibited private building in
the area, or dedicated it as an open space forever, why should this not bring
to an end the currency of a building lease, the object of which is to provide
for the erection on the area, for the combined advantage of the lessor and
lessee of buildings which it would now be unlawful to construct."
Referring to the previous authorities, Viscount SIMON LC characterised
it as erroneous to suppose that there is authority binding on the House of
Lords to the effect that a lease cannot in any circumstances be ended by
frustration. In Matthey v Curling,216
There was the demise of a house for twenty-one years. The lesser had
to keep the building in repair, to insure and in case of any destruction by
fire etc. to expend the insurance money in rebuilding. In 1918 the military
authorities took possession of the premises and remained in possession
until the expiry of the lease. In February, 1919, the house was destroyed
by fire and in March the terms of the lease expired. It was held by the
House of Lords affirming the majority decision of the Court of Appeal,
(ATKIN LJ having dissented) that the lessee was liable both for repairs and
for rent even during the period of dispossession.
Commenting upon this case, Viscount SIMON LC said: "The decision
there was that requisitioning by the Government was no answer to a claim
on the covenant for rent, any more than ouster by a trespasser would be:
the remedy of the tenant was against the Government for compensation.
Equally, destruction by fire, after the Government had requisitioned the
place, left the tenants still liable on his covenant to deliver up in proper con-
dition, for the tenant could have covered the risk by insurance. His Lordship
also pointed out that the Court of Appeal was mistaken about Matthey
v Curling as a clear authority that the doctrine of frustration cannot be
applied to a demise of real property. His Lordship quoted with approval the
statement from the dissenting judgment of ATKIN LJ in which his Lordship
said that there is no legal absurdity in implying a term that a lease shall be
determined absolutely on the happening of an event which in an ordinary
contract works as a frustration. Lord WRIGHT also expressed the same view.

But Lords RUSSEL and GODDARD expressed the contrary view. Lord RUSSEL
proceeded as follows: "A lease is much more than a contract. It creates and
vests in the lessee an estate or interest in the land, a chattel interest, it is
true, but a vested estate or interest nonetheless." As was said by LUSH J in
London & Northern Estates Co v Schlesinger:17 "It is not correct to speak
of this tenancy as a contract and nothing more. A term of years was created
by it and vested in the appellant, and I can see no reason for saying that
because this Order (the lessee being a German was ordered not to stay in the
premises during the war) disqualified him from personally residing in the
flat it affected the chattel interest which was vested in him by virtue of the
agreement. In my opinion, it continues vested in him still....".
"When a contract is frustrated it is because what is called the 'venture' or
'undertaking' which the parties have contracted to engage in, can no longer
be carried out. The court in such circumstances declares the contract to be
no longer binding on the parties. That is the end of the matter. But when
a lease is in question, it is the lease which is the 'venture' or 'undertaking"
upon which the parties have embarked. The contractual obligations there-
under of each party are merely obligations which are incidental to the rela-
tionship of landlord and tenant created by the demise and which necessarily
vary with the character and duration of the particular lease. It may well be
that circumstances may arise during the currency of the term which render it
difficult, or even impossible, for one party or the other to carry out some of
its obligations as landlord and tenant-circumstances which might afford
a defence to a claim for damages for their breach-but the lease would
remain."
"The position would, therefore, seem to be that unless the matter is
decided by the House of Lords, the decisions of the Court of Appeal repre-
sent the law and their effect is that "the doctrine is excluded in the case of
a lease".
In the still subsequent case of National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina
(Northern) Ltd218 the House of Lords have reiterated that the doctrine of
frustration was in principle applicable to leases, though the cases in which
it could properly be applied were likely to be rare. Restating the basis of the
application of the doctrine of frustration, their Lordships said that the frus-
tration of a contract occurs when the nature of the outstanding rights and
obligations are so significantly damaged by some supervening event from
what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of the exe-
cution that it would be unjust to hold them to the performance. Quite natu-
rally, such a change in the rights and obligations under a lease is likely to be
of rare occurrence. The facts of the case were:
A warehouse was demised to the defendant for a period of ten years.
The premises were not to be used for any other purpose than warehousing

unless it was with the lessor's consent. The only vehicular access to the
warehouse was by a street which the local authority closed because of the
dangerous condition of a derelict Victorian warehouse opposite to that
demised to the defendants. The period between the closure of the street
and its reopening after demolition of the Victorian-warehouse was likely
to be about 20 months. During that period the demised warehouse was
rendered unless for the defendants' purposes. They refused to pay any
further rent as they claimed that the lease had frustrated.
But they were held liable. The nature of the transaction and the obliga-
tions created by it had not significantly changed. Having regard in particu-
lar to the likely length of continuance of the lease after the interruption of
user in relation to the term originally granted, on the facts the defendants
had failed to raise a triable issue as to the applicability of the doctrine of
frustration.
INDIAN CASES.-In India the question was considered by the Supreme
Court in Raja Dhruv Dev Chand v Raja Harmohinder Singh,219 where
SHAH J (afterwards CJ) at once observed: "Authorities in the courts in India
have generally taken the view that Section 56 of the Contract Act is not
applicable when the rights and obligations of the parties arise under a trans-
fer of property under a lease".
It was one of the cases arising out of the partition of the country into
India and Pakistan. The lease in question was that of an agricultural land
for one year only. The rent was paid and the lessee was given possession.
Before the land could be exploited for any crops, came partition which
left the land in Pakistan and the parties migrated to India. The action was
to recover the rent paid.
But no such recovery was allowed. SHAH J who spoke on behalf of him-
self and RAMASWAMI and MITTER JJ pointed out that completed transfers
are completely outside the scope of Section 56.
In a case before the Allahabad High Court, 220 the roofs of a premises
which was leased out collapsed owing to their dilapidated condition and
heavy rains and required new construction, that was not taken to be a frus-
tration of the lease.
On the other hand, where on account of an event beyond the parties'
control, the lessor is not able to transfer possession to the lessee, the lessee.
would be entitled to take back his rent. This was so held by the Punjab High
Court in Gurdashan Singh v Bishen Singh.221 To this extent the Supreme
Court approved the decision, but the observation of the High Court that
"the broad principle of frustration of contracts applies to leases" was

rejected, SHAH J saying: "We are unable to agree with that observation."
The learned judge continued:
Under a lease of land there is a transfer of right to enjoy that land. If
any material part of the property be wholly destroyed or rendered sub-
stantially and permanently unfit for the purpose for which it was let out,
because of fire, tempest, floods, violence of any army or a mob, or other
irresistible force, the lease may at the option of the lessee be avoided. This
rule is incorporated in Section 108(c) of the Transfer of Property Act.
Where the property leased is not destroyed or rendered substantially and
permanently unfit, the lessee cannot avoid the lease because he does not
or is unable to use the land for the purpose for which it is let out to him.222
In the subsequent case of Sushila Devi v Hari Singh,223 the Supreme Court
held that: "In the instant case there is no concluded contract since no deed
was written or registered. It was an agreement to lease and that came within
the scope of Section 56. There was frustration of the contract as the parties
could not go to Pakistan to give or take possession."
The Jammu and Kashmir High Court allowed in Hari Singh v Dewani
Vidyawati the recovery of rent paid in advance under a lease which could
not be completed on account of partition. The recovery was allowed under
Section 65 as benefits received under a contract which became void.
The impossibility must be such that kills the contract itself and not merely
one that keeps the contract alive and capable of being performed at a fur-
ther date. The contract in this case was for waterproofing. The work was
assigned to the contractor without the wishes of house allottees. The allot-
tees were already in possession. They did not allow the contractor to do the
work. The court held that it could not be said that performance had become
impossible. The arbitral tribunal rightly awarded damages to the contractor.
Security deposit was ordered to be refunded and damages awarded covered
miscellaneous expenses and wages paid to idling labour.225
Theories of frustration
Many possible explanations have been put forward as a justification for
the doctrine of frustration as a part of the law of contract. Two theories are
most well-known.
1. Theory of implied term
The theory of implied term was explained by Lord LOREBURN in F.A.
Tamplin Steamship Co Ltd v Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co Ltd 226
in these words:

414 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
[S. 56]
A Court can and ought to examine the contract and the circumstances
in which it was made, not of course to vary, but to explain it, in order to
see whether or not from the nature of it the parties must have made their
bargain on the footing that a particular thing or state of things would
continue to exist. And if they must have done so, then a term to that effect
will be implied, though it be not expressed in the contract.... It is in my
opinion the true principle, for no Court has absolving power, but it can
infer from the nature of the contract and the surrounding circumstances
that a condition which was not expressed was a foundation on which
the parties contracted.... Were the altered conditions such that, had they
thought of them, they would have taken their chances of them, or such
that as sensible men they would have said: “If that happens, of course, it
is all over between us"?
This explanation of the doctrine of frustration has been constantly cited
in a large number of decisions. But it has also been criticised as something
unreal. For instance, Lord WRIGHT said in a case:227 "To my mind the the-
ory of the implied condition is not really consistent with the true theory of
frustration. It has never been acted on by the court as a ground of decision,
but is merely stated as a theoretical explanation." "The court has formulated
the doctrine by virtue of its inherent jurisdiction, just as it has developed the
rules of liability for negligence, or for the restitution or repayment of money
where otherwise there would be unjust enrichment. I find the theory on the
basis of the rule in the pregnant statement of Lord SUMNER that the doctrine
of frustration is really a device by which the rules as to absolute contracts are
reconciled with the special exceptions which justice demands", 228 In another
case his Lordship said: "In ascertaining the meaning of the contract and
its application to the actual occurrences, the court has to decide, not what
the parties actually intended but what as reasonable men they should have
intended. The court personifies for this purpose the reasonable man."
2. Just and reasonable solution
In a subsequent case230 DENNING LJ attempted to explain the doctrine of
frustration on a different basis. He said: "The court really exercises a qual-
ifying power a power to qualify the absolute, literal or wide terms of the
contract-in order to do what is just and reasonable in the new situation.
The day is done when we can excuse an unforseen injustice by saying to
the sufferer 'it is your own folly, you ought not to have passed that form of
words, you ought to have put in a clause to protect yourself'. We no longer
credit a party with the foresight of a Prophet or his lawyer with the drafts-
manship of a Chalmers." But this statement was not approved when the case

went before the House of Lords. The observation of Lord LOREBURN that
"no court has an absolving power", was re-emphasised. Viscount SIMON
said: "The principle remains the same. Particular applications of it may
greatly vary and theoretical lawyers may debate whether the rule should
be regarded as arising from implied term or because the basis of the con-
tract no longer exists. In any view it is a question of 'construction' as Lord
WRIGHT pointed out in Joseph Constantine Steamship Line Ltd v Imperial
Smelting Corpn Ltd 231 and as has been repeatedly asserted by other masters
of law,"232
Theories not applicable in India
Referring to the theories B.K. MUKHERJEA J of the Supreme Court said in
Satyabrata Ghose v Mugneeram Bangur & Co233 "These differences in the
way of formulating legal theories really do not concern us so long as we have
statutory provision in the Indian Contract Act. In deciding cases in India,
the only doctrine that we have to go by is that of supervening impossibility
or illegality as laid down in Section 56 of the Contract Act, taking the word
'impossible' in its practical and not literal sense. It must be borne in mind,
however, that Section 56 lays down a rule of positive law and does not leave
the matter to be determined according to the intention of the parties."
Effects of frustration
"It is well-settled that if and when there is frustration the dissolution of
the contract occurs automatically. It does not depend, as does rescission of
a contract, on the ground of repudiation or breach, or on the choice or elec-
tion of either party. It depends on the effect of what has actually happened
on the possibility of performing the contract."234
1. Frustration should not be self-induced
Explaining the principle that frustration should not be self-induced, Lord
WRIGHT said in Maritime National Fish Ltd v Ocean Trawlers Ltd.235
"The essence of 'frustration' is that it should not be due to the act or
election of the party. There does not appear to be any authority which has
been decided directly on this point." There is, however, a reference to the
question in the speech of the Lord SUMNER in Bank Line Ltd v Arthur Capel
& Co. What he says is: "I think it is now well-settled that the principle
of frustration of an adventure assumes that the frustration arises without

blame or fault on either side. Reliance cannot be placed on a self-induced
frustration."237
In Maritime National Fish Ltd v Ocean Trawlers Ltd 238 the facts were:
The appellants hired the respondents' trawler, called the "St. Cuthbert"
to be employed in fishing industry only. Both parties knew that the trawler
could be used for that purpose only under a licence from the Canadian
Government. The appellants were using five trawlers and, therefore,
applied for five licences. Only three were granted and the Government
asked the appellants to name three trawlers and they named trawlers
other than the St. Cuthbert. They then repudiated the charter and pleaded
frustration in response to the respondents' action for the hire.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the frustration
in this case was the result of the appellants' own choice of excluding the
respondents' ship from the licence and, therefore, they were not discharged
from the contract.239
In another similar case, the contract was to export 1500 tons of sugar
beet pulp pellets with a further option for the same quantity. The sellers
obtained an export licence for 3000 tons. They also contracted with another
buyer to supply him 1500 tons. But the Government refused to grant any
further licences. They shipped the whole agreed quantity to the first buy-
er.240 They were now left with the export licence for 1500 tons only, but
were under two obligations, one to supply 1500 tons to the first buyer under
the option given to him and other under the contract with the second buyer
for the same quantity. As a face saving device they apportioned the supply
between the two buyers giving about half to either. The second buyer sued
for breach of contract.21 The suppliers pleaded frustration. They were held
liable. The Court of Appeal found no legal authority justifying the proposi-
tion that where a seller has a legal commitment to A and a non-legal com-
mitment to B and he can honour the obligation to A or to B but not to both,
he is justified in partially honouring both obligations. 242 The court referred
to the principle stated in the American Uniform Commercial Code243 that
in such a situation the seller may allocate supplies in any manner which
is reasonable and fair, but found no basis for importing the principle into
English law. There is, however, an English authority to the effect that if the
seller had been under a legal duty, he would have been justified in making
fair apportionment. The court said that when a supplier has many contracts

to fulfil, but only has enough of the goods to fulfil one of them, then, if he
reasonably appropriates what he has to that one, he can rely on force mae-
jeure as to others. Thus, there is no principle of law preventing one party to
a contract taking advange of its own acts to defeat the other's rights unless
the party is in breach of duty in so acting. Where the defendant company
having the right to do so and lawfully exercising that right, sold its subsid-
iary with the result that the employees' stock options lapsed, the defendant
company was held not liable for the lapse because it was under no duty not
to sell its subsidiary, 244
In order to attract the principle that a party is not entitled to rely on his
own act in not fulfilling a condition subsequent and thereby bringing a con-
tract to an end, the act has to amount to a breach of duty owed to the other
party under the contract. If a term cannot be implied into a contract that a
party would not do an act which, if done, would prevent the fulfilment of a
condition precedent or would cause a condition subsequent to be fulfilled,
the contract takes effect according to its tenor.
Applying this principle to the case of a company which offered shares to
its own employees and to those of its subsidiary and after an employee of
a subsidiary had accepted the offer, the company's subsidiary was sold to a
bidder and the employee was informed that the scheme lapsed but he sued
the company for breach of contract, the court came to the conclusion that
the company was not, by reason of the scheme, under a duty not to deal
with the undertaking of the subsidiary in a way that would frustrate the
scheme, 245
2. Frustration operates automatically
Frustration operates automatically to discharge the contract "irrespective
of the individuals concerned, their temperaments and failings, their interest
and circumstances",246 "The legal effect of frustration does not depend on
their intention or their opinions, or even knowledge, as to the event."247 "The
belief, knowledge and intention of the parties are evidence, but evidence
only on which the court has to form its conclusion whether the changed
circumstances destroyed altogether the basis of the adventure and its under-
lying object." This is particularly true of Indian law as Section 56 of the
Contract Act "lays down a rule of positive law and does not leave the matter
to be determined according to the intention of the parties."

418 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
[S. 65]
A case, however, shows that in certain circumstances frustration may be
waived by one party and then the other will be bound by the contract. In
HR & S Sainsbury Ltd v Street:249
There was the sale of 275 tons (5 per cent more or less) of feed barley to
be grown on seller's land. The crop amounted to only 140 tons. The seller
resold it to another and contended that he had the right to do so because
the contract had ended by frustration.
But he was held liable for breach of contract. There was frustration only
to the extent of crop failure. The buyer could waive it and claim delivery of
whatever little crop the seller's land had produced.250
The Supreme Court has laid down that frustration puts an end to the
liability to perform the contract. It does not exterminate the contract for all
purposes. For example, whether the doctrine of frustration would apply or
not has to be decided within the framework of the contract and, if the con-
tract contains an arbitration clause, the arbitrator could decide the matter
of frustration.251
3. Adjustment of rights
The rights of the parties are adjusted under Section 65 of the Act.
S. 65. Obligation of person who has received advantage under void
agreement, or contract that becomes void.-When an agreement is discov-
ered to be void, or when a contract becomes void, any person who has received
any advantage under such agreement or contract is bound to restore it, or to
make compensation for it, to the person from whom he received it.
Illustrations
(a) A pays B 1000 rupees in consideration of B's promising to marry C, A's daughter. C is
dead at the time of the promise. The agreement is void, but B must repay A the 1000
rupees.
(b) A contracts with B to deliver to him 250 maunds of rice before the first of May. A delivers
130 maunds only before that day, and none after. B retains the 130 maunds after the first
of May. He is bound to pay A for them.
(c) A, a singer, contracts with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theatre for two
nights in every week during the next two months, and B engages to pay her a hun-
dred rupees for each night's performance. On the sixth night, A wilfully absents herself
from the theatre, and B, in consequence, rescinds the contract. B must pay A for the five
nights on which she had sung.
(d) A contracts to sing for B at a concert for 1000 rupees, which are paid in advance. A is too
ill to sing. A is not bound to make compensation to B for the loss of the profits which B
would have made if A had been able to sing, but must refund to B the 1000 rupees paid
in advance.

Impossibility of performance and frustration 419
The effect of the principle laid down in the section is that when the par-
ties have entered into an apparently valid contract and some benefits have
been passed under it, and subsequently the contract is either discovered to be
void or becomes void, the party who has received the benefits must restore
them to the other.252 Thus, the section does not apply to a contract which the
parties knew at the time of making it to be void.253 The section also does not
apply to a case where the benefits are passed at a time when the contract has,
though unknown to the parties, already ceased to be enforceable. This was
the position in Jagadish Prosad Pannalal v Produce Exchange Corpn Ltd.254
There was a contract for the sale of one wagon of maize starch at the
rate of Rs 77 per cwt., the control price being Rs 78. The goods were
delivered on January 3 and paid for. A few days earlier, viz. on December
16, a new order was passed by the Government making Rs 48 as the price
and this was to apply to all contracts in which delivery was to be given on
or after January 1. The buyer brought an action to recover the difference
between the revised control price and the price he paid.
The court agreed with him to this extent that the contract had become
void by the change in the control price and, therefore, neither party was
compellable to perform, but that the buyer, having paid up, was not entitled
to any refund under Section 65. For this section to apply the advantage must
have been received under "contract", whereas, in the present case, the excess
price was paid after the contract had already become void and ceased to be
enforceable.255
Discovered to be void
The first part is concerned with an agreement which never amounted to
a contract, it being void ab initio. But the parties discovered this at a later
stage. "The word 'discovered' connotes the pre-existence of that which is
discovered". This will cover cases of "initial mistake". Where for example,
money is paid for the sale of goods, which unknown to the parties, have
already perished at the time, the money is refundable. The principle will
apply whether the agreement is void by reason of law or by reason of facts, 256

date on which contract ceases to be enforceable, Amri Devi v Ridmal, AIR 1998 Raj 25.

Thus, for example, where a minor gave a shop under a partnership to the
defendant, the agreement being void, it was held that he could recover back
the shop. "The intention of Section 65 is to prevent a party to a void agree-
ment to retain benefits received under it."257 Similarly, consideration given
on a promissory note which was not enforceable for inadequacy of stamps,
was held to be refundable.258 Likewise, the money paid under a contract
with a municipality not executed in the manner laid down by the Municipal
Act, was held to be refundable.29 Payment made in advance to a contrac-
tor under a contract which is not in accordance with Article 299(1) of the
Constitution relating to Government contracts has been allowed by the
Orissa High Court to be recovered back under Section 65 of the Contract
Act. 20 Payment received by a person for proposed sale of land which he had
no right to sell, had to be returned by him to the other party,261 Taxes realised
by a contractor under the authority of State were held to be refundable to the
tax-payers when it turned out that the levy itself was invalid.22 Money paid
to a person for purchasing his right of reversion, which is not transferable,
being merely an expectancy, was held by the Privy Council to be refunda-
ble with 6 per cent interest from the date of suit. 263 Sir LAWRENCE JENKINS
examined the scope of the section: "The section deals with (a) agreements
and (b) contracts. The distinction between them is apparent from Section 2.
By clause (e) every promise and every set of promises forming the considera-
tion for each other is an agreement, and by clause (b) an agreement enforce-
able by law is a contract. Section 65, therefore, deals with (a) agreements
enforceable by law, and (b) with agreements not so enforceable. By clause (g)
an agreement not enforceable by law is said to be void."
"An agreement, therefore, discovered to be void is one discovered to be
not enforceable by law, and on the language of the section, would include

an agreement that was void in total sense from its inception as distinct
from a contract that becomes void."
Applying these principles to the facts of the case their Lordships observed
that the agreement was manifestly void from its inception but the parties
were not able to know of this fact till the demand for the property was
resisted.
Where the Orissa High Court found that the plaintiff who advanced
money to the defendant for supply of paddy was not aware on the date of
the agreement that it was in violation of law,264 his suit for refund of money
was allowed.265 The Supreme Court allowed recovery under the category
"discovered to be void" of the amount of earnest money which was paid for
purchasing a piece of land. The agreement turned out to be void because the
seller thought he was receiving the price at the rate of per kanal whereas the
buyer was under the impression that he was paying the price per bigha.266
Where it was discovered that the party who had agreed to sell property
and had received advance, had no title to the property, the party receiving
the advance was held to be under an obligation to refund the amount. The
contract was void ab initio but discovered by the parties subsequently. The
obligation to refund exists even where there is no provision in the agreement
to that effect. The obligation is founded on the equitable principle of res-
titution and prevention of unjust enrichment. 267 A lady advocate acting as
an Assistant District Counsel on the request of the District Magistrate was
allowed to recover her remuneration for the working period even though the
appointment was discovered to be void under Section 24(2) of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1973.268
The party to a void contract would still be entitled to institute a suit for
specific enforcement and in the alternative to pray for refund of money paid
under it. Rejection of the plaint was not proper.
269
A Zila Parishad awarded to the highest bidder the contract of collecting
entry fee from vehicles. The contractor did not account for to the Parishad
for a part of the collection and took shelter behind the illegality of such
authorisation. The court allowed recovery but not in the manner of recover-
ing as arrears of land revenue. 270

422 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
Pari delicto
[S. 65]
The principle has also been held to apply in cases where a contract is void
by reason of "unlawful object", but the parties were not aware of it. Thus,
for instance, in a case before the Rajasthan High Court:
The parties made a forward contract in hydrogenated groundnut oil, not
aware of the existence of an order issued under the Defence of India Rules
prohibiting such contracts.
The court held that "the parties are not in pari delicto, and, therefore,
it is a contract which is subsequently discovered to be void. The purchaser
who has advanced money under the contract is entitled to a refund of it."272
The doctrine of pari delicto was stated in the following words in
Onkarmal v Banwarilal:273
The principle behind the doctrine of pari delicto is that where each
party is equally at fault, the law favours him who is actually in posses-
sion, or that where both parties are equally culpable, the law will leave
them where it finds them and will not engage itself to determine the rights
as between them. But this principle is subject to well-known exceptions,
one of which is that it will not apply where the parties are not or cannot
be said to be really in pari delicto,234
Thus, there are at least two exceptions in which the benefits passed under
an agreement which is void by reason of illegality of object can be recovered.
Firstly, where the parties are not at equal fault, the less guilty may recover
anything that he has given to the other under the contract. Where a woman
was induced by an insurance agent to pay premiums upon an illegal and void
policy, she was held entitled to recover, as she was innocent. 275
The doctrine of pari delicto is not designed to reward the wrong-doer
or to penalise the wronged by denying to the victim access to justice. The
doctrine is attracted only when none of the parties is a victim and both
parties have voluntarily and by their free will joined hands to flout the law
for their mutual gain. Applying this principle to the landlord-tenancy rela-
tionship THAKKкAR J of the Supreme Court held that advancing a sum of
money by way of loan by the tenant to the landlord in order to get posses-
sion of premises under an unlawful agreement is an exploitation of a needy
person and, therefore, he was entitled to have the advance adjusted towards
rent as agreed. 276 Section 65 is not attracted where a negotiable instrument

is rendered void by material alteration in inserting a date in an undated
instrument. 277
Secondly, where no part of the illegal purpose has been executed, that
is, the agreement is still executory, any benefits passed under the agreement
may be recovered back. In a case before the Patna High Court:778
Where in a contract of marriage which was illegal, the father of the
bride refused to perform the marriage, he was held entitled to the refund
of the money paid by him to the father of the bridegroom.
Quantum meruit claims
Claims under the well-known English law doctrine of quantum meruit
have been allowed by the courts under this section. The Supreme Court
observed in State of Madras v Gannon Dunkerley & Co that a claim for
quantum meruit is a claim for damages for breach of contract. The value of
the material used or supplied is a factor which furnishes a basis for assessing
the amount of compensation. The claim is not for price of goods sold and
delivered but for damages. That is also the position under Section 65. In
another case280 reasonable compensation was awarded on the implication of
a contract. It will not displace an express stipulation on the point.
In a subsequent case, the Supreme Court explained the requirements of
the claim. The original contract must be so discharged by the opposite party
that the plaintiff is entitled to treat himself as free from the obligation of
further performance and he must have elected to do so. The remedy is not
available to the party who breaks the contract even though he might have
partly performed it. The remedy is restitutory, it is a recompense for the
value of the work done by the plaintiff in order to restore him to the position
which he would have been in if the contract had never been entered into. In
this respect it is different from a claim for damages which is a compensa-
tory remedy. The court accordingly did not allow the claim of a contractor
for extra payment on the ground that he had to procure the raw material
from a longer distance than that represented in the tender documents. 281
The material was in fact available within the stated distance, but its removal
required permission of Cantonment Authorities which the contractor could
not manage to get. 282
Explaining the nature of justice that Section 65 strives for, the Supreme
Court has observed:283
"We do not have the slightest doubt that net profits realised by the
company as a result of its various business activities can never be the

measure of compensation to be awarded under Section 65. It is not as
if Section 65 works in one direction only. If one party to the contract is
asked to disgorge the advantage received by him under a void contract,
the other party may ask him to restore the advantage received by him.
The restoration of the advantage and the payment of compensation have
necessarily to be mutual. In Govindram Seksaria v Edward Radbone 284
the Privy Council pointed out that the result of Section 65 was that each
of the parties became bound to restore to the other any advantage which
the restoring party had received under the contract. As a result of the
contract being void, the State could at the most recover from the contrac-
tor the value of the rough stone excavated from the quarries. But then it
would have to make good to the company the expenditure incurred by it
in quarrying operations and extraction of the rough stone."
The contract was for the grant of a quarry. It was found to be void because
the parties were mistaken about the application of income tax laws in the
area.
Becomes void
The second type of situation covered by Section 65 is where a valid con-
tract is made in the beginning, but it subsequently becomes either unlawful
or impossible of performance. Any benefits which have been passed under
the contract from one party to other must be restored. This is subject to the
expenses which have already been incurred by the other party in the per-
formance of the contract. Where a contract for purchase of granite stones
became inoperative by reason of the seller's delay in obtaining permit from
the Mining Department for removal of the material, the purchaser became
entitled to refund of the whole of the money paid by him. No interest was
allowed because he had himself deposited the money with some delays. 285
ENGLISH LAW. The principles of English law before the Law Reform
(Frustrated Contracts) Act, 1943, were those laid down in the two coro-
nation cases, one of them is, Krell v Henry26 where the court held that the
rent which had been paid before the contract to hire premises became void
by reason of the postponement of the procession was not refundable and
the outstanding rent was not recoverable. The courts left the parties where
they were. They also did not like to disturb the rights which the parties
had acquired before the contract became void. Of this the illustration is

Impossibility of performance and frustration 425
Chandler v Webster, 287 The plaintiff sued for refund of the rent which he
had paid in advance and the landlord counter-claimed for the balance which
was due. ROMER LJ stated the principle and said: "Applying this to the facts
here, as soon as it was ascertained that the procession, though no fault of
either of the parties, could not take place, they were immediately free from
any subsequent obligation under the contract, but the contract could not be
considered as rescinded ab initio. That being so, many legal rights previ-
ously accrued to either of the parties remained, and could not be disturbed,
and one of those rights was the right of the defendant to be paid £141.15 s."
The hardship that this principle is likely to cause was to a certain extent
mitigated by the House of Lords in Fibrosa Spolka Akeyjna v Fairbairn
Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd,288 Lord RUSSELL OF KILLOWEN at once
observed that Chandler v Webster was wrongly decided. Their Lordships
accordingly allowed the £1000 to be recovered which were paid in advance
for purchasing a machinery and the performance having been rendered ille-
gal by the intervention of war. His Lordship continued:
The money paid was recoverable, as having been paid for a consider-
ation which had failed. The rule that on frustration the loss lies where it
falls cannot apply in respect of moneys paid in advance when the con-
sideration moving from the payee for the payment has wholly failed, so
as to deprive the payer of his right to recover moneys so paid as moneys
received to his use; but the rule will, unless altered by legislation, apply
in all other respects.
LAW REFORM (FRUSTRATED CONTRACTS) ACT (ENGLISH).-The expected
legislation came within a year. Now the rights of parties whose contract has
ended by frustration are adjusted under the provisions of the Law Reform
(Frustrated Contracts) Act, 1943. The main provisions of the Act are as
follows:
All sums of money which have been paid under a frustrated contract shall
be refundable and those which are still payable shall cease to be payable. If
any party has incurred, expenses before the time of discharge in the perfor-
mance of the contract, the court may, if it thinks just to do so, allow him to
deduct such expenses from the refundable deposit or allow him to recover.
The same principle will apply to any benefits received other than money. In
estimating the amount of expenses the court may take into account the rea-
sonable overhead expenses and the work or services personally performed

by the party. Benefits received under an insurance policy are not to be taken
into account unless there is an express obligation to insure.
APPROPRIATION OF PAYMENTS [SS. 59-61]
When a debtor owing several distinct debts to one person, makes a pay-
ment, which is not sufficient to discharge all the debts, the question arises to
which particular debt the payment is to be applied. The Act, in Sections 59
to 61, lays down the underlying principles:289
S. 59. Application of payment where debt to be discharged is indi-
cated. Where a debtor, owing several distinct debts to one person, makes a
payment to him, either with express intimation, or under circumstances imply-
ing, that the payment is to be applied to the discharge of some particular debt,
the payment, if accepted, must be applied accordingly.
Illustrations
(a) A owes B, among other debts, 1000 rupees upon a promissory note, which falls due
on the first June. He owes B no other debt of that amount. On the first June A pays to B 1000
rupees. The payment is to be applied to the discharge of the promissory note.
(b) A owes to B among other debts, the sum of 567 rupees. B writes to A and demands
payment of this sum. A sends to B 567 rupees. This payment is to be applied to the discharge
of the debt of which B had demanded payment.
S. 60. Application of payment where debt to be discharged is not indi-
cated. Where the debtor has omitted to intimate, and there are no other cir-
cumstances indicating to which debt the payment is to be applied, the creditor
may apply it at his discretion to any lawful debt actually due and payable to him
from the debtor, whether its recovery is or is not barred by the law in force for
the time being as to the limitation of suits.
S. 61. Application of payment where neither party appropri-
ates. Where neither party makes any appropriation, the payment shall be
applied in discharge of the debts in order of time, whether they are or not
barred by the law in force for the time being as to the limitation of suits. If the
debts are of equal standing, the payment shall be applied in discharge of each
proportionately.
1. Appropriation by debtor
The first principle is laid down by Section 59 which confers the right
of appropriation upon the debtor. If the debtor owes several distinct debts
to the same creditor and makes payment, he has the right to request the
creditor to apply the payment to the discharge of some particular debt. If
the creditor accepts the payment, he is bound by the appropriation.290 This

Appropriation of payments 427
principle was laid down as early as (1816) in Clayton, re21 and has since
been incorporated in the section and also followed in a number of cases.
This principle applies to several distinct debts and not to a single debt pay-
able by instalments. 292 This set of sections is applicable only in cases where
more than one debts are due from the debtor to the creditor. They are not
attracted when there is only one debt, or, as in this case, the debt has become
merged into a decree. 293 The debtor may exercise this right and may specify
his appropriation expressly or his intention may be implied from surround-
ing circumstances indicating that his intention at the time of payment was
to appropriate the amount deposited by him to a particular debt or to the
account of that debt. 294 The payment of a money decree was directed to be
in monthly instalments. The judgment debtor remitted monthly instalments
with a covering letter that the amount be appropriated towards principal.
The bank did not refuse it and remained silent about it. The bank became
bound by the appropriation. He could not appropriate the payments first
towards interest and costs.295
These sections contain a general rule for appropriation of payments
towards several distinct debts and not towards various heads of one debt.2%
It was not applied to a case in which the principal and interest amount were
due on a single debt. The rule applicable in such cases is that payment is
first applied to wipe out interest and the balance is appropriated towards
principal.297 An arbitration award was passed against the respondent for
the principal sum with future interest. The award was challenged under
Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. During pendency
of such proceeding the respondent deposited certain amount in the court.
The deposit was recorded as representing the principal amount due and pay-
able under the award. The court said that the fact that the appellant made
no objection did not mean that he had accepted the appropriation. He there-
fore had the right to appropriate it towards the interest amount which was
due till that date. 298

428 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
2. Appropriation by creditor
[S. 61]
The second principle is laid down in Section 60, which enables the credi-
tor to make appropriation. If the debtor makes payment without any appro-
priation, the creditor may use the payment at his discretion to wipe out any
debt which is due. He may, for example, use it in payment of a time-barred
debt,299 or in payment of a debt which carries simple or lesser interest.300
Where a mortgagor deposited some amount in the court without indicat-
ing whether it was for principal or interest, the court held that the ordinary
principle that such money should first be applied to interest and costs and
then to principal, would apply. 301
3. Appropriation by law
The third principle is in Section 61. The section applies when neither
party makes an appropriation. In such a situation the law gets the right to
appropriate the payment and the law prefers to wipe out the debts in the
order of time in which they were incurred. The section says: "When neither
party makes any appropriation the payment shall be applied in discharge of
the debts in order of time, whether they are or are not (time-barred)....If
the debts are of equal standing, the payment shall be applied in discharge of
each, proportionally."
ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTS
Section 37 which enables parties to dispense with performance should
also enable them to assign their contractual obligations. "Assignment"
means transfer of contractual rights or liability by a party to the contract to
some other person who is not a party,302 For example, if A owes B Rs 500
and B owes C a like amount, B has the right to receive from A and is under

Assignment of contracts 429
liability to pay C. B can ask A to pay directly to C and if A accepts, that will
be an assignment of B's right to C.
Assignment of liabilities
An important principle affecting assignments is that the burden of or
liability under a contract cannot be assigned. The promisor has the right to
insist that performance shall be the responsibility of the promisee.303 The
promisor may have contracted with him by reason of the personal confi-
dence which he reposed in him and, therefore, the promisor, can object to
the contract being performed by any other person. This is more particu-
larly true of cases in which the engagement is of personal nature, such as,
the engagement to sing or to paint. In such cases there is no question of
vicarious performance. In other cases it should not matter to the promisor
whether the performance is offered by the promisee himself or by someone
else acting for him, provided, of course, that the promisee is responsible for
the performance by his agent. 304 Explaining this in Davies v Collins,305 Lord
GREENE MR said: "In many contracts all that is stipulated for is that the
work shall be done and the actual hand to do it need not be that of the con-
tracting party himself; the other party, will be bound to accept performance
carried out by somebody else. The contracting party, of course, is the only
party who remains liable. He cannot assign his liability to a sub-contractor,
but his liability in those cases is to see that the work is done, and if it is not
properly done, he is liable."306
A vicarious performance is not an assignment in the real sense of the
word. "It is quite a mistake to regard that as an assignment of the contract,
it is not."
Where with the consent of the promisor, the promisee drops out and
some other person takes over his obligation, that is also not an assignment.
It is a novation, that is, change of parties with mutual assent. In the words
of VENKATARAMA AIYAR J of the Supreme Court: 307 "As a rule obligations
under a contract cannot be assigned except with the consent of the prom-
isee, and when such consent is given, it is really a novation resulting in a

Assignment of rights
[S. 61]
"On the other hand, rights under a contract are assignable unless the con-
tract is personal in its nature or the rights are incapable of assignment either
the law or under an agreement between the parties." The intention of the
parties is to be gathered from the nature of the agreement and the surround-
ing circumstances. The leading authority is the decision of the Supreme
Court in Khardah Co Ltd v Raymon & Co (India) (P) Ltd.309
The dispute arose out of a contract for the purchase by a mill of
Pakistani raw jute from a dealer, who failed to supply the goods as agreed.
The court held that the contract for the purchase of foreign jute was not
assignable because the goods had to be imported under a licence which was
not transferable and which also required the utilisation of the imported raw
material only by the mill in question. The only other question was whether
the dealer could assign his right to the price on delivery of the goods. The
court conceded that ordinarily there is nothing personal about a contract
for the sale of goods. The court further pointed out that "it is settled law
that an arbitration clause does not take away the right of a party to assign
if it is otherwise assignable".310 In the opinion of the court the rights of the
unpaid seller also do not stand in the way of the assignability of a contract.
There was no provision in the contract prohibiting assignment, but even
so the court held that the contract involved so many personal obligations
on the part of the seller, which strongly suggested that the intention of the
parties was that neither of them should assign the contract. The court
also took occasion to point out: "There is in law a clear distinction between
assignment of rights under a contract by a party who has performed his
obligations thereunder, and assignment of a claim for compensation which
one party has against the other for breach of contract. The latter is a mere
claim for damages which cannot be assigned in law, the former is a benefit
under an agreement, which is capable of assignment."
The rights under a lottery ticket are assignable. Explaining this,
TULZAPURKAR J said:³12
A sale of lottery ticket confers on the purchaser thereof two rights (a) a
right to participate in the draw and (b) a right to claim a prize contingent
upon his being successful in the draw. Both would be beneficial interests
in movable property, the former "in praesenti", latter in future depending
on a contingency lottery tickets, not as physical articles, but as slips of
paper or memoranda, evidence, not one but both these beneficial interests

Assignment of contracts 431
in moveable property which are obviously capable of being transferred,
assigned or sold and on their transfer, assignment or sale, both these ben-
eficial interests are made over to the purchaser for a price.
The matter arose out of the attempt of the T.N. Government to subject
the sale of lottery tickets to Sales Tax. Such tickets being goods within the
meaning of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, the State was held to be compe-
tent to do so. Dealing with agreements which are in the nature of grants,
the court said: "It is well settled that rights and benefits arising thereun-
der, unless of a personal nature, partake of the character of personality
as opposed to reality and, therefore, movable property capable of being
assigned or transferred,"313
Another illustration of a contract involving personal element and, there-
fore, incapable of being assigned is to be found in the decision of the Court
of Appeal in Kemp v Baerselman, 314
The defendant agreed to supply a cake manufacturer with all the eggs
that he might require for a year and the latter was not to purchase else-
where. Deliveries were to be made at three different places and payment
I was to be by drawing bills of exchange on the manufacturer. The man-
ufacturer's business was taken over by a company in which he was the
principal shareholder, but even so the defendant refused to continue with
the supplies.
It was held that the contract, being of personal nature in that it involved
the personal creditworthiness of the buyer as to the mode of payment, was
not capable of being assigned.
The Central Government assigned a piece of land to its own corporate
undertaking with rights, liberties and privileges one of which was exemp-
tion from land revenue. It was held that the assignee became entitled to the
exemption as a successor in interest of the Central Government. 315
Unilateral cancellation of sale deed
It is not possible for the vendor to make a deed of cancellation of the sale
deed made and registered earlier and get it registered, even if the ground is
that full consideration was not received by the vendor. Such deed amounts
to rescission of the contract. It would require an order of the court under
Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.316
313. Quoting SALMOND'S JURISPRUDENCE (12th Edn) 412, para 108, under the heading
"Proprietory rights". See Darlington Borough Council v Wiltshier Northern Ltd, (1995)
1 WLR 68 (CA), the assignee's right to recover damages for breach of contract would be as
extensive as that of the assignor. The case involved the assignment of rights in a building
under construction and the-action by the assignee was for defective construction.

432 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
Effect and formalities of assignment
Consideration
[S. 61]
In the first place, an assignment requires some consideration between the
assignor and assignee. In the absence of any consideration between them,
the assignment will be revocable by the assignor.317 But when an assignment
made as a gift has been completed by fulfilling the essential formalities, it
cannot be revoked. This is true of all gifts. This is borne out by the follow-
ing statement of TURNER LJ:31 "In order to make a voluntary settlement
valid and effectual, the settlor must have done everything, which according
to the nature of the property comprised in the settlement, was necessary to
be done in order to transfer the property and render the settlement binding
upon him,"
Subject to equities
Secondly, the title of the assignee shall be subject to all equities that exist
at the time between the assignor and assignee, or that arise up to the time
that the notice of assignment is given to the debtor.319 Where, for example,
the assignor had induced by fraud the other party to contract with him, the
other party will have the same right of rescission against the assignee as he
would have had against the assignor. But the assignee will not be affected
by any equity of personal nature between the assignor and assignee. For
example, the right to claim damages for the fraud committed by the assignor
cannot be used to defeat the right of the assignee.320
Notice of assignment
Thirdly, notice of assignment should be given to the debtor. Such a notice
is useful from several points of view. It binds the debtor. In the absence of a
notice, the debtor can make payment to the assignor himself and that will
be a good discharge. Another advantage of giving notice is that the assignee
will not be affected by any equity that may arise between the assignor and
the debtor after notice. Notice is also important from the point of view of
priorities. If, for example, the assignor makes more than one assignments of
the same claim, the assignee who gives notice of the assignment to him first
in point of time will have priority over the other, even if the assignment to
him came later in time.

DISCHARGE BY AGREEMENT
Contracts which need not be performed
Section 62 provides that "if the parties to a contract agree to substitute
a new contract for it, or to rescind or alter it, the original contract need not
be performed".
S. 62. Effect of novation, rescission and alteration of contract.-If the
parties to a contract agree to substitute a new contract for it, or to rescind or
alter it, the original contract need not be performed.
Illustrations
(a) A owes money to B under a contract. It is agreed between A, B and C that B shall thence-
forth accept C as his debtor, instead of A. The old debt of A to B is at an end, and a new
debt from C to B has been contracted.
(b) A owes B 10,000 rupees. A enters into an agreement with B and gives B a mortgage of
his (A's) estate for 5000 rupees in place of the debt of 10,000 rupees. This is a new con-
tract and extinguishes the old.
(c) A owes B 1000 rupees under a contract. B owes C 1000 rupees. B orders A to credit C with
1000 rupees in his books, but C does not assent to the agreement. B still owes C 1000
rupees, and no new contract has been entered into.
Novation
When the parties to a contract agree to substitute the existing contract
with a new contract, that is called novation. 321 In the well-known case of
Scarf v Jardine³2 Lord SELBORNE explained the meaning and effect of nova-
tion in the following words:
... there being a contract in existence, some new contract is substituted
for it either between the same parties or between different parties, the
321. Where the parties change only a part of the contract and the new contract is so inconsistent
with the existing contract that they cannot stand together, there is no good novation. Lata
Construction v Rameshchandra Ramniklal, (2000) 1 SCC 586: AIR 2000 SC 380. United
Bank of India v Ramdas Mahadeo Prashad, (2004) 1 SCC 252: (2004) 1 CLJ 147, a mem-
orandum of understanding does not amount to novation as envisaged under this section.
The respondents had already committed a breach of contract, they could hardly seek to
enforce the contract. CITI Bank N.A. v Standard Chartered Bank, (2004) 1 SCC 12: AIR
2003 SC 4630: (2003) 117 Comp Cas 554, novation cannot be brought about unilaterally.
It requires consent of both parties. There was no evidence of any tripartite arrangement
under which the third party was to take over liability. The case was rather governed by S. 63
under which a promisee can unilaterally accept an altered position and discharge the other
party from liability. The party had accepted dishonoured bonds knowingly and voluntarily.
Vijaykumar Khandre (Dr) v Prakash Khandre, AIR 2002 Kant 145, a returned candidate
was a licensed contractor and was holding several contracts with the Government. He tried
to hand them over to others but a tripartite agreement could not be proved. Hence disquali-
fication remained. Jay Karnataka News Printers Ltd v Syndicate Bank, (2001) 2 BC 27 (Kar
DB), substitution of new contract for the old is the very essence of novation, mere deposit of
amount by a third party towards liquidation of the outstanding amount cannot constitute
novation between lender and borrower. Polymat India (P) Ltd v National Insurance Co Ltd,
(2005) 9 SCC 174: AIR 2005 SC 286, terms of contract reduced to writing, could not be
changed without mutual agreement, amendments in the approved proposal not agreed to by
the insurer, ineffective.

434 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
[S. 62]
consideration mutually being the discharge of the old contract. A com-
mon instance of it in partnership cases is where upon the dissolution of a
partnership the persons who are going to continue in business agree and
undertake as between themselves and the retiring partner, that they will
assume and discharge the whole liabilities of the business, usually taking
over the assets; and if, in that case, they give notice of that arrangement
to a creditor, and ask for his accession to it, there becomes a contract
between the creditor who accedes and the new firm to the effect that
he will accept their liability instead of the old liability, and on the other
hand, that they promise to pay him for that consideration.
Hence novation is of two kinds, namely:
(1) a novation involving change of parties; and
(2) a novation involving substitution of a new contract in place of the old.
1. Change of parties
The first illustration to Section 62 is a case of novation by change of
parties. If A is a debtor and the creditor agrees to accept B in his place as
the debtor, the original contract between the creditor and A is at an end. 323
A novation of this kind usually takes place when a new partner is admitted
into an existing firm or when a partner retires from a firm and the new firm
as constituted after admission or retirement accepts the liabilities of the old
firm and this is approved by the persons dealing with the firm. Concurrence
of all the parties is necessary. 324 All the parties to the earlier contract have to
give their consent. One or more of the parties to the novated contract must
be new persons who undertake the responsibility under the new contract.325
Novation and rescission
An order of arrest of the supplier's vessel was passed in an Admiralty
suit. The plaintiff made an out of court settlement with the owner of the
vessel. Under a subsequent agreement, the debtor agreed to pay not only the
amount claimed in the suit but costs and interest also. The payment under
the agreement was guaranteed by a third party. It was held that the existence

ment, seller seized the vehicle, a third person undertook to pay the unpaid balance and got

(1994) 2 KLT 18: AIR 1995 Ker 31, the court has to see not only whether the new debtor has
consented to assume liability but also whether the creditor has accepted the liability of the
new debtor.
325. Sasidaran v India Cements Capitals Ltd, (2011) 1 MWN (Civil) 561, promise was found to
be not a party to the new agreement, hence no novation. Colgate Palmolive India Ltd v T.J.

contract. Damages were not to be awarded on the terms of the old agreement.

cause of action became substituted by a new cause arising out of the agree-
ment. Admiralty claim was no longer maintainable. The vessel became the
property of the defendant free from liability to the plaintiff.326
2. Substitution of new agreement
When the parties to a contract agree to substitute a new contract for it,
the original contract is discharged and need not be performed. It is neces-
sary for the application of this principle that the original contract must be
subsisting and unbroken. The substitution of a new contract is not possible
after there has been a breach of the original contract. An early illustration is
Manohur Koyal v Thakur Das Naskar.327
The plaintiff sued to recover the sum of Rs 1173 due on a bond. After
the due date of the bond, the plaintiff agreed to accept Rs 400 in cash and
a new bond of Rs 700 payable by instalments. Subsequently the defendant
neither gave Rs 400 nor the bond.
The plaintiff thereupon sued him on the original bond. The Calcutta
High Court held that the original contract was discharged, not by novation,
but by breach, and the plaintiff was entitled to sue for the breach of the
original contract.
Another illustration is provided by a case in which an engineering con-
tract for extraction of coal became affected by major slides leading to stop-
page. Another area was allotted to the petitioner in place of the affected
area. He accepted it though it was less than the original allotted area. The
court said that original contract became discharged. Tenders could validly
be invited for that area. 328
The petitioner was appointed in response to an advertisement but placed
at a lower scale than that mentioned in the advertisement. He accepted his
placement. He then claimed the promised pay scale. He was not allowed to
do so. The principle of novation applied. The appointment and acceptance
at the lower scale substituted the original proposed scale. 329
A contractor's bill was lying unpaid for about 4½ years. For that reason he
was exposed to huge losses and grave economic duress. He settled his claim
under a memorandum of understanding under which he accepted payment
in full and final satisfaction. He then raised a dispute and sought arbitration.
for claiming interest on late payment. It was held that the memorandum
of understanding had put an end to the original contract and therefore the
contractor could not claim arbitration in terms of the original contract.³

[S. 62]
In the words of the Supreme Court in Lata Construction v Rameshchandra
Ramniklal as spoken by S. SAGHIR AHMAD J:
"One of the essential requirements of novation, as contemplated by
Section 62, is that there should be complete substitution of a new contract
in place of the old. It is in that situation that the original contract need not
be performed. Substitution of a new contract in place of the old contract
which would have the effect of rescinding or completely altering the terms
of the original contract has to be by agreement between the parties. The
substituted contract should rescind or alter or extinguish the previous
contract. But if the terms of the two contracts are inconsistent and they
cannot stand together, the subsequent contract cannot be said to be in
substitution of the earlier contract."
The contract in the case was to provide a flat. A subsequent contract
between the parties provided that the rights of the buyer under the original
contract would be extinguished only on payment by him of the stipulated
amount. He failed to make the payment. It was held that he could invoke the
terms of the original contract and claim before the Consumer Commission
that there was a deficiency in service on the part of the builder.
It is further necessary that the new agreement should be valid and enforce-
able. Thus, where an existing mortgage was replaced by a new agreement of
mortgage, the new agreement being not enforceable for want of registration,
it was held that the parties were still bound by the original mortgage. 332 In a
contract to provide land free of encumbrances for a housing project, the site
had to be given up because of the inability to remove hutment occupation of
the land and the rates had to be increased because of the escalated price of
the new site, the Bombay High Court held that it amounted to novating the
old with a new contract.333
It has also been pointed out in a judgment of the Calcutta High Court
that "Section 62 requires an agreement which necessarily implies consid-
eration". It is also obvious that there cannot be unilateral alteration of a
2015 Mad 175, the contract provided that the place of arbitration would be at Tuticorin.

ing a cinema hall, one of them was not allowed subsequently to alter them

the sanction was already in existence. 336
In an already concluded construction contract, requiring that 10 per cent
would be paid to the contractor in advance subject to the condition that he
would submit a bank guarantee, this being not there in the original contract,
was held to be not such a condition as would alter the very nature of the
original contract. 337
An alteration of the entire design of the rail overbridge was held to be a
substantial alteration of the plan itself amounting to converting the same
into a completely new project. Such an alteration could not fall into the
increase or decrease clause of the contract. It was wrong on the part of the
government to invite new tenders at the cost of the contractor. The govern-
ment was ordered to pay for the work already done by the contractor.338
It was opined by their Lordships of the Privy Council as far back as the
year 1893 in Commercial Bank of Tasmania v Jones that "novation of
debt operates as a complete release of the original debtor and cannot be
construed as a mere covenant not to sue him."

option to terminate the contract and the parties by means of a supplemen-
tary contract agreed to postpone the termination, it was held that this did

Where the rights under the old contract are kept alive even after the sec-
ond agreement, then there is no substitution of the contract and hence no
novation.341
In a supply contract, an escalation of price, or reduction in quantity of
supply order, or extension of date of supply has been held as not amounting
to novation. It has been so reiterated by the Supreme Court. 342
No effect upon arbitration clause
Where the signature to a settlement agreement were procured by coer-
cion, it was held that the arbitration clause in the original agreement did not
become discharged. The dispute was of a nature which was arbitrable under
the original contract. It made no difference that a settlement agreement was
entered into between the parties. 343
S. 67. Effect of neglect of promisee to afford promisor reasonable
facilities for performance.-If any promisee neglects or refuses to afford the
promisor reasonable facilities for the performance of his promise, the promi-
sor is excused by such neglect or refusal as to any non-performance caused
thereby.
A contracts with B to repair B's house.
Illustrations
B neglects or refuses to point out to A the places in which his house requires repair.
A is excused for the non-performance of the contract, if it is caused by such neglect or
refusal.
Interdependent promises
Where promises are interdependent so that one party cannot perform
without cooperation of the other, if the latter does not provide reasona-
ble facilities for performance, the former is excused from his obligation to
perform. The illustration appended to the section is based upon Makin v
Watkinson. Another illustration is Ellon v Topp. 345
An infant was placed by his father under a master to learn his three
trades. Subsequently the master gave up one of his trades. The apprentice
gave up his training for that reason.
The master sued for breach. The court came to the conclusion that the
contract was on the basis of picking up three trades and the abandonment

without any justification, the master would be free from any further obli-
gation. It is evident that the master would not be liable for not teaching the
apprentice if the apprentice will not be taught."346
Rescission and restoration
The section also permits the parties to rescind their contract. The Supreme
Court allowed the parties to rescind under this section a contract for sale
of forest coupes because of the substantial variance between the particulars
of quantity and quality of timber held out at the time of the auction and the
timer actually available. The contractor was allowed refund of his deposit.
But no compensation was allowed to him for his loss because the contract
contained a clause against compensation in such circumstances. 347
Where an old contract is rescinded and is replaced by a new one, the old.
one will not revive only for the reason that there has been a failure to keep the
new promise. The parties may, however, by mutual consent, restore the orig-
inal and then the original will revive and become binding on the parties.348
Where the relationship between the parties was purely contractual and
wholly non-statutory and the parties had by agreement ended their contrac-
tual obligations long back, it was held that if there was any dissatisfaction.
about the matter, it could have been resolved by reopening the settlement.
Writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution was not available in
such matters. 349
REMISSION OF PERFORMANCE
Section 63 allows a party to a contract to dispense with the performance
of the contract by the other party, or to extend the time for performance or
to accept any other satisfaction instead of performance.
S. 63. Promisee may dispense with or remit performance of prom-
ise.-Every promisee may dispense with or remit, wholly or in part, the
performance of the promise made to him, or may extend the time for such per-
formance or may accept instead of it any satisfaction which he thinks fit.
Illustrations
(a) A promises to paint a picture for B. B afterwards forbids him to do so. A is no longer
bound to perform the promise.
(b) A owes B 5000 rupees. A pays to B and B accepts in satisfaction of the whole debt, 2000
rupees paid at the time and place at which the 5000 rupees were payable. The whole
debt is discharged.

440 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
CASE PILOT
[S. 63]
(c) A owes B 5000 rupees. C pays to B 1000 rupees, and B accepts them, in satisfaction of his
claim on A. This payment is a discharge of the whole claim.
(d) A owes B, under a contract, a sum of money, the amount of which has not been ascer-
tained. A, without ascertaining the amount gives to B, and B, in satisfaction thereof,
accepts the sum of 2000 rupees. This is a discharge of the whole debt, whatever may
be its amount. (e) A owes B 2000 rupees and is also indebted to other creditors. A makes
an arrangement with his creditors, including B, to pay them a 350 [composition] of eight
annas in the rupee upon their respective demands. Payment to B of 1000 rupees is a
discharge of B's demand.
The effect of the provision is that the party who has the right to demand
the performance of a contract may-
(1) remit or dispense with it, wholly or in part; or
(2) extend the time for performance; or
(3) accept any other satisfaction instead of performance, 351
Acceptance of less sum
The acceptance of a less sum of money where more is due, is a good
discharge of the whole of the liability. The Supreme Court decision in
Kapurchand Godha v Mir Nawab Himayatalikhan Azamjah illustrates
this:
The liability was above twenty-seven lakhs of rupees. Hyderabad
having been taken over, a committee was appointed to clear matters. It
offered twenty lakhs to the creditor in full satisfaction and he accepted it.
Afterwards the creditor sued the debtor for the balance.
S.K. DAS J held that the facts of the case are completely covered by
Section 63 and illustration (c) thereof. The appellant having accepted the
payment in full satisfaction of his claim was not entitled to sue. The court
also relied upon Section 41 which provides that when a promisee accepts
performance from a third person, he cannot afterwards sue the promisor.
Similarly, in Hari Chand Madan Gopal v State of Punjab 353 the Supreme
Court held: "The Government had decided to recover only 40 per cent and
no more. The Government's decision would amount to remitting a part of
the debt due by the appellants. Therefore, the Government cannot ask to
recover more than 40 per cent."
There must be proof that less sum has been accepted. Where the rail-
ways sent a cheque for an amount less than what was claimed by a party
and, though the party retained the cheque, he did not issue any receipt that
he was accepting it in full and final satisfaction and neither did he stop
350. This word was substituted for the word “compensation" by S. 2 and Sch. II of the Amending
Act, 1891 (XII of 1891).

[S. 63]
Remission of performance 441
pursuing his matter, it was held that there was no evidence of an agreement
to accept less sum.354
Acceptance of payment under protest and additional work
The contractor accepted the amount mentioned in the final bill under pro-
test. The contractor company had performed additional work on the direc-
tions of the Department. The court said that the contractor was entitled to
additional amount (or by way of damages) as per the terms of the agreement.
The mere fact that the contractor had accepted the final bill, it could not be
deprived of its right to claim damages for the additional work which was a
provable fact.355
Waiver
To "dispense with" means that the party entitled to claim performance
may waive it. The Supreme Court has already laid down that waiver is the
abandonment of a right which normally everybody is at liberty to waive. "A
waiver is nothing unless it amounts to a release. It signifies nothing more
than an intention not to insist upon the right."357
An extension of time for performance by mutual consent is not the same
thing as a waiver. This distinction was emphasised by the Supreme Court in
M. Sham Singh v State of Mysore.358
M was granted scholarship by the State for higher studies in the United
States upon a bond that he would serve the State on his return, provided
that the State offered him a job within six months of his return, failing
which the bond was to be taken as waived. If M failed to comply he
was to refund the scholarship money. On his request the State agreed to
an extension of his stay in the States for practical training for one year.
During this year he came to India for a domestic visit, but was allowed
by the State to rejoin his practical training. On completion of his training
he joined service in the United States and the State claimed refund of the
scholarship money. He pleaded waiver on the part of the State.
The court held that there was no waiver whatsoever and M was liable to
refund. The extension was mutually agreed upon and there was no conduct
on the part of the State showing an intention to waive.

442 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
[S. 63]
The party who has waived compliance with a particular requirement may
in circumstances and by giving reasonable notice withdraw his waiver. The
Court of Appeal recognised this in Charles Rickards Ltd v Oppenheim.359
The contract was to supply a car chassis and to build a body on it
within seven months, time being of the essence of the contract. The bod-
ywork was entrusted to a third person who was to take his instructions
directly from the buyer. The contractor could not deliver within time and
the buyer liberally extended time until after about two months he gave
notice that if the car was not delivered within 4 weeks, he would be una-
ble to accept it. Delivery was offered still three months after this.
It was held that the buyer had the right to make time as of the essence
again by giving reasonable notice and that the notice given by him was rea-
sonable. He had rightfully rescinded the contract and was entitled to dam-
ages for breach.
Such notice must in all the circumstances of the case give a reasonable
opportunity to the other party to perform his part of the contract. If time is
not otherwise of an essence of the contract, the notice cannot make it so. A
party cannot unilaterally amend the terms of the contract. 30
Waiver is indeed an instance of the application of the principle of promis-
sory estoppel. In the words of Lord DENNING:31 "The principle of waiver is
simply this: If one party, by his conduct, leads another to believe that strict
rights arising under the contract will not be insisted upon, intending that the
other should act on that belief, and he does act on it, then the first party will
not afterwards be allowed to insist on the strict legal rights when it would
be inequitable for him to do so. There may be no consideration moving from
him who benefits by the waiver. There may be no detriment to him by acting
on it. There may be nothing in writing. Nevertheless, the one who waives
his strict rights cannot afterwards insist on them. His strict rights are at any
rate suspended so long as the waiver lasts. He may, on occasion be able to
revert to his strict legal rights for the future by giving reasonable notice in
that behalf, or otherwise making it plain by his conduct that he will there-
after insist upon them. But there are cases where no withdrawal is possible.
It may be too late to withdraw; or it cannot be done without injustice to the
other party. In that case he is bound by his waiver. He will not be allowed
to revert to his strict legal rights. He can only enforce them subject to the
waiver he has made."
"Instances of these principles are ready to hand on contracts for the sale
of goods: A seller may, by his conduct, lead the buyer to believe that he is
not insisting on the stipulated time for exercising an option. A buyer may
by requesting delivery, lead the seller to believe that he is not insisting on the

contractual time for delivery, 363 A seller may accept a less sum for his goods
than the contracted price, thus, inducing the buyer to believe that he will not
enforce payment of the balance. In none of these cases does the party who
acts on the belief suffer any detriment. It is not a detriment, but a benefit
to him, to have an extension of time or to pay less, or as the case may be.
Nevertheless he has conducted his affairs on the basis that he has that bene-
fit and it would not be equitable now to deprive him of it."
In this case, a contract for sale of goods contained a stipulation for bank
credit for the price in a certain manner. But the offer made by the confirming
bank did not comply, in several respects, with what the sellers were entitled
to require. For example, the confirming bank's offer was in terms of sterling
currency. The sellers accepted it by sending their invoices and drafts etc.
Afterwards the sterling was devalued and Tanzanian currency was not and
the seller wanted to enforce his right as to payment in Tanzanian currency.
But he was not allowed to do so. MEGAW LJ said: "It was not a concession
for a specific period of time or one which the seller could operate for as long
as they chose and thereafter unilaterally abrogate, any more than the buyers
would have been entitled to alter the terms of the credit or to have demanded
a refund from the sellers if, after his credit had been partly used, the relative
values of the currencies had changed in the opposite way."364
Extension of time
Section 63 also permits a party to extend time for performance. The
Supreme Court has pointed out in Keshavlal Lallubhai Patel v Lalbhai
Trikumlal Mills365 that the promisee cannot by unilateral act extend the
time of performance of his own accord and for his own benefit. Consent of
the other party is necessary.
The Privy Council held, in a case, that any of these things may be done
without agreement and, therefore, also without consideration. The com-
monest illustration is the release of a debt. A creditor may accept a less
sum of money than what is due, in satisfaction of the whole debt. Another

444 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
[S. 63]
illustration is the decision of the Madras High Court in Mathew Henry
Abraham v Lodge "Goodwill":367
The plaintiff was the holder of a promissory note executed in his
favour by the defendants. He agreed to abandon his claim if the "Lodge
Goodwill" which was burnt down was resuscitated. The building was
completed.
His subsequent claim upon the promissory note was dismissed. One of
the important questions was whether a conditional remission of this kind
was within the scope of the section. The court said: "The illustrations
appended to the section are no doubt cases in which performance is dis-
pensed with unconditionally. But the words of the section itself are wide
enough to cover conditional releases, and there is no reason to think that the
Indian Legislature contemplated a departure on this point from the English
law under which a release contingent on the happening of a future event is
a good release. The point on which Section 63 differs from the English law
is that it does not require consideration to support a release while under
English law a release without consideration is a nudum pactum."
The same difference between English and Indian laws was stated by the
Calcutta High Court in Manohur Koyal v Thakur Das Naskar.368 The court
said: "It is quite clear that Section 63 not only modifies but is in direct
antagonism to the law in England. It was laid down, as pointed out in the
case of John Weston Foakes v Julia Beer, that for the last pretty nearly
three hundred years it has been the law in England that if A owes B five
thousand rupees, and B consents to take two thousand rupees in payment
of the debt that is what is called a nudum pactum, and that B after taking
two thousand rupees can subsequently bring his action for the unpaid three
thousand rupees. The law in this country by virtue of Section 6330 of the
Contract Act is different."
An important difference between Sections 62 and 63 is that the former,
which provides for novation, requires an agreement based on some consid-
eration. But Section 63 requires neither. Under this section, the promisee
may before breach gratuitously release the promisor from the obligation to
perform the promise. The promisee may after breach gratuitously release
the promisor from his liability arising on such breach. 372 As against this,

Department was not afterwards permitted to make any deductions for the earlier unsatisfac-
tory performance.

[S. 63]
Accord and satisfaction 445
under Section 62 novation agreement must be made before the breach of the
original promise.
ACCORD AND SATISFACTION
The accord is an agreement made after breach whereby some considera-
tion other than his legal remedy is to be accepted by the party not in fault,
followed by performance of the substituted consideration. The liability aris-
ing out of breach of contract may be discharged by accord and satisfaction.
The validity of accord and satisfaction must be judged by the general law of
contract quite apart from the provisions of Sections 62 and 63. The principle
and effect of accord and satisfaction were thus explained in a decision of the
Privy Council:73
"The receipt given by the appellants and accepted by the respondents
and acted upon by both proves conclusively that all the parties agreed to
a settlement of all their existing disputes by the arrangement formulated
in the 'receipt'. It is a clear example of what used to be well-known in
Common Law pleading as 'accord and satisfaction by a substituted agree-
ment'. No matter what were the respective rights of parties inter se, they
are abandoned in consideration of the acceptance by all of a new agree-
ment. The consequence is that when such an accord and satisfaction takes
place the prior rights of the parties are extinguished. They have, in fact,
been extinguished by the new rights; and the new agreement becomes a
new departure and the rights of all the parties are fully represented by
it."374
A contracting party in respect of his obligation towards another is released
from such obligation if there is an accord and satisfaction between the two
parties. The obligation need not be executed and can be executory.375 In
P.K. Ramaiah & Co v NTPC the Supreme Court held that in view of the
full and final settlement of the claim, there was an accord and satisfaction
and there was no existing arbitrable dispute. Where a claim for damages
was settled by the Railway by sending a cheque in full and final payment

[S. 63]
the cheque in protest stating that objections to encashment may be com-
municated within 10 days, it was held that because there was no reply from
Railway, there was no mutually agreed accord and satisfaction. 377
An example of accord and satisfaction is to be seen in Kapurchand Godha
v Mir Nawab Himayatalikhan Azamjah.37 The plaintiff after some initial
protest expressed readiness to accept the sum sent in full satisfaction of
his claim and discharge the promissory note making endorsement of full
satisfaction and received the payment. In these circumstances it was held
that the case was completely covered by Section 63 of the Contract Act.
Another example is the decision in Snow View Properties Ltd v Punjab
& Sind Bank. 379 The bank launched recovery proceedings against the bor-
rower but compromised it if the borrower paid a certain sum of money. The
borrower accepted it and paid the amount. The claim of the bank ended by
accord and satisfaction. The bank was required by the court to return to the
borrower his mortgage and hypothecation documents.
In a claim under a fire insurance policy, the policy holder accepted an
amount by way of full and final satisfaction of his claim on the basis of the
second surveyor report. The insurance company was held to be discharged
from its liability, 380
Where the creditor agreed that if a lesser sum than due was paid by the
debtor before the specified date, it would be accepted in full satisfaction
of all claims, but the debtor paid still lesser sum within the specified date,
the court said that the debtor could not insist that his payment should be
recorded as full satisfaction of all the claims, 381
An illegal contract cannot support an accord and satisfaction.382
Estoppel: Acceptance of final bill
Where a contractor accepted the final bill without any objection and
under the terms of the contract, such act had binding efficacy against him,
it was held that the claim of the contractor for additional payments and
damages raised two years after acceptance of the final bill was barred by
estoppel.383

acceptance. Food Corporation of India v Ratanlal N. Gwalani, AIR 2004 MP 215: (2004)

[S. 63]
Material alteration 447
The Supreme Court has laid down that unless, while accepting the final
bill the contractor unequivocally declares that he would not raise any fur-
ther claim, he would not be stopped or precluded from doing so. The mere
acceptance of the final bill did not have the effect of preventing the contrac
tor from raising other claims.384 Any settlement between the parties also
does not have that effect unless the contract becomes a closed chapter under
the settlement. If not, the arbitration clause in the contract remains and
could be activated if the aggrieved party has anything more to claim.385
The settlement was signed "without prejudice". Explaining the meaning of
this phrase, the Supreme Court said: "The classic definition of the phrase
'without prejudice' is contained in the judgment of LINDLEY LJ in Walker
v Wilsher. They (the words 'without prejudice') mean without prejudice
to the position of the writer of the letter if the terms he proposes are not
accepted. If the terms proposed in the letter are accepted a complete contract
is established and the letter, although written 'without prejudice', operates
to alter the old state of things and to establish a new one."387
MATERIAL ALTERATION
"Good faith is a continuing obligation inasmuch as even after entering
into the contract, no material alteration can be made by a party in the terms
of the contract without the consent of the other."388 Where a contract is
embodied in a deed and the party who has the custody of the deed alters it
without the consent of the other in a material particular, the effect would
exactly be the same as that of cancelling the deed. Both parties will be dis-
charged from their respective obligations. The meaning of the expression
"material alteration" was considered by the Supreme Court in Kalianna
Gounder v Palani Gounder. 389

material supplied. The contractor became bound by estoppel, not entitled to anything after

448 Chapter 8 Discharge of Contract
[S. 63]
A memorandum of agreement for the sale of land under which Rs 2000
were paid in advance was with the plaintiff. The defendant refused to
convey the land and pleaded that the plaintiff had altered the deed by
adding the words that the seller shall "clear the debts and execute the sale
deed free from encumbrance".
The plea was dismissed because the alleged alteration could not be proved,
but SHAH J took opportunity to point out: "Even if it be assumed that the
sentence regarding encumbrances was written after the deed was executed it
will not invalidate the deed. Ordinarily, when property is agreed to be sold
for a price, it would be the duty of the vendor to clear it of all encumbrances
before executing the sale deed. The alternation, if any, cannot therefore be
regarded as material."
As observed in HALSBURY'S LAWS OF ENGLAND:190 "A material alteration
is one which varies the rights, liabilities or legal position of the parties as
ascertained by the deed in its original state, or otherwise varies the legal
effect of the instrument as originally expressed."""1
The same principle has been acted upon where, without the consent of
the other parties, the word "partner" was deleted from a deed, the date of
payment was changed from 1st to 10th and the word "and" was substituted
by "or". The party making such alterations was not permitted to put the
deed in the action. 392 Alteration of an agreement by the purchaser of land
for accommodating two signatures of witnesses and to make it acceptable as
a sacrosanct document was held to have discharged the agreement.393 This
judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court on appeal. The court said
that the two independent persons were introduced as marginal witnesses.
Such a change did not affect the validity or enforceability of the agreement.
It was not a material alteration. It did not have the effect of avoiding the
agreement. 394
Materiality of the unilateral amendment is the most important factor. In
a contract containing an arbitration clause, the Government made the uni-
lateral amendment to the effect that the arbitral award must be reasoned.
The alteration was held to be not binding upon the parties. The Government
was not allowed to avoid the award on the ground that the award was with-
out a statement of reasons. 395

Discharge by Breach
DISCHARGE BY BREACH
"A breach of contract occurs when a party thereto renounces his liabil-
ity under it, or by his own act makes it impossible that he should perform
his obligations under it or totally or partially fails to perform such obliga-
tions." The failure to perform or renunciation may take place when the
time for performance has arrived or even before that. Thus, breach is of two
kinds, namely:
(1) anticipatory breach, and
(2) present breach.
Meaning
ANTICIPATORY BREACH
"An anticipatory repudiation occurs when, prior to the promised date
of performance, the promisor absolutely repudiates the contract." It is an
announcement by the contracting party of his intention not to fulfil the
contract and that he will no longer be bound by it. This kind of anticipatory
renunciation has certain effects upon the rights of the parties.
Effect upon rights
Innocent party excused from further performance
In the first place, the other party is excused from performance or from
further performance. The obligation under the original contract comes to an

end and is replaced by operation of law by another obligation, namely to pay
money damages. The only legal nexus that remains between the parties is to
pay the damages which are assessed according to the old obligation but the
old obligation no longer exists as an obligation.³
Options of injured party
IMMEDIATE RIGHT OF ACTION.-Secondly, it entitles the injured party to
an option either to sue immediately or to wait till the time the act was to be
done. That an anticipatory breach gives an immediate right of action was
recognised as early as (1853) in Hochester v De La Tour:"
The plaintiff was a courier. He was engaged by the defendant to
accompany him on a tour to commence on June 1, 1852. Nearly a month
before this date the defendant wrote to the plaintiff that he had changed
his mind, and declined his services. The plaintiff sued him for damages.
for breach. The defendant's counsel very powerfully contended that there
could be no breach of the agreement before the day when the perfor-
mance was due.
But Lord CAMPBELL CJ ruled out the objection. His Lordship said: "It
cannot be laid down as universal rule that, where by agreement an act is to
be done at a future date, no action can be brought for a breach of the agree-
ment till the day for doing the act has arrived. If a man promises to marry
a woman on a future day, and before that day marries another woman, he
is instantly liable to an action for breach of promise of marriage. If a man
contracts to execute a lease on and from a future day for a certain term, and
before that day executes a lease to another person for the same term, he may
be immediately sued for breaking the contract." So, if a man contracted to
sell and deliver specific goods on a future day and before the day he sells
and delivers them to another, he is immediately liable to an action at the suit
of the person with whom he first contracted to sell and deliver....' It seems
strange that the defendant, after renouncing the contract, and absolutely
declaring that he will never act under it, should be permitted to object that

faith is given to his assertion, and that an opportunity is not left to him of
changing his mind.... The man who wrongfully renounces a contract into
which he has deliberately entered cannot just complain if he is immediately
sued for a compensation in damages by the man whom he has injured."
ANTICIPATORY BREACH OF A CONTINGENT CONTRACT.-Even when the per-
formance of a contract is conditional upon the happening of a contingency,
an immediate action for damages will lie, if before the happening of the con-
tingency, the promisor disables himself from performance. Frost v Knight® is
the well-known illustration.
The defendant promised to marry the plaintiff on the death of his
father. The father still living, the defendant announced his intention of not
fulfilling his promise on his father's death, and broke off the engagement.
The plaintiff, without waiting for the father's death, at once brought an
action for the breach.
The defendant contended that a breach could only arise on the happening
of the contingency. But COCKBURN CJ held that "the case falls within the
principle of Hochester v De La Tour and that consequently, the present
action is well brought". His Lordship said that when a contracting party
announces his intention not to fulfil the contract, the contract should be
taken to be broken as all its incidents "and the damages consequent on
non-performance being assessed at the earliest moment, many of the inju-
rious effects of such non-performance may possibly be averted or miti-
gated.... To hold that the aggrieved party must wait until the time fixed for
marrying shall have arrived would have the effect of aggravating the injury,
by preventing the party from forming any other union, and by reason of
advancing age rendering the probability of such a union constantly less". 10 In
another case of this kind, a ship was the subject-matter of a charter-party.
One of the terms was that if the ship was requisitioned for war purposes,
the hire would not be payable during the period of requisition. The ship
was requisitioned and during that period the shipowner sold her away. This
was regarded as repudiation because by selling off the ship, he had made it
beyond his power to restore it back under the charterparty.
Consequences of aggrieved party waiting for performance
The option is with the aggrieved party to sue at once or wait for perfor-
mance.12 "The promisee, if he pleases, may treat the notice of intention as

inoperative, and await the time when the contract is to be executed, and
then hold the other party responsible for all the consequences of non-per-
formance; but in that case he keeps the contract alive for the benefit of the
other party as well as his own; he remains subject to all his obligations
and liabilities under it, and enables the other party not only to complete
the contract, if so advised, notwithstanding his previous repudiation of it,
but also to take advantage of any supervening circumstance which would
justify him in declining to complete it."13 The acceptance of the repudiation
must be made clear to the repudiating party. "An act of acceptance of a
repudiation requires no particular form: a communication does not have to
be couched in the language of acceptance. It is sufficient that the communi-
cation or conduct clearly or unequivocally conveys to the repudiating party
that the aggrieved party is treating the contract as at an end. The aggrieved
party need not personally, or by an agent, notify the repudiating party of his
intention to treat the contract as at an end. It is sufficient that the fact of the
acceptance comes to the aggrieved party's attention, for example, notifica-
tion by an unauthorised broker or other intermediary may be sufficient."14
If the aggrieved party does not accept the repudiation and leaves the con-
tract alive, the consequences will be as follows:
PARTY REPUDIATING MAY CHOOSE TO PERFORM.-Firstly, the party repudi-
ating the contract may nevertheless choose to perform when the time comes
and the promisee will be bound to accept the same. The party keeping the
contract alive is not absolved from tendering further performance of his
own obligation under the contract. Accordingly, if a repudiation by anticipa-
tory breach is followed by affirmation of the contract the repudiating party
would escape liability if the affirming party is subsequently in breach of con-
tract. In this case the charterer refused to load the ship but the owner of the
ship affirmed that the contract was still alive and yet failed to make the ship
ready to load on the day specified, he became liable for breach of contract."
PREMATURE TERMINATION OF CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT.-The principle
is applicable to premature termination of a contract of employment." If
the employee does not accept the repudiation, the contract remains alive
whether he is permitted to perform his duties or not. A managing director
was removed before the expiry of his three-year term and was sought to be

still subsists. Jhandoo Mal Jagan Nath v Phul Chand Fatesh Chand, AIR 1925 Lah 217.

with falling prices and some delay in the loading of the ship, repudiated the contract. The
seller received the notice of repudiation after the ship had sailed away. He did nothing fur-
ther and sold the goods to another party. This was held to be a sufficient acceptance of the
repudiation.

Council, 1981 Ch 448: (1980) 3 WLR 714 (CA).

replaced by another appointee. He did not accept the termination. The court
said that no injunction could be granted to him to prevent the employer from
committing breach of contract of personal service the performance of which
cannot be specifically enforced. But where a contract of personal service
contains both positive and negative covenants either express or implied, an
injunction to enforce the negative covenant is often granted. As such, the
injunction to enforce the positive covenant, i.e. to employ the plaintiff as
managing director was not allowed. However, the injunction to enforce the
implied negative covenant, i.e. not to appoint someone else until the expira-
tion of the plaintiff's period was allowed."
An employment is also the subject-matter of a contract. Unless it is gov-
erned otherwise by a statute or rules framed under it, the provisions of the
Contract Act would be applicable to the formulation and termination of a
contract of employment. Subject to certain exceptions, even specific per-
formance of such a contract by way of a direction for reinstatement of a
dismissed employee is also permissible in law."
Termination of the contract occurs not on the date when the repudiatory
act is done, but from the time the party who is sinned against elects to treat
the wrongful act of the other as a breach of the contract.20
NEGATIVE INJUNCTION.-This is the other side of the old principle of
Lumley v Wagner where it was considered as well-settled that the courts
have jurisdiction to forbid the infringement of a negative stipulation, even
though it is necessary to a positive covenant for the performance of personal
services. In that case, the defendant had agreed that she would sing at the
plaintiff's theatre for three months and would not sing elsewhere during
that period. This negative side of the covenant was enforced. Such a nega-
tive may, perhaps, produce a positive response to go to the opening at hand
when all other theatres are fore-closed. "Thus injunctions have been issued
in the case of agreements not to sing elsewhere than at the plaintiff's theatre,
not, during the period of employment, to engage in any business similar to
that carried on by the employer22, and not, during the period of employ-
ment, to act as a film artiste for any motion picture company other than the
employers."23
WHERE NEGATIVE INJUNCTION NOT ISSUED.-The cases in which a negative
injunction would not be issued were explained in a case where an injunction

was sought against the boxer who was leaving and the manager who was
taking him in.24 The court said:
Where a third party induced a breach of a contract for personal ser-
vices between a master and a servant or a manager and a performer and
the contract involved the servant or performer exercising some special
skill or talent and contained both positive and negative obligations by the
servant or performer (e.g. not to enter into an agreement with any other
master or manager), the court ought not to enforce the performance of
the negative obligations if enforcement of them would have the effect of
compelling the servant or performer to perform his positive obligations
under the contract. Whether the grant of an injunction would be held to
result in compulsion directed towards the servant or performer depended
on the court taking a realistic approach on the facts of each case, to the
probable effect of an injunction on the psychological, material or physical
need of the servant or performer to maintain his skill or talent, but com-
pulsion would be more readily inferred where a longer term injunction
was sought by the master or manager or where the third party was the
only other available master or manager for the servant or performer or
where the original master or manager was likely to seek injunctive relief
against anyone else who attempted to replace him as master or manager.
Furthermore, the court would be less likely to grant an injunction where
the contract of service contained obligations of mutual trust and confi-
dence between the master and servant or manager and performer and the
servant or performer had genuinely lost confidence in the master or man-
ager. Moreover, since damages as an alternative remedy to an injunction
were invariably assessed by the court it ought not to be assumed that an
award of damages for inducing breach of a contract for personal services
would always be an inadequate alternative to the grant of an injunction.
On the other hand, having regard to the sanctity of contracts, the court
ought to scrutinise most carefully and even sceptically any claim by the
servant or performer that he was under the human necessity of maintain-
ing his skill or talent or that his trust in the master or manager had been
betrayed or that his confidence in him had genuinely gone. On the facts,
the grant of the injunctions sought would have the effect of compelling
the boxer to perform his positive obligations under the contract if he was
to maintain his skill or talent as a boxer when he had genuinely lost confi-
dence in the plaintiff's ability to act as his manager. The injunctions had,
therefore, rightly been discharged.
DISCHARGE BY ANY OTHER EVENT MAY BENEFIT BOTH.-Secondly, if while
the contract is lying open, some event happens which discharges the contract
otherwise than by repudiation, for example, by supervening impossibility or
frustration, the promisor would also be entitled to take the advantage of

[S. 39]
the changed circumstances. The most appropriate illustration is Avery v
Bowden.25
The defendant chartered the plaintiff's ship and agreed to load it with
a cargo at Odessa within forty-five days. On arrival of the ship there the
defendant told the captain that he had no cargo for him and requested
him to go away. The captain, however, stayed there in the hope that the
defendant would fulfil his contract. But, before the expiry of forty-five
days, a war broke out which rendered the performance illegal. The plain-
tiff then brought an action for breach.
It was held that the contract had ended by frustration and not by breach.
It was open to the captain to accept the renunciation and in that case "he
would have had a right to maintain an action on the charterparty to recover
damages equal to the loss he had sustained from breach of the contract on
the part of the defendant". But he continued to insist upon having a cargo
in fulfilment of the charterparty and, therefore, the contract was still open
when the war intervened.
Where no other event intervenes to discharge the contract otherwise, the
innocent party who kept waiting up to the last day of performance, may
now sue for breach.
DATE OF ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES.-Thirdly, in case the anticipatory repu-
diation is accepted, damages for breach would be assessed at the time when
repudiation takes place. In Ramgopal v Dhanji Jadhavji Bhatia:27
The defendants, the owners of a ginning mill, contracted with the
plaintiff, a cotton merchant, to use half the mill's working capacity for
ginning his cotton. But the defendant repudiated the contract before any
cotton was supplied or ginned.
The plaintiff was held entitled to recover the estimated loss of profits at
the time of repudiation. Lord SUMMER said: "This was a case of anticipatory
breach. The contract was repudiated almost as soon as it was made, and, the
intended operation being thus baulked, the plaintiff was entitled to measure
his damages as they then stood and could not be required by the defendants
to buy the cotton, which they had announced in advance they would not gin
for him."
Where, on the other hand, the promisee does not accept the anticipatory
repudiation, damages will be assessed at the time fixed for performance
and the promisee takes the risk of market rate falling and in the meantime

he will have to take all reasonable steps to keep his loss to the minimum. 28
Thus, the law is as stated in plain and simple terms in the speech of Viscount
SIMON LC in Heyman v Darwins Ltd:29
repudiation by one party standing alone does not terminate the con-
tract. It takes two to end it, by repudiation, on the one side, and accept-
ance of the repudiation, on the other.
Whether the other party accepts is a matter for his option; if he does not,
the contract remains alive, as was emphasised by the House of Lords in
White & Carter (Council) Ltd v McGregor.30
A contract for display advertisement for 3 years of a motor garage
business was struck between advertisement contractors and the agent of
the garage owner, but the latter repudiated the contract by writing a letter
of cancellation. The contractors refused this request and displayed the
advertisement. The contract provided for annual payments and in default
the payment for all the three years was to become due. Accordingly, the
contractors claimed full payment.
The House of Lords held that the contractors were only claiming what
was due to them under the contract and, therefore, were entitled to it. They
had the right to reject the repudiation. Lord HODSON considered the princi-
ple to be well-established:
It is settled as a fundamental rule of the law of contract that repudia-
tion by one of the parties to a contract does not itself discharge it....
In Howard v Pickford Tool Co Ltd" ASQUITH LJ said: "An unaccepted
repudiation is a thing writ in water and of no value to anybody: It confers
no legal rights to any sort or kind." It follows that, if, as here, there was no
acceptance, the contract remains alive for the benefit of both parties and the
party who has repudiated can change his mind but it does not follow that

[S. 39]
the party at the receiving end of the proferred repudiation is bound to accept
it before the time for performance and is left to his remedy in damages for
breach.
Premature termination of lease
Where a three-year use of premises on lease was terminated by the lessee
before the expiry of the period, the court allowed the lease-money for the
unexpired period by way of damages, the specific enforcement being not
possible.
What constitutes acceptance of repudiation
In a case where the buyers refused to accept the cargo because of delay
in loading and the seller remained silent about the matter and the question
was whether the repudiation had been accepted, the court explained the
requirement of acceptance as follows:
"It is this ability of the innocent party to choose between acceptance
of the repudiation and affirmation of the contract, courses attended by
immediate and differing consequences, that makes it necessary, as it has
repeatedly been held, for the choice of the former to be clear and unequiv-
ocal. While in human affairs, a choice may be made by thought, word or
deed, it can only be manifested by word or deed. A choice, however reso-
lute, which gains no expression outside the bosom of the chooser cannot
be clear and unequivocal in the sense that the law requires. Silence and
inaction, being in the generality of cases equally consistent with an affir-
mation of the contract, cannot constitute acceptance of a repudiation."
What amounts to repudiation
In considering whether there has been a repudiation of a contract by a
party, the whole conduct of that party has to be assessed objectively in order
to see whether there was an intention to abandon and refuse performance
of the contract. Repudiation is a drastic conclusion which should only be
held to arise in clear cases of a refusal, in a manner going to the root of the
contract to perform contractual obligations. Every minor irregularity in

34. See the observation of Lord WILBERFORCE in Woodar Investment Devp Ltd v Wimpey
Construction UK Ltd, (1980) 1 WLR 277 (HL). Applying this to the facts of the case, the
court held that a party giving notice of rescission in terms of the provisions of the contract for
purchasing land entitling him to rescind the contract if the land came under compulsory acqui-
sition under a statutory power, would not amount to repudiation even if there was a mistaken
notion as to the legal position of acquisition. The decision in Nottingham Building Society v
Eurodynamics Systems plc, 1995 FSR 605 (CA) also shows the importance of contract terms
in the matter of repudiation. The contract was for supply of computer software. The contract
provided that the supplier would deliver up the software and other documentation (including
source codes) inspite of any termination of the contract by the purchaser. The supplier failed
to maintain delivery time-schedule until he was provided with further funds which the pur-
chaser could not do, and demanded delivery up of the software and documentation. The court

the performance of a contract cannot be seized upon as a repudiation so as
to put a premature end to the contract. The court has to take into account
the effect of the breach upon the contract as a whole. Thus, in a contract
for the supply of 100 tons of flock of Government standard to be deliv-
ered by instalments, the sixteenth delivery was below the standard and the
buyer attempted to treat this as a repudiation, but the court held that the
seller's conduct did not show an intention to throw away the contract and,
therefore, the buyer should have to be content with damages for defective
goods.35 Lord HEWART CJ concluded:
With the help of these authorities we deduce that the main tests to
be considered...are, first the ratio quantitatively which the breach bears
to the contract as a whole, and, secondly, the degree of probability or
improbability that such a breach will be repeated. On the first point the
delivery complained of amounts to no more than 1½ tons out of a con-
tract for 100 tons. On the second point, our conclusion is that the chance
of the breach being repeated is practically negligible.... The delivery com-
plained of was an isolated instance out of twenty satisfactory deliveries
actually made both before and after the instalment objected to; we hold
that it cannot reasonably be inferred that similar breaches would occur in
regard to subsequent deliveries.
Similarly, in a contract for supply of iron by two instalments, payment
to be made within fourteen days of delivery, the buyer claimed reduction
in price on account of the delay in the first delivery and the seller treating
this as repudiation refused to make further deliveries, it was held that the
conduct complained of did not amount to an intimation of an intention to
abandon and altogether refuse performance of the contract.3
In a subsequent case, the Court of Appeal pointed out "that to consti-
tute repudiation, a breach of contract must go to the root of the contract....
This constitutes the test even where there are recurring breaches-produc-
ing different results according to the degree of non-compliance.... Notice
that a breach is likely to occur or recur cannot, of course, be treated as being
a repudiation unless it would have that effect when it did occur or recur."38
said that there was no repudiation on the part of the purchaser and he was entitled under the
contract terms to a mandatory injunction for the supply. See also Saphena Computing v Allied
Collection Agencies, 1995 FSR 616 DC, where the contract for supply of software for debt
collection business was terminated by mutual consent, yet litigation arose because of copy-
right problems in the material already supplied. Vaswani v Italian Motors (Sales and Services)
Ltd, (1996) 1 WLR 270, here a car was booked at a stated price with some money deposited
in advance. The seller asked the buyer to pay the increased price and on his refusal to do so,
forfeited the advance. The Privy Council held that the terms of the contract did not permit
recovery of increased price, but that there was no repudiation on the part of the supplier, the
buyer was bound to take the vehicle at the booked price.

Applying this test to the facts of the case before him, his Lordship held that
repeated delay in payment ranging from 2 to 20 days and averaging 8 days
and causing a nominal loss to the plaintiff which he could have debited to
the defendant's account but did not do so, such defaults even if repeated
could not go to the root of the contract. The plaintiffs, a French firm, were
marketing their goods in the United States through the defendant firm.
Failure to perform as the occasion arises under the contract may entitle,
depending upon the terms of the contract, the other party to treat that as a
repudiation.
A shipping contract incorporated the rules requiring sellers to have
the cargo ready for delivery at any time within the contract period. The
buyers gave a proper notice of their readiness to take the load. The sellers
failed to deliver the cargo on presentation of buyers' vessel. The buyers
took this failure as a repudiation and terminated the contract.39
It was held that the rule in question imposed an additional obligation
on the sellers to have the cargo ready for the buyers to begin loading with-
out delay or interruption as soon as the vessel was ready to load the cargo
in question. The justification for this rule is that mercantile contracts are
concluded with a reasonably long period of delivery and at a price which
presupposes the buyers' right to call for delivery at any time having given
reasonable notice. That was a valuable option which the buyers would lose
if the sellers were entitled to deliver whenever they were willing and able
to do so within the delivery period. 'Accordingly, the sellers were in breach
of their obligation. This entitled the buyers to put an end to the contract.
They were allowed to recover by way of damages the difference between the
market price of the replacement cargo and the original contract price and
loss of dispatch.
In an agreement for sale of certain shares at a price to be fixed by a
third party valuer, the Supreme Court held that a challenge to the valuation
did not amount to a repudiation of the contract. Such challenge is only an
attempt to ensure a fair price. An act to constitute repudiation must be such
as indicates an intention to refuse to perform the contract and to set the
other party free from performing his part.40
Section 39 of the Indian Contract Act gives expression to the doctrine of
anticipatory breach.
S. 39. Effect of refusal of party to perform promise wholly.-When a
party to a contract has refused to perform, or disabled himself from performing
his promise in its entirety, the promisee may put an end to the contract, unless
he has signified, by words or conduct, his acquiescence in its continuance.

(b) A, a singer, enters into a contract with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theatre
two nights in every week during the next two months, and B engages to pay her at the
rate of 100 rupees for each night. On the sixth night, A wilfully absents herself. With the
assent of B, A sings on the seventh night. B has signified his acquiescence in the contin-
uance of the contract, and cannot now put an end to it, but is entitled to compensation
for damage sustained by him through A's failure to sing on the sixth night.
Breach in entirety
The party in default must have refused altogether to perform the contract
and the refusal must go to the whole of the contract, otherwise the other
party would not be justified in putting an end to the contract. Thus, in Rash
Behary Shaha v Nirttya Gopal Nundy:41
A agreed to purchase from B under two contracts 300 tons of sugar to
be delivered at different dates. A having failed to take delivery under the
first contract, B claimed to rescind both contracts.
The Calcutta High Court held that as there was no refusal on the part of
A to perform his promise in its entirety within the meaning of Section 39,
B was not entitled to rescind the contract. The decision of the same court in
Schiller v Sooltan Chand emphasises the same point.
There was a contract for the sale of 200 tons of linseed oil in April
and May, to be paid for on delivery. Some deliveries were made and the
plaintiffs made part payment for the same withholding the balance for
adjustment of their claims. But the defendants, taking that as an anticipa-
tory repudiation, refused to make further supplies and the plaintiffs sued
them for the breach.
It was held that the withholding of a part payment under a bona fide
claim cannot be regarded as a refusal to perform the contract in its entirety.
At first sight these decisions seem to be at variance with the illustrations.
in Section 39. According to the illustrations if a singer agrees to sing at a
theatre for two nights in a week for a period of two months and then absents
herself on one night, the other party is at liberty to put an end to the con-
tract. Referring to the illustrations, GARTH CJ observed as follows:
That illustration is perhaps not a happy one, because it may lead to
misapprehension. The singer by willfully absenting herself, though on
one night only, did in fact refuse altogether to perform an integral and

essential part of her contract. By doing so she put it out of her power to
perform her contract in its entirety. But here the plaintiffs have never
refused to perform any part of their contract. They were willing to pay
the sum due as soon as their cross-claims were adjusted.43
Partial failure going to the root
Whether a partial failure goes to the root of the contract or not is a ques-
tion of fact in each case. In a case before the Supreme Court:**
There was a contract for the sale of B Twill and Hessian deliverable in
the months of April, May and June. April and May quota of B Twill and
April quota of Hessian were delivered and they were accepted and paid.
for by the buyer. For the rest the sellers sent to the buyers delivery orders
on certain mills asking them to take goods directly from the mills. The
orders reached the buyers through the hands of several middlemen. They
contained conditions different from the contract and required the buyer
to take goods subject to the conditions imposed by the mills. The buyer
refused to accept. The court held that the sellers were in breach of their
contract.45
A contract was made for supply of human albumin. Deliveries were to
be effected within the course of one year by monthly instalments. Time of
delivery was to be important. No monthly quantity was fixed. Any shortfall
in one month could be made up in subsequent months. The sellers failed.
Nothing resulted from correspondence between the parties. The buyer ulti-
mately repudiated the contract. He was allowed to recover damages for the
breach of the whole of the contract. It was one contract and not a conglom-
eration of separate contracts. 46
Where a party abandons a project before its completion, he is, of course,
liable to pay the cost and expense of completion. But whether he would be
entitled to recover anything for the actual work done depends upon a num-
ber of factors. One of them is that if the aggrieved party had an option to
reject the work but nevertheless accepted it in its partial state, he would be
bound to pay to the other an amount worked out on the basis of quantum
meruit. Things may be different where there is no such option. In a case of
this kind:47

der refused to accept the property because it measured less than what was represented. The
Government accordingly cancelled the auction and realised much greater price at reaction.

Anticipatory breach 463
A building contractor had done a little more than half the work for
which he received part payment. He informed the owner that he had no
money and could not go on with the work. The owner finished the build-
ing himself using the building materials which the contractor had left on
the ground.
The judgment of the court was that the contractor was entitled to get the
value of the materials so used but not to any amount for working. He had
abandoned the contract. The owner completed and occupied whatever he
found on the ground. That could not be regarded as accepting or enjoying
the benefit of the work done by the contractor. The claim for quantum mer-
uit was not justified.
Where the contract is for work and labour and the completion of the
entire work is not a condition precedent, payment would have to be made
for the work actually done. In a case of this kind:
The contract was to decorate a flat and to provide it with some fur-
niture. The payment was to be net cash as the work proceeded and the
balance on completion. The owner paid something more than half the
contract money and moved into his flat and used the furniture. He refused
to pay the balance money saying that there was bad workmanship and
faulty design. The official referee reported that there had been a sufficient
compliance with the contract and that the owner was bound to pay the
whole amount less the cost remedying the defects which he worked out
to be £56, roughly about 13 per cent of the total value of the contract.
The court did not interfere with the work of the referee. It was not a com-
posite contract like a building or work project. It was more in the nature of
a labour contract. The payment had to be measured by the amount of work
done.48
A contract was awarded for four laning of a road on "build, operate,
transfer" basis. The awarding authority terminated the contract on the con-
tractor's failure to provide financial guarantee as required under the contract
within the stipulated time. It was an essential term relating to the eligibility
of the contractor. The court said that the action in terminating the contract
could not be faulted with."
Aggrieved party's liability to offer restitution
The aggrieved party may, after putting an end to the contract, bring an
action for damages for breach, but he will be bound under Section 64 to

(1775-1802) All ER Rep 159 (KB). The payment was promised for working as second mate for
the whole of the voyage. The mate died en route and, therefore, could not complete the voyage.
No recovery in terms of part payment on quantum meruit basis was allowed. See also Bolton
v Mahadeva, (1972) 1 WLR 1009 (CA), where a contract for central heating of a house at a
cost of £560 was completed in such a way that it required £174 to put it right. This was held
to be not a substantial compliance.

restore to the other party the benefits he might have received under the con-
tract. This has been so held by the Privy Council in Muralidhar Chatterjee
v International Film Co Ltd. 50
The defendants, a firm of film importers, agreed with the plaintiffs to
supply them films at the rate of about one in a month. The plaintiffs were
to pay them a fixed amount for rent and, of course, some other charges.
One film was supplied and a sum of Rs 2000 was paid against it, but on
account of exhibition difficulties, the film was returned to the defend-
ants. Subsequently another sum of Rs 2000 was paid against which no
film was supplied. The plaintiffs wrote to the defendants that on account
of delay and breach of contract, all business dealings would be stopped.
The defendants accepted this repudiation and plaintiffs sued them for the
refund of their money.
It was held that the amount was refundable under Section 64, subject, of
course, to the right of the defendant to claim damages for the breach. The
case was referred back to the High Court for the determination of dam-
ages. Explaining the relationship between Sections 39 and 64, Sir GEORGE
RANKIN said: "The contract which may be 'put an end to' under Section 39
is 'voidable'. The right to recover damages in cases where the contract has
been rendered 'voidable' by the wrongful act of a party thereto and has been
rescinded by the other party accordingly is a right expressly conferred by
the statute. But the right to damages is no objection to the application of
Section 64 to cases of rescission of contract under Section 39 and the liabil-
ity to make restitution attaches to the party putting an end to the contract
under Section 39."
Referring to the money paid under the contract his Lordship said: "The
money was paid by the plaintiff in part discharge of the consideration or
to become due to them from him under the contract. It was a benefit or
advantage received under the contract which the defendants were bound to
restore, though they may set off against the plaintiff's claim such damage as
they had sustained. The fact that the money had been spent by the defend-
ants for the purposes of the contract was wholly immaterial."si

Damages for breach 465
court said that forfeiture of the whole of the deposit was disproportionate to
any loss that could have been caused by breach of the contract. 52
DAMAGES FOR BREACH [Ss. 73-74]
A contract is not a property. It is only a promise supported by some con-
sideration upon which either the remedy of specific performance or that of
damages is available. The party who is injured by the breach of a contract
may bring an action for damages. 54 "Damages" means compensation in
terms of money for the loss suffered by the injured party. Burden lies on the
injured party to prove his loss. 55 Every action for damages raises two prob-
lems. The first is the problem of "remoteness of damage" and the second.
that of "measure of damages".
Remoteness of damage
Every breach of contract upsets many a settled expectation of the injured
party. He may feel the consequences for a long time and in a variety of
ways. A person contracts to supply to a shopkeeper pure mustard oil, but
52. Sagar Vision Advertising v East Coast Rly, AIR 2015 NOC 349 (Ori).
53. Sunrise Associates v Govt of NCT of Delhi, (2006) 5 SCC 603: AIR 2006 SC 1908.
54. This is the only remedy which the Contract Act affords. Some other remedies are afforded by
the Specific Relief Act, 1963, e.g., an injunction to prevent breach or specific enforcement of
the contract, i.e. an action for specific recovery of the thing promised to be sold. P.R. & Co
v Bhagwandas, ILR (1909) 34 Bom 192; Finlay Muir & Co v Radhakissen Gopikissen, ILR
(1909) 36 Cal 736. Specific recovery is not allowed when the thing in question is freely availa-
ble in the market. The injured party should meet his requirement by purchasing elsewhere and
then claim damages for the difference in prices. This approach was adopted by the Supreme
Court in State Bank of Saurashtra v P.N.B., (2001) 5 SCC 751: AIR 2001 SC 2412, the order
for recovery of securities was not upheld. There was the alternative prayer for damages. The
purchaser had already paid the price to the bank. The latter was directed to refund the money
with a reasonable amount of compensation. Gunvantlal Ratanchand v Rameshbhai P. Patel,
(2001) 2 GCD 1518 (Guj), the original claim was for specific performance. That being not
available, an abrupt shift to claim for damages without any prior pleading and proof of loss
was not allowed. C. Panduranga Rao v Shyamala Rao, 1999 AIHC 3715 (AP), specific recov-
ery of property not ordered in favour of a person who did not pay nor showed his readiness
and willingness to pay. Data Access India Ltd v MTNL, (2006) 126 DLT 617, writ remedy
is generally not allowed because every breach of contract gives rise to a number of factual
questions like meaning of breach, remoteness of damage, etc. This case involved multiparty
arrangement involving a number of bank guarantees. City Municipal Council v S.A. Lateef
and Co, AIR 2004 Kant HCR 3032, the claimant has to show breach on the part of the other
party. The plaintiff here complained that sub-standard machinery was supplied to him, but
even so he accepted delivery, no expert opinion taken, hence no evidence of any manufactur-
ing defect. Radheshyam v Lalchand, (2005) 4 Mah LJ 441, sale of property, the buyer agreed
that he would manage permission of competent Authority but nothing was done by him in
that respect up to the time that the seller resold to another, the first buyer not allowed to sue
for specific performance.

quantum of damages was not proved, the case could not stand. ONGC Ltd v Saw Pipes Ltd,

he sends impure stuff, which is a breach. The oil is seized by an inspector
and destroyed. The shopkeeper is arrested, prosecuted and convicted. He
suffers the loss of oil, the loss of profits to be gained on selling it, the loss
of social prestige and of business reputation, not to speak of the time and
money and energy wasted on defence and the mental agony and torture of
the prosecution."
Thus, theoretically the consequences of a breach may be endless, but there
must be an end to liability. The defendant cannot be held liable for all that
follows from his breach. There must be a limit to liability and beyond that
limit the damage is said to be too remote and, therefore, irrecoverable." The
problem is where to draw the line.
The rule in “Hadley v Baxendale"
A very noble attempt was made as early as (1854) in the well-known case
of Hadley v Baxendale" to solve the problem by laying down certain rules.
The plaintiffs carried on an extensive business as miller. Their mill was
stopped by a breakage of the crankshaft by which the mill was worked.
The defendants, a firm of carriers, were engaged to carry the shaft to the
manufacturers as a pattern for a new one. The plaintiffs' servant told
the defendants that the mill was stopped, and that the shaft must be sent
immediately. But the defendants delayed the delivery by some neglect,
and the consequence was, that the plaintiffs did not receive the new shaft
for several days after they would otherwise have done. The action was
brought for the loss of profits which would have been made during the
period of the delay.
ALDERSON B laid down the following rule:
Now we think the proper rule in such a case as the present is this:
Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has bro-
ken, the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of
such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be
considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of
things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be
supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time

Damages for breach 467
On the basis of this principle the defendants were held not liable for the
loss of profits, because in the great multitude of cases of millers sending off
broken shafts for repair, it does not follow in the ordinary circumstances
that the mill is stopped. Even though it was pointed out that the mill was
stopped there could have existed several reasons for the stopping of the mill.
The fact that the mill was out of action for want of the shaft was a special
circumstance affecting the plaintiff's mill and the same should have been
pointed out to the defendants in clear terms. It should also have been com-
municated that the plaintiffs would have suffered unreasonable loss by way
of delay.
This decision has always been taken as laying down two rules.
(i) General damages
General damages are those which arise naturally in the usual course
of things from the breach itself. Another mode of putting this is that the
defendant is liable for all that which naturally happens in the usual course
of things after the breach."
(ii) Special damages
Special damages are those which arise on account of the unusual circum-
stances affecting the plaintiff. They are not recoverable unless the special
circumstances were brought to the knowledge of the defendant so that the
possibility of the special loss was in the contemplation of the parties.
No recovery of special damages when special circumstances
not known
Lack of knowledge of special circumstances once again prevented recov-
ery of special damages in Horne v Midland Railway Co.60
The plaintiffs, a firm of shoe manufacturers, contracted to supply a
quantity of shoes to a firm in London for the use of the French army at
an unusually high price. The shoes were to be delivered by the 3rd of
February. They consigned the shoes with the defendant railway company
telling them that the consignment must reach by the 3rd, but not that -
there was anything exceptional in the contract. The consignment was
delayed and the consignee refused to accept it. The plaintiffs had to sell
them in the market at about half their contract price.
In the action against the defendants for the delay in delivering the
shoes, they paid into the court a sufficient sum to cover any ordinary loss.

Smith, The Rule in Hadley v Baxendale (1900) 16 LQR 275; Shriram Pistons and Rings Ltd
v Buckeye Machines (P) Ltd, AIR 2007 NOC 1844 (Del), damages can be claimed for breach
of contract if not completed even within the extended period. Extension of time is not a waiver
of all rights.

occasioned thereby, but the plaintiffs further claimed the difference between
the price at which they had contracted to sell the shoes and the price which
they ultimately fetched. But it was held that this was a damage of an excep-
tional nature and it could not be supposed to have been in the contemplation
of the railway company when it contracted to convey the goods by the 3rd.
For the same reason loss of profits was not allowed to be recovered in
British Columbia Saw Mill Co v Nettleship."
The parts of a saw mill machinery, packed in cases, were given to the
defendant, a carrier, for carriage to Vancouver. One of the cases was lost
and consequently a complete mill could not be erected and operated. The
plaintiff claimed the cost of lost machinery and the profits which could
have been earned if the mill had been installed in time.
The court allowed only the cost in Vancouver of the articles lost. The
loss of profits to be made from the intended use of the mill was held to
be too remote. WILLES J gave the following illustration in support of this
conclusion:
Take the case of a barrister on his way to practice at the Calcutta Bar,
where he may have a large number of briefs awaiting him; through the
default of the Peninsular and Oriental Company he is detained in Egypt
or in the Suez boat, and consequently sustains great loss; is the company
to be responsible for that, because they happened to know the purpose for
which the traveller was going?2
WILLES J further pointed out that special damages are recoverable only
when the special purpose of the contract "is brought home to the party
sought to be charged, under such circumstances that he must know that the
person he contracts with reasonably believes that he accepts the contract
with the special condition attached to it."63
Special circumstances already within knowledge of contract breaker
But in the subsequent case of Simpson v London & North Western
Railway Co64 the above suggestion was qualified to this extent that if the
special circumstances are already within the knowledge of the party break-
ing the contract, the formality of communicating them to him may not be
necessary.

indication of the importance of a volume. Compare this with Hydraulic Engg Co v McHaffie

machine about which he knew that his buyer was under a contract to supply to a third party,
he was held liable for the plaintiff's loss of profit.

Damages for breach 469
The plaintiff was in the habit of exhibiting samples of his implements
at cattle shows. He delivered his samples to the defendant company for
consignment to the show grounds at New Castle. The consignment note
said: "must be at New Castle on Monday certain". But no mention was
made of the intention to place the goods in the exhibition. On account of
negligence the goods reached only after the show was over.
But as the company was already aware of the object of carrying the
goods there, the plaintiff was allowed to recover not only the loss of freight
but also the profits he would have made by placing the goods at the show.
COCKBURN CJ said:
The principle is now well-settled that, whenever either the object of
the sender is specially brought to the notice of the carrier, or the circum-
stances are known to the carrier, from which the object ought in reason
to be inferred, so that the object may be taken to have been in the con-
templation of both parties, damages may be recovered for the natural
consequences of the failure of that object.
In another cases a fragmentiser was purchased by the plaintiff under
a hire-purchase agreement. Its rotor broke down before normal life. The
plaintiff had no means to replace it at cash price. He had to arrange it again
at a hire-purchase price and claimed the same as damages. The defendant
contended that the plaintiff had to pay hire-purchase price because of his
lack of means. This contention was rejected. The fact that in the present cir-
cumstances of economy business has to depend upon hire-purchase system,
was held to be within the contemplation of parties.
Relationship between two rules re-examined
The relationship between the rules was re-examined in Victoria Laundry
(Windsor) Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd Lord ASQUITH worked out a
number of propositions from a consideration of the leading authorities. The
substance of the propositions is as follows: Only such loss is recoverable
as was at the time of the contract reasonably foreseeable as liable to result
from the breach. Foreseeability depends upon knowledge. Accordingly what
was at that time reasonably foreseeable depends upon the knowledge then
possessed by the parties or, at all events, by the party who later commits
the breach. For this purpose, knowledge "possessed" is of two kinds: one
imputed, and the other actual. Every one as a reasonable person, is taken
to know the "ordinary course of things" and consequently to know what
loss is liable to result from a breach of the contract in that ordinary course.
This is the subject-matter of the "first rule" in Hadley v Baxendale. But to
this knowledge which the defendant is assumed to possess must be added
65. B.P. Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No. 2), (1981) 1 WLR 232 (CA). Where the lessor
knew the purpose for which the lessee required the premises, he was held liable for the loss of
that purpose during the delayed period. Jacques v Miller, (1877) LR 6 Ch D 153.

[S. 73]
his actual knowledge of the special circumstances of the case showing the
possibility of more loss arising from the breach. Such a case attracts the
operation of the "second rule" so as to make the additional loss recoverable.
The judgment emphasises that both the rules are based upon the principle
of "foreseeability". This gives a "new look for Hadley v Baxendale". Now
it has been clearly so stated by DIPLOCK LJ in C. Czarnikow Ltd v Koufos.67
That there are not two rules formulated in Hadley v Baxendale but
only two different instances of the application of a single rule.
Similarly, SALMON LJ observed:68
Any damage actually caused by a breach of any kind of contract is
recoverable provided that when the contract was made such damage was
reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach.
The facts of Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd
were as follows:
A firm of launderers and dyers wanted to expand their business and,
therefore, ordered with the defendants for the supply of a boiler of much
greater capacity. The defendants agreed to deliver on June 5, 1946, but
delayed delivery until November 8. The plaintiffs claimed as damages
the loss of profits which would have been earned if their business was
expanded in time as there were at the time unique business opportunities.
The court allowed £110 as general damages but disallowed loss of prof-
its. On appeal the case was referred to an official referee to determine what
damages, in addition to £110, should be allowed on the basis of the knowl-
edge then possessed by the parties. ASQUITH J said "that no supplier who
has promised delivery of a boiler of an unusually large size by a particular
date, with knowledge that it was to be put into use immediately on delivery
can reasonably contend that he could not foresee that loss of business would
be likely to result from the delay".
To the same effect is the decision of the House of Lords in Monarch SS
Co Ltd v Karlshamns Oljefabriker (A/B).
A British vessel was chartered in April 1939, by a British company for
carrying cargo of soyabeans from Manchuria to a port in Sweden. But
owing to delay caused by the vessel's unseaworthiness, she did not reach
that port before the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Germany.
Consequently, the ship was prohibited from going to its destination and
ordered to discharge at Glasgow. The plaintiff, who needed soyabeans
for their business as they were not locally available, incurred expenses in
forwarding them in neutral ships.

Damages for breach 471
It was held that the loss was due to unseaworthiness of the ship and the
defendants were liable for it, because, in view of the international situation,
they should have foreseen that war might break out and cause loss or diver-
sion of the vessel.
House of Lords restore original vitality of two rules
The interpretation put upon the Hadley v Baxendale principles by the
Court of Appeal in the Victoria Laundry case had virtually replaced the
expression "contemplation of the parties" with "reasonable man's fore-
sight" and this being the principle in the law of tort also, hardly any distinc-
tion remained between tort and contract principles relating to remoteness
of damages. But the House of Lords in their decision in the Heron II, The
Koufos v C. Czarnikow Ltd" have restored the distinction by again laying
emphasis upon the "contemplation of the parties".
A vessel was chartered to proceed to Constanza, there to load a cargo
of three thousand tons of sugar; and to carry it to Basrah, or, at the char-
terers' option, to Jeddah. The vessel left in time. A reasonably accurate
prediction of the length of the voyage was twenty days. But the vessel in
breach of contract made deviation which caused a delay of nine days. If
the vessel had arrived in time, the charterer would have obtained roughly
£1 more per ton than what he actually obtained. The shipowner knew
that there was a market for sugar at Basrah, but did not know that the
charterer wanted to sell the sugar promptly on arrival. The shipowner
also knew that sugar prices were apt to fluctuate from day to day, but had
no reason to suppose that fluctuation would be downwards rather than
upwards. He was sued for the loss due to fall in market price. The umpire
allowed this loss. But the trial judge allowed as damages only the interest
on the value of the cargo during the period of delay. The Court of Appeal
reversed this order and restored the award of the umpire and the House of
Lords unanimously affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal.
Lord REID emphasised that the rule (or rules) laid down in Hadley v
Baxendale and which for over a century have been used for determining
remoteness of damage should not be subjected to an interpretation which
would result in a contrary decision of that case. His Lordship laid particu-
lar emphasis upon the fact that in that case the loss of profit was caused
by the delay, but even so the defendant was held not liable not because the
loss was not forseeable but because as ALDERSON B put it "it is obvious
that, in the great multitude of cases of millers sending off broken shafts to
third persons by a carrier under ordinary circumstances, such consequences
would not, in all probability, have occurred...". ALDERSON B clearly did
not and could not mean that it was not reasonably foreseeable that delay
might stop the resumption of work in the mill. He merely said that in the

great multitude-which can be taken to mean the great majority-of cases
it would not happen. He was not distinguishing between results which were
foreseeable or unforeseeable, but between results which were merely likely
because they would happen in the great majority of cases, and results which
were unlikely because they would only happen in a small minority of cases.
He clearly meant that a result which will happen in the great majority of
cases should fairly and reasonably be regarded as having been in the contem-
plation of the parties, but that a result which, though foreseeable as a sub-
stantial possibility would happen only in a small minority of cases should
not be regarded as having been in their contemplation.
Applying this test to the facts his Lordship concluded that having regard
to the knowledge available to the shipowner when he made the contract,
any reasonable person in his position would have realised that such loss was
sufficiently likely to result from the breach of contract thus making it proper
to hold that the loss followed naturally from the breach or that the loss of
that kind would have been within his contemplation.
Lord HODSON also presented the same view of Hadley v Baxendale.
I find guidance in the use of the expression in the great multitude of
cases which is to be found in more than one place in the judgment in
Hadley v Baxendale. It indicates that the damages recoverable for breach
of contract are such as flow naturally in most cases from the breach,
whether under ordinary circumstances or from special circumstances
due to the knowledge either in the possession of or communicated to
the defendants. This expression throws light on the whole field of dam-
ages for breach of contract, and points to a different approach from that
taken in tort cases. The approach in tort will normally be different sim-
ply because the relationship of the parties is different. The claim against
the tortfeaser who has inflicted tortious damage is not the same as the
claim against an opposite party for breach of contract, for the latter claim
depends on the contemplation of the parties to the contract and question
of remoteness as such does not arise. Consequently, liability in tort may
often be of a wider kind.
Physical injury resulting from breach
The wisdom of the distinction between tort and contract principles, at
any rate in reference to physical injury caused by the breach, has again
been questioned by Lord DENNING in Parsons (H) (Livestock) Ltd v Uttley
Ingham & Co Ltd."
72. 1978 QB 791: (1977) 3 WLR 990 (CA); H. Parsons (Livestock) Ltd v Uttley Ingham & Co,

other animals infected, seller liable for the loss of livestock and not only for the animal sold.

Damages for breach 473
The plaintiffs were pig farmers and they purchased from the defend-
ants a large hopper for storage of pig nuts. They had already purchased
one from them earlier and it was serving them well. The hopper was
ventilated at the top, but the ventilator had to be kept closed and was
to be opened after the hopper was installed at the plaintiff's farm. The
defendants negligently forgot to open it and the plaintiffs could not know,
it being too high. The nuts stored in the hopper became mouldy and with-
out any knowledge of the danger, they were served to the pigs. They suf-
fered from a rare type of intestinal infection and 254 of them perished.
The defendants were held liable for the loss of the pigs but not for loss of
profits from future sales of pigs. The loss of pigs was a physical injury and
the court, feeling that for such injuries the principle should be the same as
in tort, the defendants were liable for all damage which could reasonably
have been foreseen at the date of the breach as a possible consequence of the
breach. The loss of profits was an economic loss and the defendants were
not liable for it because it could not have been within the party's contempla-
tion at the time of the contract. Thus, the opinion of the Court of Appeal
is that Hadley v Baxendale should be confined to economic loss and for
physical injuries the principle of foreseeability which operates in tort should
apply.73
Damages for negligent survey report
The applicable principles have been stated by the Court of Appeal in
Watts v Morrow. The plaintiffs purchased a country home for £177,500
in reliance on a survey prepared by the defendant surveyor in which he
stated that overall dwelling house was sound, stable and in good condition
.although there were minor defects which could be dealt with as part of ordi-
nary ongoing maintenance and repair. After taking possession the plain-
tiffs discovered substantial defects not mentioned in the defendant's report
which required urgent repair, including the renewal of the roof, windows
and floor boards. The plaintiffs carried out repairs to remedy the defects at
a cost of £33,961 and sought to recover this amount. The surveyor admit-
ted liability but pleaded that it should not be more than £15,000, being the
difference between the price paid and the price that the home was worth if
the defects were taken into account. The court held that the proper meas-
ure of damages was the diminution in value rather than the cost of repairs.
Applying the principle of restitution to the terms of the contract, the amount
required to put the plaintiff in the position in which he would have been if
the surveyor had carried out the contract of survey properly was the amount
by which he was caused to pay more than the value of the house in its true
condition.

CASE PILOT
Section 73 of the Contract Act
[S. 73]
The same principles are applicable in India. The Privy Council, for
example, observed in A.K.A.S. Jamal v Moolla Dawood Sons & Co" that
Section 73 is declaratory of the common law as to damages. Similarly,
PATANJALI SASTRI J (afterwards CJ) of the Supreme Court observed in
Pannalal Jankidas v Mohanlal "that the party in breach must make com-
pensation in respect of the direct consequences flowing from the breach and
not in respect of loss or damage indirectly or remotely caused".77 The section.
provides:
S. 73. Compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of con-
tract. When a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach
is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the contract, compensa-
tion for any loss or damage caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the
usual course of things from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they
made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach of it.
Such compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or
damage sustained by reason of the breach.
Compensation for failure to discharge obligation resembling those cre-
ated by contract. When an obligation resembling those created by contract
has been incurred and has not been discharged, any person injured by the fail-
ure to discharge it is entitled to receive the same compensation from the party
in default, as if such person had contracted to discharge it and had broken his
contract.
Explanation.-In estimating the loss or damage arising from a breach of con-
tract, the means which existed of remedying the inconvenience caused by the
non-performance of the contract must be taken into account.
Illustrations
[Market price criterion].- (a) A contracts to sell and deliver 50 maunds of saltpetre to B,
at a certain price to be paid on delivery. A breaks his promise. B is entitled to receive from A,
by way of compensation, the sum, if any, by which the contract price falls short of the price
for which B might have obtained 50 maunds of saltpetre of like quality at the time when the
saltpetre ought to have been delivered.
[Extra cost of hiring alternative ship].-(b) A hires B's ship to go to Bombay, and there takes
on board, on the first of January, a cargo, which, A is to provide and to bring it to Calcutta, the
freight to be paid when earned. B's ship does not go to Bombay, but A has opportunities of
procuring suitable conveyance for the cargo upon terms as advantageous as those on which

77. Similarly, KANIA CJ of the Supreme Court observed in Pannalal Jankidas v Mohanlal, AIR
1951 SC 144: 1950 SCR 979: (1951) 21 Comp Cas 1 that the rule stated by ALDERSON B has
consistently been accepted as correct; the only difficulty has been in applying it. The Supreme
Court held in Aslhing v L.S. John, (1984) 1 SCC 205: AIR 1984 SC 988 that repudiation
by one party puts an end to the contract although the right to sue for damages survives.
Accordingly, the disqualification by virtue of a Government contract of holding an office of
profit under the State would end as soon as the contractor gives up the contract.

he had chartered the ship. A avails himself of those opportunities, but is put to trouble and
expense in doing so. A is entitled to receive compensation from B in respect of such trouble
and expense.
[Seller's loss on resale].-(c) A contracts to buy of B, at a stated price, 50 maunds of rice,
no time being fixed for delivery. A afterwards informs B that he will not accept the rice if
tendered to him. B is entitled to receive from A, by way of compensation, the amount, if any,
by which the contract price exceeds that which B can obtain for the rice at the time when A
informs B that he will not accept it.
[Ship seller's loss on resale of ship].-(d) A contracts to buy B's ship for 60,000 rupees, but
breaks his promise. A must pay to B, by way of compensation, the excess, if any, of the con-
tract price over the price which B can obtain for the ship at the time of the breach of promise.
[Loss of value caused by delay in transit].-(e) A, the owner of a boat, contracts with B to
take a cargo of jute to Mirzapur, for sale at that place, starting on a specified day. The boat,
owing to some avoidable cause, does not start at the time appointed, whereby the arrival
of the cargo at Mirzapur is delayed beyond the time when it would have arrived if the boat
had sailed according to the contract. After that date, and before the arrival of the cargo,
the price of jute falls. The measure of the compensation payable to B by A is the difference
between the price which B could have obtained for the cargo at Mirzapur at the time when
it would have arrived if forwarded in due course, and its market price at the time when it
actually arrived.
[Deficient house repairing service].- (f) A contracts to repair B's house in a certain manner,
and receive payment in advance. A repairs the house, but not according to contract. B is enti-
tled to recover from A the cost of making the repairs that conform to the contract.
[Difference in hiring charges of ship].-(g) A contracts to let his ship to B for a year, from the
first of January, for a certain price. Freights rise, and on the first of January, the hire obtain-
able for the ship is higher than the contract price. A breaks his promise. He must pay to B,
by way of compensation, a sum equal to the difference between the contract price and the
price for which B could hire a similar ship for a year on and from the first of January.
[Buyer's breach, difference between market and contract prices].-(h) A contracts to supply
B with a certain quantity of iron at a fixed price, being a higher price than that for which A
could procure and deliver the iron. B wrongfully refuses to receive the iron. B must pay to A,
by way of compensation, the difference between the contract price of the iron and the sum
for which A could have obtained and delivered it.
[Delay caused by carrier, Hadley v Baxendale module].-(i) A delivers to B, a common car-
rier, a machine, to be conveyed without delay, to A's mill, informing B that his mill is stopped
for want of the machine. B unreasonably delays the delivery of the machine, and A in conse-
quence, loses a profitable contract with the Government. A is entitled to receive from B, by
way of compensation, the average amount of profit which would have been made by the
working of the mill during the time that delivery of it was delayed, but not the loss sustained
through the loss of the Government contract.
[Knowledge of resale, loss of profit].-(j) A, having contracted with B to supply B with 1000
tons of iron at 100 rupees a ton, to be delivered at a stated time, contracts with C for the pur-
chase of 1000 tons of iron at 80 rupees a ton, telling C that he does so for the purpose of per-
forming his contract with B. Cfails to perform his contract with A, who cannot procure other
iron, and B, in consequence, rescinds the contract. C must pay to A 20,000 rupees, being the
profit which A would have made by the performance of his contract with B.
[Where no knowledge of resale agreement, no more than market difference recovera-
ble]. (k) A contracts with B to make and deliver to B, by a fixed day, for a specified price a
certain piece of machinery. A does not deliver the piece of machinery at the time specified,
and, in consequence of this, B is obliged to procure another at a higher price than that which
he was to have paid to A, and is prevented from performing a contract which B had made
with a third person at the time of his contract with A (but which had not been then commu-

nicated to A), and is compelled to make compensation for breach of that contract. A must
pay to B, by way of compensation, the difference between the contract price of the piece of
machinery and the sum paid by B for another, but not the sum paid by B to the third person
by way of compensation.
[Building contract].-(/) A, a builder, contracts to erect and finish a house by the first of
January, in order that B may give possession of it at that time to C, to whom B has contracted
to let it. A is informed of the contract between B and C. A builds the house so badly that,
before the first of January, it falls down and has to be rebuilt by B, who, in consequence, loses
the rent which he was to have received from C, and is obliged to make compensation to C
for the breach of his contract. A must make compensation to B for the cost of rebuilding the
house, for the rent lost, and for the compensation made to C.78
[Breach of warranty as to quality of goods].-(m) A sells certain merchandise to B, warrant-
ing it to be of a particular quality, and B, in reliance upon this warranty, sells it to C with a sim-
ilar warranty. The goods prove to be not according to the warranty, and B becomes liable to
pay C a sum of money by way of compensation. B is entitled to be reimbursed this sum by A.
[Default in payment of money].-(n) A contracts to pay a sum of money to B on a day spec-
ified. A does not pay the money on that day; B, in consequence of not receiving the money
on that day, is unable to pay his debts, and is totally ruined. A is not liable to make good to
B anything except the principal sum he contracted to pay, together with interest up to the
day of payment."
[Market price and not loss of profit].-(o) A contracts to deliver 50 maunds of saltpetre to B
on the first of January, at a certain price. B afterwards, before the first of January, contracts to
sell the saltpetre to C at a price higher than the market price of the first of January. A breaks
his promise. In estimating the compensation payable by A to B, the market price of the 1
January, and not the profit which would have arisen to B from the sale to C, is to be taken
into account.
[Defaulting seller not liable for closure of mill].--(p) A contracts to sell and deliver 500 bales
of cotton to B on a fixed day. A knows nothing of B's mode of conducting his business. A
breaks his promise, and B, having no cotton, is obliged to close his mill. A is not responsible
to B for the loss caused to B by the closing of the mill.
[Defaulting seller not liable for loss of season].--(q) A contracts to sell and deliver to B, on
the first of January, certain cloth which B intends to manufacture into caps of a particular
kind, for which there is no demand, except at that season. The cloth is not delivered till after
the appointed time, and too late to be used that year in making caps, B is entitled to receive
from A, by way of compensation, the difference between the contract price of the cloth
and its market price at the time of delivery, but not the profits which he expected to obtain
by making caps, nor the expenses which he has been put to in making preparation for the
manufacture.
[Carrier of passengers causing delay].-(r) A, a ship-owner, contracts with B to convey him
from Calcutta to Sydney in A's ship, sailing on the first of January, and B pays to A, by way of
deposit, one-half of his passage-money. The ship does not sail on the first of January, and
B, after being in consequence, detained in Calcutta for some time, and thereby put to some
expense, proceeds to Sydney in another vessel, and, in consequence, arriving too late in Syd-
ney, loses a sum of money. A is liable to repay to B his deposit, with interest, and the expense

Section 73 incorporates two rules of "Hadley v Baxendale"
The section declares that compensation is not to be given for any remote
or indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach. The section
also provides that the same principles will apply where there has been a
breach of a quasi-contractual obligation."
The section thus clearly lays down two rules. Compensation is recovera-
ble for any loss or damage-
(i) arising naturally in the usual course of things from the breach, or
(ii) which the parties knew at the time of the contract as likely to result
from the breach.
The first rule is "objective" as it makes the liability to depend upon a
reasonable man's foresight of the loss that will naturally result from the
breach of the contract. The second rule is "subjective" as, according to it,
the extent of liability depends upon the knowledge of the parties at the time
of the contract about the probable result of the breach.82

for recovering dues of cane growers as arrears of land revenue, he contracted to supply sugar
but failed to do so. The other party could not sue him. Suit could lie against the corporation
into which the sick sugar mill was merged.
81. The right of action depends upon proof of breach. In State of Karnataka v Shree Rameshwara
Rice Mills, (1987) 2 SCC 160: AIR 1987 SC 1359, the contract provided that damages would
be assessed by the Government and it was held that the Government was not the proper party
to determine whether a breach had taken place or not. To the same effect, Vairappa Thevar

[S. 73]
The burden of proof lies on the plaintiff to show that damage has been
sustained and what shall be the measure of converting the loss into money,
A claim for damages becomes liable to be rejected where this burden is not
discharged."
Liability in ordinary cases
The extent of liability in ordinary cases is what may be foreseen by "the
hypothetical reasonable man", as arising naturally in the usual course of
things. One illustration is the decision of the Madras High Court in Madras
Railway Co v Govinda Rau.4
The plaintiff, who was a tailor, delivered a sewing machine and some
cloth to the defendant railway company to be sent to a place where he
expected to carry on his business with special profit by reason of a forth-
coming festival. Through the fault of the company's servants the goods
were delayed in transmission and were not delivered until some days after
the conclusion of the festival. The plaintiff had given no notice to the
company of his special purpose.
He claimed as damages the expenses of travelling up to the place of festi-
val and of staying there and the loss of profits which he would have earned.
The court held that the damages claimed were too remote. All of these were
due to the frustration of the special purpose and that was not known to the
company. Fazal Ilahi v East Indian Rly Co is another illustration of the
same kind.
The plaintiff delivered to the defendant railway company's parcel
office at Cawnpore four boxes of Chinese crackers for consignment to
Allahabad where he needed them for a festival on 5th June, but he did
not disclose the purpose. The company's servants considering it unsafe to
send crackers by parcel train, actually sent them by goods train and they
reached only after the conclusion of the festival. The company required
him to take delivery on payment of additional freight, which he refused to
pay and, therefore, the company sold the goods at a nominal price.
He sued the railway company. The court disallowed the claim for profits
which would have been made, as the plaintiff's special purpose was not

their security charges.

ering the cost price of his goods sold by the company in breach of the con-
tract and Rs 100 as damages and other incidental expenses.
Even where the goods are altogether lost in transit, the carrier is not liable.
for the loss of profits which would have been made by selling the goods at
their destination.87
Proof of loss is necessary
In a claim for general damages the plaintiff has to assert that he has
suffered some loss but for the purpose of claiming special damages he has
specifically to plead and prove that he has sustained such special loss. In
a claim of compensation for damage to consignment, no details as to loss.
were mentioned in the plaint. It is necessary that some loss should be shown
by evidence. The mere fact that the carrier admitted damage was held to be
not sufficient to entitle the consignee to obtain a decree for compensation
without proof of actual loss.
Building contracts
Since works and building contracts are undertaken only with a view to
earning profits, the party committing the breach would be liable for the con-
tractor's loss in terms of expected profits. The Supreme Court came to this
conclusion in A.T. Brij Paul Singh v State of Gujarat."
A Government building contract was allotted through tenders. It fell to
the share of a Poona-based contractor who transported his mobile work-
shop from there to work site at Rajkot in Gujarat. He had done only a
part of the work when the Government unjustifiably repudiated the con-
tract. The contractor sued for loss of profits.
It was not disputed before the Supreme Court that where in a works con-
tract the party entrusting the work commits breach, the contractor would
be entitled to claim damages for loss of profit which he expected from
the project. The court noted. an observation in Hudson's BUILDING AND
ENGINEERING CONTRACTS" that in major contracts subject to competitive

tender on a national basis, the evidence given in litigation on many occa-
sions suggests that the head office overheads and profit is between 3 to 7 per
cent of the total price of cost which is added to the tender. The court accord-
ingly allowed Rs 2 lakhs as compensation under the head "loss of profits"
over and above other claims."
In a contract for the construction of a swimming-pool, the depth of the
pool happened to be only 6 feet 9 inches whereas the building contract
required it to be 7 feet 6 inches and at the diving point it was not more than
six feet. This resulted in a claim for damages for defective construction. The
Trial Judge found that the pool was perfectly safe for diving and that the
shortfall in depth made no difference to the value of the pool. He also found
that it would cost about £21,000 to cure the defect by digging the pool
deeper. It was quite likely that even after receiving the above amount, the
owner might not spend on repair. He held that the appropriate measure of
damages was the difference in value between the pool as it was and the pool
as it should have been if the contract was properly performed and allowed
£2500. The Court of Appeal reversed this and allowed the full cost of cure.
But the House of Lords restored the decision of the trial judge.93
Some earlier cases on the subject were also decided either on the basis of
cost of cure or difference in value depending on whether in the circumstances
of the case, cure would be reasonable or whether recovery on the basis of
difference in value would be reasonable. The latter would be more reasona-
ble where the building, though defective, is nevertheless substantially useful.
The costs of rectification even if recovered, may not be so used."
An approach of this kind was also to be seen in a New York decision
where two principles were stated: "first, the cost of reinstatement is not the
appropriate measure of damages if the expenditure would be out of all pro-
portion to the goods to be obtained, and, secondly, the appropriate measure

inal award."95
Delay suffered by builder
The builder was required to complete the work within 18 months but by
reason of delays caused by the Department, it took 27 months to be com-
pleted. The builder suffered itemised damages which he proved by leading
oral evidence. The amount claimed being reasonable was decreed."
Scheme for allotment of plots
Damages for mental pain and anguish cannot be awarded in a case in
which there is a breach on the part of a development authority in delaying
the completion of the scheme. It is not a head of damages in ordinary com-
mercial contracts. The court, however, allowed interest at the rate of 12.
per cent on the refundable amount though there was no provision in the
contract to that effect. It was justifiable on equitable grounds. The brochure
of the scheme clearly excluded the liability of the authority to pay interest
in cases of refund of consideration. It was held that this clause would apply
only to cases in which the claimant himself has brought about the circum-
stances of refund.97
A works contract was rescinded on the ground that the contractor had
not completed within the stipulated time even 10 per cent of the works. But
evidence showed that the contract was improperly rescinded and, therefore,
it amounted to a breach of contract. The contractor claimed Rs 20,000 as
compensation, being 10 per cent of the value of the contract. The court said
that the contractor was entitled to claim damages for loss of profit which he
expected from the project. His claim was held to be fully justified. The High
Court erred in holding that the claim should have been based on actual loss
suffered."

Where full payment was received for the house but the same was not pro-

no particulars of his loss. He was allowed 18 per cent interest on the amount

Auction sale of property
The highest bidder was to make payment of a part of the consideration
money. But he could not do so even after extension of time. Subsequently he
himself surrendered his claim and asked for refund of his initial deposit. His
prayer that he should not be compelled to hand over the assets given to him
under the project to other tenderer was rejected, but forfeiture of his earnest
money was held to be arbitrary and illegal.100
Difference between market price and contract price
(sale and supply transactions)
In a sale transaction, damages are generally awarded on the basis of the
difference between the contract price and market price. If the seller defaults,
the buyer may have to buy elsewhere at an extra cost. If the buyer defaults,
the seller may have to make a forced sale which may bring him less money
than what he would have obtained under the contract. Such difference is
recoverable as damages. The fact that because of the seller's default, the
buyer could not carry out production in his factory and suffered losses,
such losses were held to be not recoverable being a remote consequence.
The buyer was under a duty to keep his loss to the minimum by buying his.
material elsewhere so as to keep his business going,101
The Supreme Court has been generally following these principles in its var-
ious decisions. One such decision is Murlidhar Chiranjilal v Harishchandra
Dwarkadas.102
There was a contract for supplying canvas to be consigned to Calcutta,
free on rail (f.o.r.) Kanpur. The transport and labour charges were to
be borne by the buyer. The seller failed to supply at Kanpur and the ques-
tion was whether damages were to be assessed according to Kanpur or
Calcutta prices and whether the seller was entitled to profits which he
could have made on resale at Calcutta.
WANCHOO J (afterwards CJ) held that the goods were deliverable at
Kanpur and, therefore, damages should be assessed according to the differ-
ence between contract and market prices at Kanpur, for that was the only

the seller and the buyer.

loss which would be said to have arisen naturally in the usual course of
things from the breach. The learned judge referred to two principles which
he considered to be well-settled. One is that as far as money can do it, the
aggrieved party is to be put in as good'a situation as if the contract had been.
performed. This is qualified by the second principle which imposes upon
the buyer the duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate the consequences of
the breach. These two principles also follow from the law as laid down in
Section 73 read with the Explanation therefor. Here the contract was to be
performed at Kanpur and, therefore, the buyer should have proved the dif-
ference in prices at Kanpur which he did not do and, accordingly the court
said: "On this state of the evidence it could not be said that any damage
naturally arose in the usual course of things."
The buyer contended that the seller knew that the goods were required
at Calcutta and, therefore, it was in his contemplation that the loss would
be suffered at Calcutta. He relied upon R.&H. Hall Ltd v W.H. Pim Junior
Co's Arbitration104 and Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd v Newman
Industries Ltds Distinguishing the present case from these, the learned
Judge observed:
They are cases of a special type; in one case the parties knew that
goods purchased were likely to be resold before delivery and therefore
any loss that by the breach of contract may eventually result may include
loss that may have been suffered by the buyers because of the failure to
honour the intermediate contract of resale made by them; in the other-
case, the goods were purchased by the party for his own business for a
particular purpose which the sellers were expected to know and if any
loss resulted from the delay in the supply, the sellers would be liable for
that loss, if they had knowledge that such loss was likely to result.
In the present case, on the other hand, the only thing that the seller knew
was that the goods were to be booked to Calcutta from which the court.
refused to infer that the goods were meant for resale or for resale in Calcutta
alone. The buyer could have sold the railway receipt at Kanpur itself, or at
any other place. 106

A bid was made at an auction for collection and removal of residue of tree
growth and firewood. Before its confirmation, a fire destroyed the residue.
The bidder asked for cancellation of the bid or for reduction of its amount.
But his bid was accepted and he was called upon to deposit the bid amount.
On his refusal to do so, the work was reauctioned for a lower amount. The
bidder was sued for the difference. The Supreme Court rejected the claim. It
said that whether there had been a contract or its breach required decision
of a judicial authority and then only difference could be claimed. Before
acceptance of his bid, the bidder had applied for cancellation or revision of
his bid because of the intervention of an act of God. There was no contract
and no question of realising the shortfall from the bidder.107
The defendant failed to supply goods and cancelled orders of the buyers
in view of the firm's inability to comply with them. The firm promised to
refund the advance money but failed to do so. Cheques issued for refund of
the principal amount and interest bounced. The buyers had failed to invoke
bank guarantees. Their claim was decreed to the full amount with interest
at 18 per cent p.a.108
Whether actual purchase or sale of goods necessary
The High Court of Delhi was of the view in Union of India v Commercial
Metal Corp09 that it is not necessary that on default by the seller to deliver,
the plaintiff should have actually bought the goods elsewhere and only then
claim the difference. The court said that damages could be claimed on mar-
ket basis. The same ruling was repeated in Saraya Distillery v Union of
India, the court saying that the injured party can recover compensation
on the basis of the difference between the contract and market prices with-
out actually purchasing the goods. All that has to be proved is the buying
price at which the injured party can obtain substitute goods. In Ismail Sait
have suffered any loss. Devidayal Sales (P) Ltd v State of Maharashtra, (2006) 4 Mah LJ

out the distinction between a performance guarantee and an advance payment guarantee
to hold that under a performance guarantee, the bank is liable to make payment only after
breach of contract and after the affected party has suffered loss or damage due to breach.
However in an advance payment guarantee there is absolute obligation on the bank to make
payment to the affected party in the event of non-performance of the contract and the bank

Damages for breach 485
& Sons v Wilson & Co the Madras High Court held that the provisions
contained in Section 73 did not envisage that the injured buyer must resort
to actual purchase and suffer loss before claiming damages. The Bombay
High Court has expressed the view that neither Section 73 nor these rulings
would apply where the parties provide for a different rule. They can lay
down their own remedial system. The difference which the court saw in this
case was the provision in the contract that in the event of part delivery, "the
purchaser shall purchase goods from the open market and then claim dam-
ages." It was on the basis of this clause that the court held that the plaintiff
was not entitled to any compensation without actually acquiring the mate-
rial elsewhere and then showing his loss.13 Thus special circumstances may
justify departure from the rule that actual purchase is not necessary. In a
case before the Calcutta High Court," the seller did not supply anything
because he wanted increase in price to which the buyer did not agree. The
buyer, however, purchased some quantity from the seller at the enhanced
price as a special case outside the contract. The rest of the contract was can-
celled. The buyer had not purchased anything from the market. His claim
for damages was not allowed. At least the market price should be discovered
and produced before the court. Quantification of damages without it was
not proper.
Getting work done through other sources
The contractor failed to complete the work within 4 months from the
date of contract. The delay was the result of his own doings and not that of
the other party. The corporation had to get the work completed by inviting
fresh tenders. Extra amount paid to the other contractor was allowed to be
recovered. The consequences of delay were compensated by allowing inter-
est at 6 per cent on the amount of extra payment.
Premature termination of contract
A clause in the contract provided for compensation for delay in comple-
tion. The contract was terminated before it could be completed and also
before the completion period was over. The court said that no compensa-
tion could be claimed from the contractor. No evidence was also offered of
additional cost, if any, for setting the work completed from other sources.115
Incomplete execution
A road building contract was to be executed in two phases. The second
phase was never executed by the contractor. He was fully paid for completion

of the first phase. The contractor was not allowed to claim compensation
for not doing the work on the second phase just by showing technicalities.116
Award of interest on difference
Where because of the purchaser's breach, the supplier had to resell the
goods elsewhere and became entitled to recover the difference, the court
allowed future interest at 20 per cent p.a. from the date of the suit till the date
of judgment and 6 per cent p.a. from the date of judgment till realisation.117
Interest by way of damages
Payments of running bills were delayed in breach of contract terms. The
contractor had taken loan at 13.25 per cent interest. He was awarded inter-
est for the period of delay at 12.5 per cent. This was held to be proper, the
time period between raising of bill and payment being not very large.118
Loss of profits is special loss
Thus, loss of profits which are to accrue upon resale cannot be recovered
unless it is communicated to the other party that the goods are for resale
upon a special contract. This is borne out by the decision of the Supreme
Court in Karsandas H. Thacker v Saran Engg Co Ltd.119
There was a contract to supply 200 tons of scrap iron. The buyer under-
took to supply the same quantity to the Export Corporation, Calcutta.
The seller failed to supply and in consequence the buyer could not keep
his date with the Corporation. The Corporation recovered from him the
difference between the contract price and the market price. The seller
contended that he should not be held liable for anything because control
price of iron scrap was still the same and he had no knowledge of the
contract of resale to the Corporation.
The court found the facts of the case to be similar to illustration (k) accord-
ing to which the seller has not to pay any compensation that the buyer may
have to pay to his sub-buyers by reason of the breach unless he was made
aware of the buyer's purpose at the time of the contract. RAGHUBAR DAYAL
J said: On account of non-delivery of scrap iron he [the buyer] could have
purchased the scrap iron from the market at the same controlled price and
similar incidental charges. This means that he did not stand to pay a higher

price than what he was to pay to the respondent [the seller] and therefore he
could not have suffered any loss on account of the breach.... The actual loss
which he suffered on account of the breach was the result of his contracting
to sell 200 tons of scrap iron for export to the Export Corporation. As the
seller did not know this contract, he could not have known of the likelihood
of the loss actually suffered.120
Where a person was dispossessed of his leased premises prematurely, he
was allowed to recover retrenchment compensation which he had to pay to
labour and loss of profits calculated on the basis of figures provided by the
plaintiff for the period he actually did business. The court said that that was
the best indicator. The period for loss of business would be the unexpired
period of the lease. The court said that there cannot be a direct and con-
crete evidence of loss of profits. Damages on account of loss of profit are in
the nature of prospective damages and, therefore, necessarily contingent. It
is now well established principle of law that the mere fact that damages can-
not be assessed with certainty does not relieve the wrongdoer of the liability
to pay damages. 122
Loss of expected profit.-The Supreme Court reiterated that loss of
expected profit attributable to breach of contract is recoverable. The court
distinguished the contractual measure of damages from reimbursement or
compensation. The contract in this case was "build-operate-and transfer" of
an adjoining road. The contractor was to collect toll money from operation.
This required government notification which was delayed. The claim for loss
of expected profit was allowed.123
Consequences of delay in transit
Consequences of delay in transit have been noted by the Supreme Court
in some cases. A consignment of goods with the railways reached its desti-
nation after inordinate delay, caused by gross negligence, of seven months.
The plaintiff's money remained blocked for the period. He was allowed to
recover interest on the money by way of damages for the loss.124 In another

case of delay and damage, the railways have been held liable to the extent to
which the value of the goods had diminished.125 Where the goods are dam-
aged by the railways the measure of damages would be the market price at
the time of damage and not the price at which the injured party purchased
the goods.126 Regard must also be had to the type of market and setback to
price because of the taste and prejudices of a special customer class. 127 In a
fire insurance contract, the damaged goods were sold by auction under due
intimation to the insurer, who did not turn up, the court allowed the differ-
ence between the insured price and the amount realised.128
Meaning of market price
In almost all sales transactions which fail to go through the normal yard-
stick for working out the sum of money to which the aggrieved party is
entitled is the difference between the contract and market prices. 129 This rule
presupposes the existence of a market and the possibility of ascertaining the
price of the goods in that market. Both these concepts were the subject-mat-
ter of some explanation in a case where the buyer refused to accept the
goods.130 The court dealt with the question in the following way:
125. Union of India v B. Prahlad & Co, AIR 1976 Del 236 that is to say, the market value of the
goods minus their value in their damaged state; the plaintiff must do all that he reasonably
can to mitigate his loss; if the damaged goods are still saleable though at a lower price, the
measure of damages will be the market price of the goods minus what they would have
fetched in their damaged state if the plaintiff had sold them. Savani Transport (P) Ltd v
Gangadhar Ghosh, AIR 1986 Cal 330, the court laid stress upon the fact that the salvage
value of the goods cannot be ignored and that whatever be the difficulty the court can-
not shrink from ascertaining the salvage value; Dunn v Bucknall Bros, (1902) 2 KB 614,

Damages for breach 489
In assessing damages for failure to perform a contract for the purchase
of goods the measure of damages payable by the defaulting buyer is the
difference between the contract price and the current or market price at
the date of breach; based on a hypothetical sale of the particular amount
of the goods in question in the available market, but disregarding any
characteristics of the seller which might have led to a lower price being
obtained. In determining whether there is an 'available market' for the
goods in question, if the seller actually offered the goods for sale, there is
no available market unless there is one actual buyer on that day at a fair
price. If, on the other hand, there is only a notional or hypothetical sale
there is no available market unless on the relevant day there were in the
market sufficient traders, potentially in touch with each other, to evidence
a market in which the seller could if he had wished have sold the goods.
Furthermore, the market price on a hypothetical sale is the fair market
price for the total quantity of the goods if they had to be sold on the rel-
evant day, but taking into account the price which might be negotiated
within a few days with other potential buyers who were not part of the
market on that day only because of difficulties in communication. It fol-
lowed that the plaintiffs were entitled to damages based on the fair mar-
ket or current price on the date of the breach for 7755 tonnes of standard
grade tin, but that price in turn would be based on both the price which
would have been obtained by a sale of all the tin on 12 March, 1986, and
the price which would have been obtained by sales negotiated over a short
period before or after that date.131
Escalation of costs
A works contract was in writing. Delay in completing the works was due
to the contractor's fault. It seemed that he was delaying things in order to
take advantage of escalation of prices. Full payment was already made to
him according to the originally agreed rates. A quantum meruit suit for
131. The court followed: Garnac Grain Co Inc v HMF Faure and Fairclough Ltd, (1968) AC
1130: (1967) 3 WLR 143 (HL). See further Rajasthan Rajya Sahkari Kraya Vikraya Sangh
Ltd v Ram Mohan, (1988) 2 Raj LR 962 where it was observed: It is not necessary to prove
actual loss. Anticipated loss of profit can be determined by the court while awarding com-
pensation. What is necessary is that the plaintiff should establish what was the contractual
rate of purchase and what was the rate of article on the date on which it was to be supplied.
The difference between the two is a loss to the purchaser, if it is not supplied by the seller to
the purchaser. This is so because the buyer cannot be allowed to be put in a better position
than he would have been if the contract had been performed. Wertheim v Chicoutimi Pulp
Co, 1911 AC 301: (1908-10) All ER Rep 707 (PC). In this case goods were delivered by the
seller late when they were worth Rs 50 per ton in the market as against the contract price of
Rs 80, but the buyer got Rs 70 per ton on resale. He was allowed Rs 10 per ton by way of his
loss. Gauri Datt Basdeo v Nanik Ram Chauthmal, (1916) 14 All LJ 597, where no time for
delivery was fixed and the buyer having given notice fixing the time, the time so fixed was
the day on which prices were to be compared. Engell v Fitch, (1869) LR 4 QB 659 (Exch). on
deliberate refusal to sell land, the value of resale by the seller was taken as the evidence of
market value.

[S. 73]
recovering escalated costs was held to be not maintainable. Where in a
scheme for allotment of houses the limit of escalation cost was fixed in the
scheme itself, the Authority was not allowed to charge anything in excess of
the limit by way of escalation.133
Agreement to provide finance
An arrangement to provide funds for an approved project is not a typical
contract; it is only a facility. Where, after releasing some instalments, the
lending institution refuses to go further, the borrower cannot compel it, nor
hold it liable in damages for the loss of his expectations, nor claim a set-off
against its demand for interest on the money already provided, his right, if
any, to damages.134
Commercial parties are free to vary their contracting terms and to with-
draw credit facilities without constituting duress. There is no economic
duress where there are an arm's length commercial dealings between two
companies having equality of bargaining power. This principle was laid
down in a case in which facts were:
A company bought cigarettes in bulk from a person who happened by
a mistake to deliver them to a wrong address. Before they could be col-
lected from that place, they were stolen. The supplier invoiced the buyer
for the price thinking that the property in the goods had passed to the
buyer and threatened to cut off the buyer's credit facilities if he did not
pay. The buyer paid to secure his credit facilities and brought an action
for repayment saying that the payment was under pressure amounting to
economic duress. This was not allowed,135
Compensation for liability to third party before payment
Where, on account of the seller's default, the buyer was not able to keep
his commitment under a sub-sale and became liable to compensate the third
party, the court said that there is no rule of law that a liability without

payment does not constitute a recoverable loss. Where a seller of goods
breaches his contract with the buyer so as to result in the buyer being liable
to a third party to whom he had agreed to resell the goods, the buyer has
a claim for substantial damages against the seller prior to his discharging
the liability to the third party by payment. In this case the first buyer had
become impecunious and, therefore, unable to pay. His claim against the
seller was assigned to the sub-buyer who had brought the claim in the right
of the buyer. The court held that the liability to the third party was enforce-
able even before it was discharged.136
Unfair or wrongful dismissal of employee
In an action for damages for breach of contract arising out of wrongful
dismissal of an employee, the Employment Tribunal upheld the claim and
awarded damages for unfair dismissal. The employee subsequently brought
a civil suit for financial loss arising from psychological injury caused by the
manner of dismissal. It was held that an employee had no right of action.
at common law to recover financial losses arising from the unfair man-
ner of his dismissal. A conclusion to the contrary would be inconsistent
with the statutory system for dealing with unfair dismissals established by
the Parliament in 1971 to remedy the deficiencies in law as it then stood.
([English] Industrial Relations Act, 1971).137
Agreement by employee to release all claims
An employee agreed to release all claims that he might have against the
employer. The employee subsequently brought an action for a claim which
was not known to exist when the release was signed. The House of Lords
held that the claim was allowable. Their Lordships said that although a
party could in a compromise agreement supported by valuable consideration
agree to release claims or rights of which he was not and could not be aware,
the court would be slow to infer that he had done so in the absence of a clear
language to that effect. In this case, neither the bank nor the employee could
have realistically supposed that a claim for stigma damages lay within the
realm of practical possibility. On a fair construction of the documents, it
was impossible to conclude that the parties had intended to provide for the
release of rights and surrender of claims which they could never have had
in contemplation at all. If the parties had sought to achieve so extravagant
a result, they should have used language which left no room for doubt and
which might at least have alerted the employee to the effect of what he was
agreeing.

492 Chapter 9 Discharge by Breach
MEASURE OF DAMAGES
[S. 73]
Once it is determined whether general or special damages have to be
recovered they have to be evaluated in terms of money. This is the problem
of measure of damages and is governed by some fundamental principles.
Claim for damages is not debt
A claim for damages arising out of breach of contract, whether for gen-
eral or liquidated damages, remains only a claim till its adjudication by the
court and becomes a debt only after the court awards it. Till then and on
the basis of the claim alone, the claimant is not entitled to present a winding
up petition of the defendant company on the ground of its inability to pay
debts.139
Damages are compensatory, not penal
In the words of ASQUITH J: "It is well-settled that the governing purpose
of damages is to put the party whose rights have been violated in the same
position, so far as money can do so, as if his rights have been observed."140
"The primary aim or principle of the law of damages for a breach of con-
tract is to place the plaintiff in the same position he would be in if the con-
tract had been fulfilled, or to place the plaintiff in the position he would
have occupied had the breach of the contract not occurred. When this is
accomplished, the primary aim or principle of the law of damages has been
fulfilled." In a case involving the construction of a swimming-pool where
the depth of the pool happened to be less than what was specified, the pool
being otherwise useful, the court allowed the difference in value of the pool
as provided and its value as it should have been provided. The court did
not allow the cost of setting right the pool because that would have given
the recipient windfall profits which are impermissible because the award of
damages is to compensate the claimant and not to punish the payer.142
Robinson v Harman is an apt illustration. The defendant, having
agreed to grant a lease of a certain property to the plaintiff, refused to do

Measure of damages 493
so. The court allowed the plaintiff by way of damages the expenses incurred
by him on the preliminary legal work and also for the profits which he
would have earned if the lease had been granted to him. PARKE B stated the
principle thus:
What damages is the plaintiff entitled to recover? The rule of the com-
mon law is that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of con-
tract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation,
with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed.
Thus, damages are given by way of compensation for the loss suffered
by the plaintiff and not for the purpose of punishing the defendant for the
breach.144 Motive for and the manner of breach are not taken into account
because generally "punitive damages are not recoverable for breach of
contract".145
Inconvenience caused by breach
But the inconvenience caused by the breach may be taken into account.
Thus, for example, in Hobbs v London & South-Western Rly Co, where a
train pulled its passengers to a wrong direction and consequently the plaintiff
and his wife, finding no other conveyance, nor a place to stay, had to walk
home at midnight, the jury allowed £8 as the damages for the inconvenience
suffered by the plaintiffs in being obliged to walk and £20 in respect of the
wife's illness caused by catching a cold. On appeal, the court of Queen's
Bench held that the £8 was properly awarded but not £20.
The inconvenience of walking back must be taken to have been within
the reasonable contemplation of the parties. But the wife's cold was not
the necessary or even the probable consequence of the breach.
But in the subsequent case of McMahov Fields the above decision was
criticised and damages were allowed when the plaintiff's horses were turned
out of the defendant's stable in breach of contract and they caught a cold
before an alternative accommodation could be found for them.

quences are not taken into account. Graham v Campbell, (1878) LR 7 Ch D 490 (CA).

494 Chapter 9 Discharge by Breach
Loss caused by misrepresentation
[S. 73]
The price at which a thing is purchased and its difference with the real
value, when misrepresentation about it is discovered, is the yardstick for
compensation. A horse was purchased described as fit for races. But it turned
out to be of different breed. That was discovered after a long process of trial
and error and after discovery its market value was much less. It was held
that where an article purchased as a result of misrepresentation could have
been resold immediately after the sale for the price paid but by the time the
misrepresentation was discovered its value had fallen by reason of a defect
in it which had then become apparent, the appropriate measure of damages
would be the difference between the purchase price and its value at the time
when misrepresentation is discovered and not the difference between the
purchase price and its actual value at the time of purchase. The court
referred to the decision in Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd149 which deals
with cases in which a business or an article is not purchased for immediate
resale. The court cited the following dictum of WINN LJ:
It appears to me that in a case where there has been a breach of war-
ranty of authority, and still more clearly where there has been a tortious
wrong consisting of a fraudulent inducement, the proper starting point
for any court called on to consider what damages are recoverable by the
defrauded person is to compare his position before the representation was
made to him with his position after it, brought about by that representa-
tion, always bearing in mind that no element in the consequential posi-
tion can be regarded as attributable loss and damage if it be too remote a
consequence. It will be too remote not necessarily because it was not con-
templated by the representor but in any case where the person deceived
has not himself behaved with reasonable prudence, reasonable common
sense or can in any true sense be said to have been the author of his
own misfortune. The damage that he seeks to recover must have flowed
directly from the fraud perpetrated on him.
WINN LJ then assessed the damages in that case by reference to precisely
what the plaintiff had done after acquiring the business including selling the
business at some later time and giving credit for that sale price. It is perhaps
also useful to refer in this connection to Johnson v Agnew in which Lord
WILBERFORCE said:
"The general principle for the assessment of damages is compensa-
tory, i.e. that the innocent party is to be placed, so far as money can do
so, in the same position as if the contract had been performed. Where
the contract is one of sale, this principle normally leads to assessment of
damages as at the date of the breach, a principle recognised and embodied

in Section 51 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893. [S. 59 of the Indian Sale of
Goods Act, 1930] But this is not an absolute rule; if to follow it would
give rise to injustice, the court has power to fix such other date as may be
appropriate in the circumstances. In cases where a breach of a contract
for sale has occurred, and the innocent party reasonably continues to
try to have the contract completed, it would to me appear more logical
and just rather than tie him to the date of the original breach, to assess
damages as at the date when (otherwise than by his default) the contract
is lost. Support for this approach is to be found in the cases. In Ogle v
Earl Vanes the date was fixed by reference to the time when the innocent
party, acting reasonably, went into the market; in Hickman v Haynes 152
at a reasonable time after the last request of the defendants (the buyers)
to withhold delivery. In Radford v De Frobervilless where the defendant
had covenanted to build a wall, damages were held measurable as at the
date of the hearing rather than at the date of the defendant's breach,
unless the plaintiff ought reasonably to have mitigated the breach at an
carlier date."
A person owned two neighbouring hairdressing salons. He sold one of
them. He deliberately and falsely told the buyer before the sale that he would
not work at the other salon except in cases of emergency. This statement
was particularly important since it meant that the clientele would not follow
him to the neighbouring business. After the sale was completed, the buyer
discovered that the seller was working full-time at his other neighbouring
business. An award of £10,000 was allowed to the buyer for the consequen-
tial loss of business. BELDAM LJ observed:154
"If in fact the plaintiffs lost the profits which they could reasonably
have expected from running a business in the area of a kind similar to
the business in this case, I can see no reason why they do not fall within
the words of Lord ATKIN in Clark v Urquhart,155 "actual damage directly
following from the fraudulent inducement"."
The court noted the development in this field to this effect as shown by a
number of decisions which make it clear that the tortious measure of dam-
ages is the true one. 156
Incidence of taxation
Since the principle is that of compensation, and no more than compensa-
tion, the benefits, if any, that the plaintiff has received against the loss suf-
fered are to be taken into account. For example, where a dismissed employee

receives unemployment benefit, his compensation is reduced by that amount.
If he is given compensation for loss of prospective earnings, the amount of
income tax which he would have to pay on the amount if received as earn-
ings would go to reduce the compensation. This principle was laid down by
the House of Lords in British Transport Commission v Gourley157 and was
followed by the Court of Appeal in Parsons v BNM Laboratories Ltd¹58
where HARMAN LJ stated the effect of the House of Lords' decision in these
words:
The case (Gourley case) decides that in an action whether in tort for
injuries arising from negligence or in contract for wrongful dismissal
where the loss of the plaintiff consists wholly or in part in a loss of earn-
ings, and where the sum to be awarded in damages will not suffer deduc-
tion of tax in his hands, then in ascertaining the plaintiff's loss his tax
liability, that is to say, the sum which he would have had to pay in income
tax including sur tax in acquiring the lost earnings, must be deducted
from his loss in assessing the damage... Unemployment insurance is a
sum receivable by contract made by the employed man and his employer
each of whom contributes to the State on the footing that if and when
the servant is unemployed the State will make good part of his earnings
to him. I do not think that such a payment is truly analogous to insur-
ance money, as in the leading case of Bradburn v Great Western Rail
Co159 where there was a purely voluntary contract made by the plaintiff.
This is a contribution which he is bound to make with the very object
of mitigating the damage which inability to work will do him. It is just
as if his employer continued to pay part of his wages. The loss he suf-
fers is pro tanto diminished and therefore cannot be charged against the
wrongdoer,160
Nominal damages (no loss situation)
Where the plaintiff suffers no loss the court may still award him nominal
damages in recognition of his right. But this is in the discretion of the court.
The court may altogether refuse to award any damages or may award even
substantial damages. "The court is competent to award reasonable com-
pensation in case of breach, even if no actual damage is proved or shown
to have been suffered in consequence of breach of contract."161 It has been
pointed out by the Delhi High Court, following some earlier High Court
decisions, that Section 73 does not give any cause of action unless and

until damage is actually suffered. The case before the court was Union of
India v Tribhuwan Das Lalji Patel.163
A contract for the supply of sleepers to the railway administration con-
tained a number of clauses including this that irrespective of whether the
Government suffered any loss or not on account of the contractor's fail-
ure to supply, the Government was entitled to damages. The contractor
failed to supply, but the railways did not suffer any loss. Even so an action
for damages was instituted against the contractor.
It was argued on the strength of some High Court decisions and illus-
tration (a) to Section 73 that it is not necessary for the aggrieved party to
prove that he purchased the goods from an alternative source and suffered a
loss; he is entitled to the difference in the contract and market prices in any
case. Reliance was also placed upon the Privy Council decision in Mackay v
Kameshwar Singh165 where it was observed that the difference, if the market
price exceeds the contract price, is the sole damage in general recoverable
and a contract of resale or repurchase is immaterial. PRAKASH NARAIN J
did not agree with this contention. He took the Privy Council decision to be
no authority for the proposition that irrespective of whether there was any
loss, damages must still be paid and that the decision is only in the context
of quantum of damages. Thus, he refused to countenance the view that
compensation can be awarded when there has been no loss or damage. "If
the contrary view was to be taken", he said, "the provision of Section 73 will
become nugatory and a party would be penalised, though the other party
has suffered no loss."
Even so the category of nominal damages cannot be ruled out. Thus,
where a Government contract for building roads was terminated, before the
expiry of the notice period as prescribed in the contract, in circumstances
which did not entitle the contractor to recover loss of profit, he was allowed
nominal damages, 166
Where a seller of land suffered no loss from the buyer's refusal to per-
form, and, on the contrary, made a huge windfall profit by selling the land

found.167 A piece of land was sold. As a part of the sale agreement, the buyer

covenanted to build only 72 houses on the land. In breach of the agreement,
the buyer built 77 houses. The seller sued him for breach of the covenant.
The question was what should be the correct measure of damages where
there is the following set of circumstances: (a) There has been a deliber-
ate breach of contract, (b) the party in breach has made a profit from that
breach, and (c) the innocent party is in financial terms in the same position
as if the contract had been fully performed,168 STYN LJ proceeded as follows.
stating and applying the first principles:
"An award of compensation for breach of contract serves to protect
three separate interests. The starting principle is that the aggrieved party
ought to be compensated for loss of his positive or expectation interests.
In other words, the object is to put the aggrieved party in the same finan-
cial position as if the contract had been fully performed. But the law also
protects the negative interest of the aggrieved party. If the aggrieved party
is unable to establish the value of a loss of bargain he may seek com-
pensation in respect of his reliance losses. The object of such an award
is to compensate the aggrieved party for expenses incurred and losses
suffered in reliance on the contract. These two complementary principles
share one feature. Both are pure compensatory principles. If the aggrieved
party has suffered no loss he is not entitled to be compensated by invok-
ing these principles. The application of these principles to the present case
would result in an award of nominal damages only.
There is, however, a third principle which protects the aggrieved par-
ty's restitutionary interest. The object of such an award is not to com-
pensate the plaintiff for a loss, but to deprive the defendant of the benefit
he gained by the breach of contract. The classic illustration is a claim for
the return of goods sold and delivered where the buyer has repudiated his
obligation to pay the price. It is not traditional to describe a claim for res-
titution following a breach of contract as damages. What matters is that a
coherent law of obligations must inevitably extend its protection to cover
certain restitutionary interests. How far that protection should extend is
the essence of the problem before us."10
The object of the award in this case was not to compensate the plaintiff
for financial injury but to deprive the defendant of an unjustly acquired gain.
As to this his Lordship said:
"The introduction of restitutionary remedies to deprive cynical con-
tract breakers of the fruits of their breaches of contract will lead to greater
uncertainty in the assessment of damages in commercial and consumer
disputes. It is of paramount importance that the way in which disputes are
likely to be resolved by the courts must be readily predictable. Given the
premise that the aggrieved party has suffered no loss, is such a dramatic

extension of restitutionary remedies justified in order to confer a windfall
in each case on the aggrieved party? I think not. In any event such a wide-
spread availability of restitutionary remedies will have a tendency to dis-
courage economic activity in relevant situations. In a range of cases, such
liability would fall on the underwriters who have insured relevant liabil-
ity risks. Inevitably the underwriters would have to be compensated for
the new species of potential claims. Insurance premiums would have to
go up. That, too, is a consequence which mitigates against the proposed
extension. The recognition of the proposed extension will in my view not
serve the public interest. It is sound policy to guard against extending the
protection of the law of obligations too widely. The present case involves
no breach of fiduciary obligations. It is a case of breach of contract. The
principles governing expectation or reliance losses cannot be invoked.
Given the fact of the breach of contract the only question is whether resti-
tution is an appropriate remedy for this wrong. The case does not involve
any invasion of the plaintiff's property interests even in the broadest sense
of that word. I would therefore rule that no restitutionary remedy is avail-
able and there is certainly no other remedy available."
In such a case, however, the court may award nominal damages. The
decision of the Court of Appeal in Charter v Sullivan is an apt illustration.
The defendant, having contracted to buy a Hillman car from a car
dealer, ultimately refused to buy. Within a week the car was sold to
another customer. Indeed; the dealer was able to sell as many cars as he
wanted and lost nothing on account of the defendant's breach. Even so he
wanted to recover the loss of his profit.
The court held that he was entitled only to nominal damages and 40 shil-
lings were allowed.
As against it, in another case7 on account of the customer's breach in not
lifting the car in terms of his agreement, the dealer had to return the car to
the manufacturer. He was allowed to recover the profit which he would have
made on sale of the car to the defaulting customer.
Compensation in no loss situations
An action was brought for breach of contract arising out of overuse of
musical recordings. The court generally orders in such cases an account of
profits made in overuse but in this case the breach had caused no economic
loss. 172 The court said:
Although the court could order an account of profits for breach of
contract where the claimant could not prove that it had suffered any

financial loss, this would only be done in exceptional circumstances such
as national security, exceptional profits and fiduciary breaches. Damages
could be awarded for a breach of a restriction which had been imposed to
protect the claimant's property, where an injunction was refused, because
the court was only concerned with past profits. 173 This was not an excep-
tional case which justified an account of profits. Even so, the defendant
should make a reasonable and substantial payment for the unauthorised
use of the master records.
Where the highest bidder committed default in payment but the forest
authorities suffered no serious prejudice due to the default, the court said
that forfeiture of the whole of the deposit money was not justified. The court
ordered refund of the actual amount without interest or costs." 174
Refund on partial cancellation of contract
The agreement was for sale of damaged food grains. The purchaser
deposited a certain amount with the Food Corporation. An application was
made for cancellation a certain part of the agreement which was not capable
of being performed. This was conceded and some refund was made. The
purchaser was not allowed to sue the corporation for breach of contract in
the matter of refund. There was no proof of any such breach.175
Pre-contract expenditure
Pre-contract expenditure may be recovered as damages if it was within
the contemplation of the parties. The Court of Appeal laid down this princi-
ple in Anglia Television Ltd v Reed. Here, a television artiste who having
been engaged as a leading actor for a television film, repudiated the contract.
The producer was unable to find a substitute and, therefore, had to abandon
the project. The loss of profit was incapable of being estimated. The court
allowed him as damages the money spent by him in engaging a director, a
designer, etc., as this kind of expenditure was within the contemplation of
the parties. Lord DENNING MR explained the principle thus:
The plaintiff in such a case as this has to make election: he can either
claim for his loss of profits; or for his wasted expenditure. But he must
elect between them. He cannot claim both. If he has not suffered any loss

of profits or if he cannot prove what his profits would have been-he
can claim in the alternative the expenditure which has been thrown away,
that is, wasted by reason of the breach. That is shown by Cullinane v
British Rema Mfg Co Ltd. 177
If the plaintiff claims the wasted expenditure, he is not limited to the
expenditure incurred after the contract was concluded. He can claim also
the expenditure incurred before the contract, provided that it was such
as would reasonably be in the contemplation of the parties as likely to
be wasted if the contract was broken.... He (the party, committing the
breach) must pay damages for all the expenditure so wasted and thrown
away. This view is supported by the recent decision of BRIGHTMAN LJ in
Lloyd v Stanbury,178 There was a contract for the sale of land. In antic-
ipation of the contract-and before it was concluded-the purchaser
went to such expense in moving a caravan to the site and in getting his
furniture there. The seller afterwards entered into a contract to sell the
land to the purchaser, but afterwards broke his contract. The land had.
not increased in value, so the purchaser could not claim for any loss of
profits. But BRIGHTMAN J held that he could recover the cost of moving
the caravan and furniture, because it was "within the contemplation of
the parties when the contract was signed". That decision is in accord with
correct principle, namely, that wasted expenditure can be recovered when
it was wasted by reason of the defendant's breach of contract. It is true
that, if the defendant had never entered into the contract, he would not
be liable, and the expenditure would have been incurred by the plaintiff
without redress; but, the defendant having made his contract and broken
it, it does not lie in his mouth to say he is not liable, when it was because
of his breach that the expenditure has been wasted.
Competitive tendering involves considerable expenditure of time and
money. The tenderers do not get paid for it. Where a party tendered for a
construction work, and before anything, was given to believe that the work
would be allotted to them. They were encouraged to do further work in esti-
mating and tendering, but ultimately the contract was awarded to someone
else. For such further work the party was allowed to recover payment.
Where a quotation for a residential development was accepted "subject to
contract" but no contract could follow because in the intervening period
land prices crashed and the project had to be abandoned, it was held that the
bidder's expenditure in payment of fees to professional people for preparing
plans of development was not recoverable. They had incurred it voluntarily
and not on encouragement. The court said:180

"Each party to such negotiations must be taken to know that pending
the conclusion of a binding contract any cost incurred by him in prepara-
tion for the intended contract will be incurred at his own risk in the sense
that he will have no recompense for those costs if no contract results."
Agreement to provide scientific process
The agreement was for setting up a project for converting menthons to
menthol. The agreement showed that the requisite technical know-how was
to be provided by the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP). A huge expenditure
was incurred in setting up the plant. But the IIP failed in its experiment of
converting the material even up to five years. It was something which had
to be done under the contract within five months. The arbitrator awarded
compensation of Rs 90 lakhs for the loss suffered in setting up the plant.
The Court said that there was nothing against public policy in the award.181
Mental pain and suffering and punitive damages (non-pecuniary loss)
In ordinary cases damages for mental pain and suffering caused by
the breach are not allowed.182 It is not appropriate to award damages for
anguish and vexation caused by breach of contract when the contract is
an ordinary commercial one.183 But they may be allowed in special cases.
According to the American RESTATEMENT such damages may be allowed
where "the breach was wanton or reckless and caused bodily harm" and
where the defendant had reason to know that the breach would cause mental
suffering. An illustration is found in a case before the Supreme Court of
Colorado, U.S.385
The defendant, a banking corporation, agreed to loan the plaintiff
money for a trip to California by crediting his account with such sums
as he might need after reaching his destination. The plaintiff reached
California, but the defendant refused to give him the promised credit.
The court allowed damages for humiliation and mental suffering. The
banker could have foreseen that the plaintiff, having gone away from home
and among strangers on the basis of the promise, would naturally suffer
mental anguish if his cheque was not honoured.

Measure of damages 503.
Three cases listed by the House of Lords
The House of Lords in Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd listed three situa-
tions in which mental pain and suffering can be taken into account:
There are three well-known exceptions to the general rule..., namely,
actions against a banker for refusing to pay a customer's cheque when he
has in his hands funds of the customer, to meet it; actions for breach of
promise of marriage (now abolished in England), and actions like that in
Flurean v Thornhill where the vendor of real estate, fails to make title.
Lord ATKINSON then added that he knew of none other and that any ten-
dency to create a fourth exception should be checked rather than stimulated.
His Lordship warned that application of tort principles to contract would
lead to confusion, uncertainty and anomalies and occasionally to injustice
and make the law a still more 'lawless science' than it is said to be. Suppose,
for example, that a debtor refused to pay his creditor, should the damages be
reduced if the debtor is helpless and apologetic and increased if the refusal
is from a malicious desire to injure the creditor? His Lordship expressed the
opinion that these matters should not play any part in the law of contract
where the principle is that the aggrieved party "is to be paid adequate com-
pensation in money for the loss of that which he would have received had his
contract been kept, and no more". The facts of the case were:
The plaintiff was employed by the defendant company at a certain sal-
ary and commission on trade done. He could be dismissed by six months'
notice. He was given six months' notice and at the same time another
person was appointed to his place, thus preventing him from acting as
manager even for the notice period and earning his commission.
The House of Lords rejected the claim for damages for the humiliating
manner of dismissal, but allowed damages for the commission and salary
which he had lost. Lord ATKINSON explained the principles thus:
The damages the plaintiff sustained by his illegal dismissal were:
(1) the wages for the period of six months...; (2) the profits on commis-
sion which would in all probability have been earned by him; and possi-
bly (3) damages in respect of time which might reasonably elapse before
he could obtain other employment.
His Lordship then referred to the sum of £600 which was awarded to
him not in respect of these heads of damage, but in respect of the harsh and
humiliating way in which he was dismissed, including the pain he experi-
enced by reason of the imputation upon him conveyed by the manner of his
dismissal. This kind of compensation was accordingly not allowed.

[S. 73]
The reason for this conservative approach and reason why it would have
to be diluted in the modern circumstances of life appears from the following
statement.
"In an age where stress has, generally speaking, clearly increased-and
has become more of a reality in the perception of people generally, it is,
perhaps, not surprising that there has been increasing dissatisfaction with
this general approach. However, it is also clear that the courts have to be
vigilant to guard against inflated and (more importantly) bogus claims,
lest the release of the floodgates sweep away all semblance of reason,
common sense and justice."188
This line of reasoning was approved by the House of Lords in Johnson v
Unisys Ltd. Here also their Lordships did not allow damages for unfair
dismissal as a special count of liability under the head psychological injury
caused by the manner of dismissal. The claim was for summary dismissal
after an irregularity. Their Lordships observed by a majority that there is
no right of action at common law to recover financial losses arising from
unfair manner of dismissal. Any other conclusion would be contrary to the
statutory system for dealing with unfair dismissals. Parliament in creating
the new system under the Employment Rights Act, 1996 (English) had not
left any scope for contractual damages where the power of dismissal was not
exercised in good faith or fairly. The Parliament has established an entirely
new system outside the ordinary courts with tribunals staffed by a majority
of lay members applying new statutory concepts and offering statutory rem-
edies. Many of the new rules such as the limit on the amount of the statutory
award, are not based upon any general principles which the courts used to
apply.
Breach of promise of marriage
A sum of Rs 27,000 was awarded for breach of promise of marriage. The
amount covered lowering esteem in society, mental torture and expenses on
engagement ceremony."

Mental distress caused by negligent survey report or advice
The same principle was followed where mental distress was caused by a
negligent survey report as a result of which a house was purchased at a price
higher than it was worth and considerable time and money had to be spent
on making it habitable. A sum of £8000 (being £4000 to each plaintiff) was
awarded at the trial, but the Court of Appeal held that damages for breach

of a normal contract of survey are only recoverable for distress caused by
physical consequences of the breach and not for mental distress not caused
by physical discomfort or inconvenience resulting from the breach and that
accordingly the plaintiffs were not entitled to damages for distress and
inconvenience but instead they would each be awarded damages of £750 for
physical discomfort.191
In Hayes v James & Charles Dodd (a firm), the court was of the view
that the law on this point would seem to be in some doubt, but felt that, if
the law needs clarification, it may be provided by the House of Lords or by
the Law Commission. Damages awarded for negligence or want of skill,
whether against professional men or anyone else, must provide fair com-
pensation, but no more than that. The court believed that in one or more
American States damages are awarded for wrongfully defending an action
instead of admitting it, but felt that there was no such remedy in England.
In Perry v Sidney Phillips & Sons (a firm) damages were awarded for the
distress, worry, inconvenience and trouble which the plaintiff had suffered
while living in the house he bought, owing to the defects which his surveyor
had overlooked. Lord DENNING MR considered that these consequences
were reasonably foreseeable. KERR LJ stated a narrower test:14
So far as the question of damages for vexation and inconvenience is
concerned, it should be noted that the deputy judge awarded these not for
the tension or frustration of a person who is involved in a legal dispute
in which the other party refuses to meet its liabilities. If he had done so,
it would have been wrong, because such aggravation is experienced by
almost all litigants. He awarded these damages because of the physical
consequences of the breach, which were all foreseeable at the time. The
fact that in such cases damages under this head may be recoverable, if
they have been suffered but not otherwise, is supported by the decision of
this court in Hutchinson v Harris. 195

506 Chapter 9 Discharge by Breach
[S. 73]
I am not convinced that it is enough to ask whether mental distress was
reasonably foreseeable as a consequence, or even whether it should rea-
sonably have been contemplated as not unlikely to result from a breach of
contract. It seems to me that damages for mental distress in contract are,
as a matter of policy, limited to certain classes of case. I would broadly
follow the classification provided by DILLON LJ in Bliss v South East
Thames Regional Health Authority: 197
... where the contract which has been broken was itself a contract to
provide peace of mind or freedom from distress...'
It may be that the class is somewhat wider than that. But it should not,
in my judgment, include any case where the object of the contract was not
comfort or pleasure, or the relief of discomfort, but simply carrying on a
commercial activity with a view to profit. So I would disallow the item of
damages for anguish and vexation.
The facts were that the defendant solicitor told the plaintiffs who were
shifting their motor repair garage that they would have the right of way
from the backside of the site. But that was not to be. The supposed passage
was very quickly blocked after completion of the purchase. The plaintiffs
were unable to carry on business without access to the site. They claimed
damages for wasted expenditure and for anguish and vexation. The court
held as follows:
The judge had been entitled in the circumstances to award damages on
the basis of comparing the plaintiffs' actual situation with the position in
which they would have been if they had never entered into the transaction
at all rather than with the position they would have been in had the trans-
action been successful. He had therefore been entitled to award damages
on the basis of the capital expenditure thrown away in the purchase of the
business and the expenses incurred. However, damages for anguish and
vexation arising out of a breach of contract were not recoverable unless
the object of the contract was to provide peace of mind or freedom from
distress and accordingly, were not recoverable for anguish and vexation
arising out of the breach of a purely commercial contract. It followed that
the damages would be reduced by the amount awarded for anguish and
vexation and to that extent the appeal would be allowed.198
The decision of the House of Lords in Kuddus v Chief Constable of
Leicestershire Constabulary" shows that limits set by the decision in
Addis may no longer keep arresting the progress of law. The decision of their

case it was proper to assess damages on the basis of what, on the balance of probabilities,
the plaintiffs would have probably done in the matter of investment if they had been properly
advised. Evidence showed that they would have reduced the investment.

Lordships in Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International200 is an
example of this forward movement. Stigma compensation was awarded in
this case to an aggrieved employee for an unworthy removal. A learned com-
mentator encompasses this development in the context of the law in Canada
in the following words201; "By contrast the Supreme Court of Canada has
now fully embraced it (the principle) in several recent cases and especially
in Whiten v Pilot Insurance Co202... It is still far from certain that punitive
damages will be awarded for 'pure' breach of contract between commer-
cial parties of similar commercial experience and sophistication, rather even
after Whitten it is still the case that such awards may be limited to situations
where hurt feelings or damaged peace of mind. are at stake, for example, in
wrongful dismissal or insurance claim denial cases respectively."
Compensation for non-pecuniary loss
The House of Lords in their decision in Farley v Skinner,203 held that there
is no reason why compensation for non-pecuniary damage should not be
allowed. In this case, the claimant was considering the purchase of a tranquil
country property. He instructed a surveyor to report on the volume of air-
craft noise in the area. The surveyor negligently reported that the property
was unlikely to be affected by the noise. The claimant bought the property
and subsequently discovered that it was significantly affected by such noise.
He stayed in the property and brought an action against the surveyor to
recover compensation for non-pecuniary loss caused by inconvenience, etc.
Their Lordships approved the award of £10,000 as damages for breach of a
contractual duty of care in respect of the survey report. Their Lordships said
that where a surveyor gives a contractual undertaking to investigate a mat-.
ter important to the buyer's peace of mind, the buyer is in principle entitled
to recover non-pecuniary damages for breach of that undertaking. There is
no reason why the scope of recovery should depend upon the object of the
contract as ascertained from all its constituent parts. It is sufficient that a
major or important object of the contract is to give pleasure, relaxation,
or peace of mind. Such a claim is also not barred by the fact that the sur-
veyor undertook only to exercise reasonable care rather than to guarantee
the achievement of a result. It would be a singularly unattractive result if a
professional person who undertakes a specific obligation to exercise reason-
able care to investigate a matter, which his client told him to be important,
could please himself even by non-performance when his very payment was
a part of the consideration for that performance. The fact that the claimant

nevertheless chose to stay there could not deprive him of his right because
it was no justification for the surveyor's breach of duty. Lord STEYN advised
a caution that awards of non-pecuniary damages should be restained and
modest. It is important that logical and beneficial developments in the law
should not contribute to the creation of a society bent on litigation.
Their Lordships cited the principle of law as stated by BINGHAM LJ in
Watts v Morrow 204 to the effect that a contract breaker is not in general
liable for any distress, frustration, anxiety, displeasure, vexation, tension, or
aggravation which his breach of contract may cause to the innocent party,
but that this rule is not an absolute one. It is based on a consideration of
policy. An exceptional category is where the very purpose of the contract
is to provide pleasure, relaxation, peace of mind, or freedom from moles-
tation. The learned Lord Justice, however added that a contract to survey
the condition of a house for a prospective purchaser does not fall within the
exceptional category and, therefore, in such cases damages would be recov-
erable only for physical inconvenience and discomfort caused by the breach.
It was observed in another case that sentences and phrases in a single
speech of a judge cannot be treated as if they were provisions in an Act of
Parliament. Judges are not supposed to frame definitions or to lay down
hard and fast rules.
An important development for this branch of the law was Ruxley
Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth,205 Laddingford Enclosures
Ltd v Forsyth. 206 The plaintiff specified that the swimming pool should at
the deep end be 7'6" deep. The contractor did not comply with this specifi-
cation. The pool had the depth of only the standard 6'. The House of Lords
found the usual "cost of cure" measure of damages to be wholly dispro-
portionate to the loss suffered and economically wasteful. Their Lordships
awarded the moderate sum of £2500 for the plaintiff's disappointment in
not receiving the swimming pool he desired. In Knott v Botton207 an archi-
tect was asked to design a wide staircase for a gallery and an impressive
entrance hall. He failed to do so. The plaintiff spent money in improving the
staircase to some extent and he recovered the cost of the changes. He also
claimed damages for disappointment and distress in the lack of an impres-
sive entrance hall. The Court of Appeal disallowed this part of the claim.
Housing service
The complainant filed a petition before the Monopolies and Restrictive
Trade Practices Commission against a Development Authority on the
grounds of excessive delay and failure to hand over possession of the plot.
Commission awarded, among other counts, Rs 50,000 as damages for men-
tal agony suffered by the complainant. The Supreme Court held that this

was an error on the part of the Commission. 208 In such cases, the court said,
the normal rule should apply which is that the vendor should pay damages
for the purchaser's loss of bargain by paying the market value of the prop-
erty at the time fixed for completion less the contract price. The purchaser
may claim loss of profit which he intended to make from a particular use
of the land if the vendor had actual or imputed knowledge of such use. For
delay in performance the normal nature of damages is the value of the use
of the land for the period of delay, viz., usually its rental value. Interest can
be awarded on equitable grounds in appropriate cases. The rate of interest
should neither be too high nor too low. Interest at the rate of 12 per cent p.a.
should be just and proper and would meet the ends of justice in this case.
Negligent surgical operation
A 24-year-old female was surgically operated for sterilisation. The opera-
tion was performed in a crude and primitive manner without administering
even local anaesthesia.
The doctor showed incompetence in cutting small intestine instead of
fallopian tube which became the direct cause of death. Rs 1,60,000 with 12
per cent interest were awarded. The amount was directed to be paid to the
husband and minor children of the deceased.209
Negligence in maintenance of electricity lines
Where the petitioner's sole son, who was blind, died of electrocution by
coming in contact with a pole which was live due to inefficient maintenance,
the Municipal Corporation was directed to pay Rs 50,000 with 12 per cent
interest.210
Contracts for providing peace of mind or preventing mental distress
But now the principle is revolving round to this that in every proper case
damages for mental distress can be recovered.
Photographer's failure to appear at wedding
In a Scottish case, a photographer who had agreed to take photographs
at a wedding, failed in breach of his contract to appear there. As a result the
bride had no photographs of her wedding. She was allowed damages for the
resulting injury to her feelings.211
Failure by band to attend wedding reception

The band was to play for four hours during the reception, the meal and then
for dancing. Such music was part of the expected hospitality. On the day, the
band-master telephoned, half-an-hour after they should have arrived, to say
that they had broken down 200 miles away and were not coming. Friends
of the host assisted him by arranging two local musicians and by playing
tapes but that was started later and was no proper substitute for the band.
It was held that a daughter's wedding is a very special day for any father.
It was a matter of personal prestige for the father to offer the special band
as part of his hospitality to both sides' families and his many business and
social friends and he suffered a considerable humiliation by the events. The
court ordered refund of advance deposit and £800 as general damages for
disappointment and humiliation.212
Cancellation of wedding reception
A motel was booked for the plaintiff's daughter's wedding reception to
which 105 guests had been invited. The motel contracted to provide a three-
course meal, sherry reception and a room where a band would play for
dancing. The motel cancelled this 48 hours before the wedding. The only
alternative was a small function room at a public house where a cold buffet
was laid on. The room was cramped and there was no space for dancing. It
was held that an only daughter's wedding reception is of unique importance
for a parent. General damages of £750 were awarded for inconvenience and
disappointment plus £265 special damages for the cancellation fee of the
band and telephone calls to notify guests of the changed venue. 213
Holiday cases
In Jarvis v Swan Tours Ltd214 Lord DENNING MR described the principle
that damages cannot be recovered for mental pain and suffering caused by
the breach to be out of date.
The plaintiff wanted to spend his holidays. He was attracted by the
representations held out by a tourist agency that certain kind of facilities,
recreation, company, etc., would be provided by them on tours conducted
by them. The promises turned out to be unreal and the plaintiff was much
disappointed. He was allowed damages for disappointed expectations,
the court saying that in a proper case damages for mental distress can be
recovered and one such case is a contract for holiday.

ard of accommodation", but in fact it had inadequate toilet and bathing facilities, exposed
electric wiring and was in a very poor decorative order. It was booked for skiing holiday, but
the slopes were at some distance and the bus service was erratic. Following kinds of damages
were awarded: £125 for loss of enjoyment and diminution in the value of the holiday; £400
for extra stress, worry and responsibility.

Measure of damages 511
His Lordship laid down: "In a proper case damages for mental distress
can be recovered in contract just as damages for shock can be recovered
in tort. One such case is a contract for a holiday, or any other contract to
provide entertainment. If the contracting party breaks his contract, damage
can be given for disappointment, the distress, the upset and the frustra-
tion caused by the breach. (Such loss may be) difficult to assess in terms of
money, but it is no more difficult than the assessment which the courts have
to make everyday in personal injury cases for loss of amenities."
This was followed in Jackson v Horizon Holidays:215
The plaintiff entered into a contract for a holiday for himself, his wife
and two children. In many material respects the defendant failed to pro-
vide the holiday in accordance with their description. The court allowed
damages not merely for the distress to the plaintiff but also for the wife
and children.
A Canadian court allowed damages for mental distress where a motor
home was contracted to be borrowed to the defendant's knowledge for hol-
iday purposes and he failed to provide it. 216 Where the buyer communicated
to the seller that one of his reasons for buying the car was a forthcoming
touring holiday but problems with the car spoilt the holiday. The disap-
pointment of a spoilt holiday was a substantial element in the award sanc-
tioned by the Court of Appeal.217
Package tour
The tourist agency owes responsibility not only for its own services but
also for services hired from others for further stages of the package. The
plaintiff booked a package tour of mainland China for his daughter. The
service was offered by a Hong Kong travel company. At the border with
mainland China, the tour was joined by a guide of a Chinese travel com-
pany. One of the items was to visit and cross a lake. The party missed the
ferry. An alternative arrangement was made by hiring a speedboat of a third
agency. The boat was small. It could carry only eight at one time out of 24.
The driver of the boat completed two trips and refused to go for the third.
Another employee of the third agency was to drive the boat. This driver
negligently operated too fast, caused a crash in which the plaintiff's daugh-
ter was thrown overboard and lost in drowning. The original Hong Kong
agency tried to save its skin by saying that the tragedy was not due to any act
on the part of their employees. Holding them liable the court said:218
215. (1975) 1 WLR 1468 (CA). Thirty-three hours dislocation caused to a tourist party being con-
ducted under package holiday which obstruction was due to air traffic control problems, was
held to be not a breach and, therefore, an action for inconvenience was dismissed. Compton

512 Chapter 9 Discharge by Breach
[S. 73]
"Taking the contract as a whole their Lordships consider that the first
defendant here undertook to provide and not merely to arrange all the
services included in the programme, even if some activities were to be car-
ried out by others. The first defendant's obligation under the contract that
the services would be provided with reasonable skill and care remains
even if some of the services were to be rendered by others, and even if
tortious liability may exist on the part of those others."
Solicitor's failure
The principle is now no more confined to holiday cases. The decision of
the English Court of Appeal in Heywood v Wellers (a firm)219 has rendered
it to be a principle of general import.
The plaintiff engaged a firm of solicitors to obtain an injunction against
a man who was harassing her. The solicitors obtained an injunction but
failed to bring the man before the court when he molested her again with
the result that the harassment remained unabated.
She was allowed to recover damages from the solicitors for the conse-
quential mental anguish. The court expressed the opinion that this kind of
loss is no different from any other loss, for any reasonable man could have
foreseen that continued molestation would cause further mental distress.
JAMES J proceeded as follows:
It is also the law that where, at the time of making a contract, it is
within the contemplation of the contracting parties that a foreseeable
result of a breach of the contract will be to cause vexation, frustration
or distress, then if a breach occurs which does bring about that result,
damages are recoverable under that heading. Not in every case of breach
of contract on the part of a solicitor towards his client will damage be
recoverable under this head. It is only when the services contracted for
are such that both solicitor and client contemplate that a failure by the
solicitor to perform the contract will foreseeably occasion vexation, frus-
tration or distress.
A solicitor was employed by the client to prevent removal by the father
of the client's children from the United Kingdom. The solicitor accordingly
notified the passport agency but failed to renew the notification. The father
added children to his passport and took them away. The mother sued the
solicitor. The court said that the solitor's failure to renew the notification
was a breach of contractual duty. There was a casual connection between
the negligence and removal of the twins from UK. The fact that damages.

ered for the solicitor's failure to get possession of premises for his client but not damages for
annoyance and mental distress.

for loss of a child's company were not recoverable in tort, did not mean
that there could be no recovery under contract too. A claim founded on a
contract which had the object of providing pleasure, relaxation, peace of
mind or freedom from molestation is an exception to the general rule that
the contract breaker cannot be made liable for damages for injured feelings
or distress. Accordingly, she was entitled to recover damages for mental
distress.220
Loss of pets due to carrier's negligence
This principle was applied by a Canadian court to the distress caused by
the loss of a pet due to a carrier's negligence.221
The plaintiffs wanted to carry their two pet dogs with them in the
flight. The plaintiffs were willing to pay for the entire first class section
of the aircraft for the purpose of keeping their pets with them. But the
defendants did not agree to that. They told the plaintiffs that the pets
would be carried in the cargo compartment and assured that they would
arrive in the first class condition. But, as the luck would have it, the pets
happened to be placed next to a container of dry ice which threw out
fumes. One pet perished and the other was taken ill.
The plaintiff successfully claimed damages, apart from, for the loss of the
dog, for "the anguish and sadness".
Demotion of employee without reasonable cause
Where an employee was relegated without appropriate cause to a position
of lesser responsibility in breach of contract, it was held that since, it must
have been in the contemplation of the parties that the breach, without rea-
sonable cause, would expose the plaintiff to the vexation, frustration and
distress which he had suffered, the plaintiff was entitled to damages of five
hundred pounds. The plaintiff had become depressed, anxious, frustrated
and ill.
Delay in payment
The person whose payment is delayed is entitled to loss of interest on the
money. Where an insurer made payment of the life policy money one-and-a-

income to be below £5000. He issued a cheque for £4500. The building
society happened wrongly to dishonour this cheque. He claimed substantial
damages.
The Court of Appeal was of the view that it was too late in time (1996)
to draw a distinction between traders and non-traders for the purposes of
assessment of compensation for loss of honour in respect of general damages
flowing from the dishonour of a cheque. The court said:223
The credit rating of individuals is as important for their personal trans-
actions, including mortgages and hire-purchase as well as banking facil-
ities, as it is for those who are engaged in trade, and it is notorious that
central registers are now kept. I would have no hesitation in holding that
what is in effect a presumption of some damage arises in every case, inso-
far as this is a presumption of fact.
Trade secrets
Intellectual property rights include trade secrets, confidential informa-
tion, know-how, patents, trade marks, copyrights, designs, etc. These rights
do not have any physical corpus. They are intangible. They are the creations
of brain and constitute a vital business property in the competitive market
economy. A complete protection of such rights is necessary for encourage-
ment of creative and innovative abilities. The protection afforded by law is
exemplified in the following statement in Charlesworth:224
Intellectual property rights overlap, protecting different facets of a
product, for example, the product itself may be patented, its method of
manufacture may be protected as a trade secret; sales literature and soft-
ware used to run the product, may be protected by copyright; its shape
or configuration may be protected by new design right; and its name by
a trade mark.
The usual remedies for breach of confidence are: action for an account
of earnings from the use of the information; action for damages and an
injunction for prevention of misuse. For an action to succeed it would be
necessary to show that there was information of confidential nature which
was shared under an obligation of confidence with the person proceeded
against and that there was an actual or threatened use or disclosure of the
information. If the information has already become a part of public knowl-
edge, no action may lie. Every information or general knowledge of facts
which comes to be picked up by an employee cannot be labelled as trade
secret or confidential information. A TV personality who left employment
of one company and joined another which proposed to establish a competi-
tive business could not be restrained from doing so only for the fear that he

might use his experience gained in the first employment in promoting the
business of the next employer. 225
There is an implied term in a contract of employment that an employee
may not make use of his employer's trade secrets. An employee who comes in
touch with such information can be restrained from using it to the prejudice
of his employer's interest. 226 Secrets may also be shared with a collaborator
on the condition that the company shall maintain secrecy of all the technical
information and that it should obtain corresponding secret arrangements
from its employees. 227
An injunction can be issued against a third party also with whom the for-
mer employee gets new employment from using or further using any infor-
mation of confidential nature provided to him by the employee in breach
of his duty of confidence. If he still persists even after getting notice of the
breach of confidence, he can be held liable in damages for the use of an intel-
lectual property which did not belong to him.
Damages for breach of confidence
Damages are also allowed for breach of confidence.
Three actresses formed a rock group. They conceived an idea of pro-
ducing a television serial, based on their experience, to focus attention on
their individual and group life so as to contrast their collective charac-
ter with their individual character. The idea was conveyed in the course
of oral negotiations to a television company. This resulted in a written
agreement which provided some payment to the ladies but forbade the
company from using the idea unless the ladies were given the opportunity
to act and they declined it. Without giving the opportunity, the company
produced the programme with great commercial success.
The company was held liable in damages to the ladies. The agreement
contained an implied negative covenant. The circumstances in which it was
communicated imported an obligation of confidence. The content of the
idea was clearly identifiable, original, of potential commercial attractiveness
and capable of reaching fruition.228

In a case before the House of Lords: a partnership firm imported goods
and sold them to customers in the United Kingdom. Its principal customer
was EB. The firm and EB were banking with the defendant bank. The same
bank used to issue transferable letters of credit. Though EB was in touch
with the details, it did not know the prices being paid by the firm to its sup-
pliers. The bank had to send certain documents to the firm but by mistake
sent them to EB from where EB came to know of the firm's profits margins
and stopped taking the material from the firm. The firm sued the Bank for
wrongful disclosure of confidential information. It was held that the loss
of profits on repeat business was not too remote. The firm was entitled to
recover the amount equal to the profits lost during the period for which the
business was likely to have continued with EB. Their Lordships upheld the
award which the judge had made, on a reducing basis extending over a four-
year period. 229
Injunction to restrain breach of confidence
Where damages would not be an appropriate remedy, an injunction may
be issued against improper use of confidence. An illustration is Attorney
General v Barker, 230
The first defendant was employed in the royal household between 1980
and 1983 on terms which included a contractual undertaking not to dis-
close, publish or reveal any incident, conversation or information concern-
ing any member of the royal family or any visitor or guest which came to
his knowledge during his employment or any information relating to his
employment in the royal service unless duly authorised in writing to do
so. The undertaking was perpetual and worldwide and the first defendant
expressly acknowledged that it included an agreement on his part not to
publish any such matter in any book. The second defendant, which was a
Canadian company controlled by the first defendant, planned to publish
in the United Kingdom a book written by the first defendant about his
service in the royal household. The book was a flagrant breach of the first
defendant's undertaking. The first defendant having refused to comply
with the terms of his undertaking, the Attorney General issued a writ
applying for worldwide injunctions against the defendants restraining
publication of the book.
The court held as follows: The Attorney General's claim was not based
on a breach of confidentiality but on a breach of contract, the consideration
for the covenant by the first defendant not to publish matters concerning his
experiences in the royal household being the agreement to take him on the
staff of the royal household and to pay him wages or a salary. Accordingly,
compensation depends upon circumstances among which mental pain and suffering is one
factor.

the first defendant had for a consideration entered into a negative covenant
which was limited neither territorially nor in time and such a covenant was
enforceable provided it could not be attacked for obscurity, illegality or on
public policy grounds such as being in restraint of trade. The covenant was
not void on any ground of public policy or on the ground that it restricted
the freedom of expression abroad contrary to Article 10 of the Convention.
for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in the
circumstances the balance of justice required that an interlocutory injunc-
tion having extra-territorial effect be granted against both defendants.
It was contended in a case before the Bombay High Court that what
was conveyed to the other party was an idea in the abstract without any con-
crete shape. The Division Bench did not agree with the contention and cited
the following passage from Copinger and Skone James on COPYRIGHT:232
"There is a broad and developing equitable doctrine that he who has
received information in confidence shall not take unfair advantage of it
or profit from the wrongful use or publication of it. He must not make
any use of it to the prejudice of him who gave it, without obtaining his
consent or, at any rate, without paying him for it. It has for long been
clear that the Courts can restrain a breach of confidence arising out of a
contract or any right to property.... The ground of equitable intervention
is that it is unconscionable for a person who has received information
on the basis that it is confidential subsequently to reveal that informa-
tion. Acceptance of information on the basis that it will be kept secret
affects the conscience of the recipient of the information. In general it is
in the public interest that confidences should be respected, even where the
consider can point to specific financial detriment to himself. If a defend-
ant is proved to have used confidential information, directly or indirectly
obtained from a plaintiff without his consent, express or implies, he will
be guilty of an infringement of the plaintiff's rights."
In another case before it, the Bombay High Court said that confiden-
tiality was to cover only such information about which the parties had
agreed in writing that it would be confidential and not every other piece of
information, 233
Injunction for restraining breach of contract
A supply system to the Army which had been going on since 1960 was not

of equality of opportunity. Before issuing such an order some explanation

should have been called for. The court would not interfere in the matter if it
is decided again by giving opportunity to the supplier.2
Injunction for restraining alienation of property
The petitioners succeed under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996 in making out a prima facie case of and balance of convenience
in their favour and, therefore, an injunction was issued restraining the
respondent from disposing of property which was comprised in the asset
purchase agreement.235
Writ remedy against termination of dealership
A dealership agreement was terminated by reason of breaches on the part
of the dealer. He applied for a writ against the order expecting that contrac-
tual obligations should be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The
court refused to entertain the petition. The matter related to contract, trade
and business. It should be adjudicated through an appropriate civil action.216
Termination of contract by Government and writ remedy
The foreign company to whom the contract for construction of a public
road was awarded could not complete the project within the stipulated time
inspite of the fact that sufficient time and opportunity was provided for
the same. The Government terminated the contract in accordance with its
stipulations. This was questioned in a writ. The court found that the termi-
nation had become necessary in public interest. There was no violation of
Article 14 and, therefore, no scope for interference.237
An Authority which had granted a flyover contract to the writ petitioner
arbitrarily rescinded it. The contractor's writ petition against it was held to
be maintainable. A writ court is not always bound to relegate the aggrieved
party to a civil suit and that merely because the other party has raised a
factual dispute. The mere raising of a dispute about a fact does not make
it a disputed fact. The writ court can go into such an attempt at disputing
things, adjudicate it and grant appropriate relief.238
Direction for payment in writ jurisdiction
The work was performed by the contractor in accordance with the appli-
cable terms and conditions as prescribed by the State Government. The
amount of payment which was due for the completed work was admitted
by the State Authority. The court said that it was not appropriate for the
State instrumentality to avoid payment of admitted amount and compel the

contractor to pursue the conventional and cumbersome alternative remedy.
Directions for payment could be issued in writ jurisdiction. 239 On the com-
pletion of a Government contract, the Government becomes liable for pay-
ment of the amount accrued to the contractor. He gets a legal right to invoke
the jurisdiction of the writ court praying for mandamus for direction to the
Government to make payment of the admitted outstandings. 240
Withdrawal of letter of intent and writ remedy
A letter of intent was issued in favour of the petitioner for granting him
a retail outlet for sale of petroleum products. The letter was subsequently
withdrawn without assigning any reasons. This was held to fall foul of
Article 14 of the Constitution. The court said that in appropriate cases it
could interfere in contract matters in the exercise of writ jurisdiction. The
respondent was directed to restore the letter of intent and take further steps
in accordance with the law and prescribed procedure.241
Waiver and writ remedy
Waiver of credit guarantee commission charges, rebate and concessional
rates of interest were held to be a part of the terms of loan. They were con-
tractual matters between the parties. Any dispute as to such matters could
be resolved through a civil suit and not under writ jurisdiction.242
Non-performance of Government contract by contractor and writ
A foreign company contracting with the Government failed to complete
the road building projects within the stipulated periods. Sufficient time and
opportunities were afforded to the company to amend defaults. But it could
not do so. Termination of the contract by the Government in accordance
with contract stipulations was held to be justified in public interest. There
was no violation of Article 14 and no occasion for issuing a writ. 243

In Doyle v Nichols the court took into account the likely impact of
inflation while awarding damages to the widow of a doctor in respect of

into account as best as it could. In this case the victim of the accident was a
salaried employee. His salary would have naturally increased according to
the rate of inflation. His dependents would suffer obvious injustice if their
dependency figure was not increased accordingly.
In the case of the sale of a flat, long period of time running up to 20 years
elapsed before relief could be obtained. Taking the calculation from the date
of breach, the real estate valuation had increased manifold times. Damages
were accordingly awarded with interest at the rate of 15 per cent per annum
from the time of breach till date. 246
Duty to mitigate [S. 73 (Explanation)]
The explanation attached to Section 73 provides for the duty to mitigate
damages. It says:
In estimating the loss or damage arising from a breach of contract,
the means which existed of remedying the inconvenience caused by the
non-performance of the contract must be taken into account. The injured
party has to make reasonable efforts to avoid the losses resulting from the
breach so that his loss is kept to the minimum. The most frequent appli-
cation of this rule takes place in contracts for sale or purchase of goods.
On the buyer's refusal to take delivery, the seller should resell the goods at
the prevailing market price and he may then recover from the defaulting
buyer as damages the difference between the price he realised and the
price he would have received under the contract.247 If the seller does not
resell the goods and his loss is aggravated by the falling market, he cannot
recover the enhanced loss. The well-known authority for this proposition
is the decision of the Privy Council in A.K.A.S. Jamal v Moolla Dawood
Sons & Co.248
The plaintiff contracted to sell to the defendants 23,500 shares to be
delivered and paid for on December 30, 1911. The shares were tendered
on this date, but the defendants declined to take delivery or to pay for
them. At the market price for sales upon that day, the shares would have
realised Rs 1,09,218 less than their price under the contract. But the plain-
tiff sold the shares only after February when the market was again rising
and he realised only Rs 79,862 less than the price under the contract. The
defendants contended that they should be held liable to pay the loss of
only Rs 79,862. But he was held liable for Rs 1,09,218. Lord WRENBURY
explained the principles of law thus: It is undoubted law that a plaintiff
who sues for damages owes the duty of taking all reasonable steps to mit-
igate the loss subsequent upon the breach and cannot claim as damages
any sum which is due to his own neglect. But the loss to be ascertained

is the loss at the date of the breach. If at that date the plaintiff could do
something or did something which mitigated the damage, the defendant
is entitled to the benefit of it.249 If the seller retains the shares after the
breach he cannot recover from the buyer any further loss if the market
falls, nor is he liable to have the damages reduced if the market rises.
Where goods were sold 4 months after breach in a crashing market,
that was held to be not reasonable and F.C.I. was allowed to recover only
nominal damages. Forfeiture of the earnest money of Rs 1000 was consid-
ered to be sufficient.250
Similarly, where a seller refuses to perform the contract, the buyer should
buy the goods if they are available from any alternative source and cannot
recover any further loss that may be due to his own neglect.251
Auction sales and duty of mitigation
In the application of the duty of mitigation to sales through auction, it
has been held that if the highest bidder backs out, and as compared with the
bids at reauction the bid of the next higher bidder at the original auction was
much greater and if the right to sell the goods to him was still held in reserve
(in this case his earnest money was still not refunded) the goods should be
offered to him and the difference can be recovered from the defaulting bid-
der. The Municipality was allowed to recover nothing in this case because
instead of accepting the next higher bid, the goods were reauctioned at a
very low value, is
Contract of employment and duty of mitigation
The duty of mitigation also finds application in reference to premature
termination of a contract of employment. Thus, where on account of the
retirement of two out of four partners, a partnership firm was ended and
with it the services of the manager but the remaining two partners recon-
stituted the firm and offered him employment on identical terms which he
refused to accept and instead brought an action for damages, it was held
that he should have accepted the employment in mitigation of his loss and
that he was entitled to nominal damages only, 253

[S. 73]
But where no alternative employment of equal standing is available to
him, the ex-employer cannot ask that he should have mitigated his loss by
accepting a lesser job. The Bombay High Court in K.G. Hiranandani v
Bharat Barrel & Drum Mfg Co P Ltd254 explained the real nature of the
duty of mitigation. VIMAD LAL J said:
Though what the Explanation enacts is popularly called the 'rule'
in regard to mitigation of damages, and has been so referred to even in
decided cases and standard works, and though it is loosely called a "duty"
to mitigate, the position really is, as our legislature has rightly stated,
merely this, that what the Explanation means is not in the nature of an
independent rule or duty but is merely a factor to be taken into account in
assessing the damages naturally arising from the breach, for the purpose
of the main part of Section 73.
The learned Judge then adopted a passage from MAYNE ON DAMAGES 259
to the effect that the expression is somewhat loose one, since there is no duty
which is actionable or which is owed to anyone by the plaintiff, and contin-
ued to say that the proper construction of the explanation is that the means,
if any, of remedying the inconvenience caused by the breach of contract are
factors that go to reduce the damages that might otherwise have arisen "nat-
urally" from the breach.
Explaining the principle'relating to damages arising from breach of a con-
tract of employment, the learned Judge held that "there is abundant author-
ity for the proposition that in cases in which the contract of employment
was for a fixed period, the normal measure of damages would be the salary
for the whole of the unexpired period of service. The principle of awarding
damages for a reasonable period or reasonable period of notice comes into
play only when the contract of employment is not for a fixed period." The
learned Judge found support in the decision of the Supreme Court in S.S.
Shetty v Bharat Nidhi Ltd256 where BHAGWATI J delivering the judgment of
the Bench observed (obiter) that if the contract of employment is for a spe-
cific term, the servant would be entitled to damages the amount of which
would be measured, prima facie and subject to the rule of mitigation, by the
salary of which the master has deprived him. 257

Measure of damages 523
On the facts of the case, the employer contended that the dismissed
employee did not make any serious effort to find an alternative employment.
Referring to this the learned Judge said that the defendant cannot impose
new and extraordinary duties on the aggrieved party; nor can he ask him to
take up just any and every employment that may be available to him, e.g.,
the employee is not expected to accept an employment in a lower status,
nor will he be expected to go to a different part of the country or in a dif-
ferent type of work. In conclusion the learned Judge said that there was no
evidence to show that a job similar to that of a general manager of a factory
with somewhat similar status and pay scale as well as nature of work was
available at or about the time when the breach occurred.
The burden is on the defendant to show the availability of an alternative
job of equal status. It is not for the plaintiff to show the absence of such
opportunities. The court can take notice of the fact that jobs are not a mar-
ket commodity which can be bought at convenience. WADHWA J of the Delhi
High Court permitted the plaintiff to prove for the purpose of calculating
his compensation any remuneration which was being paid to him in addition
to the amount mentioned in the contract. 258
Stigma compensation
An employee of a bank, which failed, was not allowed to maintain an
action against the bank for damages for loss of reputation in the financial
services industry by reason of belonging to a bank of that kind, though the
damage to the reputation was such that he was not able to get employment
in that industry.259
It became clear from this case that an action could lie at common law
under the heading "stigma damages" representing the damage done to repu-
tation. A claim of this kind was raised in BCCI v Ali.260 The bank had ren-
dered a number of employees redundant. They were required to sign a form
of release under which they made the bank free of all their claims against
it connected with the termination of their employment. They subsequently
claimed "stigma damages" arguing that their image had been tarnished
because of their association with the bank and its fraudulent activities. The
trial court was of the view that it could not be said that the bank was under
a duty of disclosure regarding the manner in which it had conducted its

not apply to a state of facts of which the releaser was unaware at the time.
It would be unconscionable to hold him bound to such a state of things. A
commentator on this decision has expressed the following lurking fear: "If
the Court of Appeal's decision is correct, then very many of these settle-
ments could be set aside with huge repercussions throughout the industry
for the finality of these settlements. Finality in the face of potential litigation
is of course a cornerstone of English law in this area."261
Advantage out of one's own wrong not allowed
The rule that a person cannot be permitted to take advantage of his own
wrong is a rule of construction rather than a principle of law and therefore
it can be excluded by express terms of the contract. Accordingly, damages
for loss of share option cannot be claimed by an employee who is wrong-
fully dismissed shortly before becoming entitled to exercise the option if the
option scheme expressly stated that the option was to lapse if the employee
ceased to be employed by the employer. The option-holder is not entitled
to any compensation for loss of the option if the option-holder ceased to
be employed by the company for any reason whatsoever. Furthermore, the
court said that the termination of a contract of employment destroys the
status or relationship between the employer and employee, although cer-
tain aspects of the contract may continue to exist, and since the option to
purchase the employer company's shares depended upon the status or rela-
tionship of the employer to the employee it no longer continued in existence
when the employee was dismissed.262
Aggrieved party increasing loss by unreasonable conduct
Where the aggrieved party increases his loss by unreasonable conduct, he
cannot hold the defendant liable for the same. For example, in Derbishire
v Warran263 the plaintiff's car was damaged due to defendant's negligence.
The plaintiff got the car repaired at a cost which was double the value
of a new equally good substitute car. The Court of Appeal did not allow
him to recover the difference between the insurance money and the cost
of repair, but allowed the difference between the insurance money and the
market value of the car. HARMAN LJ distinguished the case from O'Grady
v Westminster Scaffolding Ltd™ª where the plaintiff was held entitled to the
cost of repairing his car at a cost considerably exceeding its market value,
because the car was unique and could not be replaced.
The duty to mitigate damages in its essence means that the court can
take into account the conduct of the injured party so as to see what he

ought in reason to have done, whereby his loss has been or would have been,
diminished. 265 The substance of the rule was also indicated by the House of
Lords in British Westinghouse Electric & Mfg Co v Underground Electric
Railway Co of London, 266 where Lord HALDANE said:
The fundamental basis thus is compensation for pecuniary loss natu-
rally flowing from the breach; but this first principle is qualified by a sec-
ond, which imposes on a plaintiff the duty of taking all reasonable steps
to mitigate the loss consequent on the breach, and debars him from claim-
ing any part of the damage which is due to his neglect to take such steps.
Where a five star hotel accommodation was booked six months in
advance to suit personal and family needs and though on account of heavy
booking and rush the hotel was not able to provide the accommodation,
they did arrange an alternative accommodation which the guest rejected, she
was given refund of the whole money she had paid and was not allowed to
recover anything more,267
Thus, what matters is the reasonableness of the conduct of the injured
party. A characteristic illustration is Payzu Ltd v Saundars.249
268
In a contract of sale of goods, delivery was to be in instalments over a
period of nine months and payment was to be made within one month of
delivery. The buyer failed to pay for the first instalment within the stated
time. The seller refused to deliver any further instalments but offered to
do so if cash was paid against each delivery.
The buyer sued him for breach of contract claiming as damages the differ-
ence between the contract and market prices. The seller contended that if the
buyer had accepted their proposal of deliveries against cash, their loss would
have been less. The question, therefore, was what a prudent person ought to
have done in the circumstances. The court laid down that the buyer should
have considered the proposal. "The plaintiffs were in fact in a position to
pay cash for the goods, but, instead of accepting the defendant's offer, which

was made perfectly bona fide, the plaintiffs permitted themselves to sustain
a larger measure of loss which as prudent and reasonable people they ought
to have avoided."
Transactions concerning property
This result would not follow everywhere. Suppose that a buyer agrees to
buy property having a certain quality and the seller delivers property with-
out that quality. There is a difference between the market value of the prop-
erty with that quality and without it. The buyer is clearly entitled to recover
the difference between the two values. Suppose further that the seller in
response to the buyer's notice proposes to buy back the property and refund
the price, but the buyer refuses. Does he lose the right to recover the dif-
ference between the two values? The Court of Appeal answered in Strutt v
Whitnell where facts of this kind were involved, that the buyer would be
entitled to retain the property and to recover the difference between the val-
ues. The seller cannot compel him to forgo his right to substantial damages
as the price of retaining what has become his own property. The seller can-
not say that the buyer had no good reason for refusing to accept his offer to
buy back the property. "The buyer is entitled to retain his property without
any investigation of his reasons for wishing to do so and that his right to
recover the difference between the two values is not contingent on his having
acted reasonably in the matter of the seller's offer to repurchase."
In such cases the option is with the buyer either to retain the goods and
recover the difference or to return the goods against refund of price and then
sue for damages for breach, if any. The seller cannot impose the choice of the
option upon the buyer. The court distinguished this case from the decision
in the Payzu case where the goods had not been delivered in breach of the
contract and were offered on different terms.
Section 73 is universally applicable to property transactions also. There is
no other special provision about such transactions. In England, however, it
was held by the House of Lords in the early case of Bain v Fothergill that
a purchaser of real estate cannot recover damages for the loss of his bargain.
He is entitled to refund of his deposit and to the recovery of his expenses.
The vendor, who was deceiving him may be sued for the tort of deceit for the
consequences of deception in not providing good title or in making a prom-
ise without the intention of performing it. In India, on the other hand, it has

been judicially observed that "the legislature has not prescribed a different
measure of damages in the case of contracts dealing with land from that laid
down in the case of contracts relating to commodities", 273 So a frustrated.
purchaser of immovable property in India is entitled to damages equal to the
amount of loss arising naturally in the usual course of things from the breach
itself subject, of course, to the duty of mitigation. 24 The court said: "As
Section 73 imposes no exception on the ordinary law as to damages, what-
ever be the subject-matter of the contract, it seems that in cases of breach of
contract for sale of immovable property through inability on the vendor's
part to make a good title the damages must be assessed in the usual way,
unless it can be shown that the parties to the contract expressly or impliedly
contracted that this should not render the vendor liable in damages." Some
other High Courts have expressed similar views.275 Accordingly, where the
vendor guaranteed a good title but even so the vendee was evicted, the latter
was allowed to recover the value of the land at the date of eviction and not
merely refund of price.276
The contract was for the provision of premises of certain nature which
were prepared for a special purpose on lease for a minimum period of
three years. The lessee returned the premises earlier. The court allowed
lease money to be recovered for the full period of three years irrespective of
the fact that no lease deed was executed. 277 Where the sale of property fell
through because of the lack of title on the part of the seller, it was held in a
suit for damages that the fact that the buyer had enjoyed the entire property
for some period and also received rents, had to be taken into account while
computing damages. The buyer had claimed refund of half the consideration
paid by him. The same was allowed to him.278
Negligent valuation
The plaintiffs lost a huge sum of money because they happened to allow
loans to purchasers of commercial property on the basis of valuation report
given by the defendant. The valuation was negligently done. The loss became
aggravated because of the collapse of the property market. The Court of

Appeal allowed recovery of the whole amount lost. The court said that once
it is established "that the valuer's negligence led the lender to make a loan,
he would not otherwise have made it seems to us that the lender is entitled
to be compensated for all the damage he has suffered. If the market moves
upwards, the valuer reaps the benefit; if it moves downwards, he stands to
lose."279
Aggrieved party not to be inflicted with unusual burdens
The duty of mitigation cannot impose upon the plaintiff burdens of unu-
sual nature. There was a transfer of a part of a plot of land, the transferee
undertaking to erect a boundary wall, which wall would have increased the
value of the seller's remaining land. The buyer failed to erect the wall. In an
action against him, the measure of damages would have been the cost of
constructing the wall. He contended that if the wall had been constructed by
the plaintiff as soon as there was the breach, the cost would have been much
less; the plaintiff waited till the decision in the case and, in the meantime,
inflation had escalated the cost. The defendant contended that he should not
be held liable for the increased cost. The court felt that it was reasonable for
the plaintiff to wait as long as his right to damages was disputed and there
was no injustice to the defendant if the result of inflation was to increase the
pecuniary amount of his ultimate liability. 280
Reluctance of courts to expand scope of duty of mitigation
Thus courts have shown a great reluctance in expanding the dimensions
of the duty of mitigation.
The distributor of a dress manufacturer agreed to purchase a given
number of garments in two seasons. He had complete freedom to choose
garments of any variety and to resell them in his area at any price. The
distributor repudiated the contract. He was sued for breach. He argued
that he should be called upon to pay damages for manufacturer's loss of
profits on their cheapest garments, because he had the freedom to choose
any garments.
The court said that since it could not have been in the contemplation of
the parties that the distributor would stock only the minimum priced gar-
ments, which would have been destructive of their market, damages must
be computed on the basis of a reasonable criterion which should also be the
least unfavourable to the distributor.281

Measure of damages 529
[S. 73]
Contributory negligence
In contract claims the duty to keep one's loss to the minimum is capable
of taking care of the matter where the loss is either caused or increased by
the claimant's contributory negligence. But where the defendant's liability in
contract is the same as his liability in the tort of negligence, independent of
the existence of any contract, the court has power to apportion blame and
to reduce the damages recoverable by the plaintiff even though the claim is
made in contract. This approach was adopted in a principal's action against
his agent for breach of agent's duty in circumstances in which the princi-
pal failed to rectify the matters during the subsequent opportunities avail-
able to him.282 The defence of contributory negligence is not available as
against a claim for damages which is founded on a strictly contractual obli-
gation. A contractor was engaged for cleaning of roofs made of corrugated
asbestos sheets. He did not properly control the asbestos discharge. The
refuse contaminated the premises necessitating extensive remedial works.
As against the owners' action for damages, the contractor contended that
the owners were also negligent because their architectural department did
not provide proper supervision of the work. The court found that the own-
ers' claim was only in contract being based on a breach of two contractual
terms. The defence of contributory negligence would not apply to such a
claim.283
Arbitrator's award
The contract was for supply of batteries to a count of more than 15 lakhs.
The suppliers guaranteed the performance and life of each battery. But the
batteries did not work up to the guaranteed period. The arbitrator passed
an award reducing the price proportionately on the basis of a representative
sample pre-estimating the loss in the light of the formula stipulated in the
contract clause. The court held the award to be proper.284
Recovery of damages as arrears of land revenue
The Supreme Court has upheld the validity of a clause in a Government
contract which authorised the State to recover damages as arrears of land
revenue. 285 Where there was no such clause recovery of dues under a con-
tract by way of arrears of land revenue was not allowed. 286

Exclusion of Section 73: Arbitration clause
[S. 74]
Whether in the context of terms and conditions of a contract it is per-
missible to provide that Section 73 would not apply and the special terms
of the contract should be applied for making out recoverable loss, the court
said that it depends upon the appreciation of the facts of the case and if the
arbitrator had followed the special provision, no fault in his award could be
found for that reason alone. 287
English Law
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND PENALTY [S. 74]
The parties to a contract may determine beforehand the amount of com-
pensation payable in the event of breach. According to English law a sum so
fixed may fall in any of the following two categories:
(1) Liquidated damages, or
(2) Penalty.
If the sum fixed represents a genuine pre-estimate of the probable damage
that is likely to result from the breach, it is liquidated damages. A sum less
than the amount of probable damage is also regarded as liquidated dam-
ages. The whole of such sum is recoverable.28 A well-known illustration is
Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd.289
A manufacturer of tyres supplied a quantity of tyres to a dealer on the
condition that they would not be sold below the list prices and that liqui-
dated damages, not penalty, of £5 would be payable for every tyre sold
in breach of the agreement. The dealer committed breach. The question
was whether the above sum was intended as a genuine compensation for
the loss suffered.
The House of Lords held it to be liquidated damages. Lord DUNEDIN
stated the effect of cases in the following propositions:
(1) The expression used by the parties is not conclusive. The court must
find out whether the payment stipulated is in truth a penalty or liqui-
dated damages.
(2) The essence of a penalty is a payment of money stipulated as in ter-
rorem of the offending party; the essence of liquidated damages is a
genuine covenanted pre-estimate of damage.290
(3) The question whether a sum stipulated is penalty or liquidated dam-
ages is a question of construction to be decided upon the terms and
inherent circumstances of each particular contract.291

Liquidated damages and penalty 531
(4) To assist this task, various tests have been suggested:
(a) It will be held to be penalty if the sum stipulated for is extravagant
and unconscionable in amount in comparison with the greatest
loss that could conceivably be proved to have followed from the
breach,292
(b) It will be a penalty if the breach consists only in not paying a sum
of money and the sum stipulated is a sum greater than the sum
which ought to have been paid.293
(c) There is a presumption (but no more) that it is penalty, when "a
single lump sum is made payable by way of compensation, on the
occurrence of one or more or all of several events, some of which
may occasion a serious and others but trifling damage",294
Court's power to reduce specified amount
If the sum fixed by the parties is found to be liquidated damages, the
whole of it is recoverable. But if it is viewed as "penalty", it is rejected.
Damages will then be calculated according to the ordinary principles. In
doing so the following "salutary warning" of DIPLOCK LJ should be kept in
mind:295
The court should not be astute to descry a penalty clause in every pro-
vision of a contract which stipulates a sum to be payable by one party to
the other in the event of a breach by the former.
To this Cheshire and Fifoot add:2%
Such a stipulation reflects good business sense and is advantageous to
both parties. It enables them to envisage the financial consequence of a
breach; and if litigation proves inevitable, it avoids the difficulty and legal
costs, often heavy, of proving what loss has in fact been suffered by the
innocent party.
An illustration of "penalty" is Ford Motor Co v Armstrong,297
The defendant, a retailer, received from the plaintiffs, supplies of cars
and parts and agreed not to sell any item below the listed price. A sum of
£250 was payable for every breach as "agreed damages".

ified in the agreement of 9 per cent per annum over 85 per cent of the purchase price of
property could not be said to be an extravagant or unconscionable amount.

532 Chapter 9 Discharge by Breach
[S. 74]
A breach having taken place, a majority of the Court of Appeal held that
the sum fixed was a penalty as it might happen that a part sold in breach was
of lesser value than the damages payable.
Application to hire-purchase contracts
Another illustration of penalty is Lamdon Trust Ltd v Hurrel.298
A car was purchased on hire-purchase terms, the total price payable
by instalments being £558. The agreement provided that if the purchaser
returned the car or if, on account of his default the seller retook it, the
total sum, including the instalments already paid, of £425 must be paid.
The purchaser paid up to £302 and then defaulted. The seller retook and
resold it for £270, thus receiving a total sum of £572, which was more
than the contract price. Even so he brought an action to recover £122,
being the difference between £425 and the instalments paid.
But his claim failed. The court rejected the sum as being a penalty and
not a genuine pre-estimate of the probable damage. In arriving at this con-
clusion DENNING LJ took into account these circumstances: "The £425 is
three quarters of the total price. It is inserted by the hire-purchase compa-
nies by rule of thumb without regard to the make of car, its age, the market
conditions or anything of the kind. It is the same for all." In addition to
the liability to pay £425, the purchaser was to keep the car in good order,
repair and condition and was to pay independent damages for any breach
of this condition, supposing that the car was taken back within a month,
could anyone think that the hire or depreciation would go up to £425. "In
these circumstances", his Lordship concluded, "I cannot regard the figure
of three-quarters as a genuine pre-estimate of damage. If the parties had
genuinely tried to estimate the depreciation of this particular car, the figure
would have been much less."
In India also hire-purchase agreements are not immune from the appli-
cability of Section 74. They are also to be tested on the same anvil. In this
case 299 interest at the rate of 18 per cent p.a. was added to the principal sum
in advance. There was a further stipulation to pay compensation at the rate
of 2½ per cent p.m. on the amount of hire-purchase in arrears. The total
rate came up to 30 per cent p.a. on an amount which already included 18
per cent p.a. This was held to be excessive. Following the decision of the
Supreme Court in K.P. Subbarama Sastri v K.S. Raghavan 300 the court said:
"A weak cannot be pushed to the wall because of the inequality of
bargaining power. He cannot be held bound by terms in fine print which
are unduly onerous, oppressive and unreasonable."

Liquidated damages and penalty 533
Heavy amount as evidence of penalty
The House of Lords in their decision in Bridge v Cambell Discount Co
Ltd 30 carried this principle further still by holding that where two-third of
the price is made payable in the event of a default, that should be viewed as
a "penalty". The Court of Appeal pointed out in a subsequent case, 302 that
where a hire-purchase agreement which, in the event of default, provides
for the payment of the full amount or a fixed amount whether the default
takes place in the beginning or towards the end of the period of agreement,
is bound to be regarded as a penalty. Similarly, where the sum of money
payable being very small and the agreement provides that in the event of
default a large sum would become payable, that is obviously a penalty. In
an old case: 303
The defendant, an artiste, engaged himself to act as a principal come-
dian at a theatre for a fixed period on a charge of about three and a half
pounds per night. The agreement provided that in the event of default
by either party a sum of £1000 was payable. This was described in the
agreement as liquidated and ascertained damages.
But even so the court held this to be a penalty. Its effect was that a failure
to pay a small sum of £3½ or for any other minor default, a sum of £1000
would become payable. The amount thus bore no relation with the degree
or extent of breach.
Fixed figure constitutes ceiling
Where the figure of compensation assessed by the parties carries some
sense, whether it is reasonable or not, it will constitute the ceiling, and noth-
ing more than that would be recoverable. In a case before the House of
Lords: 304
A contract for the delivery and erection of a certain machinery pro-
vided that the contractor would have to pay £20 as penalty for each day
of default. The contractor delayed the completion of the work by thirty
weeks. According to the contract his liability was £600, but the purchas-
ers claimed £5850 being the actual loss suffered by them by reason of the
delay.
They were held entitled to claim only £600. Lord ATKIN, pointing out
that the court was not bound by the terminology used by the parties,
said:

[S. 74]
Except that it is called a penalty, which on the cases is far from conclu-
sive, it appears to be an amount of compensation measured by the period
of delay, I agree that it is not a pre-estimate of actual damage. I think it
must have been obvious to both the parties that the actual damage would
be much more than £20 a week; but it was intended to go towards the
damage and it was all that the sellers were prepared to pay,305
Stipulation for payment on events extraneous to breach of contract
A contract providing for payment of money by one party on the occur-
rence of a specified event, rather than on the breach of a contractual duty
owed by that party, cannot be a penalty. A person who guaranteed the pay-
ment of promissory notes issued by a contractor against which loans were
provided, could not avoid his liability by showing that the amount covered
by the promissory notes would have amounted to a penalty. 306
Applicable whether stipulation is for payment in cash or kind
There is no difference between a penalty for non-payment of money due
under a contract and a penalty for the non-performance of some other obli-
gation and, furthermore, there is no distinction between a penalty which
requires the payment of money and a penalty which requires the transfer
of property. This observation occurs in a case307 in which a clause in a sale
agreement required the purchaser to transfer the shares back to the vendor
for fixed sum if he defaulted in payment of instalments. The sum fixed for
transfer back did not reflect the true value of the shares. The purchaser
defaulted in payment of instalments and wanted to escape the rigour of the
transaction by saying that it amounted to a penalty. The court said that the
clause would not permit recovery of anything more than the plaintiffs actual
loss.
Conditions of membership
A rule of an association as a condition of membership and as a matter of
policy provided that members should share equally in the benefits and bur-
dens of the association and that someone who declined the burden should
not participate in the benefit. The court said that a rule of this kind was not

in the nature of a penalty clause. The clause required the members under
a resolution of the company to make additional subscription and provided
that if a member failed to do so, he would be precluded from sharing the
benefits of any recovery that the association might make. This was held to
be not a penalty clause. 308
Section 74, Contract Act
Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act lays down a slightly different rule:
S. 74. Compensation for breach of contract where penalty stipulated
for. 309[When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract
as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract contains
any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is
entitled, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused
thereby, to receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable com-
pensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the case may be, the pen-
alty stipulated for.
Explanation.-A stipulation for increased interest from the date of default
may be a stipulation by way of penalty.]
Exception.-When any person enters into any bail-bond, recognizance or
other instrument of the same nature, or, under the provisions of any law, or
under the orders of the 10[Central Government] or of any [State Government],
gives any bond for the performance of any public duty or act in which the pub-
lic are interested, he shall be liable, upon breach of any condition of any such
instrument, to pay the whole sum mentioned therein.
Explanation.-A person who enters into a contract with Government does
not necessarily thereby undertake any public duty, or promise to do an act in
which the public are interested.

reasonable.
(e) A, who owes money to B, a money-lender, undertakes to repay him by delivering to
him 10 maunds of grain on a certain date, and stipulates that, in the event of his not

20 maunds. This is a stipulation by way of penalty and B is only entitled to reasonable
compensation in case of breach.
(f) A undertakes to repay B a loan of Rs 1000 by five equal monthly instalments, with a stip-
ulation that, in default of any instalment, the whole shall become due. This stipulation
is not by way of penalty, and the contract may be enforced according to its terms.

ments of Rs 40, with a stipulation that, in default of payment of any instalment, the
whole shall become due. This is a stipulation by way of penalty.1313
Rule stated in Section 74
The rule is that where a sum is named in a contract as the amount to
be paid in case of breach, regardless whether it is a penalty or not, the
party suffering from breach is entitled to receive reasonable compensa-
tion not exceeding the amount so named. The named sum constitutes
the maximum limit of liability. The court cannot order damages beyond
that. "The distinction [between liquidated damages and penalty] has
been abolished in India. The courts award reasonable compensation not
exceeding the stipulation. The courts knock down agreements which are
unconscionable and extravagant."34 The court has the latitude to reduce
the amount to what appears to be reasonable in the circumstances. 315

the stipulated interest was recoverable. H.P. Fruit Growers' Coop Mark Processing Society

be penal in nature and so not enforceable. Only 10 per cent was allowed on the amount.

the court has to ascertain its reasonableness. State of Gujarat v M.K. Patel & Co, AIR
1985 Guj 179. Where under a term of the contract, the Government side was authorised

Liquidated damages and penalty 537
Whether or not the party has proved to have suffered actual loss, is
immaterial.316
This has certain advantages over the English system. The section dis-
penses with the necessity of laying down rules for distinguishing liquidated
damages from penalty. Further, according to English law, the court must
either accept the amount in whole or reject it in whole. In India, the court
need not reject the amount. It may either accept the amount or reduce it
to what appears reasonable. In the Fateh Chand case the Supreme Court
observed as follows:17 "Section 74 is clearly an attempt to eliminate the
somewhat elaborate refinements made under the English Common Law in
distinguishing between stipulations providing for payment of liquidated
damages and stipulations in the nature of penalty. ... The Indian Legislature
sought to cut across the web of rules and presumptions under the English
Common Law by enacting a uniform principle applicable to all stipulations
naming the amount to be paid in case of breach and stipulations by way of
penalty."
The amount stipulated in the contract is not decisive but it is a good
attempt to avoid litigation. It is well know that assessment of compensation
with precision is somewhat difficult task. The figure work provided by the
parties gives a good start to overcome the difficulty of proof. In this case the
court had to reduce the amount stipulated because neither that much loss
was proved nor it was in the neighbourhood of probable loss.318
of or delay in performance without assessment of loss suffered by the aggrieved party was
held to be in the nature of levying a penalty. John v Oriental Kuries Ltd, (1994) 2 KLT 353,
provision for the whole number of instalments becoming immediately due on default, not a
penalty. M.M.T.C. Ltd v Sineximco (P) Ltd, (2006) 135 DLT 629, the buyer's failure in an
international contract to accept delivery of goods because of a fall in prices was held to be not
justified. The seller was not entitled to recover the whole amount specified in the liquidated
damages clause. He is entitled only to be suitably compensated within the limits specified in
the contract.

Textiles Firm v Bank of India, AIR 1992 P&H 158. For a contrary view, see Parvati Bai

driving or to pay Rs 10,000. C.K. Kesavam v Kudaythoor Panchayath, (1990) 2 KLJ 424.
A stipulation for increased interest from the day of default may be a stipulation by way of.

with due calculations and was also reasonable. The claimant had not to show any loss. Only

latory regimes as in the case of telecom industry.

538 Chapter 9 Discharge by Breach
One party not to be adjudicating authority
[S. 74]
In a case before the Supreme Court 319 a clause in a contract was to the
effect that for any breach of the conditions of the contract the first party
shall be liable to pay damages to the second party as may be assessed by
the second party. This clause was held to be void because it had the effect of
making a party also a judge to decide breach and assess damages. The court
said: "The power to assess damages is subsidiary and consequential power
and not the primary power. Even assuming for argument's sake that the
clause afforded scope for being construed as empowering the officer of the
State to decide upon the question of breach as well as assess the quantum of
damages, we do not think that adjudication by the officer regarding breach
can be sustained under the law because a party to the agreement cannot be
an arbiter in his own cause. Interests of justice and equity require that where
a party to a contract disputes breach, adjudication should be by an inde-
pendent person or body and not by the other party to the contract. The posi-
tion will be different where there is no dispute or there is consensus between
the parties regarding the breach of conditions. In such a case, the officer
of the State even though a party to the contract will be within his rights in
assessing the damages occasioned by the breach."320 The cumulative effect
of the decisions is that when breach is not admitted, one of the contracting
parties cannot arrogate to itself the power to claim compensation for the
breach from the other party without there being any adjudication by an out-
side agency as to whether there was any breach of contract. The State could
not be a judge in its own cause or its own arbiter. 321
Breach and right to compensation must be established
The injured party has to prove that there has been a breach of contract on
the part of the other party and, therefore, the remedial system provided in
the contract has become exercisable. The claim in this case was for refund
of amount retained by the other party as liquidated damages for breach. A
decree for refund of the amount was passed without going into the ques-
tion whether delay in completion of the work was caused due to lapses on
the
part of one party or the other or whether the guarantee had become

contract cannot be arbiter in his own cause; adjudication of disputed question of breach of

guarantee first encashed it and then gave notice to the other of the alleged breach of contract
and adjustment of the guarantee amount against self-assessed damages. All this was held to
be wrong.

contract and termination of contract based on exclusion clauses and excepted matters involv-
ing the question as to which party committed breach or delay and whether the contract was
validly terminated, could be decided only by the adjudicatory forum, i.e. court or arbitral
tribunal, and not by a party to the contract.

invokable. The case was sent back to the trial court for fact finding as to
breach and its consequences. 322 The plaintiff, a Government undertaking,
was dealing in export of marine products. It provided financial assistance
to the defendant who was engaged in the business of sea food. A clause in
the agreement provided that he would be liable to compensate the plaintiff
if his goods were rejected by the foreign buyer. It was found that the goods
were rejected not because of any inherent defect but because of the misfunc-
tioning of the containers in which the goods were shipped. The plaintiff had
filed a suit against the shipping agent but did not pursue it. An action against
the defendant was not allowed. The plaintiff could not take shelter of the
clause when there was no breach on the part of the defendant. 323
The court has to make its own assessment of the amount of loss caused by
the breach. It cannot blindly follow the contract clause in awarding damages
without any adjudication. 324
Unilateral deduction from final bill not permissible
It has been held that unilateral deductions towards liquidated damages
from the contractor's final bill are not permissible. Even if there is a breach,
the aggrieved party cannot of its own work out liquidated damages and
deduct the amount from the final bill. The party carrying out deduction
is not free from the responsibility of showing evidence in justification of
deductions. In this case, there were various facts which were denied by the
contractor, that was clear from the pleadings and materials and documents
on record. There was also the finding by the arbitrator that deductions were
carried out on the basis of disputed facts and by attributing the delay to the
contractor and this was contrary to the record. 325
The contract carried a stipulation as to the amount of liquidated dam-
ages. There was delay in execution of work by the contractor. The aggrieved
party became entitled to reasonable compensation but gave no evidence of
the amount of loss caused. The contractor also did not show any precise
amount of possible loss. The court awarded half of the amount claimed by
way of reasonable compensation.326

540 Chapter 9 Discharge by Breach
Common features between English and Indian laws
[S. 74]
Yet the distinction between liquidated damages and penalty is not alto-
gether irrelevant to the section. Its relevance, in the first place, arises from
the fact that the amount contemplated by the parties will be reduced only if
it appears to be by way of penalty. Otherwise the whole of it is recoverable
as liquidated damages. Secondly, the first explanation to the section uses
the word "penalty". It provides that "a stipulation for increased interest
from the date of default may be a stipulation by way of penalty". Where,
for instance, money is borrowed at 12 per cent interest payable six-monthly,
and the agreement provides that in case of default an interest of 75 per cent
shall be payable. This is a stipulation by way of penalty.327 Similarly, where
a sum of Rs 100 is borrowed but a bond is given for Rs 200, which fur-
ther provides that in default of payment of any instalment the whole shall
become due, This is a penalty. But where a sum of Rs 100 is borrowed
and it is payable by five-monthly instalments and the bond provides that in
default of payment of any instalment the whole shall become due, then it is
not a penalty and the contract is enforceable. An illustration of penalty is the
decision of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Gurubax Singh Gorowara v
Begum Rafiya Khurshid.329 The contract involved the sale of standing trees
for a sum of Rs 60,000. The contract provided that in the event of default
by either party a compensation of Rs 50,000 would be payable. The court
regarded this to be a penalty and required the plaintiff to prove his actual
loss. It was not possible for the court to accept that a contract involving a
consideration of Rs 60,000 would cause a damage of Rs 50,000 if not per-
formed. Where the whole of the money is presently due and it is only for
the benefit of the debtor and for his convenience that the creditor agrees to
accept payment in instalments, a provision that a default in the payment of
one instalment would make the whole amount to be due at once would not
amount to penalty. 330

becoming due on default in paying a single instalment, the Supreme Court held the stipula-

Liquidated damages and penalty 541
It has been held that a term of a loan agreement which provides for imme-
diate repayment of capital in the event of a default by the borrower and for
payment of interest due up to the date of default, but not future interest, is
not a penalty clause. 331 A clause in an agreement that the special benefit of a
share in the property at a lower price offered to a party under the contract
would not be available to a party defaulting in payment of an instalment
within the stated time, has been held as not amounting to a penalty.332
Still another common feature between the English common law and
Indian law is shown by the decision of the Supreme Court in Chunilal V.
Mehta and Sons Ltd v Century Spg & Mfg Co Ltd, where it has been
held that "by providing for compensation in express terms the right to claim
damages under the general law is necessarily excluded".
An agreement for the appointment of managing agents provided that
their remuneration would be Rs 6000 per month or 10 per cent of the
gross profits of a year whichever was more and also that in the event
of premature termination their compensation would be not less than
Rs 6000 per month for the whole of the unexpired period. They were
removed before the expiry of the term and claimed compensation at the
rate of 10 per cent of the gross profits.
But the Supreme Court held that they must be content with the rate of
Rs 6000 per month. They were bound by the clause. "It seems to us that the
intention of the parties was that if the appellants were relieved of the duty to
work as managing agents, they should not be entitled to get anything more
than Rs 6000 per month by way of compensation."334
Forfeiture of earnest money or deposit
In the application of Section 74 to forfeiture clauses, the Supreme Court
has drawn distinction between "earnest money" and "security deposit".
The distinction was set to work in Fateh Chand v Balkishan Das.335
For example, 75 per cent reduced to 15 per cent and 60 per cent compound to 30 per cent

542 Chapter 9 Discharge by Breach
[S. 74]
An agreement for the sale of certain land and bungalow for Rs 1,12,500
provided that the buyer was to pay Rs 1000 as earnest money and
Rs 24,000 on delivery of possession. The buyer made these payments and
was put in possession. The agreement further provided that if the buyer
failed to pay the balance price and get the sale deed registered by a cer-
tain date, the sum of Rs 25,000 would stand forfeited, the agreement
cancelled and the buyer shall return possession to the seller. The buyer
defaulted and the seller forfeited the above sum and brought an action to
recover possession and compensation for occupation and use.
He was allowed to forfeit Rs 1000 being earnest money and to retain the
sum of Rs 24,000 also not by virtue of his right to forfeit but as representing
use value. SHAH J refuted the fallacy as shown by some High Court deci-
sions that Section 74 applies only to cases where the aggrieved party is seek-
ing to recover a fixed amount on breach of contract and not to cases where
an amount received under the contract is sought to be forfeited.
In our judgment the expression "the contract contains any other stipula-
tion by way of penalty" comprehensively applies to every covenant involving
a penalty whether it is for payment on breach of contract of money or deliv-
ery of property in future or for forfeiture of right to money or other prop-
erty already delivered. In all cases, therefore, where there is a stipulation in
the nature of penalty for forfeiture of an amount deposited pursuant to the
terms of contract, the court has jurisdiction to award such sum only as it
considers reasonable, but not exceeding the amount specified in the contract
as liable to forfeiture.336
Neither earnest money nor any other kind of deposit which is liable to be
forfeited can be subjected to forfeiture if the underlying contract is void. The
Supreme Court laid down this principle in a case in which in a transaction
for sale of land the buyer was under the impression that he was getting the
land at the agreed price per bigha whereas the seller believed he was selling
336. The provision is applicable to every kind of deposit by whatever name it may be called. The
words "any other stipulation by way of penalty" are wide enough to cover all kinds of forfei-
ture provisions. Union of India v Shaim Sunder Lal, 1963 All LJ 251. Bombay Scrap Traders
v Port of Bombay, (1994) 1 Bom CR 266, failure on the part of the tenderer to comply
with the work order, forfeiture of earnest money, held justified. State of Karnataka v Stellar
Construction Co, AIR 2002 Kant 6: (2002) 5 Kant LJ 474, the road building contractor was
not paid extra charges because the claim in respect thereof was not found by the Department
to be justified. He had received payment as per contractual terms. He stopped working and
did not resume it inspite of clear notice. The court said that this amounted to breach. He was
not entitled to claim refund of the forfeited security deposit. New Media Broadcasting (P)
Ltd v Union of India, AIR 2008 NOC 967 (Del), contract envisaged specification of further
details, by Govt, some changes on representation of bidders were within tender terms, bidder
whose bid was accepted refused to sign, right to forfeit earnest money and claim damages
arose. Winmaxx Management Service (P) Ltd v UCO Bank, AIR 2011 Gau 217, the auction
buyer failed to pay the whole of the earnest money. Forfeiture of money actually paid by
him held to be justified. Haryana Financial Corpn v Rajesh Gupta, (2010) 1 SCC 655: AIR

approach road to unit would be provided, but not actually done, the purchaser did not make
further payment, forfeiture of his earnest held to be not proper.

per kanal. The parties being at cross-purposes and being not ad idem, the
agreement was void. There was no question of forfeiting, the earnest money.
It was refundable under Section 65, the contract having been discovered to
be void,337
Similarly, there can be no forfeiture or encashment of bank guarantee
where no contract arises. A tender which has been revoked before accept-
ance cannot be accepted and, therefore, the bank guarantee submitted along
with the tender also becomes revoked and cannot be encashed,338
Whatever be the name or nature of the amount deposited by one
party with the other which is liable to forfeiture in the event of breach,
Section 74 would come into play and only that part of the amount would
be open to forfeiture which is reasonable in the circumstances of the case.
Anything more would tantamount to penalty. 339 Forfeiture of earnest
money is permissible by way of liquidated damages. 340
There is no absolute right to forfeit the entire amount without proof of the
total extent of loss, when the material on record showed that the extent of
loss was less than the amount held as earnest, forfeiture could not go beyond
that. No one can be allowed to enrich himself at the cost of the other by
taking advantage of the forfeiture clause, 341

Forfeiture of earnest money on non-fulfilment of
conditions of e-auction
[S. 74]
There was e-auction of "Film Solar Photovoltaic Module". As per terms
and conditions, e-waste certificate and e-waste disposal was to be obtained
by the bidder. He did not do so. Forfeiture of earnest money as per forfeiture
clause was held to be proper.342
A provision in a contract for recovery of double the amount of sale con-
sideration as a penalty for breach of contract was held to be not legally per-
missible. It was vouched as a clear penalty for breach. Even otherwise it was
clearly in the nature of penalty and therefore not permissible.343
Withholding of payment under bills
There was e-tender for extraction of coal. The equipment capacity of the
bidder was less than the required capacity. The bidder could not achieve the
target. The result was huge shortage in extraction and transportation of
coal. The tender requirement of deployment of requisite equipment was not
fulfilled. It was held that withholding of his bills and imposition of shortfall
penalty was proper."
Whether actual loss necessary
Another question which the court considered was whether actual proof
of loss is necessary to recover anything under Section 74. In the earlier
case of Chunilal V. Mehta and Sons Ltd v Century Spg & Mfg Co Ltd³
MUDHOLKAR J suggested that where the right to recover liquidated damages
under Section 74 is found to exist "no question of ascertaining damage really
arises". The section also says that the named sum is recoverable "whether or
not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby". But even.
so SHAH J felt that these words of the section only dispense with proof of
"actual loss or damage". The section does not justify the award of compen-
sation, when in consequence of the breach no legal injury at all has resulted.
This is so because compensation can only be awarded under Section 73 for
loss which naturally arose or was in the contemplation of the parties. Thus
Consequently forfeiture of earnest money of both of them. It did not appear in the judgment
whether reasonableness of the amount forfeited was considered. Reasonableness is linked
with the loss caused.

ting breach knew that loss was a likely result of the breach.

proof of some loss is necessary, 346 though it will not be necessary to prove
the extent of it.
This view was reaffirmed by SHAH J (acting CJ) in Maula Bux v Union
of India,347
The plaintiff contracted to supply to Military Headquarters, U.P. Area,
potatoes, poultry, eggs and fish for one year and deposited Rs 18,500 for
due performance of the contract. The plaintiff having made persistent
defaults in making regular and full supplies, the Government of India,
in pursuance of the terms of the contract, rescinded the contract and for-
feited the amount deposited by the plaintiff.
The High Court of Allahabad was of the view that the deposit in ques-
tion was in the nature of earnest money and the Supreme Court decision.
in Fatehchand v Balkishan Das³ did not purport to overrule the previous
trend of authorities to the effect that earnest money deposited by way of
security for the due performance of a contract does not amount to penalty
as contemplated by Section 74. The Supreme Court did not countenance
the view that every such deposit is necessarily an earnest. The court cited
the meaning of earnest money as given in Earl Jowitt, THE DICTIONARY OF
ENGLISH LAW:349
Giving an earnest or earnest money is a mode of signifying assent to
a contract of sale or the like by giving to the vendor a nominal sum (e.g.
shilling) as a token that the parties are in earnest, have made up their
minds.
The court also cited the observation of the Privy Council in Chiranjit
Singh v Har Swarups that "earnest money is part of the purchase price
when the transaction goes forward: it is forfeited when the transaction falls
through by reason of the fault or failure of the vendee". If this is the view of
an earnest deposit, then quite obviously the deposit in the present case was
not by way of earnest because it was not to be appropriated towards the pay-
ment of price, but was to be held as a security. SHAH, acting CJ (afterwards
CJ), then referred to the cases to the effect that Section 74 has no application
to forfeiture of deposits and ruled that this view is no longer good law. The
learned Chief Justice continued:

546 Chapter 9 Discharge by Breach
CASE PILOT
[S. 74]
Forfeiture of earnest money under a contract of sale, if the amount
is reasonable does not fall within Section 74. This has been decided in
several cases. These cases are easily explained, for forfeiture of a rea-
sonable amount paid as earnest money does not amount to imposing a
penalty. But if forfeiture is of the nature of penalty, Section 74 applies.
Where under the terms of the contract the party in breach has undertaken
to pay a sum of money or to forfeit a sum of money which he has already
paid, the undertaking is in the nature of a penalty.
Referring to the argument that Rs 18,500 represent a genuine pre-esti-
mate of the probable damage, the learned Chief Justice said that the Union
has not proved to have suffered any loss. If no loss is proved to have been
suffered, the provisions of the Act in Sections 73 and 74 relating to damages
for breach are not attracted. The court confined the words of Section 74
that "whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused
thereby" to cases in which it is not possible to prove the monetary value of
the loss and, therefore, the value fixed by the parties may be taken as the
reasonable measure of compensation. But where the loss in terms of money
can be determined, the party claiming compensation must prove the loss
suffered by him. Since no attempt was made by the Government to prove
whether the prices paid to the alternative source of supply were less or more
than the contract price, therefore, the Government was not entitled to any
compensation for the breach.
Where the actual loss was not proved and the whole of the actually
reserved amount of 5 per cent of the total project value was levied as liqui-
dated damages, the court said that it amounted to a penalty. The award of
the arbitrator to that extent was set aside. 352 Where the contractor delayed
supplies of cables and the Government had to purchase from other sources
and coincidentally happened to procure at cheaper rates, the award of the
arbitrator awarding damages for breach of contract was set aside.353
In another similar case, the arbitrator awarded only half the amount that
was specified in the contract because no actual loss was shown, the court
refused to interfere. The award of 12 per cent interest was not interfered
with.
Where there was breach of a rigging contract and the amount predeter-
mined in the contract was recovered, justifying this recovery, it was held that
it was not enough to defeat such a right to show that not enough material
was placed on record for exact assessment of quantum of losses suffered.

Burden of proving that no losses were actually caused to the other party was
on the party committing breach. The court said that it was not necessary for
the party to lead evidence to show the amount of loss suffered by it unless
the breaching party came to the court and proved that no loss was in fact
caused, 354
Where no loss caused
An amount was paid by a purchaser in advance towards the purchase
price of the goods. The contract provided that on default by the purchaser
the amount would be forfeited. He defaulted. He was allowed refund. The
seller proved no loss. The court said that retention of money for a long period
was sufficient to compensate the plaintiff. 355 Where on default by the origi-
nal bidder in paying the balance of the price, the material was reauctioned
and the vendor State obtained a higher price, the court said that the provi-
sion for forfeiture of 25 per cent of the price paid in advance would have
operated as a penalty. The court could award only a reasonable amount as
damages, namely, interest on the amount in default from due date to receipt
of price from alternative buyer. 356
À clause in a contract permitted estimation and recovery of wrongful
gain, if any, made by the contractor. The contract was terminated because of
wrongful gain made by not fulfilling the conditions of the contract. The court
did not permit the bank guarantee to be invoked because the Authority had
already made good its losses by forfeiting performance security furnished by
the contractor and had also recovered the penalty amount.357
Where the arbitrator recorded a finding that the supply of material beyond
the stipulated period had not resulted in any loss to the Port Trust, the court
said that compensation was payable only when the breach had resulted in
a legal injury. Accordingly the Port Trust was not entitled to retain any
amount towards compensation. 358
Exclusion of right to compensation
It may be possible in some cases that no compensation is payable because.
the aggrieved party has suffered no loss, but it is not possible to say that no

compensation is payable because there is a provision to that effect in the
contract. It has been held that contract clauses which disentitle an aggrieved
party to the remedial benefits of Sections 55 and 73 would be void because
of violation of the very intent and purport of the Contract Act. [S. 23] There
is public policy and public interest element in these sections. Sections 73 and
55 are the very heart, foundation and basis of the contractual relation. A
contract, which can be broken at will, will be destructive of the very edifice
of the contract. 359
Loss caused by mutual delay
Both parties contributed to causing delay in completion of work. It was
impossible to know what percentage of delay was attributable to one party
or the other. Deduction of amounts from running bills of the contractor by
way of liquidated damages was held to be illegal and improper.30
Where profit follows
Where not only no loss was caused to the seller of land by the buyer's
refusal to perform, but, on the contrary, he resold it at a profit, the seller
was not permitted to forfeit the advance paid by the buyer. 361 The same
result followed where 25 per cent of the auction purchase price was paid in
advance and it was not allowed to be forfeited for the default in payment of
the balance price. The reauction was at a higher price. The court, allowed
interest on the balance from the date of default till due date of payment by
the subsequent purchaser. 362
FORFEITURE OF EARNEST MONEY ONLY WHEN REASONABLE TO DO SO.-In

acroscrap for rupees ten lakhs and paid Rs 2,50,000, being 25 per cent
of the purchase price. One of the conditions, among others being, that
if he failed to pay the balance of the purchase price in accordance with
the contract, the deposit would be forfeited and the contract cancelled.

Liquidated damages and penalty 549
The court held that the deposit in question was intended as earnest money.
The agreement clearly provided that the deposit would carry no interest and
would be adjusted in the final bills. It was a part of the price and the seller
was entitled to forfeit it. VAIDIALINGAM J found sufficient support in the
following decision of the Privy Council:
In Chiranjit Singh v Har Swarup,364 though the contract stipulated that
a sum of Rs 20,000 should be paid as earnest, the buyer did not pay any
amount by way of earnest, as such, but he paid Rs 1,65,000 against the
purchase price. But, nevertheless, the High Court, as well as the Judicial
Committee, treated a sum of Rs 20,000 out of the sum of Rs 1,65,000,
as earnest money paid under the terms of the agreement, and a claim to
recover that amount of earnest money was negatived. In the case before
us, the contract clearly refers to the earnest money being paid and to the
fact of Rs 2,50,000 having been paid as earnest. Therefore, there is no
ambiguity regarding the nature of the above payment and the right of the
respondent to forfeit the same.
The learned Judge refused to consider the obiter observation of the
Supreme Court in Maula Bux v Union of India"s that earnest money can be
forfeited without attracting Section 74 if the amount thereof is reasonable
as binding. He pointed out that the Supreme Court itself had no occasion
in that case to consider the question of reasonableness or otherwise of the
earnest deposit being forfeited.366
Refund of earnest money where wrong specification provided
The plaintiff contractor informed the State about difficulties that arose.
while he was excavating the river bank for construction of submersible
bridge. The boring test showed that the sandy clay was 18 feet deep below
the bed level whereas the information supplied was that it was only 12 to 16
feet deep. The State refused to revise rates. Delay in the work led the State to
invite fresh tenders for the project. The plaintiff was allowed refund of his
earnest money and also 1/3rd of the cost of construction.36
367
DISTINCTION BETWEEN EARNEST AND DEPOSIT, HOW FAR REAL. -Thus, it
appears that the court has gone more by technical considerations than by
the substance of the bargains in question. In either case the initial payment,

quent price realised was more than the sum due and, therefore, the court ordered the surplus

penalty. Mohd Sultan Rowther v Naina Mohammad, AIR 1973 Mad 233, in the absence of

whether named as earnest or security deposit, was intended as a cover or
protection against inconvenience or possible loss likely to be caused by the
breach. If the deposit was named as earnest the court allowed it to be for-
feited, but not otherwise, thus defeating the purport of the bargain that
the parties had voluntarily made. The fact that the payment of a sum of
money in a purchase agreement is not expressed as a deposit does not for
that reason alone render the payment not a true deposit or earnest money.
The intention of the parties with regard to the payment as earnest money
may be gathered by examining the agreement as a whole. Even if no time for
completion of the sale by paying the balance of the price was specified, the
seller's notice for completing the sale within seven days became a reasona-
ble specification of time. Therefore, on the purchaser's failure to do so, the
money paid by him was validly forfeited even if there was no provision in the
original agreement for any such forfeiture.363
The facts of Maula Bux v Union of India were virtually repeated before
the Supreme Court in Union of India v Rampur Distillery & Chemical Co
Ltd 370 with only this difference that instead of eggs etc., it was "rum" that
the contractor had failed to supply and the Supreme Court refused to allow
the deposit to be forfeited or reasonable compensation to be recovered as
the court found that breach of contract caused no loss to the Government
and the Government made no attempt to establish that it had suffered any
loss or damage on account of the breach. 371 The Gujarat High Court in its
decision in Variety Body Builders v Union of India followed the Supreme
Court decisions in reference to a failure to supply rubber and metal to the
Western Railway. Commenting upon this trend of decisions, a learned writer
says:
In the light of these decisions it is important for the Government
departments to advise officers entering into contracts with contractors
on behalf of the Government that they ought not to lull themselves into
a false feeling of security by taking a security deposit and stipulating for
its forfeiture upon default by the contractor. Under Section 74 all that
the Government can claim is reasonable compensation and it is always
necessary that the Government should establish the actual damage suf-
fered by it by the contractor's default. If Government officers are not edu-
cated on these questions, the defaulting contractor will not only be able to
recover his security deposit, but will be able to get away without paying

any damages for breach of contract, as did the contractor in Maula Bux
and Variety Body Builders.373
Where the property of a company was auctioned but the auction pur-
chaser made defaults and, therefore the property had to be auctioned again
and then it realised over two lakhs more than the earlier bid money, it was
held that the earnest money of the defaulting bidder running up to more
than five and a half lakh rupees could not be forfeited. It would have been
highly arbitrary and unreasonable to do so. A compensation of Rs 1,49,763
was awarded to the company.3
No forfeiture where extra costs otherwise recovered
Where, upon the failure of the contractor to complete the work, the State
got the work executed at his risk and also recovered the extra expenses from
him, the State was not allowed to forfeit his security deposit. This would
have amounted to penalty and the State had suffered no loss. 375 The Andhra
Pradesh High Court allowed the plaintiff to recover the stipulated amount
of Rs 2000 from a vendor of land who failed to perfect his title within the
prescribed time although no proof was given of any actual loss,3%
No forfeiture where contract still not formulated
The requirement of tendering was satisfied by the highest bidder by depos-
iting the requisite earnest money. The bid was not confirmed by the author-
ity though a period of more than one year had passed. The bidder withdrew
his tender. The authorities then confirmed his bid and forfeited his earnest
money for not depositing the balance money within 30 days from the date
of confirmation. The court said that the absence of any time prescribed
for acceptance could not give the authority an unlimited and unreasonable
period of time. The forfeiture was not proper and therefore the amount for-
feited was refundable, 377
After acceptance of tenders, the contractor was informed that any further
sale of the plots by him would invite payment of premium equivalent to 20
per cent of the sale value of the plot. Such condition did not form part of
public advertisement or terms of condition of auction sale. The contractors
were held entitled to get refund of the earnest money deposited with interest
at 7.5 per cent interest per annum from the date of withdrawal of offer till
date of payment.378

552 Chapter 9 Discharge by Breach
Stipulation for refund of double amount of earnest and interest
[S. 74]
The stipulation in the contract was that if the party failed to perform
from his side, he would refund the amount of earnest doubling it up and
also with interest at 12 per cent p.a. It was held that the Civil Judge rightly
decreed the suit of the plaintiff to receive the double amount by way of com-
pensation. It must be presumed that the parties at the time of entering into
the agreement knew very well the amount of loss which the plaintiff was
likely to sustain in the event of breach. Where the parties were supposed to
know that breach would cause loss in any case, it would not be necessary for
the aggrieved party to show any actual loss. The court has the ample power
to grant compensation for loss caused by breach of contract. 379
Security money under other contracts
Security money paid in respect of other contracts cannot be forfeited in
respect of the contract under dispute, but bill-money due to the contractor
under other contracts may be so used.
A clause in a contract provided that all moneys or compensation paya-
ble to the Government under the terms of the contract may be realised out
of the security deposit or money due under any other account.
The Supreme Court came to the conclusion that this clause enabled the
Government to realise its claim from money due to the contractor in respect
of other contracts and the security deposited under the present contract but
not the security deposit belonging to other contracts.30
Where a contract for the supply of gas in cylinders was being performed in
instalments and there was such a breach in respect of one instalment which
entitled the purchaser to terminate the contract, he was allowed compensa-
tion at the rate fixed in the contract for the failure to supply the remainder.
To attract Section 74 it is not necessary that a contract should be broken in
its entirety,381

where the court expressed the opinion that money due in respect of other contracts may be
forfeited if there is a clear and express provision to that effect under the contract. Where a
vendor has been given the right to repurchase on default and he does so, it cannot be called a
penalty on default. The court cannot provide any relief against repurchase. K. Simrathmull

Show-cause notice before forfeiture
Forfeiture of earnest money without insurance of a show-cause notice is
violative of the principle of natural justice.382
Consent decrees
The Madhya Pradesh High Court considered it to be well-settled that
principles underlying Section 74 are applicable to consent decrees. A con-
tract embodied in a decree is subject to all the incidents of any other con-
tract. Accordingly, if it contains any clause which is of penal nature, it can
be struck out. Applying these principles to a contract for sale of land for
Rs2000 half of which was deposited by way of earnest and which was com-
promised under which a consent decree was passed to the effect that the
defendant would pay Rs 2000 plus costs in two instalments and that if he
defaulted he would execute the sale deed in favour of the plaintiff, the default
clause was held to be a penalty. The court said that the executing court shall
always have power to apply equitable principles embodied in Section 74 and
relieve a party to the contract against any term in the decree which operates
as a penalty. On the other hand, where the compromise about a decree.
was that if the tenant would pay all the money found due against him by a
certain date, the landlord would not enforce the decree of dispossession, this
was held to be as not amounting to a penalty, 4
384
A compromise decree provided for payment of the principal sum with
interest at the rate of 18 per cent p.a. from the date of suit till date of decree.
Liberty was given to the decree holder to apply for its execution if the judg-
ment-debtor failed to pay the decree by the date specified in it. This stipu-
lation was held to be not in the nature of a penalty. The court said that the
executing court had no jurisdiction to go into the question whether the rate
of interest awarded was excessive or unreasonable. 385
Where the plaintiff's suit was compromised on the basis that he would
pay certain sum of money by instalments and that on default in payment,
the plaintiff's suit would be dismissed, it was held that this would amount
to penalty and, therefore, extension of time should be granted for covering
up the delay in the payment of the first instalment, 384
The burden to establish that a clause in the decree is in the nature of
penalty and is unenforceable under Section 74 of the Contract Act is on the
judgment-debtors. There cannot be any dispute that on account of the delay
premature termination of a cinematographic agreement agreed that the aggrieved party
would have suffered à loss of Rs 25,000. An award Rs 10,000 by way of damages was held to
be justified.

[S. 74]
in getting back the collateral securities on payment of the entire debt due to
the bank the decree-holder would be put to serious loss as he might not be
able to raise any further loan for his business or to discharge the existing
loans by sale of the other properties as the title deeds were with the bank.
Both the parties were aware of their rights and liabilities and with open
eyes they entered into a compromise. When the parties submitted before
the court and agreed to a decree in terms of the compromise specifying the
liquidated damages, and a decree was passed in terms of the agreement, the
judgment-debtor could not later turn round and contended that damages
agreed to were penal in nature, 387
A majority view of the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court was that
a compromise decree is a creature of the agreement on which it is based and
it is subject to all the incidents of such agreement and that it is a contract
with the command of a Judge super added to it and in construing its pro-
visions the fundamental principles governing the construction of contracts
are applicable. It was also held that one of the cardinal principles in the
construction of contracts is that the entire contract must be taken as consti-
tuting an organic synthesis embodying provisions which balance in the sum
of reciprocal rights and obligations.388
Clear notice of clause requisite
To justify forfeiture of advance deposit, being a part of the price as "ear-
nest" the terms of the contract should be sufficiently explicit and must be
made known to the party making the deposit. In this case the aggrieved
party has shown that the terms of auction were neither advertised nor were
they supplied to the intending bidders at the time of the auction. The auc-
tioning authority, therefore, could not contend that % payment was meant
as earnest and a guarantee money for performance. Nor the authority had
proved any loss upon the bidder's default. 389
Minimum charges
Minimum charges for supply of electricity have been held to be not by
way of penalty. The maintenance of a supply line does cost something
and if a consumer does not consume to a certain figure, the supplier may
recover from him the specified minimum in order to meet his costs. This
requires that the minimum should be reasonable in the circumstances and
not arbitrary. 390

Liquidated damages and penalty 555
Interest by way of damages
Interest is generally not awarded by way of damages. There has to be an
agreement to that effect or statutory provisions. When money due is wrong-
fully withheld, interest can be demanded even in the absence of agreement.
But for that purpose, a written demand is mandatory. In the absence of any
such thing as that, the plaintiff was allowed interest at the rate of six per-
cent. The withheld payment was due under the contract. 391
Where in the matter of a commercial transaction there was a term in the
contract providing that the defendant would be liable to pay interest at 20
per cent p.a. in the event of breach and the facts showed that the defendant
committed breach, the plaintiff was allowed interest at the specified rate
from the date of suit till the date of judgment. He was also allowed interest
at 6 per cent till payment as prayed.392
Bank's service charges
As per the terms and conditions of the issue of credit card, the holder of
the card had to pay a service charge if he did not pay to the bank within
the stipulated time the amount used through the credit. This was held to
be not a penalty. The fact that the bank was not complying with certain
requirements of the Service Tax Charges Act would not alter the nature of
the charge.393
Compensation for giving wrong destination to ship
A charterparty was entered into for carriage of crude oil to destination
at an Indian port. The charterer by mistake happened to mention a wrong
port where the material could not be landed. The ship arrived there. Lay
days for unloading began. The ship was then diverted to the right port. The
arbitration award held the charterer liable for excess expenses and delay.
The Supreme Court refused to interfere with the award. 394
Statutory compensation
Where compensation is payable in terms of a statutory provision, the
Supreme Court has held that the provision applicable would be one that
is in force at the time of cause of action and not one that was in force
at the time of the contract. The plaintiff's husband was killed by a goods
lorry which was insured with the defendant insurance company. At the time
of the policy, the statutory compensation for loss of life under the Motor
in plant and mains on which he has to have a reasonable return. He gets a return when energy
is actually consumed... but the minimum charges are really a return on his capital outlay
incurred for the particular consumer."

Vehicles Act, 1939, was Rs 20,000. By the time of the accident the Act had
been amended by raising the compensation money to Rs 50,000. The court
allowed the revised figure. This did not amount to retrospective operation,
because the accident had taken place after the amendment. The result would
have been different if the accident had happened before the amendment or if
the parties had contracted only on the basis of law as it then stood.395
Where no ceiling was fixed on energy to be consumed by consumers and
there was no breach of contract, nor any loss to the supplier, levy of penalty
on energy consumed in excess of the contracted demand was held to be
illegal.396
A Statutory contract means that it is a contract with some statutory con-
tent which generally contain provisions regarding determination of tariff as
per, for example, Section 43-A(2) of the Electricity Supply Act, 1948 regard-
ing determination of tariff. The court was dealing with a power purchase
agreement. 397
Termination of contract for breach
The Authority was entitled to terminate the contract on any of the spec-
ified grounds including delay in execution of the project. The contractor
could not complete the work in time. Termination of the contract for this
reason was held to be valid. The mere fact that a wrong ground happened to
be mentioned in the order of termination did not have the effect of invalidat-
ing the order of termination. 39
Jurisdiction
A substantial part of the contract remained unexecuted. The textile mills
were situated in Bombay and the supply of the goods under the contract was
to be made ex-factory at Bombay. Accordingly proceedings could be taken
at Bombay, 199

There are many situations in which law as well as justice require that a
certain person be required to conform to an obligation, although he has
neither broken any contract nor committed any tort. For example, a person
in whose home certain goods have been left by mistake is bound to restore
them. Such obligations are generally described, for want of a better or more
appropriate name, as quasi-contractual obligations.
Rationale
Theory of unjust enrichment
Q:
191
The theory on which quasi-contractual obligations are based is not yet
finally settled. Lord MANSFIELD who is considered to be the real founder of
such obligations, explained them on the principle that law as well as justice
should try to prevent "unjust enrichment", that is, enrichment of one person
at the cost of another. His Lordship offered this explanation in Moses v
Macferlan:¹
2.
2
Jacob issued four promissory notes to Moses and Moses indorsed them
to Macferlan, excluding, by a written agreement, his personal liability on
the endorsement. Even so Macferlan sued Moses on the endorsement and
he was held liable despite the agreement. Moses was thus compelled to
discharge a liability which he had excluded and, therefore, sued to recover
back his money from Macferlan.
He was allowed to do so. After stating that such money cannot be recov-
ered where the person to whom it is given can "retain it with a safe con-
science", Lord MANSFIELD Continued:
194
"But it lies for money paid by mistake; or upon a consideration which
happens to fail; or for money got through imposition; or extortion; or
oppression; or for an undue advantage taken of the plaintiff's situa-
tion, contrary to laws made for the protection of persons under those

circumstances. In one word, the gist of this kind of action is, that the
defendant, upon the circumstances of the case, is obliged by ties of natu-
ral justice and equity to refund the money."
A liability of this kind is hard to classify. Partly it resembles liability under
the law of tort inasmuch as it arises independently of any contract. Partly
it resembles contract inasmuch as it is owed only to one party and not "to
persons generally". Thus it can be accounted for either under an implied
contract or under natural justice and equity for the prevention of unjust
enrichment. Lord MANSFIELD preferred the latter theory.
Theory of "implied-in-fact" contract
But beginning with the decision of the House of Lords in Sinclair v
Brougham, it became fashionable to discard Lord MANSFIELD'S formula-
tion and to rely upon an implied-in-fact contract.
A building society undertook banking business which was outside its
objects and, therefore, ultra vires. The society came to be wound up.
After paying off all the outside creditors, a mixed sum of money was
left which represented partly the shareholders' money and partly that of
the ultra vires depositors, but was not sufficient to pay both of them.
The depositors tried to get priority by resorting to the quasi-contractual
action for recovery of money had and received for the depositors' benefit,
for otherwise the shareholders would be unjustly enriched.
The House of Lords allowed rateable (pari passu) distribution of the mixed
fund among the claimants, but did not allow any remedy under quasi-con-
tract. Lord HALDANE maintained that common law knows personal actions
of only two classes, namely, those founded on contract and those founded
on tort. "When it speaks of action arising quasi ex contractu it refers only to
a class of action in theory which is imputed to the defendant by a fiction of
law." Similarly, Lord SUMNER observed that an action for money had and
received rests, not on a contractual bargain between the parties, but "upon
a notional or imputed promise to repay".4 Lord PARKER expressly pointed
out that if a promise to pay back an ultra vires loan could be imputed to the
company as quasi-contractual obligation, the result would be to validate
a transaction which has been declared to be void on the ground of public
policy and the law would be enforcing a notional contract where an express
contract would have been void.5
This approach dominated decisions for a long time and the decision
was taken to have settled that the juridical basis of quasi-contract was the

implied, notional or fictional contract. Where the circumstances of a case
do not lead to an inference of this kind or where such an inference would be
against the law, no liability will arise.
Restoration of theory of unjust enrichment
The identification of quasi-contracts with implied contracts restricted the
scope of relief which would have been possible without any such hindrance
under the principle of "natural justice and equity". The suffocation was felt
by House of Lords itself in Fibrosa Spolka Akeyjna v Fairbairn Lawson
Combe Barbour Ltd.6 A sum of money was paid in advance under a contract
for the supply of a machine or 'for the supply of machinery', and the perfor-
mance was obstructed by the outbreak of war. Their Lordships allowed the
advance to be recovered back as having been paid for a consideration which
had wholly failed. Lord WRIGHT lent support to Lord MANSFIELD's theory
of unjust enrichment. He observed:"
"It is clear that any civilised system of law is bound to provide remedies
for cases of what has been called unjust enrichment or unjust benefit, that
is, to prevent a man from retaining the money of, or some benefit derived
from, another which it is against conscience that he should keep. Such
remedies in English law are generally different from remedies in contract
or tort, and are now recognised to fall within a third category of the com-
mon law which has been called quasi-contract or restitution."
Referring to the ratio decidendi of the decision of the House of Lords
in Sinclair v Brougham Lord WRIGHT pointed out that the case turned
upon the principle that it was against public policy to allow the recovery
of an ultra vires deposit, whether the claim be based upon contract or qua-
si-contract. The observations of their Lordships relating to the foundation of
quasi-contract were merely obiter dicta. Indeed the House adopted the pari
passu distribution of the available assets as a technique to prevent the unjust
enrichment of the shareholders at the cost of the depositors."
Provisions of the Indian Contract Act
Chapter V of the Indian Contract Act deals with such situations under
the heading "Of certain relations resembling those created by contract". The

authorisation the courts in India are not hindered in allowing relief under
the different sections of Act by the theoretical considerations concerning
quasi-contracts. But English cases do provide valuable guidance not only as
to scope of relief but also as to the way the provisions should be interpreted
to keep them in tune with the changing notions of justice. Sections 68 to 72
provide for five kinds of quasi-contractual obligation.
1. Supply of necessaries [S. 68]
Where necessaries are supplied to a person who is incompetent to con-
tract or to someone whom he is legally bound to support, the supplier is
entitled to recover the price from the property of the incompetent person.10
S. 68. Claim for necessaries supplied to person incapable of contract-
ing, or on his account.-If a person, incapable of entering into a contract or
anyone whom he is legally bound to support, is supplied by another person
with necessaries suited to his condition in life, the person who has furnished
such supples is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of such incapable
person.
Illustrations
(a) A supplies B, a lunatic, with necessaries suitable to his condition in life. A is entitled to be
reimbursed from B's property.
(b) A supplies the wife and children of B, a lunatic, with necessaries suitable to their condi-
tion in life. A is entitled to be reimbursed from B's property.
2. Payment by interested person [S. 69]
S. 69. Reimbursement of person paying money due by another, in pay-
ment of which he is interested.-A person who is interested in the payment
of money which another is bound by law to pay, and who therefore pays it is
entitled to be reimbursed by the other.
Illustration
B holds land in Bengal, on a lease granted by A, the Zamindar. The revenue payable by A
to the Government being in arrear, his land is advertised for sale by the Government. Under
the revenue law, the consequence of such sale will be the annulment of B's lease. B, to pre-
vent the sale and consequent annulment of his own lease, pays to the Government the sum
due from A. A is bound to make good to B the amount so paid.
Conditions of liability
The conditions of liability under this section may now be stated.
Payer must be interested in making payment
Firstly, the plaintiff should be interested in making the payment. The
interest which the plaintiff seeks to protect must, of course, be legally rec-
ognisable. His honest belief that he has an interest to protect is enough."
10. This provision has already been considered in Chapter 4, "Capacity to Contract”.

[S. 69]
Where a party had agreed to purchase certain mills, he was allowed to
recover from the seller the amount of already overdue municipal taxes paid
by him in order to save the property from being sold in execution. By agree-
ing to purchase the property he had acquired sufficient interest in it to safe-
guard. Lord RADCLIFFE refused to agree that the payment in question was
voluntary: "The company had contracted to buy these mills, and they were
imminently threatened with a forced sale which would, of course, defeat its
purchase. Money had to be found for the taxes if the mills were to be saved.
The Maharaja (seller) showed no sign of paying the municipality. So the
appellant company paid. But to describe it in those circumstances as having
made a voluntary payment appears to their Lordships to involve some mis-
use of language."
Explaining that the purchaser was sufficiently "interested" so as to
attract Section 69, his Lordship continued: "In any ordinary use of lan-
guage the company was interested in the taxes being paid at the time...since
only through a payment could it realise the fruit of the contract that it had
entered into. The words (of S. 69) themselves do not require that a person to
be interested in a payment should at the time have a legal proprietary inter-
est in the property in respect of which the payment is made. It is no doubt
true that there have been decisions which have tested whether a person was
interested in a payment by ascertaining whether he had such a proprietary
interest. It may be a good test in appropriate circumstances. But it would
be a bad fallacy to deduce from the circumstance that a person may be
interested in payment because he has an interest in the property to which it
relates the conclusion that no one who has not any interest in a property can
be interested in a payment made in respect of that property. In truth, Section
69 invites no such judicial limitation. The section is part of a Chapter of
the Contract Act devoted to 'Quasi-contract'. The phrase itself is no doubt
taken from a familiar branch of the English common law, although there is
no reason to suppose that the Indian Contract Act was intended to do no
more than to reproduce in compendious phrases the precise doctrines of
the English law of contract. But the general purport of the section is rea-
sonably clear to afford to a person who pays money in furtherance of some
existing interest an indemnity in respect of the payment, against any other
person who, rather than he, could have been made liable at law to make the
payment.
But should not be bound to pay
Secondly, it is necessary that the plaintiff himself should not be bound to
pay. He should only be interested in making the payment in order to pro-
tect his own interest. Where a person is jointly liable with others to pay, a

payment by him of the others' share would not give him a right of recovery
under this section.13 Where a port authority was under a statutory liability
to pay an injured workman and paid him, it could not recover from the
defendant, a contractor, whose negligence had caused injury, because the
port authority was not only "interested" but was also bound in its own
independent obligation to pay. 14
Defendant should be under legal compulsion to pay
Thirdly, the defendant should have been "bound by law" to pay the
money. The words "bound by law" have been held, after some hesitation,
to mean bound by law or by contract. It is not necessary that the liability
should be only statutory. It is enough that "the defendant at the suit of any
person might be compelled to pay".15 Explaining the purport of the phrase
in Govindram Gordhandas Seksaria v State of Gondal," where a Maharaja,
having sold certain mills without paying overdue municipal taxes, was sued
by the buyer who had to pay to save the property from being sold, Lord
RADCLIFFE said: "The Maharaja was bound to pay this money in the sense
that he made a legally enforceable contract with Seksaria to pay it. Unless
the words 'bound by law to pay' where they occur in the section, exclude
those obligations of law which arise inter partes, whether by contract or by
tort, and embrace no more than those public duties which are imposed by
statute or general law, the Maharaja was a person from whom reimburse-
ment could be claimed under the section. But their Lordships think that the
words extend to any obligation which is an effective bond in law. Certainly
the common law of England afforded a right of indemnity to one who had
paid 'under compulsion of law' against the true obliger without limiting the
circumstances in which the latter's liability had arisen. Certainly, too, there
is authority in the courts of India for the proposition that 'bound by law'
covers obligations of contract or tort."
Where a person is only morally bound and is not legally compellable to
pay, he will not be bound to pay the party discharging his moral obligation.
In a case before the Madras High Court, a person had, before his death,
gifted certain claims to the defendant. The taxing authorities, however,
added the claims to the estate of the deceased and recovered the tax from his

from the defendant, but he was held not liable. If the taxing authorities had
ordered him to pay, only then it could be said that he was bound by law to
pay.17
Payment should be by one to another
Lastly, the plaintiff should have made the payment to another person
and not to himself. "Thus, where a certain Government was the tenant of a
land and paid to itself out of the rent due to the landlord the arrears of land
revenue due to itself, the Government could not recover from the landlord.
It was a transfer of money from one head to another within the Government
and not 'payment to another' and though it was done to save the land from
being sold in execution, it did not come within the principle of the section.18
Goods sent by consigner through a carrier were looted enroute. The entire
amount of damage was paid by the insurer to the consignee. It was held that
the insurer became entitled to recover reimbursement from the carrier on the
basis of the letter of subrogation issued by the consignee to the insurer. The
insurer stepped into the shoes of the insured for recovery of the amount."19
3. Liability to pay for non-gratuitous acts [S. 70]
Section 70 creates liability to pay for the benefits of an act which the doer
did not intend to do gratuitously.
S. 70. Obligation of person enjoying benefit of non-gratuitous
act. Where a person lawfully does anything for another person, or delivers
anything to him, not intending to do so gratuitously, and such other person
enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the
former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered.

stances show that he intended to act gratuitously.

said thing he must not intend to act gratuitously; and (3) the other person
for whom something is done or to whom something is delivered must
enjoy the benefit thereof." ~
"Not intending to do so gratuitously"
Thus, one of the purposes of the section is to assure payment to a person
who has done something for another voluntarily and yet with the thought
of being paid. He should have contemplated being paid from the very begin-
ning. A Municipal Council which constructed and maintained a bus-stand.
was allowed to recover some charges from bus operators who used the stand
though there was no agreement to that effect." An employer is bound to pay
for services rendered by his employees. A university could not escape its
liability to reimburse a lecturer who worked under an appointment given to
him by the vice-chancellor though the post on which he was appointed was
not sanctioned by the State.23 The words "does anything" would include pay-
ment of money. Making payment for another tantamounts to doing some-
thing for him. Accordingly, a bank discounting an order of payment and
giving credit to the customer was allowed reimbursement from the customer
for something done for him.24 Where a tenant bank overstayed and also
did not pay the increased rent which it had acknowledged, the court said:25
Having regard to the law laid down in various decisions of the Supreme
Court and High Courts on the principle of "tenant-holding over" and its
consequential effect making the tenant liable to pay damages or mesne prof-
its to the landlord for continuing in possession without any authority of law
and similarly in view of the legal position as regards the principle of unjust
enrichment under the provisions of Section 70 of the Act, the court came
to the inevitable conclusion that the defendant bank was liable to pay the
plaintiff the entire amount of the suit claim.

[S. 70]
The plaintiff was singing for the firm of defendants. Her songs were
recorded by them. During the process of recording she did not seem to have
acted gratuitously. The defendants enjoyed the benefit of her recordings they
commercially marketed the cassettes and CDs of her song recordings. There
was no formal contract. Defendants had no right to make any business by
use of her performance. The court said that because they did make business
use of her work, a quasi-contract arose under Section 70 making the defend-
ants liable to pay for her services.26
Section would not encourage officious interference
in affairs of others
Secondly, the person for whom the act is done is not bound to pay unless
he had the choice to reject the services. "If a person delivers something to
another, it would be open to the latter to refuse to accept the thing and to
return it; in that case Section 70 would not come into operation. Similarly,
if a person does something for another, it would be open to the latter not
to accept what has been done by the former; in that case again Section
70 would not apply. In other words, the person said to be liable under
Section 70 always has the option not to accept the thing. It is only where he
voluntarily accepts the thing or enjoys the work done that the liability under
Section 70 arises."27 In the application of this principle, the courts have had
to strike a balance between two factors. One of them being that the rule
cannot be used by anybody to make officious interference in the affairs of
another. 28 And the other that the court will not compel a person to pay for
services which have been thrust upon him against his will. JENKINS CJ, deal-
ing with the scope of Section 70 in Suchand Ghosal v Balram Mardana,29
said:
"The terms of Section 70 are unquestionably wide, but applied with
discretion; they enable the courts to do substantial justice in cases where
it would be difficult to impute to the persons concerned relations actually
created by contract. It is, however, especially incumbent on final courts of
fact to be guarded and circumspect in their conclusions and not to coun-
tenance acts or payments that are really officious."
Request for services creates implied promise to pay
Yet, thirdly, it is necessary that services should have been rendered with-
out any request. Reasonable compensation may, however, be recovered for

services rendered at request. 30 This has been so held by the Supreme Court
in State of W.B. v B.K. Mondal & Sons:³
The plaintiff, on the request of an officer of the State of West Bengal,
constructed a kutcha road, guard-room, office, kitchen, room for clerks
and storage sheds for the use of the Civil Supplies Department of the
Government. The State accepted the works but tried to escape liability
under the pretence that no contract had been concluded in accordance
with the requirements of Section 175(3) of the Government of India Act,
1935 (now Article 299 of the Constitution of India). The contractor was
thus forced to try his luck with the State under Section 70, and it proved
to be better than that of the State but at the cost of fighting up to the
Supreme Court for a sum of Rs 19,325.
GAJENDRAGADKAR J (afterwards CJ), examined the conditions of lia-
bility under the section and found that they were all satisfied by the facts
and, therefore, held the State liable. There was no doubt that the State even
after having requested for the works had the right to reject. "It could have
called upon the contractor to demolish the storage sheds and take away the
material used; but if the State accepted the storage sheds and used them
and enjoyed their benefit, then different considerations come into play and
Section 70 can be invoked."
Where an item of work in a running contract was changed and the
builder worked out that item also but reluctantly and under pressure of the
Department, his claim for such additional working was allowed.

between the grant of a benefit to another on request or a grant without request. In both cases,
the person who enjoys the benefit is liable to recompense the grantor. In this case payment was
made on demand under a marriage proposal which fizzled out.

Non-compliance of constitutional requirements
of contracting with State
[S. 70]
The learned judge had still to face the mighty argument that the statutory
formalities of contracting with the State had not been observed and that the
enforcement of any such contract would defeat the relevant statute. This
difficulty was got over by holding that what was sought to be enforced was
not a contract, but a relation resembling those created by a contract. Thus,
in cases falling under Section 70 the person doing something for another
cannot sue for specific performance, nor ask for damages for breach and
this for the simple reason that there is no contract between the parties. All
that Section 70 provides for is that if the services or goods are accepted a
liability to pay arises. The mandatory provisions of Section 175(3) of the
Government of India Act, 1935, could be said to be circumvented only if a
contract not fulfilling the requirements were to be enforced, and not when
a claim was enforced under Section 70 which arises not by virtue of any
contract but rather by reason of the fact that the work has been done by
one party and enjoyed by the other without any contract at all. The mere
act of construction and its acceptance by the State cannot be said to con-
travene the provisions of Section 175(3). "Once it is realised that a cause
of action for a claim for compensation under Section 70 is based not upon
the delivery of the goods or the doing of any work as such but upon the
acceptance and enjoyment of the said goods or said work, it would not be
difficult to hold that Section 70 does not treat as valid the contravention of
Section 175(3) of the Act. That being so, the argument that the respondent's
construction of Section 70 nullifies the effect of Section 175(3) of the Act
cannot be accepted." "Any other approach would not only cause injustice
to a private party, but would also hamper Government business." "It is well
known that in functioning of the vast organisation represented by a mod-
ern State, Government officers have invariably to enter into a variety of
contracts which are often of a petty nature. Sometimes they have to act in
emergency, and on many occasions, in pursuit of the welfare policy of the
State, the Government officers may have to contract orally or through cor-
respondence, without complying with the provisions of Section 175(3). If,
in all these cases, what is done in pursuance of the contract is on behalf of
the Government and for their use and enjoyment and is otherwise legitimate
and proper, Section 70 would step in and support a claim for compensation
made by the contracting parties notwithstanding the fact that the contracts
had not been made as required by Section 175(3). ... We are referring to this
aspect of the matter not with a view to detract from the binding character of
large heap of earth. This was done by the contractor on verbal instructions of the Authority..
For this extra work of gratuitous nature the contractor became entitled to compensation. He
claimed an amount which appeared to be exorbitant. The case was remanded back to the trial
court for determination of amount payable.

Conditions of liability under the section 569
the provisions of Section 175(3), but to point out that like ordinary citizens
even the State Government is subject to the provisions of Section 70."
The court also laid down that the position of the State cannot be com-
pared with that of a minor. "The minor is excluded from the operation of
Section 70 for the reason that his case has been specifically provided for by
Section 68. What Section 70 prevents is unjust enrichment and it applies
as much to corporations and Government as to individuals.... Besides, in
the case of a minor, even the voluntary acceptance of the benefit of the
work done or thing delivered, which is the foundation of the claim under
Section 70, would not be present and so, on principle, Section 70 cannot be
invoked against a minor."
The principle of this case has been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in
Piloo Dhunjishaw Sidhwa v Municipal Corpn of City of Poona." Here
too the Corporation tried to escape liability for spare motor parts supplied
to it on the ground that the contract was not made in accordance with the
Bombay Municipal Corporation Act (59 of 1949). But the Corporation was
held liable to pay under Section 70. The only question was what should be
the measure of compensation. SHAH J (afterwards CJ) cited with approval
the decision of the Lahore High Court in Secy of State v G.T. Sarin & Co³
where it was held that "a person without an enforceable contract in his
favour supplying goods to a Government Department is entitled to a money
equivalent of the goods delivered, assessed at the market rate prevailing on
the date on which the supplies were made". In the present case the rates
quoted by the supplier in his invoice were considered to be the fair measure
of compensation giving the State the right to show that the market price
was less than that, but the Corporation did nothing in this respect. Thus,
though the claim under Section 70 is not based upon any contract, yet the
contract between the parties is relevant at least for indicating the fair meas-
ure of compensation.

supposed to have been done on gratuitous basis. The amount as sanctioned
and recommended must be paid. Such a claimant should not be compelled to
go into litigation. Technicalities should not come in the way of substantive

The Supreme Court has further held that where a contractor whose work
has been accepted by the other party claims compensation under an oral
agreement, which he is not able to prove, he would still be entitled to com-
pensation under Section 70." In another case, the Supreme Court held the
Government liable to a person who, on the instructions of the Government,
transferred the steel allotted to him in excess to a third person who failed
to pay.
Work done after termination of contract

Anything done after the termination of a contract would come within the
scope of Section 70,40
Contracts void under Article 299
Recovery under the section is possible even if there was no contract or
the contract was void under Article 299 of the Constitution.41 Thus the
Government was allowed to recover the cost of training from a candidate
who refused to join the Government service. The Government could have
waived but there was no evidence of waiver. He was sent on training on his
agreeing to serve the Government. He could not say that no advantage came
to him from the training. It has been held that salary or pension which
happens to be wrongfully paid is recoverable. This is so irrespective of the
fact whether the payment was made either by reason of misrepresentation or
fraud or otherwise.13

"Lawfully does"

Conditions of liability under the section 571
Fourthly, services should have been rendered lawfully. Commenting upon
this in State of W.B. v B.K. Mondal & Sons, the Supreme Court has said
that the word "lawfully" is not a surplusage and must be treated as an inte-
gral part of Section 70 and even if it is taken to refer to an object of con-
sideration which is forbidden by Section 23 of the Contract Act, it cannot
be taken to mean as requiring the State to pay under Section 70 for the ser-
vices which it has enjoyed was something forbidden by Section 175(3) of the
Government of India Act, 1935. Payment for extra work done in connection.
with a contract without any agreement has been allowed to be recovered
under this section."
It has been a point of emphasis that between the person claiming compen-
sation and the person against whom it is claimed, some lawful relationship
must exist and it should arise by reason of the fact that what has been done
for the former has been accepted and enjoyed by the latter. Acting on this,
the Orissa High Court allowed a person to recover what he had paid to
another for purchasing his paddy not knowing at the time that his purchase
was in violation of a State Control Order. Where a lady Advocate accepted
the request of the District Magistrate and rendered services as an Assistant
District Counsel for a certain period, she was allowed to retain the remu-
neration already received and also to recover the remaining remuneration
for the period of service even if her appointment was found to be void under
Section 24(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973."
Where a teacher due for retirement at the age of 55 obtained a stay order
contending that he was entitled to continue up to 60 and remained in service
beyond 55 before the matter was decided against him, he was allowed to
recover the monetary benefits of his entitlement for the overlapping period.
His conduct was not unlawful. He remained in service not by usurpation
but under superior orders."
Non-gratuitous acts
In the fifth place, the person rendering services should not have intended
to act gratuitously. The decision of the Madras High Court in Damodara
Mudaliar y Secy of State for India is the leading authority.

[S. 70]
The Government carried out repairs to the tank for its preservation. The
Zamindars also enjoyed the benefits of the repairs.
They were accordingly held liable to make proportional contribution
towards the expenses of repair. The case shows that even where the party
making payment or rendering services is personally interested in the matter,
he can recover proportional contribution from those who have enjoyed the
benefits of his services. Similarly, where the owners of a hat were required at
the pain of termination of their licence to make certain improvements in the
hat, one of them who carried out the improvements recovered compensation
from his co-owners. 51
Lender of money
A party admitted receipt of money as a loan. The transaction was oral,
wholly dependent upon the faith reposed by the lender. The circumstances
showed it to be a contract of loan. The court said that it could direct the
borrower to pay back the money at appropriate interest. It was not material
that there was no stamped paper acknowledging receipt of money."2
"ENJOYS THE BENEFIT."-Lastly, the defendant must have derived a direct
benefit from the payment or services. Where the works done by a railway
company developed the adjoining lands and consequently the municipality
received more taxes, this was held to be not a sufficient benefit to enable the
railway company to recover compensation from the municipality,
Services rendered to a person incompetent to contract at the time cannot
be made the basis of an action under this section. 54
Similarly, where no services have been rendered at all, for example, where
the Government cancelled a lease granted to the plaintiff by an officer who
was not so authorised, no relief can be allowed under the section. 55 Where

a road building contractor claimed an extra amount for the reason that he
had to spend more on the haulage of material than expected but he had been
told at the time of contracting to take care of all possibilities, the court said
that any disadvantage suffered by the contractor during the execution of the
work could not be made a ground of making an additional claim over and
above the contract rates.56
Provision for refund of price
A clause in a contract stipulated for reimbursement of the price of goods
which had already been paid in case of delayed delivery or delayed arrival or
non-delivery. The clause was held to be valid. Even in the absence of such a
clause, the price would have been refundable for failure to deliver.57 Where
a part payment was made by way of purchase price and not as an earnest
money, it could not be forfeited. In such a case, the remedy by way of dam-
ages for breach of contract is available.58 Where the contracting process had
been completed by acceptance of the bid at an auction but the bidder did not
sign the agreement papers saying that it had become impossible for him to
perform, the court said that this could not be regarded as a frustration of the
contract and therefore forfeiture of the security deposit in accordance with
the applicable rules was proper.59
Appropriate pleadings
It has been held that absence of pleadings to the effect that the transaction
between the parties did not involve any contract or involved a contract which
was not valid, the plaintiff would not be entitled to take aid of Section 70.60
4. Finder of goods [S. 71]
Section 71 lays down the responsibility of a finder of goods.
S. 71. Responsibility of finder of goods.-A person who finds goods
belonging to another and takes them into his custody, is subject to the same
responsibility as a bailee.
Thus in respect of duties and liabilities a finder is treated at a par with
bailee. The finder's position, therefore, has been considered along with
bailment.

but there were findings of fact by the trial court and those could be used for considering the
claim at the High Court level.

The Supreme Court has ruled in Union of India v Amar Singh" that the
statutory fiction by which a contract of bailment is inferred between a finder
of goods and the real owner should not be enlarged by analogy or other-
wise and, therefore, a railway authority which took into its custody wagons
containing the plaintiff's goods and which were left across the border in
Pakistan became the contractual bailees of goods, and it was not necessary
to regard them as finders within the meaning of Section 70.
5. Mistake or coercion [S. 72]
Section 72 deals with payments made or things delivered under mistake
or coercion.
S. 72. Liability of person to whom money is paid, or thing delivered,
by mistake or under coercion.-A person to whom money has been paid, or
anything delivered, by mistake or under coercion, must repay or return it.
Illustrations
(a) A and B jointly owe 100 rupees to C. A alone pays the amount to C, and B, not knowing
this fact, pays 100 rupees over again to C. C is bound to repay the amount to B.
(b) A railway company refuses to deliver up certain goods to the consignee, except upon
the payment of an illegal charge for carriage. The consignee pays the sum charged in
order to obtain the goods. He is entitled to recover so much of the charge as was ille-
gally excessive.
Mistake of fact or of law
Money paid under mistake is recoverable whether the mistake be of fact
or of law. The controversy between High Court decisions as to whether
money paid under mistake of law could be recovered was set at rest by
the Privy Council in Sri Sri Shiba Prasad Singh v Maharaja Srish Chandra
Nandi. 63
"Payment 'by mistake' in Section 72 must refer to a payment which
was not legally due and which could not have been enforced; the 'mistake'
is on thinking that the money paid was due when, in fact, it was not due.
There is nothing inconsistent in enacting on the other hand that if parties
enter into a contract under mistake in law that contract must stand and

is enforceable, but, on the other hand, that if one party acting under mis-
take of law pays to another party money which is not due by contract or
otherwise, that money must be repaid. Moreover, if the argument based
on inconsistency with Section 21 were valid, a similar argument based on
inconsistency with Section 22 would be valid and would lead to the con-
clusion that Section 72 does not even apply to mistake of fact.... It may
be well to add that their Lordships' judgment does not imply that every
sum paid under mistake is recoverable, no matter what the circumstances
may be. There may in a particular case be circumstances which disentitle
a plaintiff by estoppel or otherwise."
Refund of tax money paid without being due
The Supreme Court in its decision in STO v Kanhaiya Lal Mukund Lal
Saraf has accepted this interpretation of Section 72.
A certain amount of sales tax was paid by a firm under the U.P. Sales
Tax law on its forward transactions and subsequently to the payment, the
Allahabad High Court ruled the levy of sales tax on such transactions to
be ultra vires. The firm sought to recover back the tax money.
"66
Rejecting the contention based on English, American and Australian laws
which do not allow payments made under mistake of law to be recovered,
the Supreme Court allowed the recovery. "The section in terms does not
make any distinction between a mistake of law or a mistake of fact. The
term 'mistake' has been used without any qualification or limitation what-
The court found no ground for any estoppel against the firm and
disapproved the following statement of the Nagpur High Court.67 "If the
reason for the rule is that a person paying money under mistake is entitled to
recover it, because it is against the conscience of the receiver to retain it, then
when the receiver has no longer the money with him or cannot be considered
as still having it, as in a case where he has spent it on his own purposes,
different consideration must necessarily arise."
In reference to this, the Supreme Court said that "no such equitable
consideration can be imported when the terms of Section 72 are clear and
unambiguous".
If a mistake either of law or of fact is established, the assessee is entitled
to recover the money and the party receiving it is bound to return it irrespec-
tive of any other consideration. Money paid under a mistake of law comes

within "mistake" in Section 72 of the Contract Act and there is no question
of estoppel when the mistake of law is common to both the assessee and the
taxing authority.68
Scope of the word "mistake" in context of overpaid taxes
The scope of the word "mistake" has been further exemplified by the
Supreme Court in Tilokchand Motichand v H.B. Munshi."
A firm paid sales tax of more than twenty-six thousand rupees in
respect of sales to consumers outside the State of Bombay and which were,
therefore, not liable to any sales tax. The firm had itself collected the tax
money from its customers. The amount was ordered to be refunded. A
cheque was given to the firm subject to the condition that within one
month it should produce receipts from the customers outside Bombay
showing that the refund in question had been passed over to them. The
firm failed to do so and was, therefore, informed to return the tax money.
to the State failing which it would be recovered as arrears of land revenue.
The firm petitioned to the Bombay High Court but lost it. It paid back the
amount only when it received an order of attachment. When all this was
going on but unknown to the firm, the Act under which the recovery was
made from the firm had been declared by the Supreme Court to be ultra
vires.70 The firm sought to recover back the money as having been paid
under either mistake of law or coercion.
The court adopted the view of "mistake" which had been taken in the
earlier Privy Council and Supreme Court decisions to the effect that the
word means mistake in thinking that the money was due when in fact it
was not due and held that the firm in this case did not suffer from any such
mistake. The firm fully appreciated the legal position and knew that the

money was in fact due until the statute under which recovery was made was
declared to be ultra vires. The court, however, held that the payment was
made under coercion and would have been recoverable under Section 72,
had it not been for the expiry of the period of limitation. MITTER J who
spoke for the majority, held that the three years' period which was available
in this case for filing a suit for refund began to run from the date on which
the Act came into force and the petition was filed after more than three years
from that date. HEGDE J rightly dissented from this aspect of the majority
view. According to him time should begin to run from the date on which
the Act was ultimately declared to be void and the petition was filed very
soon thereafter." But it seems that justice lay in the majority view, for, as
between the firm and the State, the latter was better entitled to the money
which belonged not to the firm but to its customers.72
Where subsequently to the payment of excise duty the Excise Commissioner
declared that no duty was payable on those goods, it was held that the plain-
tiff's claim to refund could not be defeated on the ground that the refund
would unjustly enrich him." This should be contrasted with a decision of
the Andhra Pradesh High Court.74 Fee collected from consumers on the

is mistaken and recovery is allowable under S. 72, the general law of limitation would apply.

must show that he has suffered loss or injury. If the assessee has passed on the tax burden to
third persons, a suit for refund on the ground of payment under mistake of law would not
be maintainable. The dissenting judge (SEN J) was of the view that even in such cases refund
should be allowed. Pfizer Ltd v Union of India, (1996) 4 Bom CR 119, claim for refund of

sale of denatured spirit and paid into the Government account, though the
fee was illegal, the amount paid under it was not allowed to be recovered
back because it would have gone to enrich the seller at the cost of the vari-
ous buyers whom he would not have been able to pay back. As against this
recovery was allowed to a person who was compelled without authority to
pay Rs5 per quintal on the food exported by him under his export licence,
the source of payment being his own pocket and not the money collected
from customers.75
Excess stamp duty
Excess stamp duty happened to be paid voluntarily under some mistake.
The court said that it had to be refunded even though the payment was
wholly voluntary. An application for refund was also made as required by
the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958.76
Limitation and latches
Recovery proceedings generally are instituted by way of writ petition.
There is no period of limitation applicable to writs. The only requirement is
that there should not be unreasonable delay amounting to laches. It has been
held that the period of limitation would not begin to run until the applicant
has discovered the mistake or could have discovered it with reasonable dili-
gence. The claim was laid within one month of the mistake of law becoming
known. It was held that the claim could not be defeated on the ground of
limitation.77

Excess stamp duty 579
A petition was filed for refund of extra property tax paid under mistake.
The petitioner failed to explain the delay and latches in approaching the
court. The fact that he received belated advice was not considered to be suf-
ficient. The fact that the money was utilised by the municipal corporation
for the welfare of the people was held to be no defence: The court restricted
recovery of overpayment to the preceding three years and not for the whole
period.
Some other examples of mistake
Another obvious case is a mistaken credit entry in a customer's account
in a bank and the customer withdrawing the amount. He would be bound
to pay back the amount along with interest under the Interest Act." Where
rice-millers were paid an amount in excess of the agreed rate because of a
mistake in classification according to quality, they were required to disgorge
the unjust enrichment.80
Where a sum of money was paid to a bank as a price of the goods and
the bank issued delivery orders which were not accepted by the warehouse-
keeper, the Calcutta High Court held that this was not a payment under
mistake and Section 72 was not applicable." Where the railway authorities
charged extra fare under the mistaken belief that the goods would have to
be carried by a longer route, they were ordered to refund the extra fare.2

a part of the price for enabling him to pay off the mortgagee and no such
payment became necessary because the relief was provided to him under a
statutory provision with the result that the mortgage was redeemed without
payment, it was held that the purchaser was bound to return the money
retained by him for redemption. A mistaken overpayment of rent has been
held to be recoverable. The court said that when a person seeks recovery of
money paid under a mistake of law, it is not necessary to establish that he
had mistakenly believed that he was liable to make the payment. He has
only to show that he would not have made the payment but for the mistake
and possibly that the mistake was directly connected with the overpayment
or connected to the relationship between the payer and the payee.84
Kisan Vikas Patra purchased by a Cooperative Bank unconscious of
the fact that such banks were not allowed to do so under the Government
Savings Certificates Act, 1959, the post office also remained oblivious to
the restriction. It was held that the Post Office could not refuse interest
accrued up to the date of maturity. The principle of unjust enrichment does
not permit even the Government and its agencies of taking advantage of
such errors." Forfeiture of earnest money for not complying with the condi-
tions of the tender consequent upon issue of letters of intent was held to be
not an unjust enrichment. 86
A consignment of goods was damaged during transportation. The District
Forum under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, ordered the

Such company had paid the price to the consignee. The consignee had also
received the damaged goods. Thus the consignee, being the double benefi-
ciary, was directed to return the damaged goods to the carrier. In case he
had disposed them of, he was directed to pay the value of the damaged
goods to the carrier.

unjust enrichment at the cost of the other and also penalty for the fault of
the creditor.
Change of position by payee in reliance on payment
Every payment made under mistake is, however, not recoverable. "There
may in a particular case be circumstances which disentitle a plaintiff by
estoppel or otherwise." The Calcutta High Court followed this principle
in a case in which the facts were as follows:
The plaintiff bank made payment of certain crossed cheques to the
defendant bank. The latter informed their customer-payee of the cheques
and that the payment had been received for the cheques. It then turned
out that the cheques were forged. The plaintiff sued the defendant bank
and his customer to recover back the amount contending that the payment
had been made under the mistaken belief that the cheques were genuine.
The court came to the conclusion that if the defendant bank had not paid
away the proceeds to its customer or if the customer had not yet delivered
the goods, the money could have been recovered back under Section 72. The
defendant bank and its customer were as much ignorant of the forgery as the
plaintiff bank and they, having altered their position because of the cheques
being cleared, it was too late to recover back. Neither were they guilty of any
fraud nor had they been enriched by the mistake."
This defence would be available to the payee only if he can show that he
has changed his position to his disadvantage in consequence of the payment.
Thus where certain films were delivered in pursuance to a contract for pro-
cessing, developing and exhibition and certain instalments were paid by the
recipient who had also spent some money on processing, etc, he was allowed
to recover back the money paid when it was discovered that the contract was
void. The payee was not prejudiced by the fact that he delivered the films
because they would be restored to him. It was the payer who was prejudiced
having expended money on processing, etc.92

estoppel by reason of the payer's conduct or where the payment had been
made to an agent who paid it over to the principal. There was a total failure
of consideration because the payee of the instalments had no right to hand
over the films."
The Supreme Court did not allow a party to recover back the amount of
surcharge paid by him to a corporation for granting him an export licence,
though the levy was subsequently found to be not authorised. Illegal taxes
were considered by the court to be something different from payments made
to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit. But where extra pay-
ment happened to be made on procurement of paddy because of a mistake
about its quality, it was allowed to be recovered back."
The payment of a sum of money by way of part payment of the price in
advance for purchase of goods was allowed to be recovered back even where
the buyer himself made a default in buying the goods. The court said that
the result would have been different if the contract had contained a forfei-
ture clause. The court allowed interest at 9 per cent p.a.%

supply should be continued at original prices. The proposed enhancement
was finally found to be valid. It was held that the consumers were liable to
pay the difference in prices since the first notice of escalation and also inter-
est on delayed payments. The court applied the principles of deemed renewal
and restitution." The terms of the original contract had expired. No new
contract could be made because of the consumers refusal to accept the new

price. The continuance of the supply and its acceptance by consumers under
the court order became the foundation of a deemed renewal.98
Coercion
The word "coercion" is used in this section in its general sense and not as
defined in Section 15." Thus money paid under pressure of circumstances,
such as prevention of the execution of a decree on a property in which the
party paying is interested, may be recovered even though "coercion" as
defined in Section 15 is not established.100
The WESCO extracted arrears of the electricity bill of the previous con-
sumer from the subsequent purchaser of the property by refusing to supply
them with electricity unless they paid, contrary to the statute. It was held to
be an unjust enrichment by depriving a man of his money without authority
of law,101
QUASI-CONTRACTS IN ENGLISH LAW
The variety of quasi-contractual obligations recognised by English Law
may now be noted.
Payments to the defendant's use
Two principles seem to govern this kind of quasi-contractual liability.
One of them is that the payment should have been made under pressure and
not voluntarily and the other is that the defendant should have been bound
to pay and has been relieved of his liability by the payment made by the
plaintiff.
An expenditure or payment made purely voluntarily will not do. If, for
example, a person pays premiums due upon the policy of another without
his request and without any compulsion, he cannot recover.102 Similarly,

where a municipal corporation, having no legal liability to do so, carried out
repairs of a canal bridge, which it was the obligation of the canal authority
to maintain, the corporation, could not recover, although the bridge was,
for want of repair, endangering the road and although the corporation had
without success requested the defendant to carry out the repairs. They were
still volunteers.103 There was no legal compulsion on them to carry out the
repairs. The only compulsion was the damage being done to the road and
the expenditure made by them in protecting the road may give remedy under
some other principle but definitely not under quasi-contract.
The kind of compulsion or pressure that the law recognises for the pur-
poses of this remedy is evidenced by Exall v Partridge. 104 Here the plaintiff
had left his carriage upon the premises in which the defendant was living as a
tenant. The landlord lawfully seized all the goods on the premises including
the carriage for non-payment of rent and would have sold them in execution
of his claim. The plaintiff paid the outstanding rent to get back his carriage
and then sued the defendant for the amount. He was held entitled to it.
Another illustration is Brook's Wharf & Bull Wharf Ltd v Goodman
Bros. 10 This was a case in which the plaintiffs, who were warehousemen,
had taken into their bonded warehouse furs which were imported and were
liable to duty. A man keeps a bonded warehouse on the terms that he will
be responsible to the Commissioner of Customs and Excise if those goods.
go out of his bonded warehouse before the duties have been paid. The
defendants had imported skins and put them in the plaintiff's warehouse.
The goods were stolen from the warehouse and the Commissioner recovered
the duty from the warehousemen. "They had no answer, they had held the
bonded goods, the bonded goods had left their warehouse and could be
made available by the thieves on the home market, and the bonded ware-
housemen had to pay. They were held entitled to recover from the importers
the amount which they had paid because it was primarily the importer's
duty to have paid the import duties as soon as the goods were imported into
this country."
The conditions of this action were restated by LYNSKEY J in Monmouth-
shire County Council v Smith.106
"The essence of the rule is that there must be a common liability to
pay money to a particular person; that the plaintiff has been compelled
to pay it by law; that the defendant is liable to pay that money; and that
the defendant's debt or liability has been discharged by the plaintiff's
payment."

Quasi-contracts in English Law 585
This statement was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appeal was
heard along with Metropolitan Police Distt Receiver v Croydon Corpn.107
The two appeals raised exactly the same point. A police constable was
injured through the negligence of the defendants and had to remain off duty
during the period of illness. The police authorities had under statutory reg-
ulations paid them off-duty wages. The police authorities brought an action
to recover the amount so paid away as off-duty wages. The contention was
that if the police authorities had not paid them, the constables could have
recovered from the defendants, the loss of wages and that the liability of
the defendants was thereby reduced. But the Court of Appeal did not allow
any remedy under quasi-contract. In each case the defendant was liable to
pay compensation to the injured constable and their liability did not include
loss of wages. Thus the payment by the police authorities did not relieve the
defendant of any liability.
Voluntary payments
Payments made under mistake of fact
Payments made under a mistake of fact can be recovered provided that
the party paying would have been liable to pay if the mistaken fact were
true. Thus where money was paid under a life insurance policy which to
the knowledge of the company had lapsed, but the fact of lapse having been
forgotten at the moment, the company was held entitled to recover back
the money,108 PARKE B pointing out that it would be against conscience for
a person receiving such payment to retain it. The principle of this case was
applied subsequently to a case where payment was made under a policy of
marine insurance under the mistaken knowledge that the cargo of lemons
had perished whereas in fact it was only sold en route, the Privy Council
held that the money was recoverable.109
One of the essential conditions of this action is that "the mistake must be
as to a fact which, if true, would make the person paying liable to pay the
money". This suggestion was made in Aiken v Short110 and was approved by
the Court of Appeal in Morgan v Ashcroft. The facts as summarised by
the court were as follows:
The respondent is a book-maker. The plaintiff is a publican who was a
regular customer of the respondent for betting transactions. The nature
of the mistakes which led to the alleged overpayment of about £24 upon
which the action was brought, was proved in evidence to have been a
clerical error by the respondent's clerk which led her to give the appellant

credit for the sum of about £24 twice over; thus causing the respondent
to pay to the appellant £24 too much.
The action was to recover back the overpayment, and it was lost on two
grounds. Firstly, the court was forbidden by the Gaming Act, 1845, from
looking into betting transactions and, secondly, even if the mistaken over-
credit were taken to be true, there would have been no liability to pay.
In the subsequent case of Larner v LCC112 the Court of Appeal relaxed
the principle to this extent that a belief that there is a moral liability to pay
is sufficient to prevent the payment from being regarded as purely voluntary.
In that case an employer whose servants were called up for military service
proposed to pay them the difference between their pay and the pay given to
them by the military authorities. The plaintiff to whom such difference had
to be paid did not inform the employer of the difference and consequently
he was overpaid. When he came back the employer began to deduct from his
pay the extra payment which he tried to stop. But the employer was allowed
to recover the extra payment. The scheme was no doubt voluntary, but once
announced, the payments made under it could not be regarded as voluntary.
It is also necessary for this kind of action to succeed that the mistake must
be one of fact and not of law. The distinction may often be difficult to draw
and the rule may for this reason have often been criticized, it is still a part of
the law. Thus, payment of extra rent made under an agreement to increase
rent made in violation of a Rent Control Act could not be recovered,113
Similarly, the duty paid on an item which the House of Lords had held in
another case to be not dutiable, could not be recovered.114 So was true of an
extra gratuity paid on a mistaken view of the relevant regulations.115
Where a private document has been construed by a court of law, that
interpretation becomes a part of the law. Thus, where an undertaking in a
separation deed to pay the wife an annual sum of money "free of any deduc-
tions whatever" had already been construed as excluding deduction for
income tax, a payment in ignorance of this interpretation without deducting
income tax could not be recovered.116
Payments made under an ineffective contract
Three kinds of situation are generally considered under this head, namely,
total failure of consideration, money paid under a void contract and money
paid under an illegal contract. The effects of void and illegal contracts have
already been considered, only the effect of total failure of consideration will
be taken up here. Where one of the parties to a contract has paid money

Quasi-contracts in English Law 587
former has an option, namely, either to sue the other for the breach of con-
tract or to treat the contract as at an end and recover back his money under
quasi-contract. Quasi-contractual remedy arises when there has been a
total failure of consideration as opposed to partial. For example, where a
shareholder of a company transferred his shares to the plaintiff for which
the price was paid, but the company on account of certain conduct on the
part of the transferor himself refused to register the transfer of his shares,
this was held to be a total failure of consideration enabling the plaintiff to
recover back his price.117
Other instances can be seen in transactions relating to sale of goods. If
the buyer has to return the goods on account of there being no title on the
part of the seller to sell, the buyer can recover the whole of his price with-
out any deduction for use value, for there is, in such cases, a total and not
a partial failure of consideration. The same principle shall apply where
the goods have been taken under hire-purchase and the buyer had to return
them to the true owner. 119
Partial failure of consideration will not have the same effect. Thus, where
a boy was registered as an apprentice with a watchmaker for a period of
six years on payment of a premium and the master died when the boy had
learned only for one year, he could not recover any part of his premium,
there being only a partial failure of consideration.120 The same result fol-
lowed where a party occupied a premises on paying the agreed rent but left
soon thereafter on account of the landlord's failure to carry out his part of
the promise, he could not recover back the rent.[21
Payments made under compulsion
Where the owner of a market realised tolls from a shopkeeper by seizing
his goods and it being subsequently held that he had no such authority, the
shopkeeper was allowed to reclaim the toll money.122 But where any such fee
or toll is paid without improper pressure or compulsion, there would be no
right of recovery;123 so also where the payment is in response to summons
issued by a court of law.24 Payments extorted under colour of authority
which is unfounded are recoverable.125

588 Chapter 10 Certain Relations Resembling Those Created by Contract
Quantum meruit
[S. 72]
Where a party has in the performance of his contract done some work or
rendered some service and the further performance has been made useless
by the other party, he may recover reasonable compensation for the work or
service. Plinche v Colburn is an authority for this principle.
The plaintiff was the author of several dramatic entertainments. He
was engaged by the defendants, who were the publishers of a work called
"The Juvenile Library" to write for that work an article to illustrate the
history of armour and costumes from the earliest times, for which he
was to be paid, 100 guineas. The plaintiff made various drawings and
prepared a considerable portion of manuscript when the defendants dis-
continued the Juvenile Library. The plaintiff claimed a sum of 50 guineas
for the part which he had prepared, and the trouble he had taken in the
business. He was held entitled to it.
Similarly, where a printer, having printed most of the work, refused to
complete it because the dedication was libellous, he was held entitled to
recover on quantum meruit. 127 A similar recovery is allowed where a person
has rendered services under a supposed contract which turns out to be a
nullity. Craven-Ellis v Canons Ltd128 is an authority for this.
The plaintiff was appointed managing director of a company. The
appointment was made by the other directors who were disqualified by
reason of having not taken their qualification shares. The plaintiff also
did not take his qualification shares. But he continued to act as managing
director and sued the company for his agreed remuneration or for a rea-
sonable remuneration on the basis of quantum meruit.
The Court of Appeal rejected the claim for the agreed remuneration, the
contract of appointment being void, but allowed him to recover on the basis
of quantum meruit. GREEH LJ emphasised that a claim of this kind does not
depend upon implied contract arising by virtue of the services having been
accepted or upon inference of law, but upon a rule of law.
"The obligation to pay reasonable remuneration for the work done
when there is no binding contract between the parties is imposed by a
rule of law, and not by an inference of fact arising from the acceptance of
services or goods. It is one of the cases which are referred to in books on
contract as obligations arising quasi ex contractu of which a well-known
instance is a claim based on money which had been received."129

Quasi-contracts in English Law 589
Though the remedy is independent of contract, but the contract, if any,
shall not be wholly irrelevant. Thus where a ship was delivered for repairs
and the contractor used more expensive material than that authorised by the
contract, he could not recover under the contract because he had not carried
it out precisely, nor under quasi-contract, because the shipowner had no
chance to reject the expensive material. He could not have rejected the ship
after it was already repaired and the mere taking of his own property was
not the same thing as an acquiescence in or acceptance of the work done.130
Where adequate relief is available under the contract itself, the court may
not provide any relief under quasi-contract.
In the course of the performance of a contract to construct a power
dam, the owner was in several important respects in breach of the con-
tract. The breach was so fundamental as to justify termination of the
contract. However, the contractor continued to work and completed the
project. He claimed compensation for the owner's breach on quantum
meruit basis.
It was held that the contractor, having continued to work the contract in
the face of the owner's breach, was entitled to recover under the contract.
Since the contractor had completed the contract, and had adequate remedy
under the contract, there was no need for law to fashion a restitutionary
remedy. Nor would it be right for the contractor to obtain a possibly higher
rate of compensation than that under the contract.131
implied contract but on a claim for restitution and the liability to pay a reasonable remuner-
ation arose from the operation of the law upon the circumstances. A quantum meruit is an
obligation or debt imposed by operation of law which arises in the defendant having taken
the benefit of the work done, goods supplied or services rendered. Pavey and Matthews Pty

Contract of Indemnity
Definition and nature
Definition in English Law
An illustration in English law of the meaning and effect of a contract of
indemnity is to be found in the facts of Adamson v Jarvis:¹
The plaintiff, an auctioneer, sold certain cattle on the instruction of the
defendant. It subsequently turned out that the livestock did not belong to
the defendant, but to another person, who made the auctioneer liable and
the auctioneer in his turn sued the defendant for indemnity for the loss he
had thus suffered by acting on the defendant's directions.
The court laid down that the plaintiff having acted on the request of the
defendant was entitled to assume that, if, what he did, turned out to be
wrongful, he would be indemnified by the defendant.
Thus "indemnity" in English law means a promise to save a person harm-
less from the consequences of an act. The promise may be express or it
may be implied from the circumstances of the case. Thus, for example, in
Dugdale v Lovering:
The plaintiffs were in possession of certain trucks which were claimed
both by the defendants and one K.P. Co. The defendants demanded deliv-
ery and the plaintiffs asked for an indemnity bond, but received no reply.
Even so they delivered the trucks to the defendants.
K.P. Co, having successfully sued the plaintiffs for conversion of their
property, the plaintiffs were held entitled to recover indemnity from the
defendants on an implied promise as evidenced by the fact that by demand-
ing an indemnity, they made it quite clear that they had no intention to
deliver except on indemnity. Similarly, in Sheffield Corpn v Barclay,³ a cor-
poration, having registered a transfer of stock on the request of a banker,
was held entitled to recover indemnity from the banker when the transfers
were discovered to be forged.

2. (1875) LR 10 CP 196: 44 LJ CP 157: 32 LT 155.
3. 1905 AC 392. In similar circumstances in Starkey v Bank of England, (1903) AC 114 (HL), a
bank was allowed to recover indemnity from an agent who presented a transfer document on
which one out of three signatures were forged, though he did not know this fact.

592 Chapter 11 Contract of Indemnity
[S. 124]
The English definition of indemnity is wide enough to include a prom-
ise of indemnity against loss arising from any cause whatsoever, e.g., loss
caused by fire or by some other accident. Indeed, every contract of insur-
ance, other than life assurance, is a contract of indemnity."
Definition in Section 124 narrower
But the definition of "indemnity" in Section 124 of the Indian Contract
Act is somewhat narrower. It is like this:
S. 124. "Contract of Indemnity" defined.-A contract by which one
party promises to save the other from loss caused to him by the conduct of the
promisor himself, or by the conduct of any other person, is called a "contract of
Indemnity".
Illustration
A contracts to indemnify B against the consequences of any proceedings which C may
take against B in respect of a certain sum of 200 rupees. This is a contract of indemnity.
The only illustration appended to the section says that if a person prom-
ises to save another from the consequences of a proceeding which may be
commenced against him it is a contract of indemnity.³
The person who gives the indemnity is called the "indemnifier" and the
person for whose protection it is given is called the "indemnity-holder" or
"indemnified".
4. See Oriental Fire and General Insurance Co v Savoy Solvent Oil Extractions Ltd, (1997)
6 ALD 1, the following propositions are noticeable from the judgment: in a claim under an
insurance policy, if the insurer is refusing payment, the burden lies upon him to show that
the assured violated the conditions of the policy; if the assured presents a bogus claim (in
this case that the whole stock was burnt, which was not found to be true) he would forfeit all
benefits under the policy, he has to observe good faith throughout; a provision in the policy
that the insurer may enter upon the affected premises and may remain there for the purposes
of assessment, does not make it his duty to do so. State of Orissa v United India Insurance
Co Ltd, (1997) 5 SCC 512: AIR 1997 SC 2671, insurance from port to port, cancellation
by the insurer at a subsequent stage, valid. United India Insurance Co Ltd v T. Venkata
Narsaiah, AIR 2002 NOC 119 (AP), the insurer held liable for stock of bidis destroyed in fire,
figures of the stock were known to the insurer. Shifting of the insured stock from one specified
ground to another to protect it from rain could not be regarded as contrary to the insurance
policy. Vishan Narain v Oriental Insurance Co Ltd, AIR 2002 Del 336 vehicle insured for
Rs 1,00,000, it was stolen and became a total loss, the insurer not permitted to say that his
liability was only up to market value of the vehicle. Eastern Counties Leather plc v Eastern
Counties Leather Group Ltd, 2002 EWHC 494: 2002 Env LR 34, right to indemnity which
became exercisable on account of the repair works for protection of water pollution caused by
a tannery. National Insurance Co Ltd v Arumugham, (2006) 2 CTC 368, a contract of vehicle
insurance, indemnity, insurer could not depend upon exclusion clauses.
5. For another illustration see Mangladha Ram v Ganda Mal, AIR 1929 Lah 388, where a
vendor's promise to the vendee to be liable if title to the land was disturbed was held to be
one of indemnity. Other illustrations are service bonds executed by the employees to serve the
master for a particular period or persons claiming payment of money of delivery of goods on
indemnity bonds having lost the original documents of title. M. Sham Singh v State of Mysore,
(1973) 2 SCC 303: AIR 1972 SC 2440, an employee, sent abroad for training on scholarship,
undertaking to serve the State on coming back.

[S. 124]
Definition and nature 593
Thus the scope of "indemnity" is by the very process of definition restricted
to cases where there is a promise to indemnify against loss, caused: (a) by
the promisor himself, or (b) by any other person. The definition excludes
from its purview cases of loss arising from accidents like fire or perils of the
sea. Loss must be caused by some human agency.6 Contracts of insurance
against loss are covered by the chapter on Contingent Contracts."
Secondly, situations like those in Adamson v Jarvis where cattle were
sold under the instruction of a wrongful owner, are also outside the scope
of this definition. Such cases and the case of a loss arising from an act done
at the request of the promisor are covered by Section 223 of the Act which
provides for indemnity between principal and agent."
The promise of indemnity, as envisaged by the section, may be express
or implied. An illustration of implied indemnity is the decision of the Privy
Council in Secy of State for India in Council v Bank of India Ltd."
A note with forged indorsement was given to a bank which received it
for value and in good faith. The bank sent it to the Public Debt Office for
renewal in their name. The true owner of the note recovered compensa-
tion from the State and the State was allowed to recover from the bank on
an implied promise of indemnity.
An indemnity bond which permits an employee to leave the employment
earlier than the minimum agreed period only at the cost of the forfeiture of
his bond money is valid provided both the period of restriction and the bond
money are reasonable. Only that part of the bond money can be retained
which is necessary to indemnify the employer for his loss."1
The question before the Supreme Court was whether the document con-
tained a contract of indemnity or of bank guarantee. The document pur-
ported to indemnify the party against losses, claims, damages etc. which
may be suffered by it. It did not employ the usual words which are found in
à bank guarantee like unequivocal conditions, unconditional and absolute.
It was held to be a contract of indemnity. The claim made by the assured
on termination of the contract need not be honoured by the bank without
proof of loss, 12

594 Chapter 11 Contract of Indemnity
Insurance indemnity
[S. 125]
Almost all insurances other than life and personal accident insurance are
contracts of indemnity. The insurer's promise to indemnify is an absolute
one. A suit can be filed immediately upon failure of performance, irrespec-
tive of actual loss. If the indemnity holder incurred liability and that liability
was absolute, he would be entitled call upon the indemnifier to save him
from that liability by paying it off.13
Extent of liability
Section 125 lays down the extent of liability.
S. 125. Rights of indemnity-holder when sued.-The promisee in a con-
tract of indemnity, acting within the scope of his authority, is entitled to recover
from the promisor-
(1) all damages which he may be compelled to pay in any suit in respect of
any matter to which the promise to indemnify applies;
(2) all costs which he may be compelled to pay in any such suit if, in bringing
or defending it, he did not contravene the orders of the promisor, and
acted as it would have been prudent for him to act in the absence of
any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor authorised him to bring or
defend the suit;
(3) all sums which he may have paid under the terms of any compromise of
any such suit, if the compromise was not contrary to the orders of the
promisor; and was one which it would have been prudent for the promi-
see to make in the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promi-
sor authorized him to compromise the suit.
The indemnity-holder, acting within the scope of his authority, is entitled
to recover the following amounts-
(1) All damages which he may be compelled to pay in any suit in respect
of any matter to which the promise of indemnity applies;14
(2) all costs which he may be compelled to pay in such suits if, in bringing
or defending it, he did not contravene the order of the promisor, and
acted as it would have been prudent for him to act in the absence of
any contract of indemnity, or, if the promisor authorised him to bring
or defend the suit;15

(3) all sums which he may have paid under the terms of any compromise
of any such suit, if the compromise was not contrary to the orders of
the promisor, and was one which it would have been prudent for the
promisee to make in the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the
promisor authorised him to compromise the suit."
A person who encashes an indemnity bond which is in the nature of a
bank guarantee can retain only that part of the amount of the bond which
represents the damage or loss suffered by the bond-holder as a result of the
contracting party's breach. Anything more would be undeserved windfall
for one party and penalty of the other."
Where a motor vehicle (truck) was under indemnity insurance for
Rs 2,00,000 and it was stolen with no chances of recovery, it was held that
the proper amount of indemnity was as fixed by the surveyor at Rs 1,87,492
and that it was payable with 18 per cent interest for the delay period. The
settlement of claim at a lesser amount by insurance authorities was arbitrary
and unfair under Article 14 of the Constitution.18
Commencement of liability
An important question in this connection is when does the indemnifier
become liable to pay, or, when is the indemnity-holder entitled to recover his
indemnity? The original English rule was that indemnity was payable only
after the indemnity-holder had suffered actual loss by paying off the claim.
The maxim of law was: "you must be damnified before you can claim to be
indemnified." But the law is now different. The process of transformation
is well-explained by CHAGLA J [afterwards CJ] of the Bombay High Court
in Gajanan Moreshwar Parelkar v Moreshwar Madan Mantri:19 "It is true
that under the English common law no action could be maintained until the
actual loss had been incurred. It was very soon realized that an indemnity

also E.E. Caledonia v Orbit Valve Co, (1994) 2 Lloyd's Rep 230 (CA), where the question was

ered acts of negligence and breaches of statutory duty. Sujir Ganesh Nayak & Co v National
Insurance Co Ltd, AIR 1996 Ker 49, the fire policy carried "riot and strike endorsement", this
was held to be applicable to partial cessation or interruption of work resulting in loss. Raigad

[S. 125]
might be worth very little indeed if the indemnified could not enforce his
indemnity till he had actually paid the loss. If a suit was filed against him he
had actually to wait till a judgment was pronounced and it was only after
he had satisfied the judgment that he could sue on his indemnity. It is clear
that this might under certain circumstances throw an intolerable burden
upon the indemnity-holder. He might not be in a position to satisfy the
judgment and yet he could not avail himself of his indemnity till he had done
so. Therefore, the court of equity stepped in and mitigated the rigour of the
common law. The court of equity held that if his liability had become abso-
lute then he was entitled either to get the indemnifier to pay off the claim or
to pay into court sufficient money which would constitute a fund for paying
off the claim whenever it was made."20
This principle was expounded in Richardson, re, where BUCKLEY LJ
observed: "Indemnity is not necessarily given by repayment after pay-
ment. Indemnity requires that the party to be indemnified shall never be
called upon to pay...." The High Court of Calcutta in its well-known
decision in Osman Jamal & Sons Ltd v Gopal Purshttam followed this
principle.
A company was acting as the commission agents of the defendant firm
and in that capacity bought certain goods for the defendants which they
failed to take. The supplier became entitled to recover from the company
certain sum of money as damages for breach. The company went into
liquidation before paying the claim.
It was held that the Official Liquidator could recover the amount even
though the company had not actually paid the vendor. The court, however,
directed that the amount should be set apart so that it is used in full pay-
ment of the vendor in respect of whose contract the company had incurred
. liability.24

Insurance Co's, re, (1914) 2 Ch 617, 638 (CA) that indemnity does not merely mean to reim-
burse in respect of moneys paid, but to save from loss in respect of the liability against which
the indemnity has been given because otherwise indemnity may be worth very little if the
indemnity-holder is not able to pay in the first instance.

The High Courts of Allahabad's, Madras and Patna27 have all expressed
their concurrence in the principle that as soon as the liability of the indem-
nity-holder to pay becomes clear and certain he should have the right to
require the indemnifier to put him in a position to meet the claim. But con-
trary views have also been expressed.28
Where an authorised agent of the insurance company collected the pre-
mium amount from the assured against proper receipt, the liability of the
insurer began from that moment though the agent deposited the collection
with the company after the occurrence.29
Specified time for notice
An insured motor vehicle was lost by theft. The insurance policy required
the assured to send notice to the insurer immediately after theft or any other
criminal act. The assured made police report of the theft immediately after
the incident, but informed the insurer after one month. The question was
whether this could be regarded as a notice given immediately. The court said
that the expression immediately implies notice to be given with promptitude
avoiding unnecessary delay. Immediate police report showed the bona fides
of the assured in the matter. Report to the insurer after one month could not
be regarded as unreasonable. Indemnification could not be denied."

Guarantee
DEFINITION
S. 126. "Contract of guarantee", "surety", "principal debtor" and "cred-
itor". A "contract of guarantee" is a contract to perform the promise, or dis-
charge the liability, of a third person in case of his default. The person who gives
the guarantee is called the "surety"; the person in respect of whose default the
guarantee is given is called the "principal debtor', and the person to whom the
guarantee is given is called the "creditor". A guarantee may be either oral or
written.
Economic functions of guarantee
The function of a contract of guarantee is to enable a person to get a loan,
or goods on credit, or an employment. Some person comes forward and tells
the lender, or the supplier or the employer that he (the person in need) may
be trusted and in case of any default, "I undertake to be responsible". For
example, in the old case of Birkmyr v Darnell' the court said:
"If two come to a shop and one buys, and the other to give him credit,
promises the seller, 'If he does not pay you, I will"."
This type of collateral undertaking to be liable for the default of another
is called a "contract of guarantee". In English law a guarantee is defined as
"a promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another".² It
is a collateral engagement to be liable for the debt of another in case of his
default. "Guarantees are usually taken to provide a second pocket to pay if
the first should be empty."
Parties
The person who gives the guarantee is called the "surety", the person in
respect of whose default the guarantee is given is called the "principal debtor"
and the person to whom the guarantee is given is called the "creditor".

600 Chapter 12 Guarantee
Independent liability different from guarantee
[S. 126]
There must be a conditional promise to be liable on the default of the
principal debtor. A liability which is incurred independently of a "default" is
not within the definition of guarantee. To refer again to Birkmyr v Darnell,
where referring to the buyer's companion, the court further said that if the
companion had said: "Let him have the goods, 'I will be your pay master' or
'I will see you paid." "This would have been an undertaking as for himself
and is not a guarantee." This principle was applied in Taylor v Lee' decided
in the US:
A landlord and his tenant went to the plaintiff's store. The landlord
said to the plaintiff: Mr Parker will be on our land this year, and you will
sell him anything he wants, and I will see it paid.
This was held to be an original promise, and not a collateral promise to
be liable for the default of another and, therefore, not a guarantee.
The undertaking by a bank in the shape of a bank guarantee is also in the
nature of an independent obligation payable on demand. It has nothing to
do with the state of relations between the parties to the contract. It is a suit-
able method of securing payment in commercial dealings. The beneficiary is
entitled to realise the whole of the amount under the guarantee irrespective
of pending disputes between the parties."
Where only an assurance for repayment of amount due from the loanee
was given by means of a letter, the court said that it could not be construed
as a deed of guarantee. The writer of the letter was accordingly held not lia-
ble.10 Where a letter of comfort was issued by a holding company in favour

This was held to be a personal undertaking and not a guarantee. An undertaking to discharge
the liability of another without any request from him creates an independent liability and not
collateral as that of a guarantor. N.S. Varghese v Dhanalakshmi Bank Ltd, 1997 AIHC 1820

of its associate company that it had capabilities of meeting its financial and
contractual obligations, the court said that the letter was in the nature of a
recommendatory document. It could not be construed as a guarantee there
being nothing in it showing that the holding company was understanding
to discharge any liability of its associate in the event of the latter's default."
ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF GUARANTEE
The following are the requisites of a valid guarantee:
1. Principal debt
Recoverable debt necessary
The purpose of a guarantee being to secure the payment of a debt, the
existence of a recoverable debt is necessary.12 It is of the essence of a guaran-
tee that there should be someone liable as a principal debtor and the surety
undertakes to be liable on his default. If there is no principal debt, there
can be no valid guarantee." "A contract of guarantee is a tripartite agree-
ment which contemplates the principal debtor, the creditor and the surety."15
This was so held by the House of Lords in the Scottish case of Swan v Bank
of Scotland, decided as early as 1836.
The payment of the overdraft of a banker's customer was guaranteed
by the defendant. The overdrafts were contrary to a statute, which not
only imposed penalty upon the parties to such drafts but also made them
void. The customer having defaulted, the surety was sued for the loss.
But he was held not liable. The court said that "if there is nothing due, no
balance, the obligation to make that nothing good amounts itself to nothing.
If no debt is due, if the banker is forbidden from having any claim against his
customer, there is no liability incurred by the co-obligers".17

602 Chapter 12 Guarantee
Guarantee for void debt, when enforceable
[S. 126]
But sometimes a guarantee even for a void debt may be held enforceable.
Where, for example, the directors of a company guaranteed their company's
loan which was void as being ultra vires, the directors were nevertheless held
liable. The reason "may be that the voidness of a contract to guarantee the
debt of a company acting ultra vires is different in its consequence from the
voidness brought about by the express and emphatic language of a statute".19
Guarantee of minor's debt
A similar problem arises when the debt of a minor has been guaranteed.
The debt being void, is the surety liable? The Court of King's Bench con-
sidered the question in Coutts & Co v Browne Lecky20 and held that no
liability should be incurred by the surety. The head note to the report says:
"A loan, by way of overdraft made by a bank to an infant being void
under Section 1, of the Infants' Relief Act, 1874, the guarantors of the
loan, where the fact of infancy is known to all parties, cannot be made
liable in an action on the guarantee."
OLIVER J said: "Apart from authority it would certainly seem strange
if a contract to make the debt default or miscarriage of another, could be
binding where, by statute, the loan guaranteed is, in terms, made absolutely
void. Looking at the matter broadly, how, in these circumstances, can the
omission by an infant to pay what is made void by statute be described as
either a debt, a default or a miscarriage? There is no debt here because the
Act of 1874 says so; there is no default, for the infant is entitled to omit to
pay, and there is no miscarriage for the same reason."22
In India it has been held, following earlier English authorities, that where
a minor's debt has been knowingly guaranteed, the surety should be held
liable as a principal debtor himself." In Kashiba Bin Narsapa Nikade v
Narshiv Shripat the Bombay High Court observed: "A surety to a bond
passed by a minor for moneys borrowed for purposes of litigation not found
to be necessary, is liable to be sued on it whether the contract of the minor
is considered to be void or voidable. We see no reason why a person can-
not contract to guarantee the performance by a third person of a duty of

imperfect obligation. If the debt is void, the contract of the so-called surety
is not collateral, but a principal contract."25
2. Consideration
Like every other contract, a contract of guarantee should also be sup-
ported by some consideration. A guarantee without consideration is void.26
But there need be no direct consideration between the surety and the credi-
tor.27 Section 127 clearly says:
S. 127. Consideration for guarantee.-Anything done, or any promise
made, for the benefit of the principal debtor, may be a sufficient consideration
to the surety for giving the guarantee.
Illustrations
(a) Brequests A to sell and deliver to him goods on credit. A agrees to do so, provided C will
guarantee the payment of the price of the goods. C promises to guarantee the payment
in consideration of A's promise to deliver the goods. This is a sufficient consideration for
C's promise.
(b) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards requests A to forbear to sue B for the debt
for a year, and promises that, if he does so, C will pay for them in default of payment by
B. A agrees to forbear as requested. This is a sufficient consideration for C's promise.28
(c) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards, without consideration, agrees to pay for
them in default of B. The agreement is void.
Thus where a loan is given or goods sold on credit on the basis of a guar-
antee that is sufficient consideration. Similarly, where a credit has already
been given and the payment having become due, the creditor refrains from
25. In England also it has been held that in such cases the guarantor should be held liable as an
indemnifier, Yeoman Credit Ltd v Latter, (1961). 1 WLR: 828: (1961) 2 All ER 294 (CA).

27. BEST CJ observed in Marely v Boothby, (1825) 3 Bing 107 that "no court of common law has
ever said that there should be a consideration directly between the persons giving and receiv-
ing the guarantee. It is enough if the person for whom the guarantor becomes surety receives a
benefit, or the person to whom the guarantee is given suffers inconvenience, as an inducement
to the surety to become guarantor for the principal debtor".
28. The Patna High Court similarly held that a guarantee on the implied request of the princi-
pal debtor is binding. A guarantee given after the execution of the loan document is valid.

was also enhanced from time to time, guarantee taken after the facility was finally enhanced

past debts. Hence there was nothing done on the basis of the guarantee either in the present or
in the past. The guarantee was without consideration.

[S. 127]
suing the principal debtor, that would be a sufficient consideration for giving
a guarantee.
Where the consideration failed, the court said that there was no question
of recovering anything from the principal debtor or of enforcing his bank
guarantee. In this case, the contract was for cutting and removing timber
from a forest. Payment for the same was guaranteed by a bank guaran-
tee. The forest authorities did not permit the cutting. Consideration failed.
Neither the bank guarantee could be invoked nor the contractor's earnest
money could be forfeited."
Guarantee for past debt
But a guarantee for a past debt should be invalid. The section says.
that "anything done... for the benefit of the principal debtor" is good
consideration. 32
But will the words "anything done" include things done before the guar-
antee was given? The Oudh High Court in M. Gulam Husain Khan v M.
Faiyaz Ali Khan³ answered this question in the affirmative.
A lessee agreed to pay the sum due under a lease by certain instalments
and after a few days a person executed a surety bond binding himself to
pay a certain amount in default of the payment of instalments.
The court held that the bond was not without consideration. The deci-
sion has been criticised in Pollock and Mulla. The learned editors observe:
"This seems to attribute an unnatural meaning to the word, which, it is
submitted and as the rest of the section shows, refers to an executed as dis
tinguished from an executory consideration."35
The decision also seems to be contrary to the third illustration to the
section.36

Essential features of guarantee 605
In a case before the Bombay High Court, a guarantee was executed
subsequent to release of financial assistance to the borrower. The court held
that it could not be said that there was no consideration for the guarantee. In
the view of the court, "past consideration is valid consideration".
Past as well as future debt
A guarantee for a past as well as a future debt is enforceable provided
some further debt is incurred after the guarantee. But there should be a clear
undertaking to be liable for a past debt and as soon as some fresh obliga-
tion is incurred, the liability for all the obligations is coupled up.39
Benefit of principal debtor, enough consideration
If the principal debtor gets a benefit, that suffices to sustain the guaran-
tee. It will be of no consequence to say that the principal debtor had never
requested for a guarantee or that it was given without his knowledge or
consent. A contention of this kind was refuted by the Patna High Court in
a case 40 where the directors of a company who guaranteed the company's
loans argued that the company had never asked for the guarantee. The court
relied upon the following statement of Lord LOREBURN:" "There are three
possible variations in the parties to contract of suretyship. The first and the
simplest case is that in which all the three parties concerned are parties to
the contract in the sense that both the principal debtor and creditor agree
that the surety's liability is a secondary liability only, and that the principal
debtor is primarily liable for the obligations guaranteed. But it is also pos-
sible that the contract of suretyship may be recognised only as between the
principal debtor and the surety, or as between the creditor and the surety,
as extending the meaning of a section, they should also not be read as restricting its operation,
especially so, when the effect would be to curtail a right which the plain words of the section
would confer. It is, therefore, clear that when the language of the text of S. 127 of the Contract
Act is clear and unambiguous, the sweep of the text cannot be curtailed by using Illustration
(c) to impose a limitation on the expression "any thing done or any promise made for the
benefit of the principal debtor" that it should be done at the time of giving the guarantee. The
language is wide enough to include any thing that was done or a promise made before giving
the guarantee and would not restrict the application of the section only to what was contem-
poraneously done. See further Allahabad Bank v S.M. Engg Industries, (1992) 1 Cal LJ 448
where the bank was not allowed to sue the surety without further or any advance made after
the date of the guarantee.
37. SICOM Ltd v Padmashri Mahipatrai Shah, (2005) 3 Mah LJ 125. The court further held that
where a guarantee was given in consideration of an amount lent and advanced, it was not
required in law that there should be an independent consideration for each of the clauses.
38. Morrell v Cowan, (1877) 7 Ch D 151.
39. See, e.g., Carlesbery Brewery Malaysia v Soon Heng A.W. & Sons, (1989) 1 MLJ 104

within the contemplation of the parties that the guarantors were to be saddled with liabilities
not only after but also before the signing of the guarantee. Following, Esso Standard Malaya

in which event the rights and duties arising out of the contract of suretyship
only affect those parties."
Counter-guarantee
A counter guarantee is for protection of the original guarantor. When the
original guarantor is called upon to pay and he has fulfilled his obligation
under his guarantees, he can call upon the counter guarantor to pay him."
The documents filed by the plaintiff showed that the defendant had given a
counter-guarantee in favour of the plaintiff to cover the contingency of the
plaintiff having to pay any amount as a result of the invocation of the bank
guarantee. The defendant failed to pay. The plaintiff was held to be entitled
to a decree against the defendant.43
3. Misrepresentation and concealment
45
A contract of guarantee is not a contract uberrimae fides or one of abso-
lute good faith." Thus where a banker received a guarantee with knowledge
of circumstances seriously affecting the credit of the customer, it was held
that there was no duty to disclose this fact to the surety. Yet "it is the
duty of a party taking a guarantee to put the surety in possession of all
the facts likely to affect the degree of his responsibility; and if he neglects
to do so, it is at his peril. A surety ought to be acquainted with the whole
contract entered into with his principal." Where a person purchased land
without disclosing that he was doing so on behalf of a society for which the
surety would not have given the guarantee because the society was already
embroiled in litigation, the court held that it could be said that the consent
of the surety was taken by suppressing the vital fact from him and therefore
he was not bound by the guarantee." Sections 142 and 143 implement these
principles. Sections 142 and 143 provides:

Essential features of guarantee 607
(a) A engages B as clerk to collect money for him. B fails to account for some of his receipts,
and A in consequence calls upon him to furnish security for his duly accounting. C gives
his guarantee for B's duly accounting. A does not acquaint C with B's previous conduct.
B afterwards makes default. The guarantee is invalid.
(b) A guarantees to C payment for iron to be supplied by him to B to the amount of 2000
tons. B and C have privately agreed that B should pay five rupees per ton beyond the
market price, such excess to be applied in liquidation of an old debt. This agreement is
concealed from A. A is not liable as a surety.
Guarantees for the good conduct of a servant have invited more frequent
applications of this principle. A very illustrative case is London General
Omnibus Co v Holloway."
The defendant was invited to give a guarantee for the fidelity of
a servant. The employer had earlier dismissed him for dishonesty, but
did not disclose this fact to the surety. The servant committed another
embezzlement.
The surety was held not liable. "The surety believed that he was making
himself answerable for a presumably honest man, not for a known thief."
Every surety undertakes the risk of default, which is more in some cases
and less in others depending upon circumstances. If the creditor is aware
of circumstances affecting the risk, he should make the surety equally
aware. Similarly, in a case before the Lahore High Court, fresh guaran-
tees were obtained for the fidelity of a manager of a bank without disclos-
ing his previous defalcations, the sureties were held not liable for further
defalcation.48
Lord CHELMSFORD observed. with regard to a guarantee other than a
guarantee of fidelity that a creditor is under no obligation to inform an
intended surety of matters affecting the credit of the debtor, or of any cir-
cumstances connected with the transaction in which he is about to engage
which will render the position hazardous." To the same effect is an obser-
vation in a Scottish case. There is nothing in "authorities for holding that
the fact that suspicious circumstances arise to the knowledge of a creditor,
and are not communicated at once to the cautioner is a ground for holding
a cautioner freed from his obligation".50 Referring to the position of a bank,
it was observed in the same case: "There is no authority for the view that
it is the duty of a bank, whenever it becomes aware of any circumstances
seriously affecting the credit of a customer, to communicate at once with

any of that customer's friends who may have cash credits on his behalf or
guarantees for his pecuniary obligation."
4. Writing not necessary
Section 126 expressly declares that a guarantee may be either oral or
written. But in England under the provisions of the Statute of Frauds a
guarantee is not enforceable unless it is "in writing and signed by the party
to be charged". 53
EXTENT OF SURETY'S LIABILITY
The fundamental principle about the surety's liability, as laid down in
Section 128, is that the liability of the surety is co-extensive with that of the
principal debtor. The surety may, however, by an agreement place a limit
upon his liability. The section is as follows:
S. 128. Surety's liability.-The liability of the surety is co-extensive with
that of the principal debtor, unless it is otherwise provided by the contract.
51. The creditor (a bank in this case) is under a duty to disclose to the surety contractual arrange-
ments between the principal debtor and the creditor which made the terms of the princi-
pal contract something materially different in a particularly disadvantgeous respect to those
which the surety might actually expect, Levett v Barclays Bank plc, (1995) 1 WLR 1260. In
a suit on a deed of guarantee, the plea that the blanks in the deed were filled in subsequently
was not sustainable because all entries were initialled.
52. Since an oral guarantee is also valid, a person who otherwise appeared to be a guarantor
was held liable though his signature did not appear on guarantee papers. P.J. Rajappan v
Associate Industries (P) Ltd, (1990) 1 KLJ 77. A written guarantee may be spelled out from
more than one documents. S. Chattanatha Karayalar v Central Bank of India Ltd, AIR 1965
SC 1856: (1965) 3 SCR 318. A written guarantee would have to satisfy the requirements of
the Stamp Act. Karnataka State Industrial Investment & Development Corpn Ltd v State
Bank of India, (2005) 1 CLT 437: (2004) 3 CCC 568 (Kant), a guarantee in writing remains
enforceable even if stamp duty is not paid, because stamp duty can be paid at any subse-
quent stage. Shri Bishwakarma Furniture Workshop v Santanu Sarkar, (2006) 5 AIR Kant
(NOC) 762 (Jha): AIR 2006 Jhar 89: 2006 AIHC 2511, defendant guaranteed repayment of
loan, failure of borrower to pay back amount deducted from the guarantor's fixed deposit.
Guarantor sued the borrower and the latter was held liable to reimburse the guarantor. But
registration is not compulsory. See Karnataka State Industrial Investment and Devp Corpn
Ltd v SBI, (2004) 4 Kant LJ 266 (DB), where the court also held that though the transaction
is a tripartite arrangement, all the parties have not to execute it simultaneously.
53. S. 4. Actionstrength Ltd v International Glass Engg IN.GL.EN SpA, (2002) 1 WLR 566 (2)
(CA), a person may incur liability under an oral guarantee if he is estopped by reason of his
representations or conduct from contending that the guarantee was oral. However, no such
estoppel could be shown in this case. There was no representation by the employer company
to the sub-contractor that it would honour the agreement despite the absence of writing or
that it would confirm the oral agreement by writing. Another off shoot of the same litigation
was in Actionstrength Ltd v International Glass Engg IN.GL.EN SPA, (2002) 1 WLR 566
(2): (2002) 4 All ER 468 (CA), a promise is not capable of becoming a guarantee if the prom-
iser undertakes liability in respect of assets or sources within his control, vide S. 4, Statute of
Frauds, 1877. C.S. Co v Punjab & Sind Bank, (2003) 3 KLT 808, no suit can safely be decreed
on the photostat copy of the bank guarantee, terms and conditions can be given effect to only
when the guarantors are produced.

Extent of surety's liability 609
Illustration
A guarantees to B the payment of a bill of exchange by C, the acceptor. The bill is dishon-
oured by C. A is liable not only for the amount of the bill but also for any interest and charges
which may have become due on it.
1. Co-extensive
The first principle governing surety's liability is that it is co-extensive with
that of the principal debtor. The expression "co-extensive with that of the
principal debtor" shows the maximum extent of the surety's liability. He is
liable for the whole of the amount for which the principal debtor is liable
and he is liable for no more. The only illustration appended to the section
says that if the payment of a loan bond is guaranteed, the surety is liable not
only for the amount of the loan, but also for any interest and charges which
may have become due on it. Where the principal debtor acknowledges lia-
bility and this has the effect of extending the period of limitation against
him the surety also becomes affected by it.%
Where the overdrafts of a company were guaranteed by the company's
directors and the banker had recovered a part of the loan by disposing of
54. Thus a guarantor of rent was held not liable for interest on rent because the principal debtor
himself was not so liable. Maharaja of Benares v Har Narain Singh, ILR (1906-07) 28 All
25. Under the agreement in this case, and even otherwise, the surety is liable not only for the
principal amount but for interest on the principal amount and charges incurred in enforcing
the liability. The court held that the trial court erred in decreeing the suit against the surety for
only the principal amount excluding interest and costs. Indian Over Seas Bank v G. Ramulu,
(1999) 2 ALD 104.
55. For a parallel case see Nandlal Chogalal v Surajmal Gangaram, AIR 1932 Nag 62. The
expression "co-extensive" also shows the nature of liability. Thus where in a suit against the
principal debtor and surety, the principal debtor was ordered to pay in instalments and the
suit against the surety was dismissed, this dismissal was held to be not proper. SBI v Sajita
Engg Works, AIR 1992 Ori 237. The court followed the decision of the Supreme Court in
Bank of Bihar Ltd v Damodar Prasad, AIR 1969 SC 297: (1969) 1 SCR 620 and Nanda
Dulal Sen v Rao & Sons, (1972) 38 Cutt LT 959 where it was held that the decree against
the surety would not be executed till the principal debtor paid off the dues by instalments
allowed by the court and thus the liability of the guarantor was not wiped out. In all pro-
ceedings against the principal debtor, his sureties are a proper party. Industrial Finance
Corpn of India v P.V.K. Papers Ltd, AIR 1992 All 239. This is so because the liability is joint
and several. Suresh Narain Sinha v Akhauri Balbhadra Prasad, AIR 1957 Pat 256; Madho

[S. 144]
certain goods belonging to the company, the Madras High Court held that
the liability of the surety had gone down accordingly.57
Under the guarantee clause, the guarantor agreed to be bound by any
judgment or award obtained by the lender bank against the principal debtor.
It was accordingly held that a settlement or compromise between the bank
and the principal debtor was binding upon the guarantor. The mere absence
of knowledge on the part of the guarantor of the joint settlement memo was
of no consequence. 58
One of the requirements of an auction notice under the SARFAESI
Act, 2002, is that the details of the borrower must be given. The auction
notice in this case stated the details only of the guarantor. This was held
as not affecting validity of the notice because a guarantor is also a buyer
because he is equally (co-extensive) liable with the borrower."
The liability of the guarantor cannot go beyond the terms of the guar-
antee. A bank was not allowed to recover from the guarantor liability due
under pre-existing debts when there was no mention of such liability in the
guarantee which had been framed by the bank itself. The Supreme Court
however pointed out that this does not mean that no liability can be fastened
upon a guarantor for pre-existing debts.60
A guarantee was given to a bank for the borrower's loan. The guarantor
gave a notice to the bank withdrawing his guarantee. The guarantee carried
a provision to the effect that it would cease to exist after the expiry of three
months from the date of notice. The court said that the guarantor could not
be held liable after such expiry of time."1
Condition precedent
Where there is a condition precedent to the surety's liability, he will not
be liable unless that condition is first fulfilled. A partial recognition of this
principle is to be found in Section 144 which says:2
Where a person gives a guarantee upon a contract that creditor shall not act
upon it until another person has joined in it as co-surety, the guarantee is not
valid if that other person does not join.

before filing a case on him. A decree can be executed against the surety without first proceed-
ing against the principal debtor.

Extent of surety's liability 611
An illustration in point is National Provincial Bank of England v
Brackenbury.63
The defendant signed a guarantee which on the face of it was intended
to be a joint and several guarantee of three other persons with him. One
of them did not sign. There being no agreement between the bank and
the co-guarantors to dispense with his signature, the defendant was held
not liable.
The same result followed where the signature of the co-guarantor was
forged so as to make it appear that he had joined." The facts were:
The plaintiff supplied timber to a company of which the defendant
was a director. The company being unable to pay, the plaintiff agreed to
suspend the claim for a year provided that the debt was jointly and sever-
ally guaranteed by the company's three directors. A guarantee apparently
signed by the defendant and other directors was duly provided. The com-
pany went into liquidation. The plaintiff sought to enforce the guarantee.
Before the trial of the action it was discovered that the signature of one of
the directors had been forged.
The court said: "A joint guarantor under a guarantee which showed on its
fact that the other joint guarantors were intended to be parties is not liable
at law if the signature of one of the other guarantors is forged, since there is
no contract of guarantee unless all the anticipated parties to the contract in
fact became bound."
Proceeding against surety without exhausting remedies against debtor
Where the liability is otherwise unconditional, the court cannot of its
own introduce a condition into it. This was pointed out by the Supreme
Court in Bank of Bihar Ltd v Damodar Prasad.<

[S. 144]
The defendant guaranteed a bank's loan. A default having taken place,
the defendant was sued. The trial court decreed that the bank shall enforce
the guarantee in question only after having exhausted its remedies against
the principal debtor. The Patna High Court confirmed the decree. But the
Supreme Court overruled it.
Explaining that a condition of this kind would defeat the parties' inten-
tion, the court said: "The very object of the guarantee is defeated if the
creditor is asked to postpone his remedies against the surety. Is the creditor
to ask for imprisonment of the principal? Is he bound to discover at his peril
all the properties of the principal and sell them; if he cannot, does he lose his
remedy against the surety? Has he to file an insolvency petition against the
principal? The trial court gave no reason for this extraordinary direction. It
said that the principal was solvent. But the solvency of the principal is not a
sufficient ground for restraining execution of the decree against the surety.
It is the duty of the surety to pay the decretal amount. On such payment he
will be subrogated to the rights of the creditors."66
And as so subrogated may exhaust his remedies against the creditor.
"Before payment the surety has no right to dictate terms to the creditor and
ask him to pursue his remedies against the principal in the first instance. The
surety is a guarantor; and it is his business to see that the principal pays, and
not that of the creditor."
The Allahabad High Court has also taken the similar view although
without reference to the Supreme Court ruling. The loans of a company
were guaranteed. The guarantee stipulated that the liability of the surety
would arise on demand. There was no condition that the financial corpora-
tion should first proceed to recover the amount from the hypothecated prop-
erty. The corporation could straightaway proceed against the surety without
first proceeding against the company. The order directing the corporation to
first proceed against the company was held to be not proper.

Extent of surety's liability 613
In a subsequent case, the Supreme Court held that the creditor must pro-
ceed against the mortgaged property first and then only against the surety
for the balance, even if the decree is a composite one against the principal
debtor, mortgaged property and the guarantor. In that case only a portion
of the decree was covered by the mortgage and the court did not consider
it relevant whether the two portions of the decree were severable or not.
This decision has been overruled by the Supreme Court in SBI v Indexport
Registered.69 In this case a composite decree was passed against the surety,
the borrower and the mortgaged property of the borrower. The High Court
of Delhi directed that the decree-holder should first proceed against the
mortgaged property and levy execution against the surety only for the bal-
ance. YOGESHWAR DAYAL J said: "In the present case the decree does not

a composite decree, the court or the co-surety cannot insist that the creditor should proceed
against other sureties before proceeding against him. It is the creditor's option to decide for
himself against whom he should proceed first. The surety so selected for recovery would have
the right to recover contribution from the co-sureties and indemnity from the principal debtor.
The absence of decree against the principal borrower is no ground for setting aside the decree
against the surety, Balakrishnan v H. Chunnilal Bagmar, AIR 1998 Mad 175; SBI v M.P. Iron
and Steel Works (P) Ltd, AIR 1998 MP 93, action against directors guaranteeing the com-

account in the bank was allowed. Permata Merchant Bank v Glove Seal, (1994) 1 Curr LJ 389
(Malaysia), the bank was not bound to exhaust other remedies before embarking on the action

signatures were under duress, they alongwith other defendants were held jointly and severally

This position was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Central Bank of India v C.L.
Vimla, (2015) 7 SCC 337: (2015) 3 SCC (Civ) 601, where it was observed that it is a prerog-
ative of the creditor alone whether he would move against the principal debtor first or surety
for realising the loan amount. Rulings on the point, however, continue to be contradictory.

postpone the execution. The decree is simultaneous and it is jointly and
severally (passed) against all the defendants including the guarantor. It is the
right of the decree-holder to proceed with it in a way he likes."
The court conceded that the way in which a decree is drawn up is an
important fact to be considered. "If the composite decree is a decree which is
both a personal decree as well as a mortgage decree, without any limitation
on its execution, the decree-holder, in principle, cannot be forced to first
exhaust the remedy by way of execution of the mortgage decree alone and
told that only if the amount recovered is insufficient, he can be permitted to
take recourse to the execution of the personal decree.
Where, on the other hand, the sale proceeds of the hypothecated truck
were already realised and adjusted against the decreed amount, it was held
that the guarantor had no right to say that the decree-holder should have
first tried to recover the balance of the decreed amount by enforcing the
decree against the guarantor. The decree-holder may at his choice enforce
the decree either against the principal debtor or surety." A decision of the
Punjab and Haryana High Court has the effect of introducing a human
aspect. The court said that if the principal debtor is financially well off and
can discharge his liability under the decree, the creditor should in the first
instance require him to pay and only then he may be allowed to proceed
against the surety."
The Supreme Court" has also held that where the management of a com-
pany has been taken over under an Act", that does not discharge the guar-
antors of the company's loans. VENKATRAMIAH J said: "Under Section
128 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, save as provided in the contract,
the liability of the surety is coextensive with that of the principal debtor.
The surety thus became liable to pay the entire amount. Their liability was
immediate and it was not deferred until the creditor exhausted his remedies
against the principal debtor. The Act does not say that when a notification is
issued under Section 7(1)(b) the remedies against the guarantors also stood
suspended."
Action against principal debtor alone
The creditor can proceed against the principal debtor alone. His suit can-
not be rejected on the ground that he has not joined the guarantor as a
defendant to the suit." Dismissal of the suit against the principal debtor
without paying back, within a year his father who was a guarantor also died, his legal heirs
were hauled up, their lands sold, whereas the principal debtor had more land resources, he
remained untouched. The legal heirs had lost everything, might be with no means to recover
their indemnity. This is one of the consequence of creating multiplicity of proceedings.

does not of itself absolve the surety of his liability under the contract of
guarantee.
A surety was allowed to be impleaded where his liability had already been
reduced and his position would have been prejudiced if in the proceedings
against the principal debtor this fact was not brought to the notice of the
deciding authority.
Suit against surety alone
80
A suit against the surety without even impleading the principal debtor
has been held to be maintainable. In this case, the creditor, in his affidavit,
had shown sufficient reasons for not proceeding against the principal debt-
or.30 A contract of guarantee was made enforceable by its terms against the
guarantors severally and jointly with that of the principal debtor company.
It was held that the creditor had the option to sue the company along with
guarantors as co-defendants or guarantors alone."
This makes the position of sureties specially vulnerable. The court may
rescue the surety where he was prevailed upon and, therefore, his consent
was not free. A surety may be described as vulnerable where there is a rela-
tionship of trust and confidence between him and the debtor. In this case,
the wife stood surety for her husband's debts. She received no independent

advice. The court freed her from liability either because of undue influence
or mis-representation. Such vulnerability is not limited to spouses. It would
include co-habitants and others, e.g. elderly parents.
In such cases relationship of trust and confidence often exists and is prov-
able. It is necessary that the bank should have notice of the fact that the
surety was in a position of manifest disadvantage and this should put the
bank on enquiry as to whether to accept such a surety or not."
Proceeding against guarantor's mortgaged property
A financial corporation cannot take possession of the mortgaged prop-
erty of the guarantor without notice to him. The corporation also cannot
issue a public notice for auction sale of the property without notice to the
guarantor. The reason is that the liability of the guarantor is secondary and
arises only when the borrower fails in repayment. A guarantor is bound
by his own separate agreement to which the principal debtor is not a par-
ty. The petitioner was a surety for a loan advanced by the State Industrial
Corpn to the borrower. It was held that the corporation had no power to
take possession of the property of the surety under Section 29 of the State
Financial Corporations Act, 1951 and bring the property for sale without
aid of the court. The LIC policy which had been deposited by the p
tor in support of his guarantee was held to be available to the creditor for the
amount due under it. The property of the surety which has been offered
as a security can be proceeded against without exhausting remedies against
the principal debtor. In this particular case the whereabouts of the principal
debtor were not known even to the surety. He could not seek protection
under the guise that he was ignorant of the consequences of offering his
property as a security for the loan of the principal debtor. 87

the acknowledgement made by the borrower. There was nothing in it which
could be taken to be contrary to law or opposed to public policy.**
Prosecution of guarantor-surety for bouncing of his cheque
Where the guarantor had issued a cheque as a security for repayment
of loan, but the cheque bounced, the court said that he was liable to be
prosecuted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. It was no
defence that he had not issued the cheque for discharge of personal liability
or debt.
Death of principal debtor
A suit was filed against the principal debtor and surety. The suit against
the principal debtor was found to be void ab initio because of his death even
before institution of the suit. The surety was held to be not discharged. The
suit could proceed against him. It was in the interest of the surety to implead
under Order 1, Rule 10, CPC, the legal representatives of the deceased prin-
cipal debtor, because if the suit was decreed against him, the surety could
enforce against the legal representatives his rights under Section 145.89
Winding up of principal debtor company
The lending corporation had failed to recover the debt from the borrower
company. The liability of the company was held to be confined only to the
debt when winding up order was passed. Debt and interest freezed on such
order. The corporation was a party to the winding up proceedings. It did not
opt out of the same, nor sought permission of the court under Section 446 of
the Companies Act to start its own case. Hence, it could not claim anything
beyond the amount determined by the official liquidator."
2. Surety's right to limit his liability or make it conditional
It is open to the surety to place a limit upon his liability. He may expressly
declare his guarantee to be limited to a fixed amount, for example, that
"my liability under this guarantee shall not at any time exceed the sum of
£250"." In such a case, whatever may be owing from the principal debtor,

the principal debtor or the surety or any one of the sureties without impleading the principal
debtor, it cannot be said that the dismissal of the suit under Order 1, CPC against the principal
debtor would automatically discharge the surety.

[S. 144]
the liability of the surety cannot go beyond the sum so specified. Thus in
a case before the Andhra Pradesh High Court," a clause in a contract of
suretyship making the surety liable up to Rs 15,000 further declared that
he would be liable for any amount that might be finally decreed. It was held
that the clause should be construed as meaning not exceeding Rs 15,000.
A surety can attach any other condition to his liability. Thus where the
letter of guarantee made it a condition precedent to the guarantor's liability
that on default on the part of the borrower a demand for payment should
be made upon the guarantor, it was held that an independent demand was
necessary and the mere service on the guarantor of the carbon copies of the
demand meant for the borrower was not sufficient,93
Guarantor's insistence upon collateral security
Whether the obtaining of a collateral security by a lender is a term or con-
dition precedent to liability being imposed on a guarantor under his guar-
antee depends on a proper analysis of the contractual relationship between
the lender and the guarantor. Where a guarantor seeks to make his guaran-
tee dependent on a third party giving some other valid collateral security,
the guarantor has to establish that the giving of the security by the third
party formed part of the contract under which the guarantee was given and,
accordingly, in the absence of that being established, the guarantor was not
permitted to rely on any failure by the lender to provide himself with a valid
collateral security even though he might have indicated that he was going
to do so. In this case the guarantor, who was also the director and princi-
pal shareholder of the company, of his company's debts was not allowed to
escape saying that the collateral security in the shape of a company's deben-
ture obtained by the company was not a valid security, the court finding that
no proof was available to show that there was any such condition that there
should be a valid debenture." The court surveyed authorities on the point.
The authorities appear to be clear that in the final event whether the
obtaining of a collateral security by the lender is a term of or a condition
precedent to liability on a guarantor under his guarantee is to be determined

invalid. Ganga Lahari v Har Narain, 1986 Raj LR 538, where the court said that if the decree
was not fully satisfied by execution against the principal debtors (also judgment-debtors),
then execution petition should be filed against the surety. The court referred to Tan Kin Shan
v V. Che Si, AIR 1925 Rang 135 where on the basis of S. 145, CPC it was held that a notice

by a proper analysis of the contractual relationship between the lender and
the guarantor. The starting point is Traill v Gibbons." The direction to
the jury of ERLE CJ was in these terms: "Then as to the equitable plea, it
states an agreement with the defendant that Nixey should sign the deed as
co-surety with him; that the society should procure him to execute it, and
that if they should not do so the defendant should not be liable. Has such
an agreement been proved? The lender is usually the party who requires an
additional surety, and so it seems to have been here. Still it may be some-
times for the interest of a surety to say, 'unless you get co-sureties to join
with me, I will not become surety'. And that is the defence set up here. Has
it been proved? The evidence is very slight of any such agreement with the
defendant. The defendant himself does not say that he required that Nixey
should join, but merely that he knew that the society had required it. Did the
defendant require it for his own benefit or security, or was there any agree-
ment or understanding on his part, as a condition of his own execution,
that Nixey should join? Does it appear that the defendant, before he signed,
looked to Nixey at all? On the contrary, he says he did not know until some
time afterwards that Nixey had not signed." (ERLE CJ's emphasis.)
The same approach was taken in the opinion of the Privy Council expressed
by Sir ROBERT COLLIER in Ward v National Bank of New Zealand Ltd.%
"But where it is no part of the contract of the surety that other persons shall
join in it, in other words, where he contracts only severally, the creditor does
not break that contract by releasing another several surety, the surety can-
not, therefore, claim to be released on the ground of breach of contract. It
is true that he is entitled to contribution against other several sureties to the
same extent as if they had been joint, but the right of contribution among
such sureties depends not upon contract but on principles established by
Courts of Equity."
In Greer v Kettle," the agreement under which the guarantee was given
related to a debt "effectively secured by (inter alia) 275,000 fully paid shares
in the Insurance company" and this fact was specifically referred to in the
recital to the guarantee agreement. "The agreement of guarantee must be
referred to in greater detail. In it, Mercantile Marine is called 'the corpo-
ration', while the words 'the guarantors' mean Parent Trust". It contains.
one recital only, which runs thus: "Whereas the corporation have at the
request of the guarantors advanced to the Austin Friars Trust, Ltd the sum
of £2,50,000 on the security of a charge dated March 20, 1929, on the
shares particulars of which are set out in the schedule hereto."... "In these
circumstances, it would seem that the legal rights and liabilities of these
parties depend upon the true construction and effect of the agreement of
guarantee. Indeed, this view was not disputed by either side.... Once it is

realised that the debt which Parent Trust are undertaking to guarantee is a
debt described as a debt the repayment of which by the principal debtor is
secured by a charge on (amongst other shares) the 2,75,000 shares in Iron
Industries Ltd, the case (apart from the question of estoppel) becomes, in my.
opinion, a simple one. It is not a case, as BENNETT J seems to have treated
it, of seeking to imply a condition the implication of which is alleged to
be inconsistent with other provisions in the document. In other words, as
ROMER LJ said, it is not a case of Parent Trust being released from a contrac-
tual engagement. It is a case of an attempt to impose upon them a liability
which they have never undertaken. The only debt the repayment of which
by the principal debtor they undertook to guarantee was a debt secured by
a charge on the 2,75,000 shares in Iron Industries, and a debt so secured
never in fact existed."
These authorities were considered again in Byblos Bank S.A.L. v
Al-Khudhairy:"
Bank's failure to obtain other securities
"Counsel for the defendant submitted that where an underlying trans-
action envisages additional security for the principal indebtedness, a guar-
antor is released if the additional security is not taken, at least where it is
shown that it was the intention of the guarantor that such additional secu-
rity should be taken. In this case the additional security envisaged but not
taken was Al Bunnia's personal guarantee, the deposit by Ron Holdings and
(validly executed) charges on Rushingdale's property. In the course of the
hearing before this court we were referred to many authorities in support of
rival submissions on the formulation of the applicable legal principles, coun-
sel's initial submission for the defendant as set out above being plainly too
wide. It is too wide because it would include a case where a lender stipulated
for additional security for its own protection and nothing was said or done
to cause the lender acting reasonably to know or suspect that the intention
of the guarantor was that the giving of such security was a fundamental
prerequisite to the validity of his guarantee. [There is] no principle, at law
or in equity, why in such a case the giving of the additional security should
be treated as an essential prerequisite to the validity of the guarantee, and
none of the authorities to which we were referred establishes or supports the
existence of such a principle. [U]ltimately counsel for the defendant accepted
that to succeed on this appeal on this point he had to show that he had an
arguable case on the facts under one or other of the three heads: (a) that
on the true scope and ambit of the contract made between the bank and
Al-Khudhairy it was an implied term (counsel accepted that it was not an
express term) of the contract that Al-Khudhairy's liability on his guarantee
was conditional on one or more of the three items of additional security

being taken by the bank, (b) that it was the continuing common intention
of both the bank and Al-Khudhairy that Al-Khudhairy's liability should be
conditional in this way; or (c) estoppel. It is clearly impossible to spell out
of the documentary evidence that it was a precondition of Al-Khudhairy's
liability under his guarantee that the bank should obtain a guarantee from
Al Bunnia."
Where the guarantor was supposed to have deposited title deeds by way
of equitable mortgage, but no such proof was there because the bank did not
produce the original title deeds or even their copy, the guarantor was held
not liable.99
Impossibility of main contract
A loan for development and maintenance of bee culture was guaranteed.
The surety undertook to be liable jointly and severally to pay off instalments
in case of failure on the part of the debtor. The bees died in consequence of a
viral infection. There was a total failure of business. The debtor became dis-
abled from paying instalments. The surety could not escape liability under
the doctrine of impossibility of performance.100
The liability of the surety does not depend upon possibility of the surety
being able to realise the amount from the principal debtor.101 The law on
this point was settled by the decision of the Supreme Court in a case where
it was observed that the right of the creditor to recover from the guarantor
arises out of the terms of the deed of guarantee which are not in any way
superseded or brought to nullity merely because the creditor (or guarantor)
may not be able to recover anything from the principal debtor.102
The guarantors of a company's loans could not escape liability by reason
only of the fact that the company's management had totally changed.103
Novation of main contract
Where a father guaranteed his son's business debts and the business
was subsequently converted into a company and with the consent of the
bank the loan was to be treated as that of the company and the son and his
companions were accepted as guarantors, it was held that under the new
arrangement, the father had been dropped from the guarantee and hence he
was not liable. His property could not be attached for enforcement of the
guarantee.104

622 Chapter 12 Guarantee
Changes in surety company
[S. 129]
The defendant company and its promoters borrowed a sum of money
from the Industrial Development Corporation. Promoters could make any
changes in their company only with the approval of the corporation. But
without taking any such approval, they transferred their interest in the com-
pany to new company and changed the management of the company. The
promoters were not allowed to claim discharge from their personal liability
under the guarantee.¹ 105
Limitation. Where a statutory provision or contract clause requires that
first recovery should be effected from the assets of the principal debtor, the
Supreme Court held that recovery should be effected against the guaran-
tor only after it becomes ascertained as to how much could be recovered
from the principal debtor. The period of limitation for suing the guarantor
will start then and not from the date of issue of notice for recalling the
amount.106
Liability under continuing guarantee
S. 129. "Continuing guarantee".-A guarantee which extends to a series
of transactions, is called a "continuing guarantee".
Illustrations
(a) A, in consideration that B will employ C in collecting the rent of B's zamindari, promises
B to be responsible, to the amount of 5000 rupees, for the due collection and payment
by C of those rents. This is a continuing guarantee.
(b) A guarantees payment to B, a tea-dealer, to the amount of £ 100, for any tea he may from
time to time supply to C. B supplies C with tea to the above value of £100, and C pays B
for it. Afterwards B supplies C with tea to the value of £200. C fails to pay. The guarantee
given by A was a continuing guarantee, and he is accordingly liable to B to the extent of
£100.
(c) A guarantees payment to B of the price of five sacks of flour to be delivered by B to C
and to be paid for in a month. B delivers five sacks to C. C pays for them. Afterwards B
delivers four sacks to C, which C does not pay for. The guarantee given by A was not a
continuing guarantee, and accordingly he is not liable for the four sacks.
A guarantee of this kind is intended to cover a number of transactions
over a period of time. The surety undertakes to be answerable to the cred-
itor for his dealings with the debtor for a certain time. A guarantee for a
single specific transaction comes to an end as soon as the liability under that
transaction ends. Take, for instance, the old case of Kay v Groves, on
which the third illustration given in the section is based. The guarantee was
in these terms:
105. HPSIDC v Manson India (P) Ltd, AIR 2009 NOC 490 (HP).
106. Deepak Bhandari v H.P. State Industrial Development Corpn Ltd, (2015) 5 SCC 518:
(2015) 3 SCC (Civ) 123. It seems that all guarantors should be wise enough to put in such a
clause.

Extent of surety's liability 623
"I hereby agree to be answerable to K for the amount of five sacks of
flour to be delivered to T, payable in one month." Five sacks were actually
supplied and T paid for them. Further supplies were made during the
same month, for which T failed to pay.
The surety was then sued. The court held that it was not a continuing
guarantee and, therefore, there was no liability for parcels delivered for var-
ious subsequent periods.
Following is an illustration of a continuing guarantee:108
I do hereby guarantee the payment of goods to be delivered in umbrel-
las and parasols to J in the sum of £200.
Another instance of a continuing guarantee is:
Messrs Sea & Co, Sirs, the bearer, Mr Thomas Horan, wishes to deal
with you for produce, and he asked me to speak for him. I can highly
recommend him, and in fact, I will stand good for him to the amount of
£50,109
The essence of a continuing guarantee is that it applies not to a specific
number of transactions, but to any number of them and makes the surety
liable for the unpaid balance at the end of the guarantee. In Chorley &
Tucker the distinction is thus explained: "A specific guarantee provides for
securing of a specific advance or for advances up to a fixed sum, and ceases
to be effective on the repayment thereof, while a continuing guarantee cov-
ers a fluctuating account such as an ordinary current account at a bank, and
secures the balance owing at any time within the limits of the guarantee...."
A guarantee for a cash-credit account has been held to be a continuing
guarantee. The sureties could not claim to be discharged from their lia-
bility by reason of the fact that the goods in the hypothecated store were
changed.112

Supreme Court decision in Margaret Lalita Samuel v Indo Commercial Bank Ltd, (1979)
2 SCC 396: AIR 1979 SC 102, the court held that the period of limitation commences from
the time when the payment is demanded and refused or otherwise denied by the surety. In
Bradford Old Bank Ltd v Sutecliffe, (1918) 2 KB 833 (CA) it was pointed out that the con-
tract of the surety is collateral and, therefore, a demand on him is necessary to complete the
cause of action and set the statute running. The decision of the Supreme Court in R. Lilavati
v Bank of Baroda, AIR 1987 Kant 2: ILR 1987 Kant 964 at p. 969 is authority for the prop-
osition that in the case of a continuing guarantee, the question of limitation does not crop
up at all. Punjab National Bank v Surinder Singh Mandyal, AIR 1996 HP 1, guarantee for
loan for purchase of bus, debtor became irregular with his repayments, guarantor proposed
to pay back if the bank would transfer the bus to him, no response from bank, guarantor not
discharged by that reason alone.

624 Chapter 12 Guarantee.
[S. 129]
113
A guarantee for the conduct of a servant appointed to collect rents has
been held by the Calcutta High Court to be a continuing guarantee. But a
guarantee for the conduct of a tenant in paying rent due under the tenancy,
whether it be a repeated payment or a single lump sum, has been held to be
a guarantee for one transaction and not of continuing nature. It is not per-
missible to construe a bank guarantee in the light of contemporaneous doc-
uments. A bank guarantee has to be construed on its own terms. It delinks
itself with other documents of the transaction and operates independently
of them. As compared with it, a contract has to be construed, when it is
contained in more than one documents, by considering all the documents
together. The employment of a person is one transaction and the guaran-
tee for his good conduct is not a continuing guarantee.116
Liability under bank guarantee
A bank guarantee is a sort of an absolute undertaking to pay the amount
whenever demanded by the guarantee-holder. It has nothing to do with the
state of relations between the guarantee-holder and the person on whose
behalf the guarantee was given. While ordinary guarantees are linked
to and dependent on the underlying transaction, a bank guarantee is an
arrangement where the guarantee is independent of the underlying transac-
tion. There are professional guarantors for whom the issue of guarantees or
bonds is a financial service, namely, banks, insurance companies or bond
companies who issue guarantees at a certain fee.117
113. Durga Priya Chowdhury v Durga Pada Roy, AIR 1928 Cal 204: ILR (1928) 55 Cal 154.
Liability under a continuing guarantee can be enforced only after ascertaining the final
amount due. See Punjab National Bank v Sri Vikram Cotton Mills, (1970) 1 SCC 60: AIR
1970 SC 1973 and United Commercial Bank Ltd v Okara Grain Buyers Syndicate Ltd, AIR

Extent of surety's liability 625
A guarantee for the appointment of an agent has been held to be not a
continuing guarantee. The use of the word "continued" in the guarantee
bond did not make it a continuing guarantee. It only meant that the bond
was to remain in force during the subsistence of the agency.118 In a case on
the subject before the Supreme Court:119
A bank undertook to pay to the SEB a sum not exceeding Rs 50,000
within 48 hours of demand. The guarantee was submitted on behalf of
a supplier who had deposited with the bank sufficient securities. There
was no condition to the bank's liability except demand by the Board. The
Board demanded payment. The supplier was a company which went into
liquidation. The liquidator sought to prevent the Board from realising the
guarantee and the bank from paying it.
No such relief was allowed. The Board had the right to enforce payment
of the guarantee and the bank had the right to reimburse itself out of the
securities. If the liquidator thought that the Board's conduct in realising the
guarantee was not proper, he should proceed against the Board.120 Stating
the reasons for the same the Delhi High Court said that if scrutiny is com-
menced in respect of the underlying contract, obviously the autonomy and
independence of an absolute guarantee would be lost. Its enforcement would
only after liability was determined by the Debt Recovery Tribunal, encashment not stayed.

depend upon the result of an inquiry. This would defeat the very purpose of
a bank guarantee.121
In Hindustan Steelworks Construction Ltd v Tarapore & Co the
Supreme Court laid down the law in terms of the following propositions:
"(A) A bank guarantee is an independent and distinct contract between
the bank and the beneficiary and is not qualified by the underlying trans-
action and the primary contract between the person at whose instance the
bank guarantee is given and the beneficiary.
(B) In the case of an unconditional bank guarantee the nature of the
obligation of the bank is absolute and not dependent upon any dispute or
proceeding between the party at whose instance the bank guarantee is
given and the beneficiary.
(C) .........
(D) The commitment by banks must be honoured free from interfer-
ence by the court and it is only in exceptional cases, that is to say, in case
of fraud, or in a case where irretrievable injustice would be done if bank
guarantee is allowed to be encashed, that the court would interfere."
Some litigation in connection with bank or demand guarantees is gen-
erated by the fact that there can be abusive or unfair callings, which is to
a large extent due to the independent nature of both documentary credits
and unconditional on demand guarantees. The beneficiary's right to pay-
ment is absolute or almost absolute. Apart from the court stay order, one
method which has been suggested and which has been put to actual use
is the requirement that the beneficiary has to state in his letter invoking
bank guarantee that there has been some kind of breach of the underlying
transaction and what is the type of breach which is involved.123 The person

between the parties.

Co, (2007) 8 SCC 110: AIR 2007 SC 2798, an injunction can be granted only in cases of
egregious fraud and irretrievable loss, a dispute between the parties is not a sufficient ground
in itself. Org Informatic Ltd v Tulip Telecom Ltd, AIR 2011 NOC 258 (Del), bank guaran-
tee not stayed because there was neither any fraud in claiming encashment nor any chance of
the money going beyond recovery.
123. See Lars Gordon, Draft UNCITRAL. Convention on Independent Guarantees, (1997) JBL
240 at 244. Writ cannot be issued in the matter of enforcement of bank guarantee unless
some public law element is involved, A.C. Roy & Co v Union of India, AIR 1995 Cal 246.
See, for example, National Telecom of India Ltd v Union of India, AIR 2001 Del 236, the
Government was required to show at least one of two conditions for invoking guarantee, i.e.,
either that the amount had become due because of loss caused by breach or that the amount
was being forfeited by reason of the contractor's failure to perform his commitment. The
letter invoking the guarantee stated that purchase orders had not been complied with despite
extension of time. Another letter alleged breach. The court said that all this showed that the
circumstances for invoking the guarantee were made out. The court further said that even

Extent of surety's liability 627
claiming under the guarantee must establish that conditions for invoking the
guarantee do exist. In this case the Government made a counter-offer to the
highest bidder and entered into negotiations which did not materialise into a
contract. Hence, the guarantee could not be invoked. 124 A contract was held
to have been formed where the parties, though not accepting all the printed
terms, agreed to some of them. A contract thus came into existence outside
the form. Stay of encashment of bank guarantee could not be ordered on the
ground that no contract was formed.125 Where the bank guarantee is condi-
tional, the beneficiary cannot have unfettered right to invoke the guarantee
and the court can issue an injunction against invocation on the facts of the
case. Where there was no reference in the invocation letter to any breach
of contract having been committed nor to any loss or damage though the
terms of the guarantee required such conditions to be fulfilled the plaintiff
was allowed the relief of injunction.127
The Supreme Court again emphasised in

that the operation of a bank

because the bank could not sit in judgment.

guarantee should be stayed only in cases of serious dispute, fraud or special
equities.
Two bank guarantees were furnished by a contractor for the proper
construction and successful commissioning of a vanaspati plant. The
bank was not to revoke the guarantees up to a fixed date and was to make
unconditional payment on demand. The Board was to be the sole judge
of the fact whether the contractor had fulfilled the terms of the contract.
Disputes arose between the contractor and the Board as to the erection
and performance of the plant.
The contractor sought an injunction to restrain the Board from enforcing
the guarantee. The court found no serious ground for doing so. The court felt
that respectability and reliability of the assured mode of payment through
confirmed letters of credit in international trade and bank guarantees in
national trade is necessary for the growth and promotion of trade. SHETTY
J129 cited Lord DIPLOCK:130 "The whole commercial purpose for which the
system of confirmed irrevocable documentary credits has been developed in
international trade is to give to the seller an assured right to be paid before
he parts with control of the goods and that does not permit of any dispute
with the buyer as to the performance of the contract of sale being used as a
ground for non-payment or reduction or deferment of payment."
His Lordship cited American authorities 131 to the effect that the fraud-
ulent use of guarantee papers by the seller is the only case in which court
should stay misuse of a credit system. "The exception for fraud on the part
of the beneficiary seeking to avail himself of the credit is a clear application
of the maxim ex turpi causa non oritur actio, or, if plain English is to be
preferred, 'fraud unravels all","132
728, guarantees given for advance payments, whole amount of advances was recovered from
running bills, even so guarantees were invoked. The court did not stay invocation. There
was pending arbitration in which also the stay was sought. There was no danger of money
being lost forever. Even otherwise the other party had the right of encashment for all kinds of
breach. A.P. Electronics Development Corpn Ltd v M.K. Mohan, (2010) 1 LW 518 (Mad), a
bank guarantee was not allowed to be invoked for non-performance of a contract which was
found to be illegal. Petroleum India International v Bank of Baroda, (2008) 6 Mah LJ 487,

Fraud must be of egregious nature so as to vitiate the entire underly-
ing transaction. The allegation of fraud must be specifically and explicitly
pleaded. In this case there was no explanation as to how and in what man-
ner the alleged fraud was committed. Encashment of bank guarantee was
not stayed.133
The court alleviated the feelings of contractors and buyers who provide
guarantees which go beyond their reach by saying that no irretrievable injus-
tice is likely to be done because the party withdrawing the amount would
remain accountable and, if he cannot justify himself, he would have to offer
restitution or compensation.134
"The wholly exceptional case where an injunction may be granted is
where it is proved that the bank knows that any demand for payment
already made or which may hereafter be made will clearly be fraudulent.
But the evidence must be clear both as to the fact of fraud and as to the
bank's knowledge. It would certainly not normally be sufficient that this
rests on the uncorroborated statement of the customer. A bank acting on
such a statement may cause irreparable damage to its credit."135
In reference to the meaning of irretrievable injury, the Supreme Court
said that it must be of the kind which was the subject-matter of the deci-
sion in Itek Corpn v First National Bank of Boston:136 "To avail of the
exception, therefore, exceptional circumstances which make it impossible
for the guarantor to reimburse himself if he ultimately succeeds will have
to be decisively established. Clearly, a mere apprehension that the other
party will not be able to pay is not enough."

[S. 129]
In General Electric Technical Services Co Inc v Punj Sons (P) Ltd, 138
while dealing with a case of bank guarantee given for securing mobilisation
advance, it was held that the right of a contractor to recover certain amounts
under running bills would have no relevance to the liability of the bank
under the guarantee given by it.139
A bank guarantee was unequivocal and unconditional. The bank agreed
to pay without any demur and on demand the court did not accept the
agreement that the beneficiary must show that he had suffered loss by reason
of non-fulfilment of the contract. If such contentions were to be accepted the
very purpose of such guarantees would be defeated. The court would have
to record a finding and give a verdict in each case. 140
The High Court of Delhi followed this decision so as to hold that the
enforcement of the bank guarantee would not be stayed but that the author-
ity would be told that they should enforce the guarantee only for the balance
amount minus the amount already recovered from the contractor's running
account payments.141
In Escorts Ltd v Modern Insulators Ltd the High Court of Delhi refused
to stay the payment because the alleged ground only showed an inconsist-
ency in the two letters about the installation and working of machines and
not a fraud or the possibility of an irretrievable injustice. The Supreme Court
dealt with this matter at great length in U.P. Coop Federation Ltd v Singh
301, supply of goods for which guarantee was given was completed, the plaintiffs as suppliers
discharged their obligations. There was no complaint also. Requests were made for cancella-
tion of guarantees but instead invocation was made. This was stayed ad interim, attempt to
get it vacated failed.
138. (1991) 4 SCC 230.
139. Another ruling to the same effect is Coronation Construction (P) Ltd v Indian Oil Corpn
Ltd, AIR 1999 Del 268, no pleading that there was fraud in the main contract, the only alle-
gation was that the other party was trying to encash the guarantee for an amount which it
had already recovered; that was sufficient for establishing the exception of fraud or irretriev-
able injustice. J.T. Mobiles Ltd v Deutsche Bank Ltd, AIR 1999 Del 358, an injunction was
vacated on the Attorney General giving undertaking that in the event of the party's suit being
decreed, the Union of India will pay the amount. A.L.N. Narayanan Chettiyar v Official
Assignee, (1941) 54 LW 606: AIR 1941 PC 93, observations to the effect that "fraud like
any other charge of criminal proceedings must be established beyond reasonable doubt". A
finding as to fraud cannot be based on suspicion and conjecture. Cited in DLF Cement Ltd v
Inspector of Police, AIR 1999 AP 359: (1999) 2 An LD 45, stay of encashment was held to be
not proper where neither of the grounds was made out. The court, on directing the parties for
reference to arbitration in terms of their agreement, stayed the encashment of the guarantee,
this was held to be illegal. It is not the function of the courts to examine the merits of the
dispute at that stage.

minimum interference in trade. Commitments of banks must be honoured

and international, would be irreparably damaged.

United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada,144
where it was observed that "to this general statement of principle as to the
commercial obligation of the confirming bank to the seller, there is one
established exception, that is, where the seller, for the purpose of drawing
on the credit, fraudulently presents to the confirming bank documents that
contain, expressly or by implication, material representation of facts that
to his knowledge are untrue.... The courts will not allow their process to
be used by a dishonest person to carry out a fraud". An example of a fraud
of this kind was before the Bombay High Court in Dai-Ichi Karkaria (P)
Ltd v Oil and Natural Gas Commission.145 The court emphatically asserted
that the law cannot allow the benefit of a bank guarantee to be claimed by
unscrupulous methods. Here the party in question was compelled at the
pain of stopping business with him to drop from his bank guarantee the
original requirement that it would be encashable only when the parallel
amount of import duty paid by him was refunded to him. As soon as ONGC

limit, not stayed. Kamal Virdichandji Garg v Fiat India (P) Ltd, AIR 2004 Bom 462, the
contention for getting encashment stayed was that the matter had been settled by issuing
cheques, but the cheques being post-dated and could not be encashed immediately, there was
no fraud in invoking the bank guarantee. Maharashtra State Handloom Corpn Ltd v Assn

poration was restrained from encasing guarantee. Adani Agri Fresh Ltd v Mahaboob Sharif,
2015 SCC OnLine SC 1302: (2016) 2 LW 56, a fruit supplier was given a guarantee by a fruit
wholesaler to make supply to another wholesaler. Supply was accordingly made. The buyer
wholesaler did not pay the bill and the bank guarantee was invoked. An injunction against
invocation issued by the court below was held to be not proper. There was no allegation of
any fraud or irretrievable loss.

attempted to enforce the altered guarantee, he applied for and was granted
a stay against such encashment. He was the victim of undue influence bor-
dering on fraud and the special equities thus generated created the necessity
of rescuing the party from being victimised.
Where the terms of a bank guarantee required that the letter of invoca-
tion must mention the amount of loss caused, it was held that a letter of
invocation which only stated that the contractor had failed to perform his
contract was not a sufficient compliance with the requirements of invoca-
tion. Hence, encashment was stayed.146 Where no purchase order was placed
upon the bidder so that there was no concluded contract at all, invocation of
bank guarantee was held to be not justified.147
In a case before the Calcutta High Court:148
The contract was for dredging and deepening a reservoir. Advance
payment was made to the contractor for purchase of essential machinery
on bank guarantee. SAIL sought encashment on account of the contrac-
tor's default. The contractor tried to prevent it on the ground that the
work assigned to him was impossible and that important facts were sup-
pressed from him. These grounds were held to be not sufficient to prevent
encashment.
Where the provision in the contract was that the guarantee would be
enforceable on the failure of the purchaser to take delivery and that the
supplier's decision as to this would be final, the court did not interfere in the
decision of the supplier to enforce the guarantee.149 Even where the matter
under dispute was referred to arbitration, the court did not stay the enforce-
ment of the bank guarantee. A bank guarantee was invoked where the
contractor failed to make contribution towards certain welfare funds. The
terms of the guarantee made the owner as the sole judge of the fact whether
the contractor committed breach. The court did not oblige the contractor
with an injunction restraining invocation of the guarantee.151

Extent of surety's liability 633
Where a mobilisation advance was provided by the owner to the contrac-
tor against a bank guarantee and the contract having been terminated and-
the mobilisation advance thereby becoming recoverable, encashment of the
bank guarantee was held to be justified. It could not be said that the encash-
ment was not in accordance with the terms of the contract. Even if the first
invocation was not in accordance with the terms of the contract, it could
be followed by a second invocation. The court further said that reasons for
requiring a bank guarantee may continue to persist even after termination of
the contract to enable invocation up to the date of its expiry.152
Even the winding up of the company on whose behalf the guarantee was
submitted would not enable the bank to refuse payment.153 The fact that the
company which was invoking bank guarantee was likely to be declared a
sick industrial undertaking was held to be not a situation of a special equity
or irretrievable injustice so as to justify an injunction against encashment.154
Variation in terms of contract
The High Court of Delhi has expressed the view that a clause in a bank.
guarantee to the affect that the parties may vary the terms of the contract
without affecting the liability of the bank would be valid. All that is nec-
essary is that the guarantor's ultimate remedy against the principal debtor
should remain unimpaired.155
Bank guarantee separate transaction
156
The court cannot take recourse to surrounding circumstances unless an
ambiguity exists in the terms and conditions of the contract. A bank guar-
antee is a separate transaction. It has to be construed on its own terms.1
Where there were two separate contracts, the bank guarantee executed
in respect of one of them was not allowed to be invoked in respect of the
other,157

injunction to stay the enforcement of letters of guarantee on the grounds
that the goods were of inferior quality and the sellers had not sent the origi-
nal shipping documents. The court cited the following statement of JENKINS
LJ in Hamzeh Malas & Sons v British Imex Industries Ltd:160
"...the opening of a confirmed letter of credit constitutes a bargain
between the banker and the vendor of the goods which imposes on the
banker an absolute obligation to pay... and that this was not a case in
which the court ought to exercise its discretion and grant the injunction."
The court emphasised that a bank guarantee attracts the same consider-
ation as a letter of credit and added: "A letter of credit sometimes resembles
and is analogous to a contract of guarantee. A bank guarantee is very much
like a letter of credit. The courts will do their utmost to enforce it accord-
ing to its terms. They will not, in the ordinary course of things, interfere
by way of injunction to prevent its implementation." The court also cited
an observation of KERR J in Harbottle R.D. (Mercantile) Ltd v National
Westminster Bank Ltd:161
"It is only in exceptional cases that the court will interfere with the
machinery of irrevocable obligations assumed by banks. They are the life-
blood of international commerce."
The type of rare case in which a court may intervene was before the
Calcutta High Court in Banerjee & Banerjee v Hindustan Steel Works
Construction Ltd.162 Here the party claiming under the guarantee failed
to point out the precise amount of his claim although he had the means to
quantify it, his intention being to suppress vital information, the court held
that his conduct being fraudulent, enforcement of the guarantee ought to be
stayed.
Another example would be where the encashment of the guarantee would
be contrary to law. For example, where a contractor gave a bank guarantee
be stopped only in cases of fraud or irretrievable loss. Rani Constructions (P) Ltd v Patibel
JV, (2006) 129 DLT 38, guarantee revealed that bank was liable to pay on first demand
with no right of objection. This also amounted to waiver of the right under S. 133. Mark

along with his bid as was required by the tender notice, the bidder, having
the right to do so, withdrew his bid before its acceptance, the Department
was restrained from encashing the guarantee. There was no contract yet
about which it could be said that there was a breach.163
Where the sub-letting of a Government contract was allowed only in
respect of three items and the principal contractor in fraud of his sub-lettee
handed over the entire work to him and obtained from him a bank guar-
antee for due performance, the enforcement of the guarantee was stayed
by reason of the fraud, for otherwise the sub-lettee would have suffered an
irreparable loss,164,
Where the bank which presented the letter of credit for encashment was a
holder in due course, it was held that the bank which issued the letter would
have to honour the same even if the document was tainted by fraud. The
facts of the present case showed that a fraud was practised by the buyer and
the supplier colluding with one and another to deprive the bank of repay-
ment. An injunction order against the bank to restrain it from honouring the
documentary credit was vacated so that the payment could follow.165
A conditional or contingent bank guarantee cannot be invoked by the
creditor without the specified condition being fulfilled.166
Bank guarantee and arbitration clause
The enforcement of a bank guarantee cannot be made the subject-mat-
ter of arbitration proceeding.167 But where a bank found that there was a
pending arbitration under which the liability of all the parties had to be
ascertained, the Karnataka High Court upheld the decision of the bank to
withhold payment. 168 In another Karnataka case 169 it was held that the right
of the beneficiary of the guarantee to recover the guaranteed amount could
not be stayed pending arbitration and the bank could not be restrained from
honouring its obligation. But the amount encashed is subject to adjustment
under the final award to be passed by the arbitrator.

636 Chapter 12 Guarantee
Period of limitation (expiry of guarantee period)
[S. 129]
The period of limitation for enforcing a guarantee is three years from the
date on which the letter of guarantee was executed.170 Where as against the
advancement of a loan to a company, the guarantee deed was executed by its
directors and subsequently a letter acknowledging the loan was issued by the
same directors on behalf of the company, it was held that the letter did not
have the effect of extending the period of limitation. Recovery proceedings
instituted after three years from the date of the deed of guarantee were liable
to be quashed. Where an acknowledgement of liability by part payment
or otherwise has the effect of extending the period of limitation, it was held
that the debt remained the same as it was before. So long as the principal
debtor remains liable, the surety also continues to be liable. There is no need
for any separate acknowledgement from the surety.172
Where the terms of the deed of guarantee showed that the guarantee was
of continuing nature, it was held that the suit would be governed by Article
55 of the Limitation Act, 1963. Hence, so long as the account was alive, i.e.
neither settled nor there was refusal by guarantors to carry out the obliga-
tion, the period of limitation would not start running. On breach taking
place, the bank gave notice invoking the guarantee. A suit filed within three
years from that date was held to be within time.173
A guarantee has to be invoked within its validity period, i.e. before its
expiry date. Once it is invoked within time actual proceedings can be com-
menced within the period of three years from that date. Any clause in the
contract cutting short this period would be hit by Section 28.174
170. New Bank of India v Sajitha Textiles, AIR 1997 Ker 201, the guarantee deed was not allowed
to be enforced against the guarantor under a suit filed after expiry of the period. Article 55 of
the Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable.

Extent of surety's liability 637
Where the guarantee was valid for 90 days, the court said that it could be
invoked on the 91st day, if the 90th day happened to be a public holiday or
sunday and the banks did not function that day,175
Where the contract between the parties had expired by efflux of time
without invocation of bank guarantee, as such the defendants had no
right under the contract to invoke the bank guarantee. They induced the
plaintiff to renew the guarantee thus changing position to their detriment.
Defendants invoked the guarantee immediately after renewal. The order of
injunction passed restraining the defendants from invoking the guarantee
was held to be proper. 176
Joint-debtors and suretyship [S. 132]
S. 132. Liability of two persons, primarily liable, not affected
by arrangement between them that one shall be surety in other's
default.- Where two persons contract with a third person to undertake a cer-
tain liability, and also contract with each other that one of them shall be liable
only on the default of the other, the third person not being a party to such con-
tract, the liability of each of such two persons to the third person under the first
contract is not affected by the existence of the second contract, although such
third person may have been aware of its existence.
Illustration
A and B make a joint and several promissory note to C. A makes it, in fact, as surety for B,
and C, knows this at the time when the note is made. The fact that A, to the knowledge of C,
made the note as surety for B, is no answer to a suit by C against A upon the note.
The section is based upon the principle that the liability of persons who
are primarily liable as joint-debtors is not affected by any arrangement
between them as to the order of their liability. A creditor is not affected by
any private arrangement entered into as between his two debtors that one
will be the surety of the other even if the creditor knows of this arrange-
ment. The creditor may not be a consenting party to the arrangement. 177
The principle of the section is that whatever be the arrangement between
joint-debtors as to their liability to the creditor they remain joint debtors.
The creditor is not concerned with their mutual agreement that one would
be a principal and the other a surety. Where, however, the creditor knows
of any such arrangement, he must refrain from doing anything which would
have the effect of discharging the surety under Sections 133, 134 or 135.178

638 Chapter 12 Guarantee
[S. 130]
Unless there is a specific agreement between the surety and the creditor to
the effect that the principal debtor alone would be liable in the first instance,
the creditor can proceed against the surety to the same extent as if he were
himself the principal debtor. It would not be necessary first to realise the
amount from the principal debtor.179
A personal guarantee executed by the guarantor providing that the guar-
antee was to remain in force till the borrower paid the full loan amount on
demand was held to be a continuing guarantee. The period of limitation
started running on refusal by the borrower to fulfil the demand.10 After
notice of revocation, any amount due from the surety in respect of pre-ex-
isting transactions, the payment for the same must be claimed within three
years failing which it would become time-barred.181
DISCHARGE OF SURETY FROM LIABILITY
A surety is said to be discharged from liability when his liability comes to
an end. The Act recognises the following modes of discharge:
1. By revocation [S. 130]
Ordinarily a guarantee is not revocable when once it is acted upon. But
Section 130 provides for revocation of continuing guarantees.
S. 130. Revocation of continuing guarantee.-A continuing guarantee
may at any time be revoked by the surety, as to future transactions, by notice to
the creditor.
Illustrations
(a) A, in consideration of B's discounting, at A's request, bills of exchange for C, guarantee
to B, for twelve months, the due payment of all such bills to the extent of 5000 rupees.
B discounts bills for C to the extent of 2000 rupees. Afterwards, at the end of three
months, A revokes the guarantee. This revocation discharges A from all liability to B for
any subsequent discount. But A is liable to B for the 2000 rupees, on default of C.
(b) A guarantees to B, to the extent of 10,000 rupees, that C shall pay all the bills that B
shall draw upon him. B draws upon C. C accepts the bill. A gives notice of revocation. C
dishonours the bill at maturity. A is liable upon his guarantee.
Revocation becomes effective for the future transactions while the surety
remains liable for transactions already entered into.182 Offord v Davies¹³ is
a suitable illustration:
The defendants guaranteed the repayment of bills to be discounted by
the plaintiffs for Davies & Co for twelve months not exceeding £600.

https://t.me/LawCollegeNotes_Stuffs
Discharge of surety from liability 639
The defendants revoked the guarantee before any bill was discounted. But
the plaintiffs discounted the bills which remained unpaid.
The question was whether the surety had a right to revoke. The court said:
"We are of opinion that they had and consequently they were not liable. In
the case of a simple guarantee for a proposed loan, the right of revocation
before the proposal has been acted on did not appear to be disputed." In the
case of a continuing guarantee, every credit given is a separate transaction
which makes the surety irrevocably liable, but he may free himself from
further liability.184
The employment of a servant is one transaction. A guarantee for his good
behaviour is not a continuing one and is not revocable as long as he contin-
ues in the job. At any rate the employer is entitled to such notice as will
enable him to determine the employment without liability. Nor is such a
guarantee determined by the surety's death unless there is an agreement to
the contrary. 186
Whether a guarantee for the payment of rent can be revoked depends
upon the facts of each case and the language employed by the parties to
express their intention. In a guarantee of this kind where the surety died,
the court held that neither could he have revoked the guarantee during his
lifetime nor was his estate released from liability.188 JOYCE J said: "The right
to determine or withdraw a guarantee by notice forthwith cannot possibly
exist when the consideration for it is indivisible, so to speak, and moves from
person to whom the guarantee is given once for all, as in the case of the con-

As against it when a person guaranteed the payment of rent by his servant
and revoked the guarantee as soon as the servant left his employment, he
was held not liable for rents which became due after the revocation.189

entered into protection from liability under the Sick Industrial Companies
(Special Provision) Act, 1985,191
"Notice to the creditor" means a clear and specific notice intended to ter-
minate liability under the guarantee. A denial of liability in a previous suit
was held to be not serving as a notice. 192
2. By death of surety [S. 131]
A continuing guarantee is also determined by the death of the surety
unless there is a contract to the contrary. Once again, the termination
becomes effective only for the future transactions. The surety's heirs can
be sued for liability already incurred. The section clearly points this out.
S. 131. Revocation of continuing guarantee by surety's death.-The
death of the surety operates, in the absence of any contract to the contrary, as a
revocation of a continuing guarantee, so far as regards future transactions.
Liability of legal heirs
The liability of the deceased surety can be imposed against his legal heirs
but only to the extent of the property inherited by them.194
3. By variance [S. 133]
Courts of law and equity have always taken zealous care of a surety's
interest. "A surety is considered a favoured debtor and his liability is in stric-
tissimi juris." 195 Initially a contract of guarantee may not be one of utmost
good faith, but once formed the duty of utmost good faith is imposed upon
the creditor. The result of this concern of the courts for the surety's interest
is that a surety is held discharged when, without his consent, the creditor
makes any change in the nature or terms of his contract with the princi-
pal debtor. "The surety is discharged as soon as the original contract is

altered without his consent." 197 A guarantee is not a contract in respect of a
primary transaction. It is an independent transaction containing independ-
ent and reciprocal obligations. It is created on a principal to principal basis.
Therefore, some relief is provided both to the creditor and the guarantor.198
Section 133 of the Indian Contract Act incorporates this principle.
S. 133. Discharge of surety by variance in terms of contract.-Any vari-
ance, made without the surety's consent, in the terms of the contract between
the principal [debtor] and the creditor, discharges the surety as to transac-
tions subsequent to the variance.
Illustrations
(a) A becomes surety to C for B's conduct as a manager in C's bank. Afterwards, B and C
contract, without A's consent, that B's salary shall be raised, and that he shall become
liable for one-fourth of the losses on overdrafts. B allows a customer to overdraw, and
the bank loses a sum of money. A is discharged from his suretyship by the variance
made without his consent, and is not liable to make good this loss.
(b) A guarantees C against the misconduct of B in an office to which B is appointed by C,
and of which the duties are defined by an Act of the Legislature. By a subsequent Act,
the nature of the office is materially altered. Afterwards, B misconducts himself. A is
discharged by the change from future liability under his guarantee, though the miscon-
duct of B is in respect of a duty not affected by the latter Act.
(c) C agrees to appoint B as his clerk to sell goods at a yearly salary, upon A's becoming
surety to C for B's duly accounting for moneys received by him as such clerk. After-
wards, without A's knowledge or consent, C and B agree that B should be paid by a
commission on the goods sold by him and not by a fixed salary. A is not liable for subse-
quent misconduct of B.
(d) A gives to C a continuing guarantee to the extent of 3000 rupees for any oil supplied by
C to B on credit. Afterwards B becomes embarrassed, and, without the knowledge of A,
B and C contract that C shall continue to supply B with oil for ready money, and that the
payment shall be applied to the then existing debts between B and C. A is not liable on
his guarantee for any goods supplied after this new arrangement.
(e) C contracts to lend B 5000 rupees on the 1st March. A guarantees repayment, C pays the
5000 rupees to B on the 1st January. A is discharged from his liability, as the contract has
been varied, inasmuch as C might sue B for the money before the first of March.

CASE PILOT
[S. 133]
The defendant guaranteed the conduct of a manager of a bank. The
bank afterwards raised his salary on the condition that he would be liable
for one-fourth of the losses on discounts allowed by him. No commu-
nication of this new arrangement was made to the surety. The manager
allowed a customer to overdraw his account and the bank lost a sum of
money.
It was held that the surety could not be called on to make good the loss
as the fresh agreement was a substitution of a new agreement for the former
which discharged the surety.
Similarly, where the payment of rent was guaranteed, and the rent was
increased without the consent of the surety;201 where the creditor on default
of payment took a promissory note from the principal debtor without ref-
erence to the surety;202 where the position of a partner in a firm was guar-
anteed and the business of the firm was extended without knowledge of the
surety, the sureties were held to be discharged. 200
One of the questions that concerns the courts is that where a variation
is not substantial or material, or is beneficial to the surety, will he be dis-
charged? A problem of this kind was before the Supreme Court in M.S.
Anirudhan v Thomco's Bank Ltd,204
The defendant guaranteed the repayment of a loan of Rs 20,000 given
by the plaintiff bank to the principal debtor. The guarantee paper showed
the loan to be Rs 25,000. The bank refused to accept. The principal then
reduced the amount to Rs 20,000 and without intimation to the surety
gave it to the bank which was then accepted. The principal debtor failed
to pay and the bank sued the surety. The question was whether the alter-
ation had discharged him.
It was held by a majority that the surety was not discharged. KAPUR Jand
HIDAYATULLAH J (afterwards CJ) were of this view, but SARKAR J dissented.
HIDAYATULLAH J (afterwards CJ) considered the authorities. 208
Lord WESTBURY LC in Blest v Brown206 stated the liability in the fol-
lowing terms: "It must always be recollected in what manner the surety is
bound. You bind him to the letter of his engagement. Beyond the proper
interpretation of that engagement you have no hold upon him. He receives
no benefit and no consideration. He is bound, therefore, merely according

laterally extended time and also accepted new schedule for repayment. This was done on the

to the proper meanings and effect of the written engagement that he has
entered into. If that written engagement is altered in a single line, no matter
whether the alteration be innocently made, he has a right to say: 'The con-
tract is no longer for that for which I engaged to be surety; you have put an
end to the contract that I guaranteed, and my obligation, therefore, is at an
end.'"
The statement of the law in Blest v Brown207 was considered by the Court
of Appeal in Holme v Brunskill,208 COTTON LJ stated the law in these words:
"The true rule in my opinion is that if there is any agreement between
the principals with reference to the contract guaranteed, the surety
ought to be consulted, and that if he has not consented to the alteration,
although in cases where it is without inquiry evident that the alteration is
unsubstantial, or that it cannot be otherwise than beneficial to the surety,
the surety may not be discharged; yet that if it is not self-evident that
the alteration is unsubstantial or one which cannot be prejudicial to the
surety, the court will not in an action against the surety, go into inquiry
as to the effect of the alteration."
"There is a noticeable difference between the strict rule stated by
Lord WESTBURY and that stated by COTTON LJ and the law now accepts
that unsubstantial alterations which are to the benefit of the surety do
not discharge the surety from the liability. Of course, if the alteration
is to the disadvantage of the surety, or its unsubstantial character is not.
self-evident the surety can claim to be discharged. The court will not then
inquire whether it in fact harmed the surety. That dictum of COTTON LJ
was quoted with approval by the Judicial Committee in Ward v National
Bank of New Zealand Ltd, 109
An attempted variation which does not become effective leaves the surety
bound by his guarantee.210
Another effect is that an alteration not only discharges the surety from his
personal liability but also releases the property, if any, which the surety had
included in the contract.211 This was the situation in Bolton v Salmon,212 The
defendant was a surety for a loan and also brought in some of her own prop-
erty as security. The principal debtor, without her knowledge, borrowed
from the creditor further still and executed a new deed consolidating all the

tioned. Held, did not amount to variation. N. Sulochana v State of A.P., AIR 1984 AP 173.

loans. The defendant was held to have been discharged and her property
released from the bond.
Where a guarantee was given for the loan account of the principal debtor
with a bank and the bank opened a second account in the name of the prin-
cipal debtor into which considerable payments were received, the surety was
held to have been discharged.213 The terms of guarantee provided interest at
9 per cent and that the surety's consent would not be necessary for any grant
by the creditor to the principal debtor "of time or any other indulgence or
consideration". The creditor extended the time of payment by one year and
increased the interest to 16 per cent. This discharged the surety. The court
said that the substantial increase of interest could not be covered by the
words "any indulgence or consideration",24 The liability under a guarantee
ceased to exist where the guarantee was substituted by another guarantee
bond covering the whole amount and signed by other guarantors.215
Extension of cash-credit limit of the borrower beyond the amount which
was guaranteed did not have the effect of discharging the surety because his
limit of liability was to remain the same as under the guarantee. 216
The liability of the guarantor would not automatically cease or come to
an end merely because he had not signed revival letters. The fact that the
guarantor was no longer willing to continue with the guarantee did not end
the guarantee or his liability under it. 217
Advance authorisation of alteration
The Madhya Pradesh High Court has been of the view that an authority
given by the surety in advance enabling the creditor and the principal debtor
to make any alteration in the terms and conditions of the transaction guar-
anteed would be contrary to the provision of Section 133 and, therefore, of
no effect. The consent of the surety of which the section talks must be con-
sent taken at the time of variance so as to be simultaneous with the proposed
variance. The court also said that the provisions of Sections 134, 135, 139
and 141 cannot be nullified in advance.218

Discharge of surety from liability 645
Consent may be either prior or subsequent to the alteration. 219 All that the
above decision means to say is that there should be either a proposed alter-
ation for prior consent or an alteration already effected for subsequent con-
sent. There should not be consent to variation in vacuum. The High Court
of Delhi has expressed the view that a term in a bank guarantee providing
that variations in the underlying contract may be made without affecting the
liability of the bank would be valid. 220
Effect of decree against surety
In a case before the High Court of Delhi,221 the creditor obtained a decree
both against the principal debtor and the surety making them collectively
and severally liable to pay the amount to the decree-holder. He then entered
into a settlement with the principal debtor agreeing to accept from him
a less amount and not to enforce the decree against him for the balance.
The surety claimed a discharge on this basis. The court did not agree with
him. Once the liability is converted into a decreed-debt, the earlier con-
straints of the underlying contract cease to be applicable. The subsequent
dealing with the principal debtor does not operate to discharge the surety
from a liability under which he is no longer liable as a surety, but under the
decree,222
Earlier the Madras High Court had observed in a case of this kind:
"We are not, after a joint decree has been passed against principal and
surety, any longer dealing with a principal and surety but with a joint
debtor."

(1934) 50 TLR 230, normally speaking any alteration in the contract between the creditor
and the debtor is sufficient to release the surety but that effect can be excluded. SBI v Vivek
Garg, AIR 2011 Sikk 7, the guarantee stipulated that notwithstanding any variation made in
the terms of the arrangement or any composition between the bank and borrower, the guar-
antor would not be relieved and he shall be deemed to have consented to the same. Hence,
he could not plead discharge. Kunbi Sahakari Bank Ltd v Shakti Paper Co, (2009) 1 Mah LJ

[S. 134]
In still another Madras case, 224 a loan due to a co-operative society was
guaranteed by a surety and an award was obtained by the society against
the principal debtor as well as the surety. The principal debtor obtained a
discharge from the debt. The decree-holder sought to enforce the decree
against the surety, who contended that he was no more liable under the
award as the liability of the principal debtor stood extinguished. But the
court found no merit in this contention and said: "After a decree has been
passed the characters of the principal debtor and that of the surety change
into those of co-judgment-debtors. The provisions of Sections 133-139 of
the Contract Act apply only where no decree has been passed. These pro-
visions which govern the rights and liabilities of the creditor, the principal
debtor and surety, cease to operate after the rights and liabilities are deter-
mined and declared by a decree. The liability as determined by the decree
cannot thereafter be modified by anything which the decree-holder may do
or omit to do."225
An alteration which does not disturb the basic structure of liability cre-
ated by a guarantee would not render the guarantee unenforceable. Two
directors of a company guaranteed the company's obligation under a leasing
transaction for photocopying equipment. Later someone dropped the word
"company" from the borrowing company's name and initialled the altera-
tion in the names of the directors. It was held that though the alteration was
a forgery, the guarantee remained enforceable.226
4. Release or discharge of principal debtor [S. 134]
S. 134. Discharge of surety by release or discharge of principal
debtor. The surety is discharged by any contract between the creditor and
the principal debtor, by which the principal debtor is released, or by any act or
omission of the creditor, the legal consequence of which is the discharge of the
principal debtor.

(b) A contracts with B to grow a crop of indigo on A's land and to deliver it to B at a fixed

which is necessary for irrigation of A's land and thereby prevents him from raising the
indigo. C is no longer liable on his guarantee.
(c) A contracts with B for a fixed price to build a house for B within a stipulated time, B sup-
plying the necessary timber. C guarantees A's performance of the contract. B omits to
supply the timber. C is discharged from his suretyship.
(i) Release of principal debtor
The section provides for two kinds of discharge from liability. In the first
place, if the creditor makes any contract with the principal debtor by which
the latter is released, the surety is discharged. Where, for example, the credi-
tor accepts a compromise and releases the principal debtor, the surety is like-
wise released. Any release of the principal debtor is a release of the surety
also.227
Effect of Debt Relief Acts.-Where the liability of the principal debtor
is reduced under the provisions of a statute, an important question arises
whether the liability of the surety is also diminished thereby. Facing this
problem probably for the first time in 1938 and again in 1944 the Nagpur
High Court held that the intention of the statute is to relieve the principal
debtor and not the surety,228 But a Full Bench of the Madras High Court,
applying the provisions of the Madras Agriculturists' Debt Relief Act, 1938
held that "the surety is liable only for the reduced amount".229 This view of
the Madras High Court has now been supported by the Kerala High Court
in Aypunni Mani v Devassy Kochouseph.230 Explaining the purpose of the
debt-relieving statutes, GOPALAN NAMBIYARE J observed as follows: "It
appears to us, that to hold otherwise, would be to altogether deny the ben-
efit of the ameliorative provisions of the Act to the agriculturist debtor. On
any other view it would be open to the creditor to recover the debt as scaled
down from the agriculturist debtor, and the balance from the surety, and the

Indian Bank Ltd, 1985 KLT 29 (SN) where it is pointed out that the discharge of the prin-
cipal debtor is not discharge of the surety where it is not brought about by the voluntary act
of the creditor, but by operation of law; Bank of India Ltd v Rustom Fakirji Cowasjee, AIR
1955 Bom 419. Similarly, the creditor, while discharging the principal debtor, may reserve
his rights against the surety and in that event the surety would not be discharged. Cutler v

[S. 134]
latter in his turn could seek reimbursement from the principal debtor (vide
S. 144 of the Contract Act). Such a construction would completely nullify
the benefits of the ameliorative legislation to indebted agriculturists."
This is indeed the most desirable interpretation of Section 128 which
makes the liability of the surety coextensive with that of the principal debtor.
In view of this decision the effect of the section is "that a statutory reduction
or extinguishment of the principal debtor's liability will operate as a pro
tanto reduction or extinguishment of surety's debt". The mere suspension
of a debt for a short period and that too with a clause that the period of
limitation will not run during the period of suspension, will not affect the
liability of the guarantor.232
Application of insolvency laws
The Supreme Court has laid down that though under Section 134 the
surety is discharged by release or discharge of the principal debtor, a dis-
charge which the principal debtor may secure by reason of winding up or
insolvency does not absolve the surety of his liability. A bank guarantee for
a sum of Rs 50,000 was submitted by a supplier of the Electricity Board. The
bank was liable under the guarantee to pay the amount within 48 hours of
demand by the Board. The Board demanded payment. The bank made it.
The bank was now trying to realise the amount out of the securities depos-
ited by the supplier for securing the guarantee. The supplier company went
into liquidation. The liquidator sought to restrain the bank from realising
the securities. But the court allowed the bank to go ahead. The bank was a
secured creditor and was entitled to the benefit of securities. The bank had
nothing to do with the state of the relations between the company and the
Electricity Board.233
(ii) Act or omission
The second ground of discharge provided in Section 134 is that when
the creditor does "any act or omission the legal consequence of which is the
discharge of the principal debtor", the surety would also be discharged from
his liability. Where, for example, there is a contract for the construction of
a building the performance of which is guaranteed by a surety. Under the
contract, the creditor has to supply the building material. An omission on
231. This section enables the surety to recover from principal debtor the amount which he has
lawfully paid to the creditor under the contract of guarantee.

takings. Bank of Madura Ltd v Bank of Baroda, 1986 SCC OnLine Mad 95: (1986) 99 LW

his part to do so would discharge the contractor and so would the surety
be discharged. Similarly, where the payment of rent due under a lease is
guaranteed and the creditor terminates the lease, or where the payment of
instalments due under a hire-purchase is guaranteed and the creditor pre-
maturely determines the agreement, the effect would be the release of the
surety also.23+ The act of the creditor in terminating the agreement, e.g.,
in determining the agreement of hire-purchase by taking possession of the
goods, discharged the surety.235
The effect of omission to sue is considered later.236
5. Composition, extension of time and promise not to sue [S. 135]
S. 135. Discharge of surety when creditor compounds with, gives time
to, or agrees not to sue principal debtor.-A contract between the credi-
tor and the principal debtor, by which the creditor makes a composition with,
or promises to give time to, or not to sue the principal debtor, discharges the
surety, unless the surety assents to such contract.
The section provides for three modes of discharge from liability:
(1) Composition;
(2) Promise to give time, and
(3) Promise not to sue the principal debtor.
Composition
If the creditor makes a composition with the principal debtor, without con-
sulting the surety, the latter is discharged. Composition inevitably involves
variation of the original contract, and, therefore, the surety is discharged.237
A settlement was entered into between the principal borrower and bank for
one-time settlement without reference to the guarantor. The court said that
this amounted to novation of the contract between the creditor and princi-
pal debtor to the exclusion of guarantor. The liability of guarantor ceased
to exist. No proceedings could be initiated against the guarantor under
Section 13 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and
Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. The guarantor was allowed to

surety was held discharged.

barred. Bombay Dyeing & Mfg Co Ltd v State of Bombay, AIR 1958 SC 328: 1958 SCR

challenge the action initiated against him by invoking writ jurisdiction.238 A
compromise in terms of a court decree is different from private composition.
That does not discharge the surety, 239 unless the decree is collusive.
Promise to give time
"240
When the time for the payment of the guaranteed debt comes, the surety
has the right to require the principal debtor to pay off the debt. Accordingly,
it is one of the duties of the creditor towards the surety not to allow the
principal debtor more time for payment. "The creditor has no right, it is
against the faith of his contract, to give time to the principal, even though
manifestly for the benefit of the surety, without the consent of the surety."
"It is very undesirable that there should be any dispute or controversy about
whether it is for his benefit or not; there shall be the broad principle that
if the creditor does intentionally violate any rights the surety had when he
entered into the suretyship, even though the damage be nominal only, he
shall forfeit the whole remedy."241
Thus, where the principal debtor was to make payment for gas supplied
within fourteen days and on one occasion he having failed to pay, the sup-
plier took a promissory note from him, this amounted to extension of time
and thereupon the surety was discharged. Similarly, where the price of a
motor car was to be paid in instalments and payment of which was guar-
anteed, the buyer fell into arrears and the dealer settled with the buyer that
he should pay a certain sum immediately and the balance by the end of the
month. This discharged the surety,243 The Supreme Court of India has held
that where a bank gave time to the principal debtor to make up the quantity
of the goods pledged, it did not have the effect of giving time for payment
within the meaning of Section 135.244

Discharge of surety from liability 651.
S. 136. Surety not discharged when agreement made with third per-
son to give time to principal debtor.-Where a contract to give time to the
principal debtor is made by the creditor with a third person, and not with the
principal debtor, the surety is not discharged.
Illustration
C, the holder of an overdue bill of exchange drawn by A as surety for B, and accepted by
B, contracts with M to give time to B. A is not discharged.
Promise not to sue
If the creditor under an agreement with the principal debtor promises not
to sue him, the surety is discharged. "The main reason is that a surety is
entitled at any time to require the creditor to call upon the principal debtor
to pay off the debt" when it is due and this right is positively violated when
the creditor promises not to sue the principal debtor.
Forbearance to sue
This is, however, subject to two important qualifications. In the first
place, a promise not to sue should be distinguished from a mere "forbear-
ance to sue". "A promise not to sue is an engagement which ties the hands
of the creditor. It is not negatively refraining; not exacting the money at
the time, but it is the act of the creditor depriving himself of the power of
suing...."245 Section 137 incorporates this principle.
S. 137. Creditor's forbearance to sue does not discharge surety.-Mere
forbearance on the part of the creditor to sue the principal debtor or to enforce
any other remedy against him does not, in the absence of any provision in the
guarantee to the contrary, discharge the surety.
Illustration
Bowes to C a debt guaranteed by A. The debt becomes payable. C does not sue B for a
year after the debt has become payable. A is not discharged from his suretyship.
Thus "mere forbearance to sue" does not discharge the surety, 246 But sup-
pose that the forbearance continues up to the expiry of the period of lim-
itation and consequently the action against the principal debtor becomes
time barred, will the surety be discharged? According to Section 134 if the
creditor is guilty of any act or omission the legal consequence of which
is the discharge of the principal debtor, the surety is also discharged. The
AIR 1930 Lah 896; Bank of Baroda v Avdoot Bhagwant Naik, AIR 2005 Bom 224, delay
in asking for payment and in filing suit, did not mean promise to extend time, the trawler
purchased was disposed of but the loan amount not paid. The principal debtor and guarantor
became jointly and severally liable.

[S. 137]
omission to sue the principal debtor within the period of limitation defi-
nitely discharges him. Thus if Section 134 stood alone the surety would be
discharged. But Section 137 declares that "mere forbearance to sue" does
not discharge the surety. These two provisions naturally created a conflict of
decisions which was ultimately resolved by the decision of the Privy Council
in Mahant Singh v U Ba Yi. Lord PORTER observed as follows: "... a fail-
ure to sue the principal debtor until recovery is barred by the statutes of
limitation does not operate as a discharge of the surety in England. 248 The
same view prevails in most of the High Courts in India.... With these
decisions of the other High Courts in India may be contrasted the case of
Ranjit Singh v Naubat, 250 which decides that in spite of the provisions of
Section 137, the creditor's right against the surety is not preserved unless he
sues the principal debtor within the period of limitation. Such a decision is
inconsistent with the views held by the courts in England and majority of
the courts in India. In this conflict, their Lordships prefer the reasoning of
the majority."251
Reserving rights against surety
The decision further points out that an agreement not to sue the princi-
pal debtor or to give time with a reservation of the right against the surety,
would not discharge the surety. The Mahanth Singh case252 was decided on
this principle.
The plaintiff was engaged as a contractor by certain trustees of a
pagoda for construction work. The payment by the trustees was guaran-
teed by the defendants. The trustees defaulted and, therefore, the plaintiff
sued the trustees and the surety. The beneficiaries of the trust replaced
their trustees and the plaintiff dropped his case against them and was not
allowed subsequently to sue them in their personal capacity. But the suit
against the surety was maintained.
It was held that the surety was not discharged. "The appellant's act in
continuing to sue the surety though he withdrew his action against the

principal debtors was a clear reservation of his rights. The remedy of the
surety against the principal debtor is not impaired and his liability is, there-
fore, not discharged."253
Promise to give time to debtor made with third person
Secondly, Section 136 provides that "where a contract to give time to the
principal debtor is made by the creditor with a third person, and not with
the principal debtor, the surety is not discharged".
6. By impairing surety's remedy [S. 139]
S. 139. Discharge of surety by creditor's act or omission impairing
surety's eventual remedy.-If the creditor does any act which is inconsistent
with the right of the surety, or omits to do any act which his duty to the surety
requires him to do, and the eventual remedy of the surety himself against the
principal debtor is thereby impaired, the surety is discharged.
Illustrations
(a) B contracts to build a ship for C for a given sum, to be paid by instalments as the work
reaches certain stages. A becomes surety to C for B's due performance of the contract.
C, without the knowledge of A, prepays to B the last two instalments. A is discharged by
this prepayment.
(b) Clends money to B on the security of a joint and several promissory note, made in C's
favour by B, and A as surety for B, together with a bill of sale of B's furniture, which gives
power to C to sell the furniture, and apply to proceeds in discharge of the note. Subse-
quently, C sells the furniture, but, owing to his misconduct and wilful negligence, only a
small price is realized. A is discharged from liability on the note.
(c) A puts Mas apprentice to B, and gives a guarantee to B for M's fidelity. B promises on his
part that he will, at least once a month, see M make up the cash. B omits to see this done
as promised, and M embezzles. A is not liable to B on his guarantee.
If the creditor does any act which is inconsistent with the rights of the
surety, or omits to do any act which his duty to the surety requires him
to do, and the eventual remedy of the surety himself against the principal
debtor is impaired, the surety is discharged. It is the plain duty of the cred-
itor not to do anything inconsistent with the rights of the surety. A surety
is entitled, after paying off the creditor, to his indemnity from the principal
debtor. If the creditor's act or omission deprives the surety of the benefit
of this remedy, the surety is discharged.254 Thus, where the integrity of a
cashier is guaranteed and the employer undertakes to check his work once
in a month but neglects to do so, the cashier embezzles, the surety is not
liable. The same duty requires the creditor to preserve the securities, if any,
which he has against the principal debtor. If he loses or parts with the secu-
rities, the surety is discharged to that extent.255 Similarly, where against the
253. See further, Orissa Agro Industries Corpn Ltd v Sarbeswar Guru, AIR 1985 Ori 270, where
the suit against the principal debtor was dismissed, but it was allowed against the surety.

terms of the guarantee the Government allowed the contractor to remove
felled trees from a forest without payment of price, the surety was held to
be discharged.256
Another suitable illustration is Darwen & Pearce, re:257
The principal debtor was a shareholder in a company. His shares were
partly paid and the payment of the unpaid balance was guaranteed by the
surety. The shareholder defaulted in the payment of calls and the com-
pany forfeited his shares.
By reason of the forfeiture the shares became the property of the com-
pany. If they had not been forfeited they would have belonged to the surety
on payment of the outstanding calls. Thus, the forfeiture deprived the surety
of his right to the shares and he was accordingly discharged.
Failure on the part of the supplier of a lorry to seize it after an accident,
particularly when it was under repairs and under lien for repair charges, is
not the same thing as impairing the surety's remedy who had guaranteed
payment of the remaining instalments of the price.258 To the same effect is a
decision of the Rajasthan High Court. 259 The payment of the price of a liq-
uor shop was spread into ten instalments and these payments were guaran-
teed by the defendant. The principal debtor defaulted with the instalments.
The State could have cancelled the licence and re-auctioned the shop, but
did not do so. The guarantor contended that this inaction should put an
end to his liability. But he was held liable. The State inaction had in no way
impaired his ultimate remedy against the principal debtor. Similarly, where
the surety repeatedly asked the bank to do something against the principal
debtor who was rapidly disposing of his assets and even so the bank did
nothing, the surety was not allowed to claim any discharge.260

Discharge of surety from liability 655
The creditor also owes to the surety the duty of realising the proper value
of the securities in case he exercises his power of sale.261 "Any improper
dealing with the collateral deposited to secure an indebtedness guaranteed
by another is available to the guarantor as a defence."262 In a New York
case the guarantor pleaded in defence that the collateral security (skins in
this case) was sold before maturity of the debt without notice for 200 dol-
lars although worth 12,500 dollars at the time of sale. The guarantor was
allowed corresponding reduction in his liability. Where, on the other hand,
the assets of a company, whose debt was secured by mortgaging the assets
and also guaranteed by a director, were taken over by the receiver appointed
by the mortgagee, the receiver was held to be under no duty towards the
surety to realise proper value of the assets. The guarantor sued the receiver
for the loss caused to him by not obtaining proper value of the assets. But
the action was not allowed.264 The decision proceeded on the ground that
the receiver is an agent of the creditor or, at the most, of the company, but
not that of the surety. But the decision has been criticised. 265
In a case before the Supreme Court:
A bank granted a loan on the security of the stock in godown. The loan
was also guaranteed by a surety. The goods were lost from the godown on
account of the negligence of bank officials. The surety was discharged to
the extent of the value of the stock so lost,266
261. Bhumiputra Merchant Banker Berhad v Melewar Corpn, (1990) 2 Current LJ 30 (HC Kuala
Lumpur), a mortgagee has the right to choose the time to sell and when he has decided to sell,
he owes a common law duty to the mortgagor to realise the true value of the property sold.
The court cited Standard Chartered Bank Ltd v Walker, (1982) 1 WLR 1410 (CA), where
Lord DENNING described this duty as only a particular application of the general duty of
care to your neighbour which was stated by Lord ATKIN in Donoghue v Stevenson, 1932 AC
562 (HL). The mortgagor and guarantor are clearly in very close "proximity" to those who
conduct sale. Shri Mahadev Rama Bhonsle v Central Bank of India, (1998) 2 Bom CR 244,
the bank realising the value of hypothecated vehicles after a lapse of five years, the bank was
liable to reduce the recovery from the surety to the extent of recoverable loss. Chistovan Vaz

[S. 139]
This has been further supplemented by the Supreme Court by the decla-
ration in a subsequent case that the creditor must proceed in the first place
against the security and then only against the surety for the balance.267
Where the salary of both the principal debtor and the surety was got
attached, it was held that nothing could be recovered from the surety as
long as the principal debtor was paying his instalments. Only an instalment
in default could be recovered. The creditor caused delay of some years in
executing the decree. The court said that the interest for the period of delay
could not be recovered from the surety. His liability was to be confined to
the original decretal amount.268
In a case before the Privy Council,269 their Lordships observed that the
creditor owed no duty to the surety to exercise his power of sale of the
mortgaged securities and could decide in its own interest whether to sell and
when to do so. The security was neither surrendered, nor lost, nor imperfect,
nor altered in condition by reason of what was done by the creditor. The
creditor bank had three sources of repayment. The creditor could sue the
debtor, sell the mortgaged securities or sue the surety. All those remedies
could be exercised at any time or times simultaneously or contemporane-
ously or successively or not at all. If the creditor chose to sue the surety and
not pursue any other remedy, the creditor on being paid in full was bound to
assign the mortgaged securities to the surety. If the creditor chose to exercise
his power of sale over the mortgaged security, he must sell for the correct
market value, but the creditor must decide in his own interest if and when
he should sell. The creditor does not become a trustee of the mortgaged
than in the course of business, the surety was held to be not discharged because there was
no connection between the bank's negligence and the loss of security. Union Bank of India

this connection. The bank failed to prevent transfer of the hypothecated stock by the princi-
pal to a third party despite having the power under the terms of the loan to do so. The bank
was under duty to inspect periodically, take account, evaluate and give directions regarding
disposal of the hypothecated stock. Failure of the bank in this respect faciliated illegal aliena-
tion. The surety was discharged to the extent of such loss of the stock. Punjab National Bank

on the application of the bank for pledged goods. The bank claimed that the goods were
damaged or destroyed due to natural decay while in the custody of the bank. No evidence
was offered to show the quantity or quality of the goods at the initial stage. The bank's suit
against the sureties was decreed after adjusting the value of the goods lost.

securities and the power of sale for the surety unless and until the creditor is
paid in full and the surety, having paid the whole of the debt, is entitled to a
transfer of the mortgaged securities to procure recovery of the whole or part
of the sums he has paid to the creditor.
Waiver of rights
There are contradictory rulings on the point whether a surety can
give up the benefit of provisions designed to relieve him from liability.
The Karnataka High Court has been of the view that the rights under
Sections 133, 134, 135, 139 and 141 are of variable nature and, therefore, a
surety can waive the benefit of these provisions by a clause in the guarantee.
There is, however, a ruling to the effect that the operation of Section 133
relating to discharge by variance cannot be ousted. 271
A surety
RIGHTS OF SURETY
has certain rights against the debtor, creditor and co-sureties.
Rights against principal debtor
Following are the rights of the surety against the principal debtor:
1. Right of Subrogation [S. 140]
2. Right to Indemnity [S. 145]
1. Right of subrogation [S. 140]
Section 140 provides for the right of subrogation:
S. 140. Rights of surety on payment or performance.-Where a guaran-
teed debt has become due, or default of the principal debtor to perform a guar-
anteed duty has taken place, the surety, upon payment or performance of all
that he is liable for, is invested with all the rights which the creditor had against
the principal debtor.
When the surety has paid all that he is liable for he is invested with all the
rights which the creditor had against the principal debtor. The surety steps
into the shoes of the creditor. The creditor had the right to sue the principal
debtor. "If the liability of the surety is coextensive with that of the principal
debtor, his right is not less coextensive with that of the creditor after he
satisfies the creditor's debt.272 The surety may, therefore, sue the principal
debtor in the rights of the creditor. For example in Lamplugh Iron Ore Co,
re:273

658 Chapter 12 Guarantee
[S. 140]
A director of a company in liquidation guaranteed and paid the rents
due from the company before the date of the liquidation. It was held
that he was entitled to stand in the place of the creditor, and to use all
remedies; if need be, in the name of the creditor in any action to obtain
indemnification from the principal debtor for the loss sustained.
The Supreme Court has laid down that "the surety will be entitled to
every remedy which the creditor had against the principal debtor; to enforce
every security and all means of payment; to stand in the place of the creditor;
to have the securities transferred to him, though there was no stipulation for
that; and to avail himself of all those securities against the debtor. This right
of a surety stands not merely upon contract, but also upon natural justice.
The language of Section 140 which employs the words "is invested with
all the rights which the creditor had against the principal debtor" makes it
plain that even "without the necessity of a transfer, the law vests those rights
in the surety",234
This may not always be to the advantage of the surety. Where the princi-
pal debtor becomes insolvent, the surety cannot ask the creditor first to pur-
sue his remedy against the principal debtor. The Supreme Court has pointed
out that even then the surety should pay. He will be subrogated to the rights
of the creditor against the principal debtor, though such rights against an
insolvent debtor may not be of much use. "The very object of guarantee
is defeated if the creditor is asked to postpone his remedies against the
surety,"275
Rights before payment
Under the right of subrogation the surety may get certain rights even
before payment. The Calcutta High Court examined this possibility in a
case where the surety found, that the amount having become due, the prin-
cipal debtor was disposing of his personal properties one after the other lest
the surety, after paying, may seize them and sought a temporary injunction
to prevent the principal debtor from doing so. The court granted the injunc-
tion. Relying upon an authoritative work, SUKUMAR CHAKRAVARTY J said
that if in any suit it is proved by affidavit or otherwise that the defendant
threatens, or is about to remove or dispose of his property with intent to
defraud his creditors, the court may grant a temporary injunction to restrain
such act or to give such other order for the purpose of staying or preventing
the removal or disposition of the property.

to a very large extent, only the balance allowed to be recovered from the surety, for which he
was entitled to indemnity from the principal debtor.

[S. 145]
Rights of surety 659
Listing the other rights of the surety which arise in his favour before
payment, the court cited the following passage from STORY ON EQUITY:277
"Sureties, also, are entitled to come into a court of equity, after a debt has
become due, to compel the debtor to exonerate them from their liability by
paying the debt; or sue in the creditor's name, and collect the debt from
the principal, if he will indemnify the creditor against the risk, delay and
expense of the suit."
The court brought out from SNELL'S PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY a passage
which discusses the remedies of the surety under two heads, viz., before
payment and after payment: "It has been stated there that the surety has
an equitable right to compel the principal debtor to pay the debt and so
relieve the surety from the necessity of paying it out of his pocket. It is in
the nature of quia timet, and is based on the principle that it is unreasonable
that a man should always have a cloud hang over him, so that he ought to be
entitled to remove it. It is, therefore, immaterial that the creditor has refused
to sue or that he has made no demand. A fortiori, the action lies where the
principal debtor threatens to commit a breach of the obligations which the
surety has guaranteed and an order may be made even though the principal
debtor is without funds. But an action will not lie where the debt is not an
actual, accrued or definite debt or, if on its true construction, the guarantee
precludes action before the creditor demands payment."379
In a suit against the principal debtor and sureties for recovery of the
mortgage money the sureties paid the amount on passing of preliminary
decree. The court said that this amounted to payment during the pendency
of the suit. The court further said that, by operation of law, the suit became
assigned in their favour and they could continue it against the principal
debtor by virtue of the subrogation.280
2. Right to indemnity [S. 145]
S. 145. Implied promise to indemnify surety.-In every contract of guar-
antee there is an implied promise by the principal debtor to indemnify the
surety; and the surety is entitled to recover from the principal debtor whatever
sum he has rightfully paid under the guarantee, but no sums which he has paid
wrongfully.

278. (28th Edn by P.V. Baker and P. St. J. Langan) 467.
279. The court also cited a passage from CHITTY ON CONTRACTS (24th Edn) Vol 11, para 4855 to
the effect that there are certain potential and inchoate rights of surety before payment. See
at p. 283, AIR 1987 Cal. See Jagdish Chandra Sahani v Prakash Kaur, (1997) 2 MPLJ 320,
the rights under S. 140 are available only against the principal debtor and not co-sureties.
Against co-sureties there is only the right to contribution under Ss. 146 and 147.

doing so, but is compelled to pay the amount of the debt with costs. He can recover
from B the amount paid by him for costs, as well as the principal debt.
(b) Clends B a sum of money, and A, at the request of B, accepts a bill of exchange drawn
by B upon A to secure the amount. C, the holder of the bill, demands payment of it from
A, and, on A's refusal to pay, sues him upon the bill. A, not having reasonable grounds
for so doing, defends the suit, and has to pay the amount of the bill and costs. He can
recover from B the amount of the bill, but not the sum paid for costs, as there was no
real ground for defending the action.
(c) A guarantees to C, to the extent of 2000 rupees, payment for rice to be supplied by C to
B. C supplies to B rice to a less amount than 2000 rupees, but obtains from A payment
of the sum of 2000 rupees in respect of the rice supplied. A cannot recover from B more
than the price of the rice actually supplied.
Thus in every contract of guarantee there is an implied promise by the
principal debtor to indemnify the surety. The right enables the surety to
recover from the principal debtor whatever sum he has rightfully paid under
the guarantee, but not sums which he paid wrongfully. An example of
wrongful payment is a case where a surety had guaranteed the payment of
four motor vehicles delivered on hire-purchase. The surety contended that
he had paid Rs 4000 in discharge of his liability, but he failed to give an
account of the price which the motor vehicles might have realised on resale.
He was not allowed to recover his indemnity.282
Rights against creditor
The surety enjoys the following rights against the creditor:
1. Right to securities [S. 141]
2. Right to share reduction
3. Right of set off
1. Right to securities [S. 141]
S. 141. Surety's right to benefit of creditor's securities.-A surety is enti-
tled to the benefit of every security which the creditor has against the principal
debtor at the time when the contract of suretyship is entered into, whether the
surety knows of the existence of such security or not; and, if the creditor loses,
or, without the consent of the surety, parts, with such security, the surety is dis-
charged to the extent of the value of the security.

amount of the value of the furniture.
(b) C, a creditor, whose advance to B is secured by a decree, receives also a guarantee for
that advance from A. C afterwards takes B's goods in execution under the decree, and
then, without the knowledge of A, withdraws the execution. A is discharged.
(c) A, as surety for B, makes a bond jointly with B to C, to secure a loan from C to B. After-
wards, C obtains from B a further security for the same debt. Subsequently C gives up
the further security. A is not discharged.
The section recognises and incorporates the general rule of equity as
expounded in Craythorne v Swinburne that the surety is entitled to
every remedy which the creditor has against the principal debtor, including
enforcement of every security.284
On paying off the creditor the surety steps into his shoes and gets the
right to have the securities, if any, which the creditor has against the prin-
cipal debtor.285 The right exists irrespective of the fact whether the surety
knows of the existence of such security or not. "It is the duty of the creditor
to keep the securities intact; not to give them up or to burden with further
advances."286
The plaintiffs lent to B and P, who were traders, £300 for the payment
of which the defendant became surety. At the time of the loan B and P
assigned by deed as security for the debt, the lease of their business prem-
ises and plant, fixtures and things thereon. The plaintiff had the right to
sell on default by giving a month's notice. The default took place, but the
defendant did not enter into possession. He received notice of the debtors"
insolvency but allowed them to continue in possession. Consequently the
assets were seized and sold by the receiver. It was held that the plaintiffs,
by their omission to seize the property assigned on default, had deprived
themselves of the power to assign the security to the surety. He was,
therefore, discharged to the amount that the goods were worth.287

[S. 141]
Where certain bills of exchange were given by way of collateral security
and they being dishonoured, the creditor made them useless by not doing
anything within the period of limitation, the surety was discharged to the
extent of their value. 288
If the securities are burdened with further advances it will not affect the
rights of the surety. For example, in Forbes v Jackson:29
The principal debtor borrowed £200 on mortgaging his leasehold
premises and a policy of life insurance, the defendant joining as a surety.
The principal debtor borrowed further sums from the creditor on the
same securities, the surety knowing nothing about it. The principal debtor
failed to pay. The surety paid off £200 and interest and claimed both the
securities. The creditor demanded payment of the further advances also.
But it was held that the surety's right to the securities was not affected
by the further advances and, therefore, he was entitled to both the
securities.
According to English law, the surety has a right to securities which the
creditor in fact has against the principal debtor, whether the surety knew of
them or not and whether they were received before or after the guarantee.
"The expression 'security' in Section 141 is not used in any technical
sense; it includes all rights which the creditor had against the property at the
date of contract." This statement occurs in the judgment of SHAH J (after-
wards CJ) of the Supreme Court in State of M.P. v Kaluram. 290
The State sold a lot of felled timber to a person for a fixed price payable
in four equal instalments, the payment of which was guaranteed by the
defendant. The contract further provided that if a default was made in the
payment of an instalment, the State would get the right to prevent further
removal of the timber and to sell the remaining timber for the realisation
of the price. The buyer defaulted but even so the State allowed him to
remove the timber.
The surety was then sued for the loss. But he was held not liable. "The
State had a charge over the goods sold as well as to remain in possession till
payment of the instalments. When the goods were removed by the buyer that

Karnataka High Court held in Karnataka Bank Ltd v Gajanan Shankararao Kulkarni, AIR
1977 Kant 14 and again in R. Lilavati v Bank of Baroda, AIR 1987 Kant 2 that a mere pas-
sive activity or passive negligence on the part of the creditor by failing to realise the debt from
the collateral security is not sufficient in itself to discharge the surety. If this view is correct,
the effect would be that the creditor can passively permit the securities to be lost, but should
not do something active to destroy them. The court proceeded on the logic that the surety
can himself take steps to seize the security by paying out the creditor.

Rights of surety 663
security was lost and to the extent of the value of the security lost, the surety
stood discharged." The court also pointed out that it was immaterial that
the loss of securities was due to a mere inaction and not to a positive action.
The difference between the English law and the principle laid down in
Section 141 was explained by the Supreme Court in Amritlal Goverdhan
Lalan v State Bank of Travancore: 291 "It is true that Section 141 has limited
the surety's right to securities held by the creditor at the date of his becom-
ing surety and has modified the English rule that the surety is entitled to the
securities given to the creditor both before and after the contract of guaran-
tee. But subject to this variation, Section 141 incorporates the rule of English
law relating to discharge from liability of a surety when the creditor parts
with or loses the security held by him."
WHEN RIGHT TO SECURITIES ACCRUES.-When is the surety entitled to the
securities? Obviously, only on paying the debt. Difficulty, however, arises
when the surety has guaranteed only a part of the debt and consequently
even when he has paid all that he was liable for, the creditor's claim against
the principal debtor is not yet fully satisfied. The Bombay High Court con-
sidered the question in Goverdhandas Goculdas Tejpal v Bank of Bengal.25
292
Certain mortgages were given to a bank as security for debts amounting
to Rs 3,15,000. The plaintiff, who was a surety in part, paid Rs 1,25,000
and claimed that he was entitled to that extent to stand in the place of the
Bank and to receive a share of the proceeds of the said securities propor-
tioned to the sum which he had paid.
FARRAN J considered the English authorities and following them, said:
"A surety who has paid the debt, which he has guaranteed, has a right to
the securities held by the creditors, because as between the principal debtor
and surety the principal is under an obligation to indemnify the surety.
The equity between the creditor and the surety is that the creditor shall not
do anything to deprive the surety of that right. But the creditor's right to
hold his securities is paramount to the surety's claim upon such securities,
which only arises when the creditor's claim against such securities has been
satisfied."
The Madras High Court has differed not only from this opinion but also
from the fact whether this is the effect of the English decisions.293 The case
before it was Parvateneni Bhushayya v Potluri Suryanarayana.294
The Imperial Bank advanced three different loans to a person with
three different sureties for each loan. The principal debtor did not repay
the loans in time and, therefore, the bank obtained mortgage of his prop-
erty. Ultimately the bank had to file suits and three different decrees were

obtained against the principal debtor and the surety on each loan. The
first two sureties paid off the decrees for which they were sureties but the
third did not.
The question on these facts was whether the first two sureties who had
paid off their obligations were entitled to a proportionate share in the mort-
gage, while a part of the bank's claim against the principal was still unsat-
isfied. KRISHNASWAMI AYYANGER J held that they were so entitled. He said:
"Section 140... expressly says that the surety upon payment of all that he is
liable for is invested, that is, immediately invested, with all the rights which
the creditor had against the principal debtor. The condition laid down by
the section for this right to arise is the payment by the surety of all that
he is liable for, and not the payment of all that may be due to the creditor
who holds the securities. Where the guaranteed debt is fraction only of the
debt, the surety's right comes into existence immediately on payment of that
fraction, for that fraction is, so far as he is concerned, the whole."295 The
learned Judge then considered Indian and English authorities and came to
the conclusion that "the result of the discussion on a careful consideration
of the decided cases is that a surety for a part only of a debt is on payment
of that part entitled pro tanto to the security held by the creditor as a cover
for the debt as a whole" 29
Where the evidence did not disclose that the creditor had anything to
do with the loss of the hypothecated properties, the surety was not permit-
ted to claim any reduction of liability in that respect. The act of losing or
parting with a security has to be a voluntary act on the part of the creditor.
The loss has to be due to an act which is attributable to the creditor.297 The
decision of the Karnataka High Court298 was on the basis of a surety bond
which provided that the surety would not claim the benefit of Section 141.
The section does not carry the words "not withstanding anything con-
tained to the contrary, etc.", but even so the court held that by reason of the
provision in Section 128, which permits liability to be regulated by agree-
ment, a surety can waive the benefit of any of the provisions touching his
liability.299

their being lost by the creditor does not arise.300
2. Right to share reduction
This right may be illustrated by the case of Hobson v Bass:301
J gave a guarantee to B in the following words: "I hereby guarantee to
you the payment of all goods you may supply to E.H., but so as my liabil-
ity to you under this or any other guarantee shall not at any time exceed
the sum of £250." E gave a similar guarantee. B supplied goods to E.H.,
to the amount of £657. E.H. became bankrupt. B proved the whole sum
in the insolvency of E.H. and then called on the guarantors who paid him
£250 each. Subsequently B received from the receiver a sum of 2s, and,
1d... in the pound on £657. It was held that each of the guarantors was
entitled to a part of the dividend bearing to the whole the same propor-
tion as £250 to 657,302
3. Right of set-off
If the creditor sues the surety, the surety may have the benefit of the set-
off, if any, that the principal debtor had against the creditor. He is entitled
to use the defences of the debtor against the creditor. If, for example, the
creditor owes him something, or the creditor has in his hand something
belonging to the debtor for which the creditor could have counter-claimed,
the surety can also put up that counter-claim, 303
He can claim such a right not only against the creditor, but also against
third parties who have derived their title from the creditor. Thus where a
mercantile agent sold the goods of his principal and, being a surety for pay-
ment of the price to the principal, had to pay it, he was held to have become
entitled to the unpaid seller's lien against the buyer and those deriving title
from him, 304
Rights against co-sureties
Where a debt has been guaranteed by more than one person, they are
called co-sureties. Some of their rights against each other are:
1. Effect of releasing a surety;
2. Right to contribution.

1. Effect of releasing a surety (S. 138]
[Ss. 138, 146-147]
S. 138. Release of one co-surety does not discharge others.--- Where
there are co-sureties, a release by the creditor of one of them does not discharge
the others; neither does it free the surety so released from his responsibility to
the other sureties.
The creditor may at his will release any of the co-sureties from his liabil-
ity. But that will not operate as a discharge of his co-sureties. However, the
released co-surety will remain liable to the others for contribution in the
event of default. 305
2. Right to contribution [Ss. 146-147]
S. 146. Co-sureties liable to contribute equally.-Where two or more
persons are co-sureties for the same debt or duty, either jointly or severally, and
whether under the same or different contracts, and whether with or without the
knowledge of each other, the co-sureties, in the absence of any contract to the
contrary, are liable, as between themselves, to pay each an equal share of the
whole debt, or of that part of it which remains unpaid by the principal debtor.
Illustrations
(a) A, B and C as sureties to D, for the sum of 3000 rupees lent to E. E makes default in pay-
ment. A, B and C are liable, as between themselves, to pay 1000 rupees each.
(b) A, B and C are sureties to D for the sum of 1000 rupees lent to E, and there is a contract
between A, B and C that A is to be responsible to the extent of one-quarter, B to the
extent of one-quarter, and C to the extent of one-half. E makes default in payment. As
between the sureties, A is liable to pay 250 rupees, B 250 rupees and C 500 rupees.
S. 147. Liability of co-sureties bound in different sums.- Co-sureties
who are bound in different sums are liable to pay equally as far as the limits of
their respective obligations permit.
Illustrations
(a) A, B and C as sureties for D, enter into three several bonds each in a different penalty,
namely, A in the penalty of 10,000 rupees, B in that of 20,000 rupees, C in that of 40,000
rupees, conditioned for D's duly accounting to E. D makes default to the extent of
30,000 rupees. A, B and C are liable to pay 10,000 rupees.
(b) A, B and C, as sureties for D, enter into three several bonds, each in a different penalty,
namely, A in the penalty of 10,000 rupees, B in that of 20,000 rupees, C in that of 40,000
rupees conditioned for D's duly accounting to E. D makes default to the extent of 40,000
rupees. A is liable to pay 10,000 rupees, and B and C 15,000 rupees each.
(c) A, B and C, as sureties for D, enter into three several bonds, each in a different pen-
alty, namely, A in the penalty of 10,000 rupees, B in that of 20,000 rupees, C in that of
40,000 rupees, conditioned for D's duly accounting to E. D makes default to the extent
of 70,000 rupees. A, B and C have to pay each the full penalty of his bond.
Where there are several sureties for the same debt and the principal debtor
has committed a default, each surety is liable to contribute equally to the

extent of the default. 304 If one of them has been compelled to pay more than
his share, he can recover contribution from his co-sureties so as to equalise
the loss as between all of them.307 Thus, if there are three sureties and a
default of three thousand rupees has taken place, each surety must contrib-
ute one thousand rupees. The principle will apply whether their liability is
joint or several, under the same or different contracts, and whether with or
without the knowledge of each other.
The principle was applied by the English Court of Appeal even to a case
in which payment was made by one of the co-sureties even before there was
any formal demand by the creditor as required by the guarantee. The court
said that it was necessary for this purpose that the co-surety must not have
acted officiously or voluntarily. A demand is not a precondition for liability
under a guarantee. It is rather a procedural and evidentiary requirement.
It is there for the benefit of the surety alone. He could waive it. Where the
creditor is entitled to proceed against either co-surety without notifying the
other, such waiver by one co-surety would not deprive him of his entitlement
to contribution from the other who has not been specially disadvantaged.308
PETER GIBSON LJ summarised the law thus:309 "Let me start by setting out
certain uncontroversial principles applicable in this area of the law:
(1) Where more than one person guarantee to the creditor the payment of
the same debt, an equity arises such that if one of them pays more than his
due proportion of the debt, he is entitled to a contribution from his co-guar-
antor or co-guarantors.
(2) It is immaterial whether the co-guarantors are bound jointly or sever-
ally or jointly and severally, or by the same instrument or by separate instru-
ments, or in the same sum, or different sums, or at the same time or different
times, or whether the co-guarantor making payment knows of the existence
of the other co-guarantor or co-guarantors, as the right of contribution is
not dependent upon agreement, express or implied.
(3) Normally an action for contribution cannot be brought until payment
has been made by a co-guarantor of more than his share of the common
liability.
(4) In particular circumstances an action for contribution will lie even
before payment is made; thus when judgment has been entered by the credi-
tor against one guarantor, who has paid nothing in respect of the judgment,
he can maintain an action in equity against his co-guarantor and obtain
an order requiring payment of the co-guarantor's due share to the creditor
(if a party to the action) or (if the creditor is not a party) an order that the
co-guarantor indemnify the judgment-debtor, on payment of his own share,
against further liability."

668 Chapter 12 Guarantee
[S. 147]
These principles are all subject to any contractual terms which may limit
or extend the entitlement of an interested person.
Is the service of a demand in writing in accordance with the guarantee,
a precondition of liability under the guarantee? It would be surprising if an
evidentiary or procedural requirement of service of a written demand in the
guarantee was a precondition.
The only textbook which deals with the specific point is Andrews and
Millett, LAW OF GUARANTEES. 310 The editors say:311
"It is submitted that strictly speaking there is no restriction upon the
time at which a surety can apply for relief against his co-sureties, provided
that the account between the principal (debtor) and the creditor is closed
and there is an immediate liability due and payable under the guarantee
such that the amount of the contribution can be properly ascertained. It is
immaterial that the creditor has not yet demanded payment, or even that
the creditor is obliged under the terms of the guarantee to make a demand
before the surety is liable. It is enough that the creditor could enforce the
guarantee, either forthwith or after making a demand for more than the
surety's rateable share. This is certainly the case with quta times relief
against the principal debtor for an indemnity, and there is no reason why
the same should not apply against the co-surety for contribution."
The principle of equal contribution is subject to the maximum limit, if
any, fixed by a surety to his liability. This is so because Section 147 lays
down that "co-sureties who are bound in different sums are liable to pay
equally as far as the limits of their respective obligations permit". Suppose
that A, B and C are three sureties for a debt. A undertakes to be liable up
to Rs 200, B up to Rs 400 and C for Rs 600. The principal debtor makes a
default of Rs 600. Each surety must contribute Rs 200. But if the default is
of Rs 900, then according to the principle of equal contribution, each would
be liable for Rs 300; this being more than the limit of A's obligation, he can
be required to contribute only Rs 200. The remaining seven hundred will be
apportioned between B and C equally.
Indemnity and guarantee distinguished
Indemnity and guarantee have this common feature that both are devices
for providing protection against a probable loss. In either case the loss may
arise due to human conduct. However, the technique of providing protec-
tion, the need and occasion for protection and the number of parties involved
mark some differences between them. "Guarantees and indemnities, which
are also described as securities, are distinct arrangements under which a
third party, the surety, agrees to assume liability if the debtor defaults or

causes loss to the creditor. The former arrangement is a guarantee, the latter
involves an indemnity."312
1. The liability under a contract of indemnity is contingent in the sense
that it may or may not arise. Under a guarantee, on the other hand, the
liability is subsisting in the sense that once a guarantee has been acted upon,
the liability of the surety automatically arises, though it remains in sus-
pended animation till the principal debtor commits default.
2. The undertaking in a guarantee is collateral, in an indemnity it is orig-
inal. The purpose of a guarantee is to support the primary liability of a
third person. In an indemnity, there being no third person, the indemnifier's
liability is in itself "primary",314
3. In a contract of indemnity there are only two parties, namely, the
indemnifier and the indemnity-holder. But there are three parties to a guar-
antee, the creditor, the principal debtor and the surety. It is a tripartite
arrangement.
4. In an indemnity there is only one contract, that is, the contract of indem-
nity against loss between the indemnity-holder and the indemnifier. But in
a guarantee there are three contracts, namely, a contract of loan between
the principal debtor and the creditor; a contract of guarantee between the
creditor and the surety and finally an implied contract of indemnity between
the principal debtor and the surety.

Bailment
Bailment implies a sort of relationship in which the personal property
of one person temporarily goes into the possession of another. The owner-
ship of the articles or goods is in one person and the possession in another.
The circumstances in which this happens are numerous. Delivering a cycle,
watch or any other article for repair, or leaving a cycle or car, etc., at a
stand, depositing luggage or books in a cloakroom, delivering gold to a gold-
smith for making ornaments, delivering garments to a dry-cleaner, deliver-
ing goods for carriage, warehousing or storage and so forth, are all familiar
situations which create the relationship of bailment. Thus bailment is a sub-
ject of considerable public importance."
DEFINITION
"Bailment" is defined in Section 148 of the Indian Contract Act in the
following words:
S. 148. "Bailment", "bailor" and "bailee" defined.-A "bailment" is the
delivery of goods by one person to another for some purpose, upon a contract
that they shall, when the purpose is accomplished, be returned or otherwise
disposed of according to the directions of the person delivering them. The per-
son delivering the goods is called the "bailor". The person to whom they are
delivered is called the "bailee".
Explanation.-If a person already in possession of the goods of another con-
tracts to hold them as a bailee, he thereby becomes the bailee, and the owner
becomes the bailor of such goods, although they may not have been delivered
by way of bailment.
ESSENTIAL FEATURES
The following essential features of "bailment" are emphasised by this
definition.
1. Delivery of possession
The first important characteristic of bailment is "the delivery of posses-
sion" by one person to another. "Delivery of possession" for this purpose
1. See, for example, C.V. Davidge, Bailment, (1925) 41 LQR 433.
2. New India Assurance Co Ltd v DDA, (1991) 2 PLR (Del) 82, the essence of bailment is
possession. Delivery of truck to the parking centre, receipt issued for charges, safe keeping

672 Chapter 13 Bailment
CASE PILOT
[S. 148]
should be distinguished from a mere "custody". "One who has custody
without possession, like a servant, or a guest using his host's goods is not
a bailee. The goods must be handed over to the bailee for whatever is the
purpose of bailment. Once this is done, a bailment arises, irrespective of the
manner in which this happens.
An old customer went into a restaurant for the purpose of dining there.
When he entered the room a waiter took his coat, without being asked,
and hung it on a hook behind him. When the customer rose to leave the
coat was gone.4
What the waiter did might be no more than an act of voluntary courtesy
towards the customer, yet the restaurant-keeper was held liable as a bailee.
The waiter by taking the coat into his possession had relieved the plaintiff
of its care and had thus assumed the responsibility of a bailee. It was he who
selected the place where the coat should be put.
If the customer had instructed the servant where and how the coat should
be put, the result, perhaps, would have been otherwise. To take, for instance,
a decision of the Madras High Court."
A lady handed over to a goldsmith certain jewels for the purpose of
being melted and utilized for making new jewels. Every evening as soon
as the goldsmith's work for the day was over, the lady used to receive
half-made jewels from the goldsmith and put them into a box in the gold-
smith's room and keep the key in her possession. The jewels were lost one
night.
But the lady's action against the goldsmith failed, the court saying: "Any
bailment that could be gathered from the facts must be taken to have come
to an end as soon as the plaintiff was put in possession of the melted gold.
Delivery is necessary to constitute bailment. The mere leaving of box in a
room in the defendant's house, when the plaintiff herself took away the key,
cannot certainly amount to delivery within the meaning of the provision in
Section 149."
Bank locker
On the same principle, the hiring of a bank's locker and storing things in
it would not constitute a bailment. Things kept there are in a way put in a
hired portion of the premises and not entrusted to the bank. The court also
found that there was no proof of the fact that at the time when bank locker
was robbed the customer had some items of jewellery in the locker. The
for 24 hours. The owner of the centre could not return the vehicle nor he gave any plausible
explanation for its absence, held liable for the loss.

court further said that it could not be inferred without proof that the strong
room and lockers were not built according to specifications. The customer
was not allowed to claim any damages. The court said that in order to con-
stitute bailment within the meaning of Section 148 it is necessary to show
that actual and exclusive possession of the property was given by the hirer
of the locker to the bank. It is only then that the question of reasonable care
and damages would arise. As it was, it was impossible to know the quantity,
quality or the value of the jewellery that was there in the locker. It is also not
a relationship of landlord and tenant. The locker-holder has no direct access
to his locker, nor he can operate it of his own. He can do so only with the
assistance of the bank.
Actual or constructive delivery
Section 149 explains the meaning of delivery of possession.
S. 149. Delivery to bailee how made.-The delivery to the bailee may be
made by doing anything which has the effect of putting the goods in the pos-
session of the intended bailee or of any person authorised to hold them on his
behalf.
An explanation to Section 148 provides that "if a person already in pos-
session of the goods of another contracts to hold them as a bailee, he thereby
becomes the bailee and the owner becomes the bailor although they may not
have been delivered by way of bailment".
Delivery of possession is thus of two kinds, namely:
(1) actual delivery, and
(2) constructive delivery.
When the bailor hands over to the bailee physical possession of the goods,
that is called "actual delivery". "Constructive delivery" takes place when
there is no change of physical possession, goods remaining where they are,
but something is done which has the effect of putting them in the possession
of the bailee. For example, delivery of a railway receipt amounts to delivery
of the goods. Similarly, where a person pledged the projector machinery of
his cinema under an agreement which allowed him to retain the machinery
for the use of the cinema, the Andhra Pradesh High Court' observed:
"It must be held that there was a constructive delivery, or delivery by
attornment to the bank. Since then there was a change in the legal char-
acter of the possession of goods, though not in the actual and physical

custody. Even though the bailor continued to remain in possession, it was
the possession of the bailee."10
Another illustration of constructive delivery is Fazal v Salamat Rai."
The defendant was holding the plaintiff's mare under the execution of
a decree. The plaintiff satisfied the decree and the court ordered redeliv-
ery of the mare to the plaintiff. The defendant, however, refused to do so
unless his maintenance charges were also paid. The mare was stolen from
his custody.
Holding him liable, the court said that after the delivery order had been
passed, the relation of bailor and bailee was established by virtue of the
Explanation to Section 148.
In a case before the Supreme Court the owner of a car involved in an
accident delivered it under the policy on behalf of the insurer to the nearest
garage for repairs. This delivery was regarded as sufficient to constitute the
insurance company as a bailee and the garage as a sub-bailee. They became
responsible for the loss of the car in a fire on the premises.12
2. Delivery should be upon contract
Delivery of goods should be made for some purpose and upon a contract
that when the purpose is accomplished the goods shall be returned to the
bailor. When a person's goods go into the possession of another without
any contract, there is no bailment within the meaning of its definition in
Section 148. A well-known illustration is the decision of the Allahabad High
Court in Ram Gulam v Govt of U.P.13
The plaintiff's ornaments, having been stolen, were recovered by the
police and, while in police custody, were stolen again. The plaintiff's
action against the State for the loss was dismissed.
SETH J said: "...the obligation of a bailee is a contractual obligation and
springs only from the contract of bailment. It cannot arise independently
of a contract. In this case the ornaments were not made over to the
Government under any contract whatsoever.... The Government, therefore,
never occupied the position of bailee and is not liable as such to indemnify
the plaintiffs."14

Non-contractual bailments
Essential features 675
English law recognises bailment without contract. In the words of
Cheshire and Fifoot: "At the present day, no doubt, in most instances where
goods are lent or hired or deposited for safe custody, or as security for a
debt, the delivery will be the result of a contract. But this ingredient, though
usual, is not essential."15
The Bombay High Court in its decision in Lasalgaon Merchants Coop
Bank Ltd v Prabhudas Hathibhai has taken the lead in imposing the obliga-
tion of a bailee without a contract. In the opinion of the court, as expressed
through NAIK J, where certain goods belonging to an individual are seized
by the Government the latter becomes the bailee thereof even if there is no
suggestion of a contract between the Government and the individual. The
facts stated briefly were as follows:
Certain packages of tobacco lying in the godown of a partnership firm
were pledged to the plaintiff bank. Some of the partners, having failed to
clear their income tax dues, the Income Tax Officer ordered seizure of the
goods. The officials of the Collectorate accordingly locked the godown
and handed over the key to the police.. Then came heavy rains. The roof
of the godown leaked and the tobacco was damaged.
The court said: "Heavy rains do not (necessarily) amount to an act of
God. It was the duty of Government officers to take such care as every pru-
dent manager would take of his own goods. The Government stood in the
position of bailees and it was for them to prove that they had taken as much
care as was (reasonably) possible for them and that the damage was due to
reasons beyond their control."17
This view was accepted by the Supreme Court in State of Gujarat v
Memon Mahomed Haji Hasan.18
Certain motor vehicles and other goods belonging to the plaintiffs were
seized by the State in exercise of its powers under a Sea Customs Act. The
goods while in the custody of the State remained totally uncared for.
It was contended on behalf of the State that as the State were not bailees,
there was no obligation to take care. Referring to this SHELAT J observed as
follows: "That contention is not sustainable. Bailment is dealt with by the

Nor is consent indispensible for such a relationship' to arise. A finder of
goods of another has been held to be a bailee in certain circumstances."
The court also cited the following passage from Pollock and Wright:20
"Bailment is a relationship sui generis and unless it is sought to increase or
diminish the burdens imposed upon the bailee by the very act of bailment,
it is not necessary to incorporate it into the law of contract and to prove a
consideration."21
The trend set by these cases has been affirmed by the Supreme Court
though without reference to them.22 The facts involved a repetition of the
Ram Gulam23 story, namely, theft, recovery of the ornaments by the police
and their final disappearance from police custody. The State was held liable
to pay the value of the ornaments to the victim of the theft.
When the Port Trust is required to store imported goods, the relationship
of bailor and bailee comes into existence. Under Section 42(6) of the Major
Port Trusts Act, 1963, the Port Trust of a Major Port would be regarded
as the bailee of the goods coming into its possession. The provisions of
Sections 151, 152 and 161 of the Contract Act become applicable (duty of
care and duty to return). 24
Contract, express or implied
The contract may be express or implied. Thus, where with the consent
of the station-master goods were stored on a railway company's platform,
wagons being not available, the company was held liable when they were
damaged by fire caused by a spark emitted by a passing engine.25
3. Delivery should be upon some purpose
Bailment of goods is always made for some purpose and is subject to the
condition that when the purpose is accomplished the goods will be returned
to the bailor or disposed of according to his mandate.26 If the person to
whom the goods are delivered is not bound to restore them to the person

Essential features 677
delivering them or to deal with them according to his directions, their rela-
tionship will not be that of bailor and bailee.
The plaintiff delivered to the Treasury Officer at Meerut nine
Government promissory notes for cancellation and consolidation into a
single note of Rs 48,000. The defendant's servants misappropriated the
notes. The plaintiff sued the State to hold them responsible as bailees.27
But his action failed. There can be no bailment unless there is a delivery
of goods and a promise to return. The Government was not bound to return
the same notes, nor was it bound to dispose of the surrendered notes in
accordance with the plaintiff's directions.
Bailment compared with other similar relations
It is this feature of bailment which distinguishes it from many other trans-
actions of the same kind. A deposit of money with a banker is not a bailment
as he is not bound to return the same notes and coins. 28 Accordingly, a bank
was not allowed to exercise the right of lien as a bailee on money held under
a fixed deposit. An agent who has collected money on his principal's behalf
is not a bailee of the money for the same reason. 30 In the words of SHETTY
J of the Supreme Court:" "One important distinguishing feature between
agency and bailment is that the bailee does not represent the bailor. He
merely exercises, with the leave of the bailor (under contract or otherwise),
certain power of the bailor in respect of his property. Secondly, the bailee
has no power to make contracts on bailor's behalf, nor can he make the
bailor liable, simply as bailee, for any acts he does."32 Applying this princi-
ple to the position of a banker who was holding the goods on behalf of its
account-holder for the purpose of delivering them to his customers against
payment, the court held that the bank was not thereby constituted into an
agent and remained a bailee only.
A bailment is also distinguishable from sale, exchange or barter. In these
transactions what is transferred is not mere possession, but also ownership
and, therefore, the person buying is under no obligation to return. In a sale
of beer bottles, one of the terms was that the price of the bottles would be
refunded on the buyer returning the bottles. The transaction was held to be
a sale of the bottles and not a bailment." But hire-purchase contract is a

bailment, though of course, not merely a bailment. It has two aspects, bail-
ment plus an element of sale. 34
Post office, bailee
Post Office is a bailee of the articles of the sender. 35
DUTY OF BAILOR
According to Section 150 which deals with the duty of bailor, bailors are
of two kinds, namely:
(1) gratuitous bailor, and
(2) bailor for reward.
A person who lends his articles or goods without any charge, is called a
"gratuitous bailor". His duty is naturally much less than that of a bailor for
hire or consideration.
Duty of gratuitous bailor
Speaking of the duty of a gratuitous bailor, Section 150 says:
S. 150. Bailor's duty to disclose faults in goods bailed.-The bailor is
bound to disclose to the bailee faults in the goods bailed, of which the bailor is
aware, and which materially interfere with the use of them, or expose the bailee
to extraordinary risks; and if he does not make such disclosure, he is responsible
for damage arising to the bailee directly from such faults.
If the goods are bailed for hire, the bailor is responsible for such damage,
whether he was or was not aware of the existence of such faults in the goods
bailed.
Illustrations
(a) A lends a horse, which he knows to be vicious, to B. He does not disclose the fact that
the horse is vicious. The horse runs away. B is thrown and injured. A is responsible to B
for damage sustained.
(b) A hires a carriage of B. The carriage is unsafe, though B is not aware of it, and A is injured.
B is responsible to A for the injury.
A person, for example, who lends his cycle or horse to a friend, and if
he knows that the cycle is without brakes or that the horse is unsound, he
should disclose this fact and his duty ends there. "Would it not be monstrous
on return of tins. The court held that the tins would be deemed to be sold on the expiry of the
time for return.

Duty of bailor 679
to hold that if the owner of a horse, knowing it to be vicious and unmanage
able, should lend it to one who is ignorant of its bad qualities and conceal
them from him, and the rider, using ordinary care and skill, is thrown from
it and injured, he should not be responsible? By the necessarily implied pur-
pose of the loan a duty is contracted towards the borrower not to conceal
from him those defects known to the lender which may make the loan peril-
ous or unprofitable to him."36 The conditions of his liability are:
(1) He should have knowledge of the defect and the bailee should not be
aware, 37
(2) The defect in the goods must be such as exposes the bailee to extraordi-
nary risks or materially interferes in the use of the goods.
Duty of bailor for reward
The duty of a bailor for consideration is much greater. He is making
profit from his profession and, therefore, it is his duty to see that the goods
which he delivers are reasonably safe for the purpose of the bailment. It is
no defence for him to say that he was not aware of the defect. Section 150
clearly says that "if the goods are bailed for hire, the bailor is responsible for
such damage, whether he was or was not aware of such faults in the goods
bailed". He has to examine the goods and remove such defects as reasonable
examination would have disclosed. In Hyman & Wife v Nye & Sons:"
The plaintiff hired from the defendant for a specific journey a carriage,
a pair of horses and a driver. During the journey a bolt in the underpart
of the carriage broke, the splinter bar became displaced, the carriage was
upset and the plaintiff injured.
Holding the defendant liable LINDLEY J said: "A person who lets out
carriages is not responsible for all defects discoverable or not; he is not an
insurer against all defects. But he is an insurer against all the defects which
care and skill can guard against. His duty is to supply a carriage as fit for
the purpose for which it is hired as care and skill can render it." Similarly
in Reed v Dean:39
The plaintiffs hired a motor launch from the defendant for a holiday
on the river Thames. The launch caught fire, and the plaintiffs were una-
ble to extinguish it, the fire-fighting equipment being out of order. They
were injured and suffered loss.
The court held that there was an implied undertaking that the launch
was as fit for the purpose for which it was hired as reasonable care and skill
could make it. The defendant was accordingly held liable.

[S. 151]
Where a bailor delivers goods to another for carriage or for some other
purpose, and if the goods are of dangerous nature, the fact should be dis-
closed to the bailee,40
DUTIES OF BAILEE
The following are the duties of every bailee:
1. Duty of reasonable care [Ss. 151-152]
Section 151 lays down this duty in the following terms:
S. 151. Care to be taken by bailee.-In all cases of bailment the bailee is
bound to take as much care of the goods bailed to him as a man of ordinary pru-
dence would, under similar circumstances take, of his own goods of the same
bulk, quality and value as the goods bailed.
Uniform standard of care
The section lays down a uniform standard of care for "all cases of bail-
ment". Originally in English law "liability in bailment was absolute. It
was no excuse for the bailee to say that the damage or failure to return was
due to no fault of his own; he was liable in any case". Thus, where goods
were delivered to a bailee for safe custody and he was robbed of them, the
court held him liable, saying, "it is a delivery which chargeth him to keep
at his peril". The first concession was given to a gratuitous bailee. It was
laid down in R. v Viscount Hertford" that "if money be given to one to
keep generally without consideration and if the person be robbed, he is dis-
charged". Lord HOLT in Coggs v Bernards further reduced the scope of
absolute liability by confining it only to bailees "who exercised a public
calling", namely, public carriers and innkeepers." Subsequently still by a
judgment of Lord MANSFIELD absolute liability was confined to carriers
only. The rest of the bailees owe only the duty of reasonable care.48

1917 PC 173.
41. Thus even a gratuitous or involuntary bailee is bound to bring into his duty the same amount
of care as is prescribed by the section. Wilson v Brett, (1843) 11 M&W 113.

46. About innkeepers (hotels, lodges and guest-houses) the general trend of decisions is that they
are bailees liable only if the requisite standard of care is not observed. See Rampal Singh v
Murray & Co, ILR (1897-1900) 22 All 164; before the Contract Act there were some deci-
sions to the contrary effect. See Whateley v Palanji, (1866) 3 BHC (OC) 137. But now the

[S. 151]
Duties of bailee 681
For the purpose of duty of care modern English law divides bailees into
two kinds only, namely, gratuitous bailee and bailee for reward. A gratu-
itous bailee is liable for loss of, or damage to, goods only if he is guilty of
gross negligence. "There is a certain degree of negligence to which everyone
attaches great blame", and that may be called "gross negligence"." But the
modern trend is towards a simple principle of liability for negligence in all
cases. Blount v War Office" shows this trend.
50
A house belonging to the plaintiff was requisitioned by the War Office.
The plaintiff was allowed to store certain articles in a strong-room in the
house, which he locked. Of the troops stationed there, who were not kept
under proper control, some broke into the room and stole a quantity of
silver plates.
The War Office was held liable. The court said: "There was a voluntary.
bailment of the goods to the defendants in the way of deposit and the stand-
ard of care required of them was reasonable care which a man would take
of his own property. It is hard to believe that any reasonable man, who had
valuable property of his own stored in those circumstances, would leave
it to the tender mercies of seventy or eighty displaced persons of that type
without taking any precaution. The Ministry was negligent."
This trend has been further confirmed by the Court of Appeal in
Houghland v R.R. Low (Luxury Coaches) Ltd.52
The plaintiff was a passenger in one of the defendant's coaches. She
had her suitcase put in the boot of the coach from where it was lost. The
trial Judge found that this was technically a gratuitous bailment.
Even so it was held that the standard of care was that of reasonable
care and was the same whether the bailment was gratuitous or for reward.
ORMEROD LJ said: "The question that we have to consider in a case of this
kind, if it is necessary to consider negligence, is whether in the circumstances
of this particular case a sufficient standard of care has been observed by the
defendants or their servants."
The standard of care expected of a paid bailee has been expressed in
almost similar terms. This appears from Martin v London County Council.53
18 Cal 620 (PC); S. 93 of the Railways Act, 1989 charges the Railways with the responsibility
of an insurer subject only to some defences and variations permitted by the Act. Carriers by
Sea and Air are under similar responsibility. See, for further details, Avtar Singh, LAW OF

The plaintiff was brought to a paid hospital as a patient. On her entry,
the hospital officials took charge of two pieces of jewellery and a gold
cigarette-case. They were subsequently stolen by a thief who broke into
the room in which they were kept.
It was held that the defendants were bailees for reward and were liable
for the loss as they had failed to exercise care which the nature and quality
of the articles required.
In India, however, Section 151 prescribes a uniform standard of care in
all cases of bailment, that is, a degree of care which a man of ordinary
prudence would take of his own goods of the same type and under similar
circumstances. If the care devoted by the bailee falls below this standard, he
will be liable for loss of or damage to the goods:
S. 152. Bailee when not liable for loss, etc, of thing bailed.-The bailee,
in the absence of any special contract, is not responsible for the loss, destruc-
tion or deterioration of the thing bailed, if he has taken the amount of care of it
described in Section 151.
"No cast-iron standard can be laid down for the measure of care due
from a bailee and the nature and amount of care must vary with the posture
of each case."54 Nature, quality and bulk of the goods bailed, the purpose
of bailment, facilities reasonably available for safe custody and the like, will
be taken into account for determining whether proper care has been taken.
Thus, where a part of the foodgrains stored at a bailee's godown were dam-
aged by floods unprecedented in the history of the place; where a man
hired a wooden shop and it was burnt by mobs during communal riots in
the city, 56 the bailee in each case was held not liable as the loss was due to
events beyond his control. Where on account of partition of the country a
bank had to flee along with mass exodus from Pakistan to India, the bank
was held to be not liable for goods bailed to it in Pakistan and which were
thus lost there. 57
Loss by theft
Where the bailor's goods are stolen from the custody of the bailee, he will
be liable if there has been negligence on his part. Where the plaintiff stayed
at a hotel and his articles were stolen while he was away, the hotelier was
held liable as the room was, to his knowledge, in an insecure condition. 58
Similarly, in another case, a bailee kept the bailor's ornaments locked in a

safe and kept the key in a cash-box in the same room. The room was situ-
ated on the ground floor and, being locked from outside, was easily acces-
sible to burglars by removing the latch. The ornaments having been stolen,
the bailee was held liable." Where a banker was rendering the service of
receiving goods on behalf of its account-holder and to hold them for the pur-
pose of delivering them to the customers of the account-holder against pay-
ment, it was held by the Supreme Court that the position of the banker was
that of the bailee and he was liable for the account-holder's loss inasmuch
as the banker did not deliver goods to the customers from whom payment
had been received. The court said:60 "The banker-bailee, gratuitous or for
reward, is bound to take the same care of the property entrusted to him as
a reasonably prudent person and careful man may fairly be expected to take
of his own property of the like description. In fact, a paid bailee must use the
greatest possible care and is expected to employ all precautions in respect
of the goods deposited with him. If the property is not delivered to the true
owner, the banker cannot avoid his liability in conversion."
Applying these principles the court held that "the bank could not avoid
the liability to return the goods as agreed upon or to pay an equivalent
amount to the plaintiff. Even if we assume that the goods were delivered to
a wrong person, the bank had to own up the liability to the plaintiff. The
liability of banker to a customer in such a case is absolute even if no neg-
ligence is proved". In HALSBURY'S LAWS OF ENGLAND it is stated: "Where
the bank delivers the goods to the wrong person, whereby they are lost to
the owner, the liability of the bank is absolute, though there is no element
of negligence, as where delivery is obtained by means of an artfully forged
order. In law the banker could contract out of this liability, but he would be
unlikely to do so in practice.")
Burden of proof
The burden of proof is on the bailee to show that he was exercising rea-
sonable care and if he can prove this he will not be liable. If the bailee places
before the court evidence to show that he had taken reasonable care to avoid
damage which was reasonably foreseeable or had taken all reasonable pre-
cautions to obviate risks which were reasonably apprehended, he would be
absolved of his liability. Thus, where the railway administration was not

able to explain how the barge carrying the plaintiff's goods sank and was
lost, negligence was presumed making the railway liable. 63 Where a jewel-
lery box with declared contents was handed over to a bank under the clause
which provided, "The articles in safe custody will be kept in the strong-
room under joint custody of the manager or an officer duly authorised by
the Head Office and the cashier", it was held that the bank was liable to
account for the missing articles of jewellery and became liable because it
failed to give any sufficient explanation for the loss. The depositor having
died the recovery was sought by legal heirs through open delivery in court."
Where the bank took over possession of the hypothecated truck because of
the borrower's default in repayment and neither disposed it of in accordance
with the terms of the agreement nor took proper care of it leaving it in an
open place, the extent to which the truck suffered loss of value because of
the passage of time, the loan amount had to be reduced to that extent. 65
Where the plaintiff's car was lost in a fire occurring in a garage where it was
delivered for repairs and the bailees did not lead any evidence to show as
to how the incident took place, the Supreme Court held the bailees liable.6
Where the goods were removed by the carrier's driver and attendant, it was
held that the onus was on the carriers, as bailee, to prove that the loss was
not caused by any fault of his or his agents. In the case before the court the
carrier had failed to discharge the onus of proof and as such the court found

Duties of bailee 685
as a fact that the carrier was negligent in appointing a particular driver in
the circumstances.67 As against it, where certain engraving plates were gra-
tuitously left with a bailee and they were lost and though he was not able
to account for the manner of loss, he proved that the plates were kept in a
proper place under the care of proper persons and in a proper arrangement.
He was accordingly held not liable.
Loss due to act of bailee's servant
Where the loss has been due to the act of the bailee's servant, he would be
liable if the servant's act is within the scope of his employment. Explaining
the principle in Cheshire v Bailey" COLLINS MR said: "The bailee is bound
to bring reasonable care to the execution of every part of the duty accepted.
He may perform that duty by servant or personally, and if he employs serv-
ants he is as much responsible for all acts done by them within the scope of
their employment."
Thus in, Sanderson v Collins:70
The defendant sent his carriage to the plaintiff for repairs and the latter
lent his own carriage to the defendant while the repairs were going on.
The defendant's coachman, without his knowledge, took away the car-
riage for his own purpose and damaged it.
The defendant was held not liable as the coachman at the time when
the injury was done to the carriage was not acting within the course of his
employment. "If a burglar broke into the coach house and took away the
carriage and caused damage to it and brought it back, no liability would
attach to the bailee. The act of the servant was not different."71
Where, on the other hand, the bailee's driver left the vehicle in which he
was carrying the plaintiff's goods unattended and half the goods were sto-
len, the bailee was held liable. The court also rejected the argument that the
bailee had contracted with a forwarding agent and not with the plaintiffs,
as the bailee knew that the goods belonged to the plaintiff." The same result
followed where the goods were stolen by the driver and attendant of the
carrier's motor lorry.73
When the goods have been stolen from the bailee's custody, he should
take reasonable steps to recover them.

686 Chapter 13 Bailment
[S. 152]
A farmer accepted certain cattle for adjustment. Some of them were
stolen without his default, but he made no efforts whether by informing
the owner or the police to recover them.74
He was held liable. He should have used reasonable diligence to recover.
them and he could discharge himself only by showing that such diligence
would have been unavailing.
Bailee's own goods lost with those of bailor
Where the bailee's own goods are lost along with those of the bailor, the
bailee would naturally contend that he was taking as much care of the bail-
or's goods as he did of his own." But this would not be the deciding factor.
The fact that the bailee is generally negligent with his own goods is no jus-
tification for his negligence towards the bailor's goods, unless the bailor is
aware of his habits and, therefore, knew what to expect. Even in such cases
the proper inquiry is whether reasonable care has been taken. Thus, where at
general merchant going to consign his parcel for export, took, out of volun-
tary courtesy, his friend's parcel for similar consignment and entered both
the parcels under a wrong heading, and, consequently, both were seized and
lost. He was held not liable as he had in good faith taken equal care of both
the parcels."
Misdelivery by Railway
Goods were delivered to an unauthorised person on production of an
indemnity bond which turned out to be bogus. Railway administration was
not able to show what was the date of arrival of goods and of termination
of transit for the purpose of showing that neither the consignor nor the con-
signee had claimed the goods within a week of their arrival. Thus there was
nothing to exonerate the railway administration of its liability.78
Goods carried at owner's risk
The goods carried by a road carrier were insured and were also being
carried at "owner's risk". They were damaged by rash and negligent driving
causing accident. It was held that "owner's risk" cannot protect a carrier
from the consequences of his own negligence or negligence of his agents.

[S. 152]
Duties of bailee 687
"Owner's risk" cannot be regarded as a licence or liberty clause from the
duty of reasonable care."
Involuntary bailee
"A person who has come into possession of a chattel through no act of
his own and without his consent" is called an involuntary bailee. An early
illustration is to be found in the facts of Howard v Harris:80
The author of a play, without being asked, sent his manuscript to a
theatre operator, who lost it.
The court held "that no duty of any kind was cast on the defendant by
receipt of something he had not asked for". Subsequent decisions, how-
ever, do not support this view of the situation. And this is amply shown by
Newman v Bourne & Hollingsworth."1
The plaintiff went to the defendant's shop to buy a coat. She was wear-
ing a coat fastened with a diamond brooch, and she took the coat off, and
put it on a glass case with the brooch by the side of it. When leaving she
forgot the brooch and it was handed by an assistant to the shopwalker
who put it in his desk, from where it was lost.
The defendant was held liable. "He had not exercised that degree of care
which was due from one who had found an article and had assumed posses-
sion of it. The degree of negligence must be measured by the apparent value
of the article."
But if an involuntary bailee, without negligence, does something which
results in the loss of the property, he will not be liable for conversion. This
has been laid down in Elvin & Powell Ltd v Plummer Raddis Ltd.82
A man came to the plaintiff's warehouse, and ordered to buy £350
worth of coats. He said he wanted them to be sent to the Brighton Branch
of P&E Ltd, which was done. Subsequently he sent a telegram to P&E
saying: "Goods sent to your branch by error. Sending van to collect." The
defendants, believing in good faith in the error theory, allowed him to
have the goods.
The plaintiff's action against them for conversion failed.
Contract to the contrary
It is still debatable whether a bailee can contract himself out of the duty
prescribed by Section 151, or whether a contract of bailment can exempt
the bailee from his liability for negligence? The argument is built chiefly on
79. Sirmour Truck Operators Union v National Insurance Co Ltd, AIR 2011 NOC 389 (HP).

688 Chapter 13 Bailment
[S. 152]
the ground that Section 152 opens with the remark: "in the absence of any
special contract". This may show that the legislative intent was to permit
him to reduce the scope of his liability. Judicial thinking on this line is in
evidence in a Punjab and Haryana decision. The court said that the words
"in the absence of special contract" as used in Section 152 show that a bailee
can contract himself out of the obligation under Section 151. The court cited.
the following observation from a Bombay decision: "This court in Bombay
Steam Navigation Co Ltd v Vasudev Baburao Kamat held that it was open
to a bailee to contract himself out of the obligation imposed by Section 151.
The Act does not expressly prohibit contracting out of Section 151 and it
could be a startling thing to say that persons sui juris are not at liberty to
enter into such a contract of bailment as they may think fit. Contracts of
bailment are very common although they are not always called by their
technical name. There is no reason why a man should not be at liberty to
agree to keep property belonging to a friend on the terms that such property
is to be entirely at the risk of the consumer and that the man who keeps it
is to be under no liability for the negligence of his servants in failing to look
after it."
It is submitted with respect that this seems to be an unnatural reading
of the two sections. Section 151 prescribes the minimum standard of care.
expected of a bailee and Section 152 has the effect of saying that unless the
standard of care is enhanced by special contract, the bailee will be liable
only when he fails to observe the requirement of Section 151. The words
in Section 152 "in the absence of any special contract" would permit the
standard of duty to be revised upwards and not to be diluted. Apart from
this, it has always been held that it is unfair and unreasonable for any person
to say that he would not be liable for negligence. No one can get a licence
to be negligent. Thus in a Gujarat case bales of cloth were lost from bank
custody under circumstances showing negligence. The banker was held lia-
ble irrespective of a clause which absolved him of all liability." The clause
in question was that the bank will be absolved from all liability for shortage
of goods by way of pilferage, stealth or removal from the godown in any
manner. Even this could not protect the bank because it was against the
meaning and intent of the minimum standard prescribed by Section 151.
The Kerala High Court also adopted this line of reasoning. The court held:
"Where the goods are entrusted with the Port Trust, their duty is certainly

[S. 152]
Duties of bailee 689
in the nature of a bailee's duty and they are expected to take reasonable
care. [They] cannot claim a total exemption from the standard of care to be
taken by a bailee by taking recourse to the provision contained in Section
121 of the Major Ports Trust Act, 1963 (protection from liability for acts
done in good faith). A Division Bench of this court had occasion to consider
in Cochin Port Trust v Associated Cotton Traders Ltd the nature of the
duty of the Cochin Port Trust towards the owner of the goods. In this case
also the goods were destroyed in a fire which broke out in the godown of
the Port Trust. The court held that the Port Trust which is in the position of
a bailee has a duty to take all proper measures for protection of the goods.
When goods entrusted to a bailee are lost or damaged, there is initial pre-
sumption of negligence (failure to take care) on the part of the bailee. Onus
of proof is on the bailee to show that he had taken necessary precautions
and care required under law. The bailee alone will be in a position to explain
the cause of fire. It is a fact specially within his knowledge and, therefore,
under Section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872, the burden of proving that fact
will be upon him."88
Delivery of goods to Railways for purpose of carriage is under a special
contract because, in addition to it being an ordinary contract of bailment,
the provisions of the Railways Act89 also apply. The Bombay High Court
faced a problem on this point in a case 90 involving consignment of certain
bales of cloth to be carried in brake van and on arrival at the destination one
of the bales being tampered with resulting in short delivery to the extent of
33 kg. The Railways escaped liability because the value of the goods was not
declared as required by the relevant section of the Railways Act."
As ordinary bailees Railways too are bound by the duty imposed by
Section 151. The Railways were held liable where, instead of keeping the
goods in their own godown, they left them at the jetty of a port and they
were destroyed by fire.92 Liability came to railways when the goods they'
were carrying in a wagon were damaged due to percolation of rain water
into the wagon.93
A contract of bailment provided that the bailee would not be liable for
loss or damage due to causes beyond his control. It was held that this would

not include shortage in the weight of the goods." The court said that the
words "any other cause whatsoever" would also not cover shortage of which
no cause is shown. The bank officers were negligent in taking count and
weight of the handles and cotton strips. Such irresponsibility could not be
described as a cause. The word "cause" had to be interpreted as other causes
akin to those mentioned in the clause.
2. Duty not to make unauthorised use [S. 154]
S.154. Liability of bailee making unauthorised use of goods bailed.-If
the bailee makes any use of the goods bailed which is not according to the con-
ditions of the bailment, he is liable to make compensation to the bailor for any
damage arising to the goods from or during such use of them.
Illustrations
(a) Alends a horse to B for his own riding only. B allows C, a member of his family, to ride the
horse, C rides with care, but the horse accidentally falls and is injured. B is liable to make
compensation to A for the injury done to the horse.
(b) A hires a horse in Calcutta from B expressly to march to Benares. A rides with due care,
but marches to Cuttack instead. The horse accidentally falls and is injured. A is liable to
make compensation to B for the injury to the horse.
Goods must be used by the bailee strictly for the purpose for which they
have been bailed to him. Any unauthorised use of the goods would make the
bailee absolutely liable for any loss of or damage to the goods. Even an act
of God or inevitable accident would be no defence. A horse lent for riding
should not be used for any other purpose and if it is used outside the scope
of the bailment, the bailee would be liable for any damage to the horse how-
soever happening. Apart from this, the bailor may terminate the contract at
once and insist on the goods being returned to him. This is so provided in
Section 153.
Where a vehicle was delivered to a workshop for repair and the owner of
the workshop allowed an unlicensed employee to drive the vehicle and he
caused an accident resulting in the death of a person, it was held that the
bailee was liable to compensate the deceased as also the owner of the vehicle
because it was an unauthorised use of the vehicle and the liability was abso-
lute. The insurer was also liable to pay compensation to the deceased and
recover indemnity from the vehicle owner."
S. 153. Termination of bailment by bailee's act inconsistent with con-
ditions.-A contract of bailment is avoidable at the option of the bailor, if the
bailee does any act with regard to the goods bailed, inconsistent with the con-
ditions of the bailment.
Illustration
A lets to B, for hire, a horse for his own riding. B drives the horse in his carriage. This is, at
the option of A, a termination of the bailment.

Duties of bailee 691
[Ss. 155-157, 160]
3. Duty not to mix [Ss. 155-157]
The bailee should maintain the separate identity of the bailor's goods.
He should not mix his own goods with those of the bailor and without his
consent. If the goods are mixed with the consent of the bailor, both will
have a proportionate interest in the mixture thus produced. [S. 155] If the
mixture is made without bailor's consent, and if the goods can be separated,
or divided, the bailee is bound to bear the expenses of separation as well as
any damage arising from the mixture. [S. 156] But if the mixture is beyond
separation, the bailee must compensate the bailor for his loss. Sections 155
to 157 run as follows:
S. 155. Effect of mixture, with bailor's consent, of his goods with bail-
ee's.-If the bailee, with the consent of the bailor, mixes the goods of the bailor
with his own goods, the bailor and the bailee shall have an interest, in propor-
tion to their respective shares, in the mixture thus produced.
S. 156. Effect of mixture, without bailor's consent when the goods
can be separated.-If the bailee, without the consent of the bailor, mixes the
goods of the bailor with his own goods, and the goods can be separated or
divided, the property in the goods remains in the parties respectively, but the
bailee is bound to bear the expense of separation or division, and any damage
arising from the mixture.
Illustration
A bails 100 bales of cotton marked with a particular mark to B. B without A's consent,
mixes the 100 bales with other bales of his own, bearing a different mark; A is entitled to
have his 100 bales returned, and B is bound to bear all the expenses incurred in the separa-
tion of the bales, and any other incidental damage.
S. 157. Effect of mixture, without bailor's consent, when the goods can-
not be separated.-If the bailee, without the consent of the bailor, mixes the
goods of the bailor with his own goods, in such a manner that it is impossible
to separate the goods bailed from the other goods, and deliver them back, the
bailor is entitled to be compensated by the bailee for the loss of the goods.
Illustration
A bails a barrel of Cape flour worth Rs 45 to B. B, without A's consent, mixes the flour with
country flour of his own, worth only Rs 25 a barrel. B must compensate A for the loss of his
flour.
4. Duty to return [Ss. 160-161]
Section 160 provides for the duty to return.
S. 160. Return of goods bailed, on expiration of time or accomplish-
ment of purpose. It is the duty of the bailee to return, or deliver according to
the bailor's directions, the goods bailed, without demand, as soon as the time
for which they were bailed has expired, or the purpose for which they were
bailed has been accomplished.

692 Chapter 13 Bailment
CASE PILOT
[S. 161]
S. 161. Bailee's responsibility when goods are not duly returned.--If,
by the default of the bailee, the goods are not returned, delivered or tendered
at the proper time, he is responsible to the bailor for any loss, destruction or
deterioration of the goods from that time.
When the purpose of bailment is accomplished or the time for which the
goods were bailed has expired, the bailee should return the goods to the
bailor without demand." If he fails to do so, he will keep the goods at his
risk and will be responsible for any loss of or damage to the goods arising
howsoever. For example, in Shaw & Co v Symmons & Sons:97
The plaintiff entrusted books to the defendant, a bookbinder, to be
bound, the latter promising to return them within a reasonable time. The
plaintiff having required the defendant to deliver the whole of the books
then bound, the defendant failed to deliver them within a reasonable time
and they were subsequently burnt in an accidental fire on his premises.
The defendant was held liable in damages for the loss of the books. When
the loss takes place while the bailee's wrongful act is in operation, there is
no question of any defence like "act of God" or "inevitable accident" being
set up. He is liable in any case."
98
Similarly, where a pawnee refused to return the goods even after the ten-
der of the debt by the pawner, and the goods, having been subsequently
stolen, he was held liable."
Termination of gratuitous bailment
Where the lending of the goods is gratuitous, the bailor may at any time
require return of the goods even though he lent them for a specified time
or purpose. But if the bailee has acted on the faith of the loan made for a
specified time or purpose in such manner that if the goods are demanded
back before the agreed time, the bailee's loss would be greater than the ben-
efits derived, the bailor must, if he compels the return, indemnify the bailee
96. He can be sued for detinue. Dhian Singh Sobha Singh v Union of India, AIR 1958 SC 274:

Duties of bailee 693
for the amount in which the loss occasioned exceeds the benefits derived.
Section 159 is as follows:
S. 159. Restoration of goods lent gratuitously.-The lender of a thing for
use may at any time require its return, if the loan was gratuitous, even though
he lent it for a specified time or purpose. But, if, on the faith of such loan made
for a specified time or purpose, the borrower has acted in such a manner that
the return of the thing lent before the time agreed upon would cause him loss
exceeding the benefit actually derived by him from the loan, the lender must, if
he compels the return, indemnify the borrower for the amount in which the loss
so occasioned exceeds the benefit so derived.
A gratuitous bailment is also terminated by the death either of the bailor
or of the bailee. Section 162 is as follows:
S. 162. Termination of gratuitous bailment by death.-A gratuitous
bailment is terminated by the death either of the bailor or of the bailee.
Bailment by joint owners [S. 165]
S. 165. Bailment by several joint owners.-If several joint owners of
goods bail them the bailee may deliver them back to, or according to the direc-
tions of, one joint owner without the consent of all, in the absence of any agree-
ment to the contrary.
5. Duty not to set up "jus tertii"
A bailee is not entitled to set up, as against the bailor's demand, the
defence of jus tertii, that is to say, that the goods belong to a third person.100
The bailee is estopped from denying the right of the bailor to bail the goods
and to receive them back. Where the goods were returned to the ware-
house keeper who had pledged them without the authority of the owner and
the pledgee did not know this fact, the pledgee was held to be not liable to
the true owner.102 Even if there is a person who has a better title to the goods
than that of the bailor or who claims ownership of the goods, the bailee may
safely return the goods to the bailor and he will not be liable to the owner
for conversion.
S. 166. Bailee not responsible on re-delivery to bailor without title.-If
the bailor has no title to the goods, and the bailee, in good faith, delivers them
back to, or according to the directions of the bailor, the bailee is not responsible
to the owner in respect of such delivery.
100. This is called the estoppel of bailee. He can return the goods to the person bailing them even
against the demands of the true owner unless he is under legal pressure. Rogers Sons & Co
v Lambert & Co, (1891) 1 QB 318, 325 (CA).
101. S. 117 of the Indian Evidence Act (Act 1 of 1872). Where the goods have been seized by the
Government, liability under this section does not arise. Juggilal Kamlapat Oil Mills v Union
of India, (1976) 1 SCC 893: AIR 1976 SC 227.

[S. 167]
But the person who claims the ownership may apply to the court to pre-
vent the bailee from returning the goods to the bailor and to have the ques-
tion of title decided.103
S. 167. Right of third person claiming goods bailed.-If a person, other
than the bailor, claims goods bailed, he may apply to the Court to stop the deliv-
ery of the goods to the bailor, and to decide the title to the goods.
Further, if the bailee has already delivered the goods to the person having
a better title, and yet the bailor sues him, he may prove that such person had
a better right to receive the goods as against the bailor.104 In a case before
the Supreme Court:105
Oil was consigned with the Railways from Kanpur to Calcutta. It
reached Calcutta intact. The sender, however, instructed the Railways
to bring it back to Kanpur. Before the formalities for the same could be
complied with, the oil was seized by a food inspector, who found it adul-
terated and had it destroyed under the order of the High Court.
Holding the Railways not liable, the court said that a bailee is excused
from returning the subject-matter of the bailment to the bailor where it was
taken away from him by an authority of law.
Where goods have been bailed by several joint owners, the bailee may
deliver them back to one joint owner without the consent of all, in the
absence of any agreement to the contrary. [S. 165]
Transfer of shipping documents
Where the bill of lading, under which delivery of the cargo was effected
to the carrier, was transferred by the shipper, it was held that the right to file
a suit under the contract of carriage became transferred to the bank when
it became the holder of the bill of lading under a transfer by the shipper.
Even if the transfer was by the principal to its agent, the principal could not
claim the right to sue. But even so the original contract of bailment would
continue to exist subject only to the rights created under the transfer and
subject also to the terms and conditions of the bill of lading. To that extent
the original shipper could sue the carriers for their failure to deliver goods
to the party entitled to them at the destination.106
6. Duty to return increase [S. 163]
In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the bailee is bound to
return to the bailor natural increases or profits accruing to the goods during

the period of bailment. This is so provided in Section 163, which is as
follows:
S. 163. Bailor entitled to increase or profit from goods bailed.-In the
absence of any contract to the contrary, the bailee is bound to deliver to the
bailor, or according to his directions, any increase or profit which may have
accrued from the goods bailed.
Illustration
A leaves a cow in the custody of B to be taken care of. The cow has a calf. B is bound to
deliver the calf as well as the cow to A.
Where shares and securities were pledged with a bank and the bank
received bonus shares and dividends and interest in respect thereof, it was
held that the bank could not be compelled to handover such increment unless
the pledged securities were redeemed.108
FINDER [SS. 168-169]
S. 168. Right of finder of goods: May sue for specific reward
offered. The finder of goods has no right to sue the owner for compensation
for trouble and expense voluntarily incurred by him to preserve the goods and
to find out the owner; but he may retain the goods against the owner until he
receives such compensation; and where the owner has offered a specific reward
for the return of goods lost, the finder may sue for such reward, and may retain
the goods until he receives it.
S. 169. When finder of thing commonly on sale may sell it.-When a
thing which is commonly the subject of sale is lost, if the owner cannot with
reasonable diligence be found, or if he refuses, upon demand, to pay the lawful
charges of the finder, the finder may sell it-
(1) when the thing is in danger of perishing or of losing the greater part of
its value, or
(2) when the lawful charges of the finder, in respect of the thing found,
amount to two-thirds of its value.
Finders are bailees
A finder of goods is a bailee thereof and as such bound by the duty of
reasonable care.109 He does not have the right to sue the owner for compen-
sation for trouble and expense voluntarily incurred by him to preserve the
goods and to find out the owner. [S. 168] Early English cases disallowed not
only any compensation, but also right to lien for expenses. Thus where:
A finder fed a dog for 20 weeks and claimed 20s. for the same.110
107. Where, for example, bonus shares are allotted in respect of the shares during the period of
their pledge, the increment has to be returned on redemption of the pledge. Motilal Hirabhai

[S. 164 & 158]
The court said he would be guilty of trover if he refused to deliver unless
paid for his keeping. Similarly, in another case:
A quantity of timber, placed in a dock on the bank of a navigable river,
being accidentally loosened, was carried by the tide to a considerable dis-
tance. The defendant, finding it in that situation, voluntarily conveyed it
to a place of safety.
He was held not entitled to lien on the timber for the trouble or expense,
but was liable in trover for refusing to deliver.
Finder's rights
Sections 168 and 169, however, protect the interest of a finder in two
ways. Section 168 allows the finder to retain the goods against the owner
until he receives compensation for trouble and expense. Further, where the
owner has offered a specific reward for the return of the goods lost, the
finder may sue for such reward, and may retain the goods until he receives it.
Section 169 allows the finder to sell the goods in certain circumstances.
Where the thing found is commonly the subject of sale and if the owner
cannot be found with reasonable diligence, or if he refuses to pay the lawful.
charges of the finder, the finder may sell the goods in the following cases:
(1) when the thing is in danger of perishing or of losing greater part of its
value, or
(2) when the lawful charges of the finder, in respect of the thing found,
amount to two-thirds of its value.
RIGHTS OF BAILEE
1. Right to compensation [S. 164]
S. 164. Bailor's responsibility to bailee.-The bailor is responsible to the
bailee for any loss which the bailee may sustain by reason that the bailor was
not entitled to make the bailment, or to receive back the goods, or to give direc-
tions respecting them.
If the bailor has no right to bail the goods, or to receive them back or to
give directions respecting them and consequently the bailee is exposed to
some loss, the bailor is responsible for the same.
2. Right to expenses or remuneration [S. 158]
S. 158. Repayment by bailor of necessary expenses.--Where, by the
conditions of the bailment, the goods are to be kept or to be carried, or to have
work done upon them by the bailee for the bailor, and the bailee is to receive
no remuneration, the bailor shall repay to the bailee the necessary expenses
incurred by him for the purpose of the bailment.
111. Nicholson v Chapman, (1793) 2 Hy Bl 254.

[S. 158]
Rights of bailee 697
A bailee is entitled to recover his agreed charges. But where there is no
such agreement at all, Section 158 comes into play. The section says that
where the bailee is required by the terms of bailment to keep or carry the
goods or to do some work upon them for the benefit of the bailor, and the
contract provides for no reward, the bailee has a right to ask the bailor for
payment of necessary expenses incurred by him for the purpose of the bail-
ment. The American law is also the same.
Where the bailment is gratuitous and the bailee is in no way benefited,
the bailor has to bear the expenses, if any, of the bailee for keeping the
chattel. It is akin to the lien of a warehouseman for claiming charges for
the preservation of the goods.112
The Calcutta High Court has laid down that this right is not linked
with the right of lien. Lien can be exercised only as long as possession is
retained whereas the right to charges remains alive even when possession
has been parted with. In this case the State Trading Corporation had hired
the plaintiff's storage tank for storing its oil. On account of a dispute, the
STC appointed a special officer who took charge of the tank and delivered
its contents to others as directed. The plaintiff thus lost possession of the
oil and with it his lien, but his right to charges for protection and storage of
the oil survived. The court said that the bailor had enjoyed the benefit of the
bailee's services, 113
Where the bailment is for the benefit of the bailee, there, in reference to
expenses, the following two propositions apply:
If in using the thing, the borrower is put to any expense, this must be
borne by himself. Thus, for example, if a horse is lent to a friend for a jour-
ney, he must bear expenses of his food during that journey, and to getting
him shod, if he should chance to require it, for it is a burden which is natu-
rally attendant upon the use of the horse.
"The borrower is compellable to bear the ordinary expenses; for the loan
being for his benefit he must be presumed to engage to bear the burden as
an incident to the use."114
3. Right of lien [Ss. 170-171]
If the bailee's lawful charges are not paid he may retain the goods. The
right to retain any property until the charges due in respect of the property
are paid, is called the right of lien. The Supreme Courts cited the following

[S. 170]
passage from HALSBURY'S LAWS OF ENGLAND 116 as to the nature of this
right:
"Lien is in its primary sense a right in one man to retain that which
is in his possession belonging to another until certain demands of the
person in possession are satisfied. In this primary sense it is given by law
and not by contract."
Liens are of two kinds, namely: (1) particular lien, and (2) general lien.
Particular lien [S. 170]
As a general rule a bailee is entitled only to particular lien, which means
the right to retain only that particular property in respect of which the
charge is due. This right is provided for in Section 170 of the Act.
S. 170. Bailee's particular lien.-Where the bailee has, in accordance with
the purpose of the bailment, rendered any service involving the exercise of
labour or skill in respect of the goods bailed, he has, in the absence of a contract
to the contrary, a right to retain such goods until he receives due remuneration
for the services he has rendered in respect of them.
Illustrations
(a) A delivers a rough diamond to B, a jeweller, to be cut and polished, which is accordingly
done. B is entitled to retain the stone till he is paid for the services he has rendered.
(b) A gives cloth to B, a tailor, to make into a coat. B promises A to deliver the coat as soon
as it is finished, and to give a three months' credit for the price. B is not entitled to retain
the coat until he is paid.
Exercise of labour or skill
Thus the right is available subject to certain important conditions. The
foremost among them is that the bailee must have rendered some service
involving the exercise of labour or skill in respect of the goods bailed.117
Further, it has been frequently pointed out that the labour or skill exercised
by the bailee must be such as improves the goods. "There is no authority
for the proposition that if what the contractor does is not to improve the
article, but merely to maintain it in its former condition, he gets a lien for
the amount spent upon it for that maintenance. A job master has no lien at
all for the amount of his bill in respect of feeding and keeping a horse at his
stable, whereas a trainer does get a lien upon a horse for the improvements
which he effects to the horse."118
for any superior claim. He has to be paid first. Where goods were taken away from bailee
under court order, his lien survived and applied to the sale proceeds of the goods for his
payment.
116. Vol 20 (2nd Edn) 552, para 695.
117. It was observed by BEST CJ in Bevan v Waters, (1828) 3 C & P 520 that if a man has an
article delivered to him, on the improvement of which he has to bestow trouble and expense,
he has a right to detain it until his demand is paid.

[S. 170]
https://t.me/LawCollegeNotes_Stuffs
Rights of bailee 699
Similarly, it has been observed in another case that "where a bailee has
expended his labour and skill in the improvement of a chattel delivered to
him, he has lien for his charge in that respect. Thus, the artificer to whom
the goods are delivered for the purpose of being worked up into form, or the
farrier by whose skill the animal is cured of a disease, or the horse-breaker
by whose skill he is rendered manageable, have liens on the chattels in
respect of their charges",119 In Hutton v Car Maintenance Co:120
The owner of a motor car gave it to a company to maintain it for three
years on a fixed annual payment. An amount having become due for
maintenance charges, the company claimed lien on the car.
It was held that inasmuch as what the company did was not to improve
the car, but only to maintain it in its former condition, the company had no
lien on the car. Similarly, where a bailee claimed lien for storage of sugar,
it was held that such custody, not being a service involving the exercise of
labour or skill within the meaning of Section 170, the bailee was not enti-
tled to lien. On the same reasoning, a person to whom cattle are given for
grazing does not have the right of lien on them for his charges.122
In accordance with contract
Secondly, the labour or skill must have been exercised in accordance with.
the purpose of the bailment and the terms of the contract."
Goods on which labour or skill bestowed
Thirdly, only such goods can be retained on which the bailee has
bestowed trouble and expense. He cannot retain any other goods belonging
to the bailor which are in his custody,124 It is this element of "particular lien"
which distinguishes it from "general lien".
POSSESSORY RIGHT.-Lastly, the right depends on possession and is lost
as soon as possession of the goods is lost. In a case before the Nagpur High
Court:125
The plaintiff purchased an old refrigerator, the vendor agreeing to
repair it for a fixed charge. When the repair was over and the condition of
the machine was found satisfactory, it was delivered to the plaintiff but a
part of the repair money was still unpaid. The machine broke down again
and the vendor carried its engine and another part for further repairs and

CASE PILOT

700 Chapter 13 Bailment
[S. 171]
claimed lien on these parts until the outstanding charges of repair were
paid.
The court held that delivery of possession after repairs are effected puts
an end to the lien which the repairer has for the charges of repairs and
cannot be revived because the repairer undertakes further repairs merely
out of grace and not as a matter of fresh contract. The court cited Lord
ELLENBOROUGH as saying:26 "... the defendant, after the repairs were com-
pleted, relinquished his possession, and could not afterwards detain for the
amount of the repairs."
Thus, "lien is a possessory right which continues only so long as the pos-
sessor holds the goods",127
The right of lien may also be defeated or excluded by an agreement to the
contrary. By an agreement to that effect, a particular lien may be converted
into a general lien. For, Section 171 says in the end that no other persons
have the right to general lien unless there is an express contract to that
effect. The right of lien also became affected when the carrier was directed
to deliver the goods to the consignor Warehousing Corporation because they
were in the danger of perishing. The order required the furnishing of a bank
guarantee.128
General lien [S. 171]
The right of "general lien", as provided for in Section 171, means the
right to hold the goods bailed as security for a general balance of account.
The right of particular lien entitles a bailee to detain only that particular
property in respect of which charges are due. But general lien entitled the
bailee to detain any goods bailed to him for any amount due to him whether
in respect of those goods or any other goods. If, for example, two securities
are given to a banker but a loan has been taken only against one of them, the
banker may detain both securities until his dues are paid. Where a quantity
of imported meat was stored with a warehouse keeper who by a general term
of the trade had a general lien, it was held that he could retain the meat for
his charges due in respect of other goods.129
S. 171. General lien of bankers, factors, wharfingers, attorneys and pol-
icy brokers. Bankers, factors, wharfingers, attorneys of a High Court and pol-

Rights of bailee 701
for a general balance of account, any goods bailed to them; but no other per-
sons have a right to retain, as a security for such balance, goods bailed to them,
unless there is an express contract to that effect.
Parties entitled to general lien
The right of general lien is a privilege and is specially conferred by
Section 171 on certain kinds of bailees only. They are: (1) Bankers, (2) Factors,
(3) Wharfingers, (4) Attorneys of a High Court, and (5) Policy-brokers.
1. Bankers
"The general lien of bankers, as judicially recognised and dealt with in
Section 171, attaches to all goods and securities deposited with them as
bankers by a customer or by a third person on a customer's account, pro-
vided there is no contract, express or implied, inconsistent with such lien."130
The Supreme Court cited the following passage from CHALMERS ON BILLS
OF EXCHANGE¹³ as to the concept of banker's lien: "A banker's lien on nego-
tiable securities has been judicially defined as an 'implied pledge'. A banker
has, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, a lien on all bills received
from a customer in the ordinary course of banking business in respect of any
balance that may be due from such customer."
The court also cited the following passage from CHITTY ON CONTRACTS:133
"By mercantile custom the banker has a general lien over all forms of com-
mercial paper deposited by or on behalf of a customer in the ordinary course
of banking business. The custom does not extend to valuables lodged for the
purpose of safe custody and may in any event be displaced by an express
agreement or circumstances which show an implied agreement inconsistent
with the lien.
...The lien is applicable to negotiable instruments which are remitted to
a banker from the customer for the purpose of collection. When collection
has been made the proceeds may be used by the banker in reduction of the
customer's debt balance unless otherwise earmarked."134
Acting on these authorities the court came to the conclusion that fixed
deposit receipts deposited by way of security for cash-credit facility were
usable as security against the customer's other debts also.135

133. (26th Edn) 389, para 3032
134. The court also cited similar passages from Paget's LAW OF BANKING (8th Edn) 408.
135. See also J&K Bank Ltd v Abdul Samad Chaloo, AIR 2008 J&K 1, the lending bank can
recover from any partner of the firm and can also look to general lien as a protection against
loss on the loan. Deposits or securities have been held to be species of goods over which lien
can be exercised.

702 Chapter 13 Bailment
[S. 171]
Certain gold ornaments were pledged with a bank for raising a loan. The
borrower paid back the loan. The bank retained the security because of
another loan subsequently taken by the borrower. The bank was held to be
entitled to do so till the satisfaction of the other loan also.136
It is necessary that the goods should have been given to the banker as a
bailee, because the lien extends only to goods which have been bailed to
the banker. 137 "And there is a distinction between bailment and deposit. It
has been held, that money paid into a bank to be credited into the cur-
rent account of the person making the payment does not constitute a bail-
Following these authorities, it has been held that Section 171 does
not apply to cases of deposit of money in a bank. The bank cannot claim lien
on such money. 140 The court said: "Section 171 of the Contract Act in terms
does not apply to cases of deposit of money. In such cases, the relationship
of bailor and bailee is not established within the meaning of Section 148.
Money deposited with a bank does not maintain its identity unless set apart
or earmarked for some special purpose. Since the relationship of creditor and
debtor is established, the money in customers' accounts legitimately belongs
to the bank. The bank has the right of ownership over the money. The bank
cannot claim lien on money which belongs to it. Therefore, the application
of Section 171 should be properly confined to cases where the papers, secu-
rities and other goods of the debtor are lying with the bank under bailment.
Similarly, where goods are deposited for safe custody or some other special
purpose, they will not be under the spell of general lien as the acceptance
of the goods for a special purpose impliedly excludes general lien." Thus
where securities were given to a bank to get them exchanged for fresh bills,

Things deposited with him in his character as a banker are within the spell. Allahabad Bank
v MECON, Doranda, AIR 2005 Jhar 54, bank promised to issue bank guarantee on deposit
of 10 per cent of the guarantee amount which was paid and guarantee issued. Subsequently,
the bank exercised lien on the party's fixed deposit for payment of guarantee commission.
The court did not allow it. The only requirement was that of deposit. There was no talk of
guarantee commission.

the banker could not exercise lien on the new securities which, as Lord
CAMPBELL said, "were delivered to them for a special purpose inconsistent
with the existence of the lien claimed". The securities were brought to
the bank by a customer but they belonged to another person. The customer
instructed the bank to have them renewed and to transfer the interest to
his personal account. On the interest so credited the bank was allowed to
exercise lien.
Another illustration of a deposit for a special purpose is the case of
Mercantile Bank of India Ltd v Rochaldas Gidumal & Co. 343
A customer gave his banker a sum of money for transmission by tel-
egraphic transfer to his own firm at another place. The bank purported to
hold the money for their balance of account against the firm.
The first question raised was whether "money" would be covered by the
words "goods bailed" as used in Section 171. The word "goods" is not
defined in the Indian Contract Act. The Indian Sale of Goods Act defines
"goods" as excluding money. Thus the matter was open and following
English authorities it was held that "money is a species of goods which may
be the subject-matter of bailment and over which lien may be exercised",144
But the court held that money given for telegraphic transfer is given for a
special purpose inconsistent with the exercise of the right of lien. "It would
be most unbusiness like and unreasonable for a banker to expect that a
remitter who is in urgent need of money at the place of payment would agree
to transmit money through the banker if he is told or has reason to believe
that the money is likely to be withheld in the exercise of this alleged lien."145
Where a customer has two accounts, a deposit account and a loan
account, the banker may in the exercise of its lien, transfer the money in
the deposit account to the loan account without any specific instructions
of the depositor to that effect. The Karnataka High Court has held that

[S. 171]
the right would extend to the fixed deposits of the customer including those
of his/her spouse. The bank was entitled to adjust the amounts towards the
loan account. The court relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in
Syndicate Bank v Vijay Kumar,148 which was to the effect that the banker's
lien could be exercised in respect of a joint account also49 and also fixed
deposits. "The banker's lien is not prejudiced by any defect in the title of the
customer or equities of third parties, provided the banker acts honestly and
without notice of any defect of title."150 Thus where a banker knows that the
securities deposited by a customer belong to some other person he cannot
hold them in the exercise of his lien against the customer." But where two
firms have separate accounts in a bank and agree to give the bank a general
lien over all monies of the two firms, the bank may hold the money in one
account against a loan on the other account. This has been so held by the
Punjab High Court in Firm Jai Kishan Das Jinda Ram v Central Bank of
India Ltd.152
One of the above two firms gave a sum of money to the bank to remit
the same to a sugar mill. The mill refused to accept the amount when
offered. The amount thus came back to the bank and it claimed lien on it
for a balance due against the other firm.
The court held that the specific object for which the money was given
having failed, the money was no longer bound by any incident of trust and,
therefore, the bank had a good lien in the terms of the firms' agreement.

Nath Mahanta v United Bank of India, AIR 2002 Gau 1, it was held that a fixed deposit
is basically a loan in the hands of the bank. It has no connection with a loan in a different
account. An amount in another account could not be adjusted against the claim in any suit.

has no legal justification to withhold payments from the customer's saving bank account.

Rights of bailee 705
Where an equitable mortgage is created by deposit of title deeds for a
particular loan, whether the same can be withheld for a subsequent debt is a
question to be answered on facts. The Karnataka High Court held that they
would not be the subject-matter of a general lien unless there was intention
on the part of the depositor to that effect.153
The property mortgaged by the customer for the loan in question was
attached and sold in execution of a decree. The purchaser paid back the
loan and asked for return of the title deeds. The bank sought to retain the
deeds as against another loan for which the customer was a surety. The
purchaser paid the surety money also under protest, got the title deeds
released, and then sued the bank for refund of the surety money as having
been paid under coercion.
He was allowed refund. The bank was not entitled to general lien. Its
withholding was wrongful and wrongful withholding of property is coer-
cion.154 The deeds were deposited to secure one particular loan and no more.
The court cited Lord KINDERSLEY remark that conveyance of land was not
subject to general lien.155 The court also cited a remark from PAGET'S LAW
OF BANKING 156 to the effect that "it must be assumed that the general lien
extends only to the customer's own securities".
Similarly, where a person obtained a loan on a pledge of gold ornaments
to the lending bank and subsequently became a guarantor for another per-
son's loan, he was allowed to claim his ornaments on paying off his personal
loan though the loan of another person guaranteed by him still subsisted.157
The principle of general lien does not extend to a loan taken by the customer
from another branch of the bank.158 A guarantor was allowed to take back
his securities from the bank when the bank guarantee in respect of which

they were deposited came to an end. The bank was not allowed to retain
them for the loan of another company in which also the guarantor was a
director.159
A bank provided financial assistance to a sugar factory against pledge of
its entire stock of sugar stored in its seven godowns as security. Subsequently,
the stock was seized under statutory provisions for payment of other claims.

of the stock of sugar in two godowns ordered by the court to be sold by
public auction,160
Pre-deposit for entertaining appeal under the SARFAESI Act
Under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, 2002 a pre-deposit of money is
required for entertaining an appeal. Such deposit has been held to be not a
deposit with the lender bank. The bank had no lien on such deposit. After
disposal of appeal the pre-deposit has to be refunded to the borrower unless
already appropriated by the bank with the consent of the depositor or any
attachment in any proceedings under Section 13 or Rules.161
2. Factors
The word "factor" in India, as in England, means an agent entrusted with
possession of goods for the purpose of selling them for his principal.162 He
is given the possession of the goods in the ordinary course of his business
for the purpose of sale. He has a general lien on the goods of his principal
for his balance of account against the principal. Thus where a motor car
was delivered to an agent for sale, he was held entitled to retain the car until
his charges were paid.163 It is necessary for the lien to arise that the goods
should have been delivered to the factor in the course of business and in his
capacity as a "factor".
A factor who used to have various dealings with his principal was
instructed by the principal to effect a policy of insurance on a ship. The
principal sent the premium and the policy remained in the possession of
the agent, who claimed lien for the money which was owing to him in his
capacity as a factor.
His claim was not allowed, as the policy of insurance had not come to his
possession in his capacity as a factor. 164

Rights of bailee 707
A factor, like a banker, will not have the right of lien on such goods as
have come to his possession for a specific purpose which impliedly excludes
the right to lien.16
3. Wharfingers
"Wharf means a place contiguous to water, used for the purpose of load-
ing and unloading goods, and over which the goods pass in loading and
unloading. It is essential to a wharf that goods should be in transit over it.
The primary idea is that, it is a place used, not for storing goods, but in the
process of their transit to or from water."166 Wharfinger "is he that owns or
keeps a wharf, or hath the oversight or the management of it".167 A wharf-
inger has general lien on the goods bailed to him until his wharfage, which
means, charges due for the use of his wharf, are paid.
"The fact that a manufacturer has a wharf upon which he receives goods
brought to him by customers, does not entitle him to claim lien as a wharfin-
ger upon such goods."168 He is not a wharfinger in the real sense of the word.
4. Attorney of High Court
An attorney or a solicitor who is engaged by a client is entitled to general
lien until the fee for his professional service and other costs incurred by
him are paid. The right extends to the proceeds of the action that come
to the hands of the attorney.170 He has a right of lien over funds which are
deposited with the court." The Bombay High Court held in a case that a
solicitor who is discharged by his client, has the right to hold the papers
entrusted to him subject to his lien for costs.172 The court cited the following
passage from a judgment of Lord JAMES J:13 "A man has a right to change
his solicitor if he likes; but then the law imposes certain terms in favour of
the solicitor, that is to say, that the papers in the suit cannot be taken out of
his hands without having his costs paid."
But if the attorney himself decides not to act for the client, he forfeits his
lien and, therefore, must hand over the papers to the client, whether his costs

are paid or not. Thus where an attorney refused to act unless his previous
costs were paid, and where a firm of attorneys was dissolved and, there-
fore, they ceased to act for their clients, it was held in either case that the
lien was lost.
The law on this point has been summarised by the Andhra Pradesh High
Court in terms of the following propositions:176
(1) The common law right of passive and retaining lien available to al
solicitor in England is accepted by courts in India as part of the law of this
country.
(2) The said common law right is not abrogated by Section 171, Contract
Act.
(3) Section 171, Contract Act, enacts a special rule of lien applicable
exclusively to attorneys who are also known as solicitors.
(4) The other practitioners, who discharge the functions of solicitors, are
entitled to invoke the common law rights applicable to solicitors though
Section 171 is inapplicable to them.
(5) The practitioner forfeits the right of retaining lien the moment he dis-
charges himself or by his client for misconduct.
Advocates.-The Supreme Court has laid down in R.D. Saxena v Balram
Prasad Sharma¹77 that advocates have no right of lien over clients' papers for
their unpaid fee. The Court said that files containing copies of the records
(perhaps some original documents also) could not be equated with the word
"goods" referred in Section 171. It could not be said that files and papers
of a client lying with the advocate were in the category of "goods bailed".
In the case of litigation papers in the hands of the advocate there is neither
delivery of goods nor any contract that they shall be returned or otherwise
disposed of. That apart, the word "goods" mentioned in Section 171 is to be
understood in the sense in which that word is defined in the Sale of Goods

Act. Thus they have to be saleable goods. There is no scope for converting
the case-files into money, nor they can be sold to any buyer. Hence, an advo-
cate cannot place reliance upon Section 171.
5. Policy brokers
An insurance agent who is employed to effect a policy of marine insurance
is called a policy broker. His lien extends to any balance on any insurance
account due to him from the person who employed him to effect the policy.
Lien against time-barred debt
One of the great advantages of the right of lien is that it can be exercised
for the realisation of a debt even when an action for recovery of the debt
would be time barred.178.
Maritime lien
The Supreme Court explained the concept in M.V. Al Quamar v Tsauliris
Salvage (International) Ltd:179 "Be it noted that there are two attributes
to maritime lien: (a) a right to a part of the property in the res; and (b) a
privileged claim upon a ship, aircraft or other maritime property in respect
of services rendered to or injury caused by that property. Maritime lien
thus attaches to the property in the event of the cause of action arising and
remains attached. It is, however, inchoate and very little positive in value
unless it is enforced by an action. It is a right which stems from general mar-
itime law and is based on the concept as if the ship itself caused the harm,
loss or damage to others or to their property and the ship itself must make
good that loss."190
Carrier's lien
A carrier has the right to retain goods until his dues are paid. A carrier
cannot be forced to deliver goods without payment of demurrage even if the
detention order was issued by the Customs Authorities. The detention order
turned out to be illegal. Therefore, the Customs Authorities became liable
to pay the demurrage.

remedy of recovering debt from the principal debtor was barred by limitation, the liability
subsisted and the bank was entitled to appropriate the debt due from the amounts which
were in its possession either belonging to the principal debtor or to the surety. In the absence
of a special contract, there is general lien in favour of the bank over securities and amounts
in its possession.

710 Chapter 13 Bailment
Lien of Port Trust
[S. 171]
The general lien contained in Section 171 of the Contract Act is not cov
ered by the provisions of Chapter VI of the Major Ports Trust (MPT) Act.
This Act no doubt deals with lien in respect of, inter alia, the goods imported
but it does not deal with the general lien in respect of amount due on earlier
consignments for which payment has not been made. The contract to the
contrary as envisaged in Section 171 of the Contract Act has to be specific.
The MPT Act nowhere provides that the general lien under Section 171 of
the Contract Act would not be available to wharfingers in a case where the
MPT Act is applicable.182
"General balance of account"
Services which are undertaken under Section 42 of the Major Ports Trust
Act, 1963 have to be paid for and any amount so due would be regarded
as a part of the "general balance of account". There is no reason to give a
restricted meaning to the expression to include only the wharfage charges
and exclude demurrage. A comparison of the provisions of Section 171 of
the Contract Act and Sections 59 and 61 of the MPT Act shows that while
Section 171 enables the retention of the goods only as a trustee, Section 59
of the MPT. Act gives the right of lien, while Section 61 gives the power to
sell the goods and realise its dues. 183
Lien of chit fund company
The nature of the transaction in a chit has been held to be not that of
a creditor and debtor, but contractual. The chit fund company can exer-
cise lien over the chit amounts. The company was entitled to seek the relief
of attachment before judgment against the prize amount of the surety in
another chit.184
Set off
Set off is different from lien in this respect that it can be carried out even
without there being any bailment. A bank had loaned a sum of money to
its landlord, which was still outstanding. Arrears of rent had piled up into
an amount more than the sum due under the loan. Adjustment of the rent
amount against the loan amount was held to be quite alright. 185

S. 180. Suit by bailor or bailee against wrongdoer.-If a third person
wrongfully deprives the bailee of the use or possession of the goods bailed, or
does them any injury, the bailee is entitled to use such remedies as the owner
might have used in the like case if no bailment had been made; and either the
bailor or the bailee may bring a suit against a third person for such deprivation
or injury.
S. 181. Apportionment of relief or compensation obtained by such
suits. Whatever is obtained by way of relief or compensation in any such
suit shall, as between the bailor and the bailee, be dealt with according to their
respective interests.
Section 180 enables a bailee to sue any person who has wrongfully
deprived him of the use or possession of the goods bailed or has done them
any injury.186 The bailee's rights and remedies against the wrongdoer are just
the same as those of the owner. An action may, therefore, be brought by the
bailee or the bailor. "Whatever is obtained by way of relief or compensation
in any such suit shall, as between the bailor and the bailee, be dealt with
according to their respective interests."187 For example, where the railway
company was induced on production of forged railway receipts to deliver
certain goods, the company was held entitled as a bailee to sue to recover the
goods from a person with whom they were subsequently pledged.18
"Although sub-bailment is a sub-bailment, the law has been slow to define
the critical aspects of the parties' relationship."189 Morris v C.W. Martin and

development. The plaintiff delivered a mink stole to a furrier to be cleaned.
With his consent the stole was given to the defendant, a reputed cleaner. The
furrier was aware of the terms and conditions of the trade which applied to
sub-bailment. One of those conditions purported to exclude liability for loss
of or damage to goods. The fur was stolen by an employee of the cleaner.
The owner sued him.
Lord DENNING MR spoke thus: "Here it was not the owner, the plain-
tiff, who entrusted the fur to the cleaner. She handed it to Beder, who, in
turn, with her authority, handed it to the cleaners who were sub-bailees for
reward. Mr Beder could clearly himself sue the cleaners. But can the plaintiff
sue the cleaners direct for the misappropriation by their servant."
The plaintiff's action was accordingly allowed. The sub-bailee owed a
duty to her to take care. The Court of Appeal noted with emphasis that the
legal relationship of bailor and bailee of a chattel can exist independently
of any contract. An exemption clause in a sub-bailment contract could be
enforced against the owner only if he had expressly or impliedly consented
to the bailee making a sub-bailment containing those conditions, but not
otherwise.
The decision in Johnson Mathey and Co Ltd v Constantine Terminals
Ltd laid emphasis upon this that if the original bailor decides to sue the
sub-bailee directly, he would be bound by the terms of the contract between
the bailee and sub-bailee, whether there was consent or not. He could not
claim to be put in a better position than that of the bailee if the latter had
sued his sub-bailee.
In this case silver bullion was taken by one carrier for a part of the way
and then handed over to another for completing the last leg of the journey.
This latter carrier's contract with the original carrier had this clause that
he would not be liable for any loss unless it was due to his wilful neglect or
default. The bullion was stolen from the end carrier's possession. The clause
was held to be effective against the owner.
The Privy Council examined the doctrinal basis of the concept of
sub-bailment in Pioneer Container, re:193
The plaintiffs contracted with freight carriers for carriage of their
goods by container. The Bills of Lading provided that the carriers would
be entitled to sub-contract on any terms, the whole or any part of the
handling, storage or carriage of the goods. The carriers sub-contracted
the carriage from Taiwan to Hong Kong with the defendant shipowners.
The defendants issued feeder bills of lading containing the clause that the

Rights of bailee 7131
Bills of Lading would be governed by Chinese law and that any dispute
would be determined in Taiwan. The vessel sank with the cargo as the
result of a collision.
The plaintiffs commenced proceedings in Hong Kong by issuing a writ
in rem for arresting a sister ship. The proceedings in Hong Kong suited
them because if they had sued in Taiwan they would have been obliged
to pay advance costs and a counter-security for the claim if the vessel was
arrested. The defendants moved for stay of proceedings in Hong Kong. By
the time the matter was heard the limitation period in Taiwan had expired.
In reference to the contention of sub-bailment and lack of privity of contract
their Lordships of the Privy Council specifically acknowledged that rights
and obligations under bailment were independent of contractual doctrines.
The law of bailment does not depend for its efficacy upon the doctrine of
consideration and privity of contract. Their Lordships emphasised that the
relationship of bailment arises automatically when a party voluntarily takes
possession of another's goods. An integral element of the relationship is the
assumption of a duty to the owner and direct accountability for any breach.
An action would be maintained by the owner without reference to the con-
tract of sub-bailment. It would be sufficient that the claim is founded on
bailment alone. Thus, the principal bailor was not bound by the exclusive.

Pledge
Section 172 defines pledge:
DEFINITION
S. 172. "Pledge", "pawnor" and "pawnee" defined.-The bailment of
goods as security for payment of a debt or performance of a promise is called
"pledge". The bailor is in this case called the "pawnor". The bailee is called the
"pawnee".
Thus a pledge is only a special kind of bailment, and the chief basis of
distinction is the object of the contract. Where the object of the delivery of
goods is to provide a security for a loan or for the fulfilment of an obliga-
tion, that kind of bailment is called pledge. "Pawn or pledge is a bailment
of personal property as a security for some debt or engagement. A pawner
is one who being liable to an engagement gives to the person to whom he is
liable a thing to be held as security for payment of his debt or the fulfilment
of his liability."1
Following are the essential characteristics or ingredients of a pledge:
1. Delivery of possession
"Delivery of the chattel pawned is a necessary element in the making
of a pawn." The property pledged should be delivered to the pawnee.³
Thus, where the producer of a film borrowed a sum of money from a
financier-distributor, and agreed to deliver the final prints of the film when

Act.

tody of debtor, could not be said to be pledged, delivery of possession, actual or constructive,
is necessary. The creditor bank was paying from the borrower's account insurance premium.
That did not establish constructive possession of the bank.
3. Things delivered would include the increments, if any, on the goods. Where shares and secu-
rities were pledged, it was held that bonus shares, dividends and interest income in respect of
the securities received by the pledgee became a pledged property, Standard Chartered Bank v
Custodian, (2000) 6 SCC 427: AIR 2000 SC 1488.

ready, the agreement was held not to amount to a pledge, there being no
actual transfer of possession." Delivery of possession may be actual or con-
structive. Delivery of the key of the godown where the goods are stored,
is an illustration of constructive delivery. Where the goods are in the pos-
session of a third person, who, on the direction of the pledger, consents to
hold them on pledgee's behalf, that is enough delivery. It is sometimes called
delivery by attornment. Delivery of documents of title which would enable
the pledgee to obtain possession is equally effective to create a pledge. This
was clearly recognised by the Supreme Court in Morvi Mercantile Bank Ltd
v Union of India.
Certain goods were consigned with the Railways to "self" from
Bombay for transit to Okhla. The consigner endorsed the railway receipts
to the appellant bank against an advance of Rs 20,000. The goods having
been lost in transit, the bank as an endorsee of the railway receipts and
pledgee of the goods sued the Railways for the loss of the goods which
were worth Rs 35,500. The trial court rejected the action. The Bombay
High Court allowed recovery up to Rs 20,000 only. There were cross-ap-
peals against this decision.
The Supreme Court was called upon to decide whether a railway receipt
could be equated with the goods covered by the word "goods" for the pur-
pose of constituting delivery of goods. SUBBA RAO J (afterwards CJ), who
delivered the majority opinion, held, that delivery of railway receipts was
the same thing as delivery of goods, the pledge was, therefore, valid and the
pledgee was entitled to sue for the loss. "In this vast country where goods
are carried by Railways over long distances and remain in transit for long.
periods of time, the railway receipt is regarded as the symbol of the goods
for all purposes for which a bill of lading is so regarded in England." The
Court also held that the pledgee was entitled to recover the full value of the
goods lost and not merely the amount of his advance. "A pledge being a bail-
ment of goods as security for payment of a debt, the pledgee will have the
same remedies as the owner of the goods would have against third person
for deprivation of the said goods or injury to them."
RAMASWAMI and MUDHOLKAR JJ dissented. They were of the view that
in all cases of pledge an effective change of possession is absolutely neces
sary. The only exception could be in favour of a bill of lading. If the pledger
has goods in his physical possession he could effect the pledge by actual
delivery. If, however, the goods are in the physical possession of a third

person, pledge should be effected by a notification to the custodian who
should acknowledge to hold the goods for the bailee. There would thus be a
change of possession and constructive delivery.
It has been held by the Mysore High Court that way bills issued by a
public carrier have not yet acquired the character of being documents of title
and, therefore, their delivery cannot be regarded as pledge of the goods."
Pledge by hypothecation
Sometimes the goods are allowed to remain in the custody of the pledger
for a special purpose. But that does not militate against the effectiveness of
the pledge. Reeves v Capper is an early illustration.
The captain of a ship pledged his chronometer with the shipowner
who allowed him to use the instrument for the purpose of a voyage. The
captain pledged it over again with another person.
The question was whether the first pledge was valid. The court held
that it was. In the same way a constructive pledge comes into existence as
soon as the pawner, without actually delivering the goods, agrees to hold
them for the pawnee and promises to deliver them on demand. An illustra-
tion is the decision of Andhra Pradesh High Court in Bank of Chittoor v
Narasimbulu,"
A cinema projector and accessories were pledged with a bank. The
bank allowed the property to remain with the pledgers, since they formed
the equipment of a running cinema. Subsequently the pledgers sold the
machinery.
The court held that the sale was subject to the pledge. "There was a con-
structive delivery or delivery by attornment to the bank."
Similarly, where a firm of merchants, having pledged certain railway
receipts with a bank, took them back under the pretence of clearing the
goods and repledged them with another bank, the Privy Council held that
the first pledge was not thereby defeated. Likewise, where certain motor
vehicles pledged by a motor dealer were allowed to remain in his possession
for demonstration purposes, the pledge was held to be valid."

the value. He is not liable for any accident caused by the motor vehicle which is under his

[S. 172]
In such cases the other creditors cannot claim anything from such goods
unless the claim of the pledgee is first satisfied."
2. In pursuance of contract
"Pledge is a conveyance pursuant to a contract, and it is essential to a
valid pledge that delivery of the chattel shall be made by the pledger to the
pledgee in pursuance of the contract of pledge."15 But it is not necessary that
delivery of possession and the loan should be contemporaneous. "Delivery
and advance need not be simultaneous and a pledge may be perfected by
delivery after the advance is made." Delivery may be made before or in
contemplation of an advance, which ripens into a pledge as soon as the
advance is made. For instance, in Blundell Leigh v Attenborough:"7
On November 1, 1919, the plaintiff handed her jewellery to one Miller
to value it and let her know what offer he could make as to lending her
money; he was to keep the jewellery as security if he made the advance.
On the same day Miller pledged the jewellery with the defendants, a
pawnbroker, who in good faith advanced £1000 on it. On November 5,
Miller advanced £500 to the plaintiff on the security of the ring. Miller
died. The plaintiff came to know the facts. She paid the amount she had
borrowed and sued the defendant for return of her jewellery.
The contention on her part was that when she gave the jewellery to Miller
for examination, he only became a gratuitous bailee having no right to deal
with it. There was no valid pledge then. Subsequently, when he advanced the
money, no valid pledge could arise as he had already parted with the posses-
sion of the goods. But the court held that the pledge was valid. Delivery made
on November 1 was a good delivery for the purpose of creating a pledge,
whenever that pledge was created. "It is clear that the plaintiff intended,
when she handed over the jewellery to Miller, to create a valid pledge as
between him and her from the moment when he handed her the money by
way of loan which she was prepared to accept."18

[Ss. 173-174]
RIGHTS OF PAWNEE
1. Right of retainer [Ss. 173-174]
S. 173. Pawnee's right of retainer. The pawnee may retain the goods
pledged, not only for a payment of the debt or the performance of the promise,
but for the interest of the debt, and all necessary expenses incurred by him in
respect of the possession or for the preservation of the goods pledged.
S. 174. Pawnee not to retain for debt or promise other than that for
which goods pledged: Presumption in case of subsequent advances.-The
pawnee shall not, in the absence of a contract to that effect, retain the goods
pledged for any debt or promise other than the debt or promise for which they
are pledged; but such contract, in the absence of anything to the contrary, shall
be presumed in regard to subsequent advances made by the pawnee.
The first important right of a pawnee is the right to retain the goods
pledged until his dues are paid. He has a right to retain the goods not only
for payment of the debt or performance of the promise, but for the interest
due on the debt, and all necessary expenses incurred by him in respect of the
possession or for the preservation of the goods pledged.19
The pledgee can retain the goods only for the payment of that particu-
lar debt for which the goods were pledged and not for any other debt or
promise, unless there is a contract to the contrary. Where, however, after a
pledge is created, a subsequent advance is made without any other security, a
contract to burden the same goods shall be presumed.20 The right of retainer
ends on proper tender of payment. If the pledgee refuses a proper tender,
he opens himself up for pledger's remedies of seeking return and absolute
liability of bailee under Sections 160 and 161 for failure to return in time."
Special and paramount interest of pledgee
The right of retainer is thus in the nature of a particular lien. Yet lien
is different from pledge. "A pawn or pledge is an intermediate between a
19. This right of the pledgee has to be distinguished from bailee's lien. A pledge creates a special
interest in the property pledged in favour of the pledgee giving him the right to sell, but a lien
is only a right to retain. Alliance Bank of Simla v Ghamandi Lal Jain Lal, AIR 1927 Lah
408: (1927) 8 Lah 373. A mortgage is different from pledge in this sense that the legal inter-
est in the property becomes vested in the mortgagee subject only to the mortgagor's right of
redemption, whereas a pledge gives to the pledgee only a special interest. Metonic India (P)
Ltd v Krishna Behl, AIR 1997 P&H 297, the pledgee bank took over possession of the goods
in the pledgor's godown and locked it, that did not amount to sub-letting of the premises for

will transferred his interest in gold articles lying with the bank to his legal representative, who
paid off the whole claim of the bank. The bank became bound to return the security without
demanding succession certificate. The pledgee should exercise his power in a fair manner and
not maliciously, Bank of India v Lekhimoni Das, (2000) 3 SCC 640: AIR 2000 SC 1172.

simple lien and a mortgage." "22 "The pawnee gets a special property in the
goods pledged. The general property remains in the pawner and wholly
reverts to him on discharge of the debt. The right to property vests in the
pledgee only so far as is necessary to secure the debt."23
Explaining the nature of the special property in the goods which is
acquired by the pledgee in Bank of Bihar v State of Bihar the Supreme
Court observed: "This special property or interest is to be distinguished
from the mere right of detention which the holder of a lien possesses, in
that it is transferable in the sense that a pawnee may assign or pledge his
special property or interest in the goods. Where judgment has been obtained
against the pawner of goods and execution has issued thereon, the sheriff
cannot seize the goods pawned unless he satisfies the claim of the pawnee.
On the bankruptcy of the pawner the pawnee is a secured creditor with
respect to things pledged."
Thus, so long as the pawnee's claim is not satisfied no other creditor of
the pawner has any right to take away the goods or their price. In that case,
the goods which were under the pledge of a bank were seized by the State of
Bihar. It was held that the seizure could not deprive the pledgee of his right
to realise the amount for which the goods were pledged and, therefore, the
State was bound to indemnify him up to the amount which would have been
realised from the goods. The court also pointed out that the Indian law in
this respect was not different from the English law,25

the intervention of court for the purpose of recovering his dues. The position in the case of
regular pledge completed by possession is undoubted and set out in the relevant sections of

debtor to retain possession either on behalf of or in trust for himself (the creditor)." State

[S. 174]
A sugar manufacturing company had pledged its stock of sugar with the
lending bank. It was held that the rights of the bank over the pawned sugar
had precedence over claims of the Cane Commissioner for payment to cane
growers and claims of workmen. In the absence of winding up of the com-
pany, their claims ranked as those of unsecured creditors. A sugar mill
took bank loan by pledging sugar stock. The stock was sold in auction pur-
suant to a recovery certificate issued against the mill for payment of sugar-
cane growers. Provident fund dues of mill employees were also outstanding.
It was held that disbursement of sale proceeds first towards PF dues and
cane growers was improper. The pawnee bank had to be given precedence
over other dues.27
Records proved that sugar factories had entered into a tagging agree-
ment as per Section 17(5) of the UP Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and
Purchase) Act, 1953 which provided that an advance obtained on the secu-
rity of stock of sugar which is produced or to be produced has to be uti-
lised for payment of dues of cane growers irrespective of any other financial
agreement in respect of the same stock of sugar. It was held that financial
institutions would be entitled to assert their rights only after dues of cane.
growers as per tagging agreement were duly fulfilled.28
Hypothecatee has no direct right of seizure
Where the pledge is by way of hypothecation, the creditor cannot directly
seize the goods by entering premises or otherwise. He has to do so either
with the consent of the borrower or through a court order. The creditor does
not have the right to enter the premises, lock and seal the same. In Union
of India v Shenthilnathan the most conspicuous feature of the agreement
was that in case the borrower committed default in payment of the debt as
stipulated, the lender was at liberty to seize the goods. The court held that
this power was not directly exercisable. No possession was delivered on the
date when the hypothecation deed was entered into. What was contemplated
was a future overt act on the part of the creditor to sequester the goods, if
so desired and that too by a process known to law. At best the right which
the plaintiff had under the agreement was to file a suit on the debt and after
obtaining a decree to proceed against the property specified in realisation
of the decree. 30

the subject-matter of the litigation is purely contractual. Where the financier who is hypoth-
ecatee of the material financed by him takes possession on default in lawful manner and in

Rights of pawnee 721
Where the contract provided that the hypothecatee would have the power
to take possession of and sell hypothecated goods without intervention of
the court, it was held that a dispute resulting from the exercise of this power
was outside the scope of determination in a writ jurisdiction."
Where the purchase of a vehicle was financed, and the financier neither
gave information as to the latest position of instalments nor gave any notice
before seizure of the vehicles by force, the fact being that all instalments had
already been paid, the seizure was held to be illegal. The order of the trial
court awarding damages to the extent of Rs 50,000 for breach of contract
by the financier was upheld.12
A clause in the agreement permitting the financier to forfeit payments
already made in the event of a default was held to be void. The amounts paid
by the borrower would have to be accounted for and credited to his account.
The right of the financier is only to recover the balance amount.
Duty of care
Where the bank admitted that the goods in question were actually
hypothecated to it and since the goods were not traceable, the High Court
said that the courts below were correct in holding that the goods were lost.

It was for the bank to show that sufficient care was taken. But no proof was
offered. The bank was held liable for loss of the goods while they were in its
possession.34
2. Right to extraordinary expenses [S. 175]
The pawnee is entitled to receive from the pawner extraordinary expenses
incurred by him for the preservation of the goods pledged. For such expenses,
however, he does not have the right to retain the goods. He can only sue to
recover them. This right is provided for in Section 175 which is as follows:
In an agreement of term loan and hypothecation with a bank, there was
no provision empowering the bank to debit any amount by way of xerox
charges or legal fees. The court did not permit the bank to debit such
amounts.35
S. 175. Pawnee's right as to extraordinary expenses incurred. The
pawnee is entitled to receive from the pawnor extraordinary expenses incurred.
by him for the preservation of the goods pledged.
3. Right to sell [S. 176]
Section 176 which provides for this important right is as follows:
S. 176. Pawnee's right where pawnor makes default. If the pawnor
makes default in payment of the debt, or performance, at the stipulated time,
of the promise, in respect of which the goods were pledged, the pawnee may
bring a suit against the pawnor upon the debt or promise, and retain the goods
pledged as a collateral security; or he may sell the thing pledged, on giving the
pawnor reasonable notice of the sale.
If the proceeds of such sale are less than the amount due in respect of the
debt or promise, the pawnor is still liable to pay the balance. If the proceeds
of the sale are greater than the amount so due, the pawnee shall pay over the
surplus to the pawnor.
Upon a default being made by the pawner in the payment of the debt
or performance of the promise, the pledgee gets two distinct rights under
Section 176 of the Act. Firstly, the pledgee may sue upon the debt and retain
the goods as a collateral security,36 Secondly, he may sell the goods after
reasonable notice of the intended sale to the pawner.37

[S. 176]
Rights of pawnce 723
The right to sue is a personal action and rests upon the contract of loan
quite apart from the pledge. But until the money due is recovered, the pledged
goods may be retained, though they would have to be surrendered when the
loan is realised. If by reason of his own act, the pledgee is unable to return
the goods, he cannot have judgment for the debt. This was laid down by the
Supreme Court in Lallan Prasad v Rahmat Ali.38
The defendant borrowed Rs 20,000 from the plaintiff on a promissory
note and gave him aeroscrapes worth about Rs 35,000 as security for
the loan. The plaintiff sued for repayment of the loan, but was unable to
produce the security, having sold it, and, therefore, his action for the loan
was rejected.
SHELAT J after examining the rights of the parties to a pledge, cited the
following passage from the decision of the House of Lords in Trustees of the
Property of Ellis & Co v Dixon Johnson:"
"If a creditor holding security sues for the debt, he is under an obliga-
tion on payment of the debt to hand over the security, and that if, having
improperly made away with the security he is unable to return it to the
debtor he cannot have judgment for the debt."
"If it were otherwise," SHELAT J added, "the result would be that he
would recover the debt and also retain the goods pledged and the pawner in
such a case would be placed in a position where he incurs a greater liability
than he bargained for under the contract of pledge."40
The Orissa High Court followed this decision so as to hold that a bank

ered by a godown-keeper under the order of the Controller of Foodgrains, he not pointing out

AIR 1967 SC 1322 and held that even where the security is lost on account of the negligence
of the bank, it would not lose its right to recover back the loan amount if there is clause in the
agreement exempting the bank from liability for loss caused by negligence.

promissory note would get a decree conditional upon return of the gold to
the borrower and a decree for sale of the articles if the borrower does not
satisfy the decree.42 Where certain fixed deposit receipts were pledged with
a bank as a collateral security, they being in the nature of goods, it was held
that the bank could exercise the option of retaining them and file a suit for
recovery of the loan. It was also held that the bank was not obliged to adjust
the monthly instalments of FDR refunds towards the loan amount.43 Thus
the creditor has two rights which are concurrent and the right to proceed
against the property is not merely accessory to the right to proceed against
the debtor personally. The same principles have been held to be applicable
to cases of hypothecation or mortgage of movable property." Section 176
has been held to be mandatory. 45 Where the bank took over possession of
the hypothecated truck but thereafter neither sold it according to the agreed
terms nor took care of it, leaving it in open place, the bank was liable for the
extraordinary depreciation in the value of the vehicle."
Where the bank provided money for purchase of a lorry and also paid
insurance premium and subsequently the owner reported loss by theft, it
was held that the insurance company was liable to pay the insurance money
to the bank irrespective of the fact that the insurance was not in the name of
the bank. The bank was the hypothecatee and both the insurance company
and the borrower were joint debtors, the insurance company to the extent of
insured value and the borrower for the balance.47
Where certain shares were pledged with the bank, it was held that the
bank had the right to sell them without intervention of the court. The court
also directed the company to register the transfer because without such reg-
istration the title of the purchaser could not be perfected."
The two rights are disjunctive
The pawnee's two rights, namely the right to sue the pawnor for personal
recovery or resort to sell the security after reasonable notice, are disjunctive,
being independent of each other. The fact that a period is prescribed for fil-
ing suit would not mean that the prescribed period would also apply to the
alternative remedy of selling the goods."

Rights of pawnee 725
The security holder is not bound to proceed against the security first or
surrender it before maintaining a summary suit against the buyer.50
Priority of employees' PF dues
The employer had defaulted in depositing employees' PF dues. The prop-
erty of employer was pledged with a bank by way of security for repayment
of a loan. It was held that such property could be attached and sold for
recovery of PF dues, $1
Requirement of notice
Alternatively, the pledgee may sell the goods. Before making the sale he is
required to give to the pawner, a reasonable notice of his intention to sell.52
The requirement of "reasonable notice" is a statutory obligation and, there-
fore, cannot be excluded by a contact to the contrary. Thus, for example,
in a case before the Allahabad High Court:
One of the terms of an agreement of loan enabled the lending banker to
sell the securities without any notice to the pawner. The pawner defaulted
in payment. The bank sent a reminder, but the pawner asked for more
time. The bank thereupon disposed of the securities.
The sale was held to be bad in law. "What is contemplated by Section 176,"
the court said, "is not merely a notice but a 'reasonable' notice, meaning
thereby a notice of intended sale of the security by the creditor within a cer-
tain date so as to afford an opportunity to the debtor to pay up the amount
within the time mentioned in the notice." The court refused to agree with
the bank's contention that the sale notice should be inferred from the pawner's

a sale actually arranged for a particular date. A notice under the section does not require a
specification of the date, time and place of sale. Bharat Bank Ltd v Sheoji Prasad, AIR 1955

request for time. "A notice of the character contemplated by Section 176
cannot be implied. Such notice has to be clear and specific in language...."
If the proceeds of sale are less than the amount due in respect of the debt
or promise, the pawner is still liable to pay the balance. If the proceeds of
sale are greater than the amount so due, the pawnee shall pay over the sur-
plus to the pawner.56
In a case before the Patna High Court," a banker, with whom some
jute bales were pledged, sold them in the exercise of his right of resale, but
refunded the price to the buyer when the latter rejected the goods on the
ground that they contained "gudri" and not merely jute. The banker resold
the goods to another buyer at a lower figure and then sued the pawner for
the balance still due after adjusting the sale proceeds. The court rejected his
action. He should have referred to the pawner before refunding the price.
UNTWALLA J said: "I find no principle or authority to support the contention
that all that was done by the bank in regard to the dispute was incidental to
the power of sale of the bank under Section 176. It would be disastrous for
the commercial world to accept and uphold it to be good."
The right of sale can be exercised even against a time-barred debt. In lieu
of sale, the court can order the pawner to pay off the time-barred debt but
such an order must inevitably be accompanied with an order to the pawnee
to return the pledged articles, 58
The fact that the date, time and place of sale were not mentioned in the
notice did not have the effect of rendering the notice to be ineffective. No
payment was made even after receiving notice. Requesting the bank to post-
pone sale could not deprive the bank of its right to proceed with the sale.
Supposing that a due notice of sale has been given so that the pledgee
gets the right to sell, may he buy the goods himself? The Punjab High Court
held, following a Privy Council decision" that a sale to the pledgee himself
is not void. It does not terminate the contract of pledge so as to entitle the
pledger to have back the goods without payment of loan. But the pledger
may hold the pledgee liable for any loss he may have suffered by reason of
that fact, for example, that the goods have been given a value less than their
market price.

Loss of security due to pledgee's negligence
Rights of pawnee 727
Where goods are lost due to the negligence of the pledgee, the liability
of the pledger is reduced to the extent of the value of such goods. In a case
before the Supreme Court:
Certain goods in the godown of a firm were under the pledge of a
bank. The godown was insured against fire. A part of them was damaged
by fire. The bank received insurance money to the extent of the fire.
The bank was obliged by the court to give credit to the firm in its cash-
credit account for the amount so received. The court also pointed out
that bank was not entitled to hold it under lien against partners' personal
accounts. The goods were of the firm. They were not the goods of the part-
ners. They were not offered as security for the individual debts of the part-
ners. The goods were pledged against the cash-credit facility allowed to the
firm.62
Pawner's right to redeem [S. 177]
Section 177 provides for the most valuable right of the pawner.
S. 177. Defaulting pawnor's right to redeem.-If a time is stipulated for
the payment of the debt, or performance of the promise, for which the pledge
is made, and the pawnor makes default in payment of the debt or performance
of the promise at the stipulated time, he may redeem the goods pledged at any
subsequent time before the actual sale of them; but he must, in that case, pay,
in addition, any expenses which have arisen from his default.
"Satisfaction of the debt or engagement extinguishes the pawn and the
pawnee on such satisfaction is bound to redeliver the property. The pawner
has an absolute right to redeem the property pledged upon tender of the
amount advanced."3 It has been pointed out by the Supreme Court that
"the special interest of the pledgee comes to an end as soon as the debt for
which the goods were pledged is discharged. It is open to the pledger to
redeem the pledge by full payment of the amount for which the pledge had
been made at any time if there is no period fixed for redemption, or at any
time after the fixed date and the right continues until the thing pledged is
lawfully sold". The right to redeem clearly continues up to the time on the
expiry of which the pawnee has notified that the goods would be sold. But
the right continues even longer, for Section 177 clearly provides that the

ance, distinguishing Durga Dass v Sansar Singh, 2003 AIHC 2800.

pawner may redeem the goods at any subsequent time before the actual
sale of them. "So long as the sale does not take place the pawner is entitled
to redeem the goods on payment of the debt." In other words, the right to
redeem is extinguished not by the expiry of time specified in the notice of
sale, but by the actual sale of the goods.
Where the pawner redeems after the expiry of the specified time, he is
bound to pay to the pawnee such expenses as have arisen on account of his
default. [S. 177] Where the pawner redeems before the expiry of the speci-
fied period, he would remain bound by the terms of the loan, if any, that a
premium would be leviable on premature repayment.
The pawner has the right to take back with the goods the increase, if any,
that the goods have undergone during the period of pledge. In a case before
Delhi High Court," the pledge was that of certain shares of a company and
during the period of pledge the company issued bonus and rights shares. It
was held that these increases belonged to the pawner.
Redemption means the enforcement of the right to have the title to corpus
of the pledged property restored to the pledgor free and clear of the pledge.
A suit for redemption has to be filed for exercising this specific remedy and
not just for a declaration of the right of redemption.
The suit was for redemption of pledged gold ornaments. The premises
of the pawnee were raided and the ornaments were seized by officers of the
Income Tax Department. The transaction of pledge between the parties was
proved. Section 293 of the Income Tax Act could not defeat the right of the
pawnor to institute the suit for recovery of his ornaments.68
Legal heir's right to redeem
Certain gold ornaments were pledged with the bank as security for gold
loan. The pawner died. He left behind a will enabling his widow to redeem.
The bank demanded probate. It was held that the bank had no right to do
so. Neither probate nor succession certificate was necessary. The son and
daughter of the deceased had raised no objection."
WHO CAN PLEDGE
Ordinarily goods may be pledged by the owner or by any person with
the owner's authority. A pledge made by any other person may not be valid.
Thus, for example, where goods were left in the possession of a servant,
while the owner was temporarily absent, a pledge made by the servant was

held to be invalid. Similarly, where certain goods are left in the care of a
person for some special purpose, he cannot pledge them." In a case before
the Allahabad High Court, 72 the railway company delivered goods on a
forged railway receipt. The goods were then pledged with the defendants. In
a suit by the Railways to recover the goods, the defendants contended that
the Railways were too negligent in delivering the goods to a wrong person.
But the court held that this would not constitute an estoppel against the
company and that pledge was not valid. The principle is necessary to protect
the individual interest in the ownership of property. But interest acquired
in the course of lawful commercial transactions equally deserves to be pro-
tected. Accordingly, Sections 178 and 179 provide for certain circumstances
in which a person, being left in possession with the consent of the owner,
may make a valid pledge though without the owner's authority.
1. Pledge by mercantile agent [S. 178]
S. 178. Pledge by mercantile agent.-Where a mercantile agent is, with
the consent of the owner, in possession of goods or the documents of title to
goods, any pledge made by him, when acting in the ordinary course of business
of a mercantile agent, shall be as valid as if he were expressly authorised by
the owner of the goods to make the same: Provided that the pawnee acts in
good faith and has not at the time of the pledge notice that the pawnor has no
authority to pledge.
Explanation. In this section, the expressions "mercantile agent" and "doc-
uments of title" shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indian Sale of
Goods Act, 1930 (Ill of 1930).
The first exception is in favour of a pledge created by a mercantile agent.
Section 178 provides that where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of
the owner, in possession of goods or documents of title to goods, any pledge
made by him while acting in the ordinary course of business shall be valid,
provided that the pawnee acts in good faith and has no notice of the fact that
the agent has no authority to pledge." The necessary conditions of validity
under the section are as follows:

The bank refused and asked her to produce letters of administration. The court said that such
letters were not necessary. The court further said that the refusal was wrongful and that inter-
est ceased to run from the date of refusal.

1. Mercantile agent
[S. 178]
There should be a mercantile agent. The explanation to the section says
that the expression "mercantile agent" has the same meaning as is assigned
to it by Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930. In this Act, "mercantile agent means
an agent having in the customary course of business as such agent authority
either to sell goods, or to consign goods for the purpose of sale, or to buy
goods or to raise money on the security of goods". [S. 2(9), Sale of Goods Act]
2. Possession with owner's consent
The mercantile agent should be in possession of the goods or documents
of title with the consent of the owner. The Supreme Court has laid down
that the word "consent" for this purpose means agreeing on the same thing
in the same sense as defined in Section 13 of the Contract Act. If the consent
is real, it is immaterial that it was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation
or with dishonest intention. All these things may make the person receiving
possession liable for some offence, but the consent of the owner actually
given is not annulled thereby. Thus, where a goldsmith obtained possession
of certain jewellery under the pretence that he had a customer, and instead
pledged the jewellery, the pledgee was held to have obtained a good title.74
Similarly, where a French Company sent to their London agents certain pic-
tures, some being for exhibition only, but the agent pledged them, the pledge
was held to be valid, the court saying that the principle applies to all goods
in the custody of the mercantile agent whether for sale or not.?
In Sharadin v Gokulchand," the court interpreted "possession" appear-
ing in Section 178 as juridical possession as distinguished from mere phys-.
ical possession or bare custody. It has been held that a servant or a relation
entrusted by the owner with the custody of goods during his absence cannot
be said to be in possession thereof so as to be entitle to make a valid pledge
thereof.
3. In the course of business
Goods should have been entrusted to the agent in his capacity as a mer-
cantile agent and he should be in possession in that capacity. If the goods are
entrusted to him in a different capacity, it is not open to a third party who
takes a pledge from him to say that they were in his possession as a mercan-
tile agent and therefore, he had the power to create a pledge." In Chalmer's
SALE OF GOODS,78 the principle is explained by this illustration:

is not thereby affected.

Who can pledge 731
Suppose a house were let furnished to a man who happened to be an
auctioneer. Could he sell the furniture by auction and give a good title to
the buyer? Surely not?
It is further necessary that he should make the pledge in the ordinary
course of his business as such agent.
The plaintiff, a dealer in diamonds at Amsterdam, sent some diamonds
to a diamond broker in London for sale. The broker asked a friend of his
to pledge the diamonds for him. The friend pledged them with the defend-
ants, who were pawnbrokers."
In the owner's action against the defendants for the diamonds, the pledge
was held to be invalid. "It was not the ordinary course of business of a mer-
cantile agent to ask a friend to pledge goods entrusted to him, but to pledge
them himself."
4. Good faith
The last essential requirement is that the pawnee should act in good faith
and should not have at the time of the pledge notice that the pawner has
no authority to pledge. The expressions "good faith" and "notice" are not
defined in the Act. The definition of "good faith" as given in the General
Clauses Act, 1895 is, therefore, applicable. According to that Act a thing is
said to be done in good faith when it is done honestly, whether negligently or
not. "Notice" will mean actual as well as constructive notice.80
Pledge by documents of title [S. 178]
Where a mercantile agent is in possession of the documents of title relat-
ing to his principal's goods, and if he pledges the same, the pledgee gets a
good title if he acts in good faith and without notice. An explanation to
Section 178 says that the expression "documents of title" shall have the same
meaning as is assigned to it in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. Section 2(4) of
this Act provides that "documents of title to goods" includes a bill of lad-
ing, dock warrant, warehouse keeper's certificate, wharfinger's certificate,
railway receipt, warrant or order for the delivery of goods and any other
79. De Gorter v Attenborough & Sons, (1904) 21 TLR 19. Similarly it is not in the ordinary
course of business to pledge outside the agent's business premises or out of business hours.

tion book is also not in the ordinary course of business. Pearson v Rose & Young Ltd, (1951)

whom they knew were mercantile agents.

documents used in the ordinary course of business as proof of the posses-
sion or control of goods, or authorising or purporting to authorise, either
by endorsement or by delivery, the possessor of the document to transfer or
receive goods hereby represented.
Before the Sale of Goods Act was separated from the Contract Act in
1930, "railway receipts" were not included in the meaning of the expression
"documents of title". But the Privy Council had held that "railway receipts"
were also documents of title as they are treated as a symbol of possession
and control of goods covered by them. In 1930 when the Sale of Goods
Act was enacted "railway receipt" was expressly included in the definition
of "documents of title to goods". "This indicates the legislative intention to
accept the mercantile usage found by the Judicial Committee in Ramdas
Vithaldas Durbar v S. Amerchand & Co.82"
May the owner himself pledge the goods by transferring documents of
title? It has been held both by the Privy Council and the Supreme Court that
it is impossible to justify a restriction on the owner's power to pledge which
was not imposed on the powers of the mercantile agent.83
2. Person in possession under voidable contract [S. 178-A]
S. 178-A. Pledge by person in possession under voidable con-
tract. When the pawnor has obtained possession of the goods pledged by
him under a contract voidable under Section 19 or Section 19-A, but the con-
tract has not been rescinded at the time of the pledge, the pawnee acquires a
good title to the goods, provided he acts in good faith and without notice of the
pawnor's defect of title.
Where goods are pledged by a person who has obtained possession under
a voidable contract, the pledge is valid, provided that the contract has not
been rescinded at the time of the pledge and the pledgee has acted in good
faith and without notice of the pledger's defect of title. Phillips v Brooks
Ltd is a well-known authority.
A fraudulent person, pretending to be a man of credit, induced the
plaintiff to give him a valuable ring in return for his cheque which proved
worthless. Before the fraud could be discovered, the ring was pledged
with the defendants.

[S. 178-A]
Who can pledge 733
The pledge was held to be valid, it being made by a person in possession
under a voidable contract. The effect of fraud is to render the transaction
voidable and not void and if, therefore, an innocent person has taken the
goods under a pledge before the transaction is avoided, the true owner can-
not claim them back. Explaining the principle, DENNING LJ observed in
Pearson v Rose & Young Ltd: "For instance, if a mercantile agent should
induce the owner to pass the property to him by some false pretence as by
giving him a worthless cheque, or should induce the owner to entrust prop-
erty to him for display purposes, by falsely pretending that he was in a large
way of business when he was not, then the owner cannot claim the goods
back from an innocent purchaser (or pledgee)...."
But if the contract under which possession is obtained is void, the person
in possession cannot create a valid pledge. The following passage in the
judgment of B.K. MUKHERJEA J in Central National Bank Ltd v United
Industrial Bank Ltd" explains the principle: "The position, however, is
entirely different if the fraud committed is of such a character as would
prevent there being consent at all on the part of the owner to give possession
of the goods to a particular person. Thus A might obtain possession of the
goods from the owner by falsely representing himself to be B. In such cases
the owner can never have consented to the possession of goods by A; the
so-called consent being not a real consent is a totally void thing in law.... The
position, therefore, is that when the transaction of possession is voidable
merely by reason of its being induced by fraud, which can be rescinded at
the option of the owner, the consent which follows false representation is a
sufficient consent. But where the fraud induced an error regarding the iden-
tity of the person to whom or the property in respect of which possession
was given, the whole thing is void and there is no consent in the sense of an
agreement between two persons on the same thing in the same sense."87
The contract must not have been rescinded at the time of the pledge.
The usual method of rescinding a contract is by giving notice to the other
party of the intention to rescind. If he pledges the goods after receiving such
notice, the pledge will not be valid. Where the person who has taken away
the goods keeps out of the way so that he cannot be contacted, the contract
can be rescinded by doing whatever the owner can do to regain possession.
Thus, informing the police and requesting the Automobile Association to
trace the car which has been taken away by a swindler by giving a fake
cheque has been held to be a sufficient demonstration of the intent to rescind
and any dealing with the goods after this will not bind the owner.38

88. Car & Universal Finance Co Ltd v Caldwell, (1965) 1 QB 525: (1964) 2 WLR 600 (CA). The

intention to avoid.

[S. 179]
CASE PILOT
S. 179. Pledge where pawnor has only a limited interest.-Where a per-
son pledges goods in which he has only a limited interest, the pledge is valid to
the extent of that interest.
Section 179, which is the relevant provision says that where a person
pledges goods in which he has only a limited interest, the pledge is valid to
the extent of that interest. Thus, when a pledgee further pledges the goods
the pledge will be valid only to the extent of his interest and his interest is
the amount for which the goods have been given to him as a security. If he
pledges for a larger amount, the original pledger will still be entitled to his
goods on paying the amount for which he himself pledged the goods.89
Where, on the other hand, an effective pledge in favour of the pledgee has
not taken place, any repledge made by him will be equally ineffective. The
Supreme Court decision Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney v State of Bombay90
is an instructive, though a bit complicated, illustration.
A Co-operative Bank had an overdraft account with the Exchange
Bank, which was secured by the deposit of certain securities. After many
dealings and adjustments the last position of the account was that the
overdraft limit was set at Rs 66,150 and the securities under the pledge
of the bank were worth Rs 75,000. The Co-operative Bank did not, how-
ever, make use of this overdraft facility for a very long time and when it
attempted to sue the Exchange Bank it was itself in financial straits and
had pledged the securities first with the Canara Bank and then having
redeemed them, pledged them again with a private financier.
The Supreme Court held that the pledge was not valid. If the Co-operative
Bank had in fact operated the overdraft account and drawn sums within the
limit, the Exchange Bank would have had pro tanto an interest in these
securities and might then have been entitled to pledge the securities with a
third party. But so long as there was no overdraft by the pledger, the pledgee
had no such interest as would have enabled it to sub-pledge to a third party.
Additional exceptions under the Sale of Goods Act
In addition to these exceptions, a pledge by a seller remaining in posses-
sion after sale and by a buyer obtaining possession before sale is valid."
Where one of several joint-owners is in possession with the permission of all,
a pledge by him would be valid, if the buyer had no notice of the situation."

Agency
CASE PILOT
DEFINITION OF "AGENT"
Representative capacity, hallmark of agency
"Agent" is defined in Section 182 of the Act in the following words:
S. 182. "Agent" and "principal" defined.-An "agent" is a person
employed to do any act for another, or to represent another in dealings with
third persons. The person for whom such act is done, or who is so represented,
is called the "principal".
The emphasis is on the power of the agent to represent his principal in
dealings with third persons. But the above "definition is wide enough to
embrace a servant pure and simple, even a casual employee, a man who is
engaged by me in the street to black my boots; but it cannot for a moment be
contended that they are all to be placed in the same category"." Thus what
distinguishes an agent from a person appointed to do an act, is the agent's
representative capacity coupled with a power to affect the legal relations
of the principal with third persons. "The essence of the matter is that the
principal authorised the agent to represent or act for him in bringing the
principal into contractual relation with a third person."2
The concept of "agency" was thus explained by RAMASWAMI J of the
Madras High Court in P. Krishna Bhatta v Mundila Ganapathi Bhatta:³
"In legal phraseology, every person who acts for another is not an agent.
A domestic servant renders to his master a personal service; a person may
till another's field or tend his flocks or work in his shop or factory or mine
or may be employed upon his roads or ways; one may act for another in
aiding in the performance of his legal or contractual obligations of third
persons....In none of these capacities he is an agent and he is not acting
for another in dealings with third persons. It is only when he acts as a

representative of the other in business negotiations, that is to say, in the
creation, modification or termination of contractual obligations, between
that other and third persons, that he is an agent....Representative char-
acter and derivative authority may briefly be said to be the distinguishing
feature of an agent."4
The same appears from an observation of the Supreme Court' to the
effect that "the expression agency is used to connote the relation which
exists where one person has an authority or capacity to create legal relations
between a person occupying the position of principal and third parties".
The National Textile Corporation Ltd was held to be neither a Government
in itself nor a department of the Government. It is only a Government com-
pany. It could not equate itself with the Central Government. It could not be
regarded as an agent of the Central Government. It is an independent legal
person. An agent is merely an extended hand of the principal and cannot
claim independent rights.6
Test of determining existence of agency relationship
The test of determining the existence of agency relationship has been
explained by DHAWAN J of the Allahabad High Court in the following
words:
"Agency depends on true nature of relationship. The American juris-
prudence refers to a case in which it was held that the use of the words
'agency agreement' and 'agent' by the parties in a contract does not nec-
essarily establish a relationship of agency in the legal sense. The law in
India is the same. It has been held in several decisions that the fact that
the parties have called their relationship an agency is not conclusive, if the
incidence of this relationship, as disclosed by evidence does not justify a

finding of agency, and that the court must examine the true nature of the
relationship and the functions and responsibilities of the alleged agent."
Applying this test to the facts of the case before him the learned Judge
held that when the Assam Government placed its quota of a commodity at
the hands of a dealer for resale to consumers, he was not an agent of the
Government even if he was described as such in the agreement. Similarly "a
person does not become an agent merely because he gives advice in matters
of business"." A "procurement agent" has been held to be not an agent, as he
is only a person directed to do an act on a commission and not to represent
another.10
A person who was described under the Madras Foodgrains Procurement
Order, 1947, as a "wholesale dealer" has been held to be an agent. He was to
purchase and sell at price fixed by the State and he was also responsible for
safety. Thus, he was a channel through which the State was operating and
became an agent of the State." Similarly, where a person was authorised by
the Government of India to procure rice in Nepal, to have it milled at a spec-
ified mill in Bihar and to dispatch it to different States as directed, he was
held to be an agent of the State.12 Coal dispatched by a colliery under col-

There was no understanding with or request by the payee that it should be

Liability for non-delivery was that of the UTI and not the post office.14
Agency in hire-purchase transactions
To know whether a person occupies the position of an agent or not, the
law has to go by his functions. The law has to see the substance of the trans-
action and not the parties' terminology. The relevance of the expressions
used in an agreement has often been considered in connection with hire-pur-
chase transactions. A transaction of this kind generally involves three par-
ties, the dealer, who provides the goods; the financier, who provides money
to the dealer and the hirer, who takes the goods and pays hire-purchase
instalments to the financier. What happens in real substance is that the dealer
hands over goods as directed by the financier. Lest the dealer be regarded as
an agent of the financier a hire-purchase agreement often expressly declares
that the dealer is not an agent. The Hire Purchase Act, 1972 (repealed)
regards the dealer as an agent of the financier for some purposes, one of
them is that if any representations are made by the dealer to promote the
sale of the product, he would be deemed to be an agent of the financier.
But whether he is a general agent of the finance company remains an open
question. The Court of Appeal has witnessed two views being expressed.

[S. 183]
In one of them it was stated that the dealer is a party to the hire-purchase
transaction in his own right and not as a representative of any other party,
though for many purposes he is an intermediary between the two others.¹
The other view considered the dealer as an agent of the finance company
for many purposes of law." The House of Lords has expressed (obiter) the
opinion that the questions of liability of the finance company for acts or
defaults of dealers can be resolved only in reference to the general mercan-
tile structure within which they arise or, if one prefers the expression, to
mercantile reality. The reality of the situation is that customers often do
not know about the finance company. They come only to the counter of the
dealer, who does everything. "If this is so, a general responsibility of the
finance company for the acts, receipts and omissions of the dealer in relation
to the proposed transaction of hire-purchase ought to flow from this general
structure of relationship and expectation."18
Co-agents and co-principals
Where the authority given to co-agents is joint, it would be necessary for
them to act jointly and only then their principal would be bound. Where the
authority is joint and several any one of them would be competent to act for
the principal." An agent who represents more than one principals in one
and the same transactions, should account for to all of them jointly, for an
account given to one may not absolve him from his liability.20
Essentials of agency principal should be competent to contract
I
An agency being a contract of employment to bring the principal into legal
relations with a third party, the first requisite is that the principal should be
competent to contract:21
S. 183. Who may employ agent.-Any person who is of the age of major-
ity according to the law to which he is subject, and who is of sound mind, may
employ an agent.
It follows that a minor cannot appoint an agent. The appointment of an
agent involves a contract, and a minor's agreement is void. Emphasising this
principle, DENNING LJ observed in Shephard v Cartwright: "An infant
cannot appoint an agent to act for him neither by means of a power of attor-
ney, nor by any other means. If he purports to appoint an agent, not only is

the appointment itself void, but everything done by the agent on behalf of
the infant is also void and incapable of ratification."
Explaining the reason for the infant's incapacity, his Lordship said: "An
infant has not sufficient discretion to choose an agent to act for him. He
is all too likely to choose a wrong man; and so the law declares him to be
incapable of choosing an agent at all."
But in situations where a minor is capable of binding himself by contract
he may appoint an agent to contract on his behalf. "Whatever a person
can do personally he can do through an agent."23 The following article in
BOWSTEAD ON AGENCY24 emphasises the same principle: "An infant or a
lunatic is bound by a contract made by his agent with his authority, where
the circumstances are such that he would have been bound if he had himself
made the contract." "25
Further, "there is nothing in the Act which prohibits the guardian of a
minor from appointing an agent for him", 26
Where a principal who had executed a power of attorney became old,
weak, mentally infirm and not in a position to think independently, it was
held that the power of attorney had become worthless; that the engagement
of a lawyer under it came to an end, the principal being unable to give
instructions because of mental infirmity and that the holder of the power
was no longer competent to give evidence on behalf of the principal. 27
The principle that every person has the right to appoint an agent for any
purpose does not apply where the act to be performed is personal in char-
acter or when it is annexed to a public office or to an office involving any
fiduciary obligation. 28

Agent need not be competent
[Ss. 184-185]
S. 184. Who may be an agent.-As between the principal and third per-
sons, any person may become an agent, but no person who is not of the age of
majority and of sound mind can become an agent, so as to be responsible to his
principal according to the provisions in that behalf herein contained.
The agent need not be competent to contract. Section 184 lays down very
clearly that "as between the principal and third persons any person may
become an agent". Ordinarily, an agent incurs no personal liability while
contracting for his principal and, therefore, it is not necessary that he should
be competent to contract. 29 Thus a person may contract through a minor
agent, but the minor will not be responsible to his principal. "In the days
when married women lacked contractual capacity they could nonetheless
act as agents." A company may act as an agent beyond its capacity (ultra
vires). A person may act as a trustee despite his contractual competence."
Consideration for appointment not necessary
S. 185. Consideration not necessary. No consideration is necessary to
create an agency.
Lastly, Section 185 provides that no consideration is necessary to create
an agency. Generally an agent is remunerated by way of commission for
services rendered, but no consideration is immediately necessary at the time
of appointment.
Agent and servant
An agent occupies a position which is in many respects similar to that occu-
pied by a servant, bailee or trustee. The distinction between an "agent" and
a "servant" has been underlined by the Supreme Court in Lakshminarayan
Ram Gopal & Sons Ltd v Govt of Hyderabad." BHAGWATI J adopted the
distinction as it is stated in Powell's LAW OF AGENCY" and HALSBURY'S
LAWS OF ENGLAND," The main points of distinction which have been
emphasised are as follows-

Definition of "agent" 743
(1) An agent has the authority to act on behalf of his principal and to cre-
ate contractual relations between the principal and a third party. This
kind of power is not generally enjoyed by a servant.
(2) "A principal has the right to direct what the agent has to do; but a
master has not only that right, but also the right to say how it is to be
done."37 "A servant acts under the direct control and supervision of his
master and is bound to conform to all reasonable orders given to him
in the course of his work. But an agent, though bound to exercise his
authority in accordance with all lawful instructions... is not subject in
its exercise to the direct control of supervision of the principal."38
(3) The mode of remuneration is generally different. A servant is paid by
way of salary or wages, an agent receives commission on the basis of
work done.39
(4) A master is liable for a wrongful act of his servant if it is committed
in the course of the servant's employment. A principal is liable for his
agent's wrong done within the "scope of authority".
(5) A servant usually serves only one master, but an agent may work for
several principals at the same time.40
The managing director of a company is an employee of the company, but
in the matter of the company's relation with third parties he occupies the
position of an agent." Similarly, the secretary of a company is its servant,
but in respect of the matters that come under his domain, he becomes an
agent in his dealings with third persons. "Professional advisers, such as
stockbrokers and architects often act as agents for their clients. Other pro-
fessional persons are engaged simply to produce a specified result: for exam-
ple, to prepare a report or to paint a picture. Such persons have no power to
act on behalf of their clients;....
The court is not bound by the terminology of the parties, but by the
substance of the relation. Where an agent was described and treated as a
servant, but the nature of the dealings showed that he was in essence an
agent, it was held that he having invested his personal money and resources

[S. 185]
in the working of the agency, the same could not be summarily terminated.
It required some reasonable notice.44
Agent and bailee
An agent differs from a bailee in certain respects. Firstly, the relationship
of bailor and bailee subsists only so long as the bailee holds some goods
belonging to the bailor, but this is not necessary for the subsistence of
agency relationship. Sometimes an agent may be in possession of his princi-
pal's property and to that extent he may also be a bailee. And sometimes an
ordinary bailee may become an agent when he is authorised to dispose of the
bailor's property according to his directions.
Secondly, an agent is a representative with a power to contract on behalf
of his principal. A bailee does not have that power. The Supreme Court
accepted these points of distinction in a case in which a banker had assumed
the responsibility of receiving the goods on behalf of an account-holder and
to release them in favour of his customers against payment. The banker was
held thereby not to have become an agent. He remained only a bailee.45
Agent and buyer
A selling agency has to be distinguished from a transaction resulting in an
out and out sale. The legal position of an independent buyer is enormously
different from that of an agent. An illustration is to be found in the decision
of the Supreme Court in Gordon Woodroffe & Co (Madras) Ltd v Sk M.A.
Majid." The court pointed out that even an agent can become a purchaser
when he pays the price to the principal and discloses to him that fact. The
opening words of the contract in question were that the defendants were
buying the goods for resale in the UK. If it were not an outright sale, but
only an agency, it would not have been necessary to provide for the price,
for the time of delivery and for the fact that sales tax was to be borne by the
defendants.
Kinds of agent
Agents are of several kinds. The word "agent" is used to describe vari-
ous types of activity. For instance, Lord HERSCHELL observed in Kennedy
v De Trafford: "No word is more commonly and constantly abused than
the word 'agent'. A person may be spoken of as an agent and no doubt in
popular sense of the word he may properly be said to be an agent, although
when it is attempted to suggest that he is an agent under such circumstances

was allowed to recover compensation from the godown-keeper for damage to the goods.

as create the legal obligations attaching to agency that use of the word is
only misleading."
"The description 'agent' is often employed in business in a complimentary
and not in a legal sense." Thus one hears of "dress agency; private inquiry
agent; secret agent", and the word is also used in reference to mechani-
cal agents, such as washing or cleansing agent. The types of agent that are
known to the business world are, however, fewer. Only those may be briefly
described here.
Factor
"The word 'factor' in India as in England, means an agent entrusted with
the possession of goods for the purpose of selling them."50 "He is a mercan-
tile agent whose ordinary course of business is to dispose of goods, of which
he is entrusted with the possession or control by his principal."
Broker
A "broker" is also a kind of mercantile agent. He is appointed to negoti-
ate and make contracts for the sale or purchase of property on behalf of his
principal, but is not given possession of the goods.
Del credere agent
A "del credere agent" is another type of mercantile agent. In ordinary
cases the only function of an agent is to effect a contract between his princi-
pal and a third party. The agent then drops out." He can neither sue on the
contract, nor he is held liable for the failure of the third party to perform.
But where an agent undertakes, on the payment of some extra commission,
to be liable to the principal for the failure of the third party to perform the
contract, he is called del credere agent and his extra commission for the
guarantee is known del credere commission. The position of such agent was
explained in Hastie v Couturier:54
The defendants acting as del credere agents sold the plaintiff's goods
which were supposed to be on a voyage but which unknown to the par-
ties had already been sold by the captain owing to damage by heat. The
buyer repudiated the contract and, therefore, the agents were sued for the
buyer's failure to perform.

[S. 185]
The question was "whether the defendants are responsible by reason of
their charging a del credere commission, though they have not guaranteed
by writing". The court said that they were. "A higher reward is paid in con-
sideration of their taking greater care in sales to their customers and also
for assuming a greater share of responsibility than ordinary agents, namely,
responsibility for the solvency and performance of their contracts by their
vendees. This is the main object of the reward being given to them." Keeping
this in view, the court held that a del credere agency is not a contract of
guarantee, even if it may terminate in a liability to pay the debt of another,
because the agent has a personal interest in the transaction and, therefore, a
writing is not necessary.
The nature of liability incurred by a del credere agent has been explained
by the Allahabad High Court in the following words:
"A del credere agent incurs only a secondary liability towards the prin-
cipal. His legal position is partly that of an insurer and partly that of a
surety for the parties with whom he deals to the extent of any default by
reason of any insolvency or something equivalent. His liability does not
go to the extent of making him responsible to the principal where there
can be no profit by reason of any stringency in the market."
A del credere agent is, however, not liable to the buyer for any default
on the part of his principal." Nor is he liable for any disputes between the
principal and the buyer relating to the contract or the sum due. 57 The extent
of his involvement as a guarantor was thus explained by BUCKLEY LJ:"
"The liability of the del credere agent is contingent pecuniary liability,
not a liability to perform the contract; it is a pecuniary liability to make
good in the event of the default of the buyer in respect of a pecuniary
liability. It does not extend to other obligations of the contract. It does
not expose del credere agent to an action to ascertain the sum due. It is
limited to a contingent pecuniary liability in respect of a sum which as
between the seller and the buyer is an ascertained sum."
CREATION OF AGENCY
In the words of DESAI J of the Supreme Court: "The relation of agency
arises whenever one person called the agent has authority to act on behalf
of another called the principal and consents so to act. The relationship has
its genesis in a contract."
The relationship of principal and agent may be created in any of the fol-
lowing ways: (1) by express appointment; (2) by the conduct or situation of

the parties; (3) by necessity of the case; or (4) by subsequent ratification of
an unauthorised act.
Express appointment
Any person who is competent to contract and who is of sound mind may
appoint an agent. The appointment may be expressed in writing or it may
be oral. "In English law no man can become the agent of another except
by the will of that other person. His will may be manifested by writing or
orally or simply by placing another in a situation in which, according to the
ordinary rule or law, or perhaps it would be more correct to say, according
to the ordinary usage of mankind, that other is understood to represent and
act for the person who has so placed him; but in every case, it is only by the
will of the employer that an agency may be created."
"The relationship of principal and agent can only be established by the
consent of the principal and the agent. They will be held to have consented if
they have agreed to what amounts in law to such a relationship, even if they
do not recognize it themselves and even if they have professed to disclaim
it... But the consent must have been given by each of them, either expressly
or by implication from their words and conduct".
"In Indian law the definition given in Section 182 seems to be somewhat
wider in this respect.... The definition does not limit the employment to
one by the principal only.... It will include an employment by any authority
authorised by law to make the employment." Thus, where an agent was
appointed under the provisions of a statute for the protection of the interests
of quarrelling co-owners and of third persons, the Calcutta High Court
held that the agent so appointed would come within the definition, though
he would not have the same "well-known and settled incidents" attached
to him as arise in the case of contractual agency." Similarly, loan incurred
by an agent appointed under the terms of a statute was held binding on the
proprietors.62
In England also, "the law may attribute an agent to a person: for exam-
ple, when a company is first formed, its original directors are its agents by
operation of law....A statute may empower the court to appoint a person
to act on behalf of another and so enable the court to create the relation of
principal and agent. Thus a person appointed by the court to manage the
affairs of a mental patient has been held to be the patient's agent."3

Where the appointment is made by a deed, it is called a "power of attor-
ney". In a case before the Supreme Court's a power of attorney, by which
a person was appointed as a caretaker of certain agricultural lands, was
signed by the three owners of the lands and one of the arguments was that
the appointment was ineffective because how could three persons become
the principals of one agent and that too by a single power of attorney.
Overruling the objection, DESAI J said: "The relationship of agency has its
genesis in a contract. If agency is the outcome of a contract between the
principal and the agent, in order to show that three principals jointly consti-
tuting an agent by a deed called 'Power of Attorney' something which was
impermissible, provisions of the Contract Act or the general law of contract
should have been shown as having been violated by such a contract. Nothing
of the kind was pointed out to us. On the contrary, in HALSBURY'S LAWS
OF ENGLAND," the following proposition has been stated: 'Co-principals
may jointly appoint an agent to act for them and in such case become jointly
liable to him and may jointly sue him.""
The three principals who signed the power of attorney had no joint prop-
erty. Even so the power was regarded to be valid and applicable to their
respective agricultural lands.67
An oral appointment is also valid even though the contract which the
agent is authorised to make has to be in writing.68
Under the Salary Saving Scheme adopted by the Life Insurance Corpo-
ration of India the employer, when authorised by the LIC to collect premium
amount from the salary of an employee and forward it to the LIC, becomes
an agent of the LIC for that purpose. Where such an employer failed in for-
warding the amount to the LIC and consequently the policy was in the state
of lapse at the time of the employee's death, the National Commission under
the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 directed the employer to pay the amount
due to the employee under the policy. The Supreme Court did not approve
this decision and directed the LIC to make payment under the policy. The
employer was directed to pay Rs 25,000 as the costs of the proceedings."
64. Amina Begum v Mohd Ramzan, AIR 2005 Raj 41, the power of attorney carried the words
"general power of attorney" and not "special power of attorney", it related naturally to vari-
ous cases pending in courts and not to any particular transaction. State of Rajasthan v Basant

Creation of agency 749
The court referred to its own earlier decision in Harshad J. Shah v LIC."
The Supreme Court cited the following passage from HALSBURY'S LAWS OF
ENGLAND: "Under the law governing contracts of insurance the premium
may be paid by the assured to the insurers or to an insurance agent acting
on behalf of the insurers and if the agent has the authority to receive it the
payment binds the insurers. The authority need not be an express authority;
it may be implied from the circumstances."
Implied agencies
Implied agencies arise from the conduct, situation or relationship of par-
ties. Whenever a person places another in a situation in which that other.
is understood to represent or to act for him, he becomes an implied agent.
Thus, where a woman allowed her son to drive a car for her, she paying all
the expenses of maintenance and operation, it was held that the son was
an implied agent of the mother and when he made a collision injuring his
wife, the wife could sue the mother for the fault of her agent. A permis-
sion granted to a person to ferry a car from one place to another makes
him an agent for that limited purpose so as to create liability for conse-
quences of negligent driving." The borrower of a car would not occupy that
position.74 Unauthorised pretensions do not have that effect.75 An employer
allowed to collect premiums from his employees and forward the collection
to the organisation, became the implied agent of the latter though described
explicitly in the scheme as the agent of the employees."
Estoppel
One of the well-known illustrations of implied agency is agency by hold-
ing out or estoppel. The principle of holding out has been thus stated in an
American case: "Where a principal has by his voluntary act placed an agent
in such a situation that a person of ordinary prudence, conversant with busi-
ness usages and the nature of the particular business, is justified in presum-
ing that such agent has authority to perform a particular act and therefore
deals with the agent, the principal is estopped as against such third person
from denying the agent's work."77
An early illustration is Pickering v Busk";

authorise the agent to collect premium on behalf of LIC.

A purchaser of hemp allowed it to remain in the custody of the broker
through whom he had bought it. The broker's ordinary business was to
buy and sell hemp. He sold the hemp and received the price.
The Court held that the sale and receipt of money were binding on the
principal. Lord ELLENBOROUGH explained the principle thus: "If a person
authorises another to assume the apparent right of disposing of property in
the ordinary course of trade, it must be presumed that the apparent authority
is the real authority. He may bind the principal within the limits of authority
with which he has been apparently clothed by the principal; and there could
be no safety in commercial transactions if he could not."
An illustration is a decision of the Orissa High Court, in which a land-
lord appointed a tahsildar to manage his agricultural lands. He let out the
lands to tenants on certain terms.
An authority of this kind was not given to him and, therefore, the question
was whether the tenancy agreements would bind the landlord. It was held
that the landlord had, by making the tahsildar incharge of the lands, cre-
ated an appearance of authority which, according to the prevailing usages,
included the right to let.
Husband and wife
A wife living with her husband has the implied authority of the husband
to buy articles of household necessity. In the striking words of Hornby: "As
long as people continue to live in houses, the wife will normally do the
household shopping, and the husband will pay the bills.... The law of prin-
cipal and agent will always cut deeply into the law of husband and wife."80
A wife's implied authority to bind her husband by her credit purchases is,
however, subject to some important limitations. In the first place, it is neces-
sary that the husband and wife should be living together. If the wife is living
apart from the husband without his fault and if she has been left unprovided
for, she may become an agent of necessity of her husband to pledge his credit
to the extent to which a reasonable maintenance makes it necessary, but she
will not be an implied agent."
Secondly, they must be living together in a domestic establishment of
their own. "The mere fact of marriage does not make the wife an agent in
law of her husband"; nor the fact of living together is sufficient. There must
be a domestic establishment of which the wife is the incharge. If there is
a domestic establishment of which a person is acting as the manager, the

Creation of agency 751
presumption of agency will arise even if that person is not the wife. This
well-known principle was established in Debenham v Mellon:
The defendant was the manager of a hotel, where his wife acted as the
manageress. They lived together in the same hotel, but had no domestic
establishment of their own. The wife incurred with a tradesman a debt
for clothes, payment for which was demanded from the husband.
But he was held not liable, the court saying that the mere fact of cohabi-
tation did not give rise to presumption of agency, unless it was in a domestic
establishment.
If these conditions are fulfilled it is immaterial whether the tradesman did
or did not know that the buyer was a married woman.83
Thirdly, the wife can run her husband into debt only for necessaries.
"The domestic arrangement of the family being usually left to the control
of the wife, her authority extends to all those matters which fall within her
department, as, for example, the supply of provisions for the house, clothing
for herself and things of that sort." The word "necessaries" is no doubt
not free from ambiguity. But it has been held to include articles suited to the
style in which the husband chooses to live, because "the husband conducting
himself in the manner of a wealthy man no doubt expects his wife to con-
duct herself in the manner of a wealthy man's wife".85 But the wife cannot
embark upon the purchase of things beyond the station in which they live.86
Thus where the goods supplied to a wife included a gold pen and pencil, a
sealskin cigar case, a sealskin tobacco pouch, a glove and a handkerchief,
the husband was held not liable."7
Lastly, the husband will not be liable if he makes a reasonable allow-
ance to his wife for her needs. Thus, for example, in Girdhari Lal v W.
Crawford the Allahabad High Court held that the husband will not be
liable even if the fact of allowance is not known to the seller.
The husband can negative liability by proving-
(1) that he expressly warned the tradesman not to supply goods on credit;"
(2) that the wife was already supplied with sufficiency of the articles in
question;
(3) that the wife was supplied with sufficient means for the purpose of
buying the articles without pledging the husband's credit.
Further, the (English) Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act, 1970,
which restricts the implied agency of wife, provides in Section 4(1) that:

[S. 185]
"Any rule of law and equity conferring on a wife authority, as agent of
necessity to her husband, to pledge his credit or to borrow money on his
credit is hereby abolished."
Husband not implied agent of wife
A husband has no original, inherent or implied power to act as an agent
for his wife. His authority can arise from an appointment as agent, expressly
or impliedly, or by ratification by his wife of acts done by him on her behalf.
Accordingly, a wife was held not liable on a contract made by her husband
in her name and without her authority when she disaffirmed the contract
within reasonable time after getting to know of it." A husband has no
implied authority to sell his wife's property."
Agencies of necessity
The reason for the agency of necessity has been thus stated by Story:32
"Although the powers of the agents are, ordinarily, limited to particular
acts; yet... extraordinary emergencies may arise, in which a person, who
is an agent, may, from the necessities of the case, be justified in assuming
extraordinary powers; and... his acts fairly done, under such circumstances,
will be binding upon his principal."
Originated with marine adventures
The principal of agency of necessity was first applied to cases of marine
adventures. Unforeseen emergencies may arise in the course of a marine
adventure which may threaten the goods and the master of the ship is not
able to communicate with the principal. In such circumstances the mas-
ter gets the power and it is also his duty to sell the goods in order to save
their value. The sale will bind the cargo owner. Initially it was supposed
"that this doctrine of authority by reason of necessity is confined to certain
well-known exceptional cases, such as those of the master of a ship or the
acceptor of the bill of exchange for the honour of the drawer". But in subse-
quent cases the same principle was applied to carriers by land. Thus, in Sims
& Co v Midland Rly Co:"
A quantity of butter was consigned with the defendant railway com-
pany. It was delayed in transit owing to a strike. The goods being perish-
able the company sold them.
The sale was held binding on the owner. The company's action was jus-
tified by the necessities of the case and it was also not practicable to get
instructions from the owner.

Similarly, in Great Northern Rly Co v Swaffield:"
Creation of agency 753
A horse, having been consigned with the defendant-company, was not
received by anyone at the destination. The company had no arrangement
of its own to keep animals and, therefore, placed the horse with a livery
stable-keeper.
The company's action was held to be reasonably necessary in the circum-
stances and, therefore, the company was allowed to recover the charges of
the stable-keeper.
And then became principle of general application
"Thus the basic principle is a broad and useful one. It lies at the root of
various classes of cases of which the carrier decisions are merely an illustra-
tion." The reason for this wide rule as to agency of necessity was thus stated
by MCCARDIE J in Prager v Blastpiel Stamp & Heacock Ltd:" "The object
of common law is to solve difficulties and adjust relations in social and
commercial life. It must meet, so far as possible, sets of facts abnormal as
well as usual. It must grow with the development of the nation. It must face
and deal with changing or novel circumstances. Unless it can do that it fails
in its function and declines in its dignity and value. An expanding society
demands an expanding common law."
Pre-existing agency not necessary
It was also supposed at one time that agency of necessity is confined to
cases in which there is subsisting relationship of principal and agent and
the agent, in some emergency, exercises an authority which is not expressly
provided in the contract. For example, SCRUTTON LJ observed in Jebara v
Ottoaman that "the agency of necessity develops from an original and
subsisting agency and only applies itself to unforeseen events not provided
for in the original contract". According to him the principle would not apply
"when there is no pre-existing agency, as in the case of a finder of perish-
able chattels or animals". Two cases have been usually cited in support of
this proposition, namely, where the finder of a dog spent money on feed-
ing it," and a person spent money on rescuing logs from a river" and nei-
ther of them could claim a lien on the goods for his trouble and expense.
BOWEN LJ observed in one of the cases on the subject that "liabilities are
not to be forced upon people behind their backs, any more than you can
confer a benefit upon a man against his will"." The case where help is vol-
unteered by a pure stranger are covered in Roman law by the doctrine of

Negotiorum Gestio.100 Referring to this doctrine it is observed in Anson's
LAW OF CONTRACT:10 "Our law does not recognise the negotiorum gestor
of Roman law-the man who voluntarily spends his own money upon the
necessary protection of the property of another."
This may be the general principle of English law. But exceptions have
been admitted. A person who carries on salvage at sea is entitled to his com-
pensation from the person whose property has been salvaged.102 Similarly,
where a bill of exchange has been dishonoured either by non-acceptance or
by non-payment, any person may honour it by acceptance or payment for
protecting the honour of the drawer and may subsequently recover from
such person. But it has been pointed out by Lord GODDARD CJ in Sacha v
Milkos 103 "that the court should be slow to increase the classes of those who
can be looked upon as agents of necessity in selling or disposing of other
people's goods without the authority of the owners".
"In the United States it is fairly clear law that a finder of lost goods is
entitled to recover from the owner his necessary and reasonable expenses
incurred in the successful recovery and preservation of the goods." 104 In
India a finder has no right of action, but he is entitled to lien unless his law-
ful charges are paid. He has also a limited right of sale. [S. 177]
Relief of injured persons
Another occasion for a person to act as an agent of necessity arises when
an injured person is in urgent need of medical attendance. Any person acting
on his behalf may call the services of a doctor; or any doctor may volunteer
his services. The person benefited is bound to pay the charges of the service.
Williston in his article on Agency of Necessity 105 cites the following cases as
an illustration of the principle:
In Matheson v Smiley106 the Manitoba Court of Appeal held that at
surgeon was entitled to recover from the deceased man's estate reasonable
remuneration for his services when he had, without request, given aid to
a man who had attempted suicide.

Creation of agency 755
INABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH PRINCIPAL.-"In the first place, it
is of course clear that agency of necessity does not arise if the agent can
communicate with his principal. The basis of this requirement is that if the
principal's directions can be obtained the agent should ask it before acting."
A well-known illustration is Gwilliam v Twist.108
While the defendants' omnibus was being driven by their servant, a
policeman, thinking that the driver was drunk, ordered him to discon-
tinue driving, the omnibus being then only a quarter of a mile from the
defendants' yard. The driver and the conductor then authorised a person'
who happened to be standing by to drive the omnibus home. That person
through his negligence injured the plaintiff.
The plaintiff's action against the owners failed, because the defendants
might have been easily communicated with and, therefore, there was no
necessity for their servants to employ another person.
ACT SHOULD BE REASONABLY NECESSARY.-"In the next place, it is
essential for the agent to prove that the sale was necessary. What does this
mean?"109 LINDLEY LJ observed in a case that "by necessary is meant rea-
sonably necessary and in considering what is reasonably necessary every
material circumstances must be taken into account, e.g. danger, distance,
accommodation, expense, time and so forth".110 Sacha v Milkos is an illus-
tration explaining absence of necessity:
The defendant allowed the plaintiff to store certain furniture in his
house free of charge. Thereafter they lost touch with each other. Some
three years later the defendant needed the space taken up by the furniture
and wrote two letters to the plaintiff at an address supplied by his bank,
but received no reply. His attempt to reach the plaintiff by telephone also
failed. He then sold the furniture. Six years later the plaintiff claimed the
furniture.
It was held that those facts gave rise to no agency of necessity since they
exhibited nothing in the nature of an emergency compelling the defendant to
sell the furniture. As to the question of damages the court pointed out that
if the plaintiff received the letters, he would be entitled to recover only the
actual sale proceeds of the furniture. But that if he did not receive the letters,
he would be entitled to compensation for the increased value of furniture
between the date of sale and his discovery of it.
A year later the same court faced another problem of the same kind in
Munro v Willmott.112

[S. 185]
The plaintiff left her car in the defendant's yard without payment. The
storage was intended to be for a short time, but the car remained there for
several years. It became an obstacle owing to the conversion of the yard
into a garage. After unsuccessful efforts to communicate with the plain-
tiff the car was repaired and sold.
The court held that the facts showed no emergency which would have
entitled the defendant to sell as an agent of necessity.
Another interesting decision is Prager v Blastpiel Stamp & Heacock
Ltd.113
During the First World War the defendant purchased for the plaintiffs,
as their agents, fur skins to be despatched to Romania. Owing to the
occupation of Romania by German forces it became impossible for the
defendants to send the skins or any communication to the plaintiffs. In
the last year of the war, the defendants sold the skins.
When peace returned the plaintiffs claimed their goods. The defendants
sought to justify their action under the principle of agency of necessity. But
the court held that there was no necessity to sell the goods. They had been
purchased by the plaintiff in time of war in the hope of receiving them when
peace arrived. The goods being dressed furs were not likely to deteriorate if
care was used.
BONA FIDE IN THE INTEREST OF PARTY CONCERNED.-"In the third
place, an alleged agent of necessity must satisfy the court that he was acting
bona fide in the interest of the parties concerned. In Tronson v Dent,1+ the
Privy Council plainly indicated that bona fides was essential in addition to
actual necessity."115
Relations of principal and agent
DUTIES OF AGENT
Mutual rights and duties of principal and agent may be wholly provided
for in their contract. But the following duties of general nature are imposed
by law upon every agent, unless they are modified or excluded by special
contract.
1. Duty to execute mandate
The first and the foremost duty of every agent is to carry out the mandate
of his principal. He should perform the work which he has been appointed
to do. Any failure in this respect would make the agent absolutely liable for
the principal's loss. Thus it has been held in a number of cases that: “The
rule of equity is, that if an order is sent by a principal to a factor to make an

insurance, and he charges his principal, as if it was made, if he never in fact
made that insurance, he is considered as the insurer himself."!!
In such cases the agent is held liable to the principal for the amount which
would have been recovered if the goods had been insured.17 Thus, for exam-
ple, in Pannalal Jankidas v Mohanlal:118
A commission agent purchased goods for his principal and stored them
in a godown pending their despatch. The agent was under instruction to
insure them. He actually charged the premium for insurance, but failed
to insure the goods. The goods were lost in an explosion in the Bombay
harbour.
The agent was held liable to compensate the principal for his loss
minus the amount received under the Bombay Explosion (Compensation)
Ordinance, 1944, under which the Government paid compensation up to
fifty per cent in respect of the uninsured merchandise lost in the explosion.119
2. Duty to follow instructions or customs [S. 211]
S. 211. Agent's duty in conducting principal's business.-An agent is
bound to conduct the business of his principal according to the directions given
by the principal, or in the absence of any such directions, according to the cus-
tom which prevails in doing business of the same kind at the place where the
agent conducts such business. When the agent acts otherwise, if any loss be
sustained, he must make it good to his principal, and if any profit accrues, he
must account for it.
Illustrations
(a) A, an agent engaged in carrying on for B a business, in which it is the custom to invest
from time to time, at interest, the moneys which may be in hand, omits to make such
investment. A must make good to B the interest usually obtained by such investments.
(b) B, a broker, in whose business, it is not the custom to sell on credit, sells goods of A on
credit to C, whose credit at the time was very high. C, before payment, becomes insol-
vent. B must make good the loss to A.
Section 211 provides that an agent is bound to conduct the business of his
principal according to the directions given by the principal and to keep him-
self within the confines of his authority. For example, an estate agent cannot
make a binding contract on behalf of his principal with a third party,120 In
the absence of directions, the agent has to follow the custom which prevails
in businesses of the same kind and at the place where the agent conducts
such businesses. When the agent acts otherwise, if any loss be sustained,

[S. 211]
he must make it good to his principal, and, if any profit accrues, he must
account for it. [S. 212] Thus, for example, in Lilley v Doubleday;122
An agent was instructed to warehouse his principal's goods at a par-
ticular place. He placed a part of them at a different warehouse which
was equally safe. But the goods were destroyed without negligence.
The agent was held liable for the loss. Any disobedience of, or departure
from, the instructions makes the agent absolutely liable for the loss.123
Where a principal had given instructions of ambiguous nature which
were capable of two meanings, he was not permitted to argue as against the
agent that he should have read the instruction in the other sense than what
he actually did.124
In the absence of instructions, business customs must be followed. Where,
for example, the customs of a particular trade require that goods should not
be sold on credit or in return for a negotiable instrument, the agent should
not do so. If he does so, he would be liable to the principal for any loss
resulting from the transaction.125 In reference to a broker the importance
of acting according to customs was highlighted in the following words: 126
"Brokers employed to sell goods are bound to do so in the usual way, and
if it is usual to send the seller an estimate of value in order that he may be
enabled to fix a reserve price, they ought to do so; and whether it is so or
not they are bound for their own guidance to make a careful estimate of the
value; and if they sell, even by public auction at a price much below their
fair value, then not having made such an estimate, will be evidence of negli-
gence, and if a loss is caused thereby, they will be liable."
Where a booking agent did not prepare the airway bill with proper skill
and diligence inasmuch as the relevant boxes relating to the items as to 'cash.

Duties of agent 759
he being in breach of duty, he was not allowed to recover his expenses in
arranging consignment of the goods.127
Akin to this is the duty to maintain the business secrets of the principal. A
bank is under a similar duty of secrecy so far as the customer's dealings with
him are concerned and would be liable in damages if any loss is caused to
the customer by leakage of secret information. Certain currency notes were
deposited with a bank for demonetisation. The bank informed the Income
Tax Authorities and the customer thereby lost the utilisation of that money.
Even so the customer's action against the bank failed. The bank was under a
higher national duty which superseded the duty to the customer.128
An agent is also under a duty to maintain confidence, secrecy and non-dis-
closure of any sensitive information about the affairs of his principal. A
banker may be liable if the state of his customer's account is leaked, except
where the disclosure is under compulsion of law, e.g., duty to obey an order
under Bankers' Books Evidence Act, or under higher duty owed to State or
public institutions which supersedes lower duty or under any statement in a
formal claim or with customer's permission.129
3. Duty of reasonable care and skill [S. 212]
S. 212. Skill and diligence required from agent.-An agent is bound to
conduct the business of the agency with as much skill as is generally possessed
by persons engaged in similar business, unless the principal has notice of his
want of skill. The agent is always bound to act with reasonable diligence, and
to use such skill as he possesses; and to make compensation to his principal
in respect of the direct consequences of his own neglect, want of skill or mis-
conduct, but not in respect of loss or damage which are indirectly or remotely
caused by such neglect, want of skill, or misconduct.
Illustrations
(a) A, a merchant in Calcutta, has an agent, B, in London, to whom a sum of money is paid
on A's account, with orders to remit. B retains the money for a considerable time. A, in
consequence of not receiving the money, becomes insolvent. B is liable for the money
and interest from the day on which it ought to have been paid, according to the usual
rate, and for any further direct loss-as e.g., by variation of rate of exchange--but not
further.
(b) A, an agent for the sale of goods, having authority to sell on credit, sells to B on credit,
without making the proper and usual enquiries as to the solvency of B. B, at the time of
such sale, is insolvent. A must make compensation to his principal in respect of any loss
thereby sustained.
(c) A, an insurance-broker employed by B to effect an insurance on a ship, omits to see that
the usual clauses are inserted in the policy. The ship is afterwards lost. In consequence
of the omission of the clauses nothing can be recovered from the underwriters. A is
bound to make good the loss to B.

(d) A, a merchant in England, directs B, his agent at Bombay, who accepts the agency, to
send him 100 bales of cotton by a certain ship. B, having it in his power to send the cot-
ton, omits to do so. The ship arrives safely in England. Soon after her arrival the price of
cotton rises. B is bound to make good to A the profit which he might have made by the
100 bales of cotton at the time the ship arrived, but not any profit he might have made
by the subsequent rise.
131
Thus every agent is bound to carry on the business of agency with reason-
able skill and care.130 For example, a bank was instructed by the plaintiff
to collect a certain amount on his behalf and to remit it to him. There was
no specific instruction as to the manner of remittance. The bank sent the
amount by draft placed in a letter sent by ordinary post. The bank was held
negligent in sending the amount like that. Certain cheques were paid into a
bank for collection. The bank sent them to the drawee bank for collection,
but they were lost in transit. The bank was held liable to the customer for
the principal value of the cheques.132
The standard of care and skill which an agent has to bestow depends upon
the nature of his profession.133 An agent, having authority to sell on credit,
must take care to ascertain the solvency of his buyer. An insurance broker
must see that usual clauses for the protection of the principal are inserted
in the policy. An estate agent should know the land laws and also must
take care to ascertain the solvency of the tenant. If an agent is retained
for assisting his principal for lending money on a mortgage, he must make
reasonable inquiry about the value of the property. A stockbroker should
know the regulations of the stock exchange. An agent should command
enough legal knowledge to sufficiently and adequately safeguard the inter-
ests of the principal in the course of the agency. He may become answer-
able for the incompetence of the labour employed by him.137
135
If the principal suffers any loss owing to the agent's want of care or skill,
the agent must compensate the principal for such loss. Section 212 limits the
agent's liability to "direct consequences". 138 It provides that the agent must
"make compensation to his principal in respect of the direct consequences
of his own neglect, want of skill or misconduct, but not in respect of loss
130. Duties and liabilities are the same whether the agent is working for consideration or without
it. Agnew v Indian Carrying Co, (1865) 2 Mad HC Cases 449.

differently. Raja Ram v Abdul Rashim, (1973) 9 SLR 77: (1915) 31 IC 450; Lagunas Nitrate

Duties of agent 761
or damage which are indirectly or remotely caused by such neglect, want of
skill or misconduct". If, for example, an agent fails to send the principal's
money in time, he may be liable for the money and the loss of interest, but
not if the principal becomes insolvent by that reason. An example of direct
loss is to be seen in the facts of Keppel v Wheeler, An agent was appointed
to sell a house. He received an offer which he promptly communicated to
his principal. The latter accepted it provisionally "subject to contract".
Subsequently the agent received a higher offer which he failed to pass on to
the principal. This resulted in final acceptance of the first offer in ignorance
of the second. The agent was held liable to make good the principal's loss in
terms of the difference in the two prices.
The meaning of the expression "direct consequences" has been explained
by the Supreme Court in Pannalal Jankidas v Mohanlal™40:
An agent, having been instructed to insure certain goods, failed to do
so. The goods were lost in an explosion at the docks. Even if the agent
had taken out a fire insurance policy in the usual form it would not have
covered a loss of this kind, as fire due to explosion would have been an
excepted peril. But the Bombay Government passed an ordinance under
which it undertook to pay half loss in cases of uninsured goods. Thus the
principal got only half of what he would have got if the goods had been
insured.
The agent contended that as the passing of the Ordinance could not have
been anticipated, the loss was too remote. But, it was held by a majority,
that the loss was the direct result of the agent's negligence. Their Lordships,
following English decisions, felt that the intervention of the Government
Ordinance did not break the chain of causation. KANIA CJ said: "Once
misconduct is admitted or proved the fact that the Ordinance did not exist
and could not have been in the contemplation of the parties is irrelevant for
deciding the question of liability."
In cases of difficulty the agent's duty is to use all reasonable diligence in
communicating with his principal, and in seeking to obtain his instructions,
if the principal can be communicated with by reasonable care, before taking
any steps in facing the difficulty or emergency.12
S. 214. Agent's duty to communicate with principal.-It is the duty of
an agent, in cases of difficulty, to use all reasonable diligence of communicating
with his principal, and in seeking to obtain his instructions.

would be despatched as soon as transport strike was over whereas he had
done nothing in the matter, it was held by the Supreme Court that such a
neglect and misconduct of the agent misinforming the principal was squarely
within the wide terms of Section 212. "He must bear the brunt to pay dam-
ages," the court said.143
4. Duty to avoid conflict of interest
S.215. Right of principal when agent deals, on his own account, in busi-
ness of agency without principal's consent.--If an agent deals on his own
account in the business of the agency, without first obtaining the consent of
his principal and acquainting him with all material circumstances which have
come to his own knowledge on the subject, the principal may repudiate the
transaction, if the case shows, either that any material fact has been dishonestly
concealed from him by the agent, or that the dealings of the agent have been
disadvantageous to him.
Illustrations
(a) A directs B to sell A's estate. B buys the estate for himself in the name of C. A, on discov-
ering that B has bought the estate for himself, may repudiate the sale, if he can show
that B has dishonestly concealed any material fact, or that the sale has been disadvan-
tageous to him.
(b) A directs B to sell A's estate. B, on looking over the estate before selling it, finds a mine
on the estate which is unknown to A. B informs A that he wishes to buy the estate for
himself, but conceals the discovery of the mine. A allows B to buy in ignorance of the
existence of the mine. A, on discovering that B knew of the mine at the time he bought
the estate, may either repudiate or adopt the sale at his option.
S. 216. Principal's right to benefit gained by agent dealing on his own
account in business of agency.-If an agent, without the knowledge of his
principal, deals in the business of the agency on his own account instead of on
account of his principal, the principal is entitled to claim from the agent any
benefit which may have resulted to him from the transaction.
Illustration
A directs B, his agent, to buy a certain house for him. B tells A it cannot be bought, and
buys the house for himself. A may, on discovering that B has bought the house, compel him
to sell it to A at the price he gave for it.
An agent occupies fiduciary position and, therefore, it is his duty not to
do anything which would bring his personal interest and his duty to the
principal in conflict with each other. This conflict invariably arises when
the agent is personally interested in the principal's transaction, for example,
where he himself buys the property he is appointed to sell or delivers his own
goods when he is instructed to buy on behalf of the principal. A stockbro-
ker was employed to buy some shares for his principal. He submitted to his

principal for signature certain papers which showed that the purchase was
being effected in the market. But, in fact, the agent was transferring his own
shares to the principal. The principal was allowed to claim rescission.144 A
well-known illustration is the case of De Busche v Alt:45
The plaintiff consigned a ship to a company in China for sale "at
£90,000 payable in cash". With the consent of the plaintiff the company
appointed the defendant, a Japanese agent, to sell the ship. The defendant
attempted to sell the ship, but having failed to find a customer, bought the
ship himself and without disclosing this, remitted the above sum through
the company to the plaintiff. Soon thereafter a war broke out and ships
were again in great demand. A Japanese prince bought it from the defend-
ant at £1,60,000. The plaintiff sued the defendant to recover the profit
made on resale.
He was held bound to account for the profit. There would have been
nothing wrong if the agent had bought the ship after disclosing the fact to
his principal. The agent might have been honest in this particular case. But
if his contention was accepted, many an agent would make secret profits by
feigning inability to sell.146
The principle is incorporated in Section 215, which provides that if an
agent deals on his own account in the business of agency, without first
obtaining the consent of his principal and acquainting him with full facts,
the principal may repudiate the transaction if he can show that-
(a) a material fact has been dishonestly concealed from him, or
(b) the dealing of the agent has been disadvantageous to him.147
The first illustration to the section says that if the agent has secretly
bought the principal's property for himself, the principal may repudiate the
transaction if he can show that the agent has concealed any material fact
or that the sale has been disadvantageous to him. Where, for example, the
agent discovers a mine on the principal's estate and without disclosing this
fact buys the estate for himself, the principal may repudiate the transaction.
The mere fact of the agent buying the principal's property brings his interest
in conflict with his duty to the principal and, therefore, it has been pointed
out that the conflict is in itself a sufficient disadvantage to the principal.14
144. Armstrong v Jackson, (1917) 2 KB 822. WILLIES J observed in Mollett v Robinson, (1870)
LR 5 CP 646, 655 that "it is an axiom of the law of principal and agent that a broker
employed to sell cannot himself become the buyer without distinct notice to the principal so
that the latter may object to it if he thinks proper".
145. (1878) LR 8 Ch D 286.
146. The principle is applicable even where there is a mere possibility of conflict and the agent acts
in good faith. Boardman v Phipps, (1967) 2 AC 46: (1966) 3 WLR 1009 (HL).
147. Detriment of the principal is a question of fact. Firm of Rameshardas Benarashidas v
Tansookhrai Bashesharilal Firm, AIR 1927 Sind 195. Repudiation by the principal must be
within reasonable time after discovering the facts. Armstrong v Jackson, (1917) 2 KB 822:

5. Duty not to make secret profit
[S. 216]
Another aspect of this principle is the duty of the agent not to make any
secret profit in the business of agency. His relationship with the principal is
of fiduciary nature and this requires absolute good faith in the conduct of
agency. What is meant by secret profit? It means any advantage obtained
by the agent over and above his agreed remuneration and which he would
not have been able to make but for his position as agent. Acceptance of
bribe is a profit of this kind, even "if the employers are not actually injured,
and the bribe fails to have the intended effect". A military officer who
took bribe and allowed goods to pass under the authority of his uniform,
was held liable to account for the same to the Crown.150 Similarly, where
an auctioneer received from the buyer commission in addition to what his
principal paid him, he was held bound to hand over the commission to the
principal.is
Where an agent sells his own stock to the principal without disclosing
the fact, he is bound to account for any profit he made in the transaction.
It is immaterial that the agent charged only the prevailing market price.152
A principal agreed to buy horses from a dealer provided that his veteri-
nary surgeon would pass them as sound. The seller bribed the surgeon and
obtained his certificate. The horses turned out to be unsound. The principal
was held justified in rejecting them and countermanding the cheque which
he had issued for the price.153
Knowledge which is acquired by an agent in the course of the business of
agency and which he converts into advantage does not require accountabil-
ity if the agent neither uses the principal's property in the process nor diverts
his business opportunities.154
As a part of the agent's duty to be honest to his principal, it is necessary
that the agent should not disclose any confidential information received by
this bare conflict must be shown. Grant v Gold Exploration and Development Syndicate
Ltd, (1900) 1 QB 233 (CA), an agent for sale and purchase cannot act for the other party
at the same time or take a commission from him unknown to the principal. Nabi Khan v
Roojdar, AIR 2010 Raj 128, agent appointed to sell land, sold it below natural price and that
too to his own father, thus self-dealing, recovery of property by the principal ordered.

him from his principal. If he does so, the principal may terminate the con-
tract and hold the agent liable in damages for his loss, if any,155
6. Duty to remit sums [S. 218]
S. 218. Agent's duty to pay sums received for principal.-Subject to
such deductions, the agent is bound to pay to his principal all sums received
on his account.
The agent is bound to pay to his principal all sums received on his account.
The agent is, however, entitled to deduct his lawful charges, but subject only
to this right, the principal's money must be remitted to him even if it has
been received in pursuance to a void or illegal contract. The agent has to
perform this duty even if his earnings for the principal flow out of void or
illegal transactions. "If an agent receives money on his principal's behalf
under an illegal and void contract, the agent must account to the principal
for the money so received and cannot set up the illegality of contract as a
justification for withholding payment, which illegality the other contracting
party has waived by paying the amount."157
The agent has the right to make a counter claim. The Bombay High Court
did not consider it fair or in the interest of justice to compel the agent to
deposit the amount in the court as a measure of protecting his principal,
particularly when there was a claim against the claim.158
7. Duty to maintain accounts [S. 213]
S. 213. Agent's accounts.-An agent is bound to render proper accounts
to his principal on demand.
Accounts are necessary for the proper performance of the agent's other
duties, for example, the duty to remit sums to the principal.159
There is no provision in the Act enabling an agent to institute a suit for
accounts against the principal. The Supreme Court in Narandas Morardas
Gajiwala v S.P.A.M. Papammal60 laid down that the provisions of the
Contract Act are not exhaustive in this regard and that the right of an agent
to sue the principal for accounts is an equitable right arising under special

[S. 213]
circumstances. One of those special circumstances is where all the accounts
are in the possession of the principal. In a case before the Madras High
Court, 161 an agent was running a mill which was taken over by the own-
ers. The agent claimed that he lost his accounts in the process of take-over
and, therefore, claimed accounts from the principal. The court did not pro-
vide him any relief because he was not able to give any proof of the loss of
his accounts. Where an agent was appointed to secure orders for supply
of goods, his commission to be payable when the principal received pay-
ment for supplies, it was held that quite naturally an account would have
to be maintained by the principal and the agent had the right to demand an
account. The same is the position where the accounts are so complicated
that a suit for a definite sum of money is not possible. In cases where set-
tlement of accounts alone can do complete justice between the parties, the
agent can sue the principal for accounting even if he is having some evidence
of the transaction with him.163
The Lahore High Court faced a case of this kind in Ram Lal Kapur &
Sons v Asian Commercial Assurance Co Ltd¹* TAPP J observed: "The right
to claim a statement of accounts is an unusual form of relief, only granted
in certain specific cases and is only to be claimed when the relationship
between the parties is such that this is the only relief which will enable the
claimant to satisfactorily assert his legal rights."
In that case, the plaintiffs, who were insurance agents, were to be remu-
nerated by a commission calculated on the premia paid on all policies
effected or introduced through them. The court held that as the plaintiffs
could not know which of the policies had lapsed, matured or forfeited, they
were entitled to demand rendition of accounts.
The Sind High Courts explained the position in the following words:
"An agent has no statutory right to the account from his principal.
Nevertheless where it is equitable from the particular circumstances and
the relationship of the parties that one should account to the other, a suit
for account will lie. If an agent can satisfy that all accounts are rightly in
possession of the principal and that he (the agent) has not and could not
have in his possession accounts which would enable him to determine his
claim for commission against his principal, he will be entitled to sue for
an account. But if it is found that the agent has no accounts because of his
own failure or fault, he should not be granted the relief he claims, much
less if it is found that he has accounts which he is withholding."
A suit by an agent against his principal for a specific sum of money is
not a suit for accounts. It is only in exceptional cases where the agent's

remuneration depends on the extent of dealings which are not known to him
or where he cannot be aware of the amount due to him unless the accounts
of his principal are gone into, that a suit by an agent for accounts against his
principal might be competent.166
The Division Bench of the Nagpur High Court allowed a sale pusher of
books to know from his principal an account of the volume of sale induced
by his efforts,167
The principle behind these rulings was affirmed by the Supreme Court in
Narandas Morardas Gajiwala v S.P.A.M. Papammal.168 The agent sued for
an account and the principal sought enforcement of promissory note given
by the agent to the principal. The court passed a decree on the promissory
note subject to set-off for amounts due from the principal to the agent. The
principal thus became accountable for those dues. 169
Inspection of agent's accounts.
Conceding the right to the principal of inspecting his underwriting agent's
computerised accounts, the court said: "That obligation to provide an accu-
rate account in the fullest sense arises by reason of the fact that the agent has
been entrusted with the authority to bind the principal to transactions with
third parties and the principal is entitled to know what his personal contrac-
tual rights and duties are in relation to those third parties as well as what he
is entitled to receive by way of payment from the agent. He is entitled to be
provided with those records because they have been created for preserving
information as to the very transactions which the agent was authorised by
him to enter into.
Being the participant in the transactions, the principal is entitled to the
records of them."170
Explaining the source of the agent's obligation to maintain accounts
and to provide inspection the court held that the obligation to keep records
and provide records to the principal arises out of the agency relationship.
and does not depend on that relationship having been created by contract.
The duty would coexist with a contract of agency. The express arrange-
ments for inspection do not oust this, though they qualify the implied duty,
for instance, by relieving the agent of duty to deliver their original books,
accounts and records.
The duty to provide access to the records survives the termination of the
contract. It would be extremely inconvenient and potentially very damag-
ing to the principal if the obligation does not survive termination of the

contract. It is clear that there can be obligations under the contract which
do survive its termination. The classic example is of course an agreement for
arbitration,171
The principal specifically admitted that he was ready to settle all claims
and liabilities. The court said that such claim revealed that there was neces
sity for rendition of accounts. Accounts were still not crystallised. The suit
for rendition of accounts was maintainable.172
8. Duty not to delegate [S. 190]
Delegatus non potest delegare is a well-known maxim of the law of
agency. The principal chooses a particular agent because he has trust and
confidence in his integrity and competence. Ordinarily, therefore, the agent
cannot further delegate the work which has been delegated to him by his
principal.
It was laid down in John McCain and Co v Pow" that unless so author-
ised by the principal, an estate agent has no right to appoint a sub-agent and
delegate to him his powers which require special skill and care. No implied
authority could be pleaded. In this case the sub-agent effected a sale on his
own account. The agent (plaintiff) had sued for his commission. The court.
negatived the claim as the contract of agency did not permit appointment of
sub-agent.
This principle and its exceptions are stated in Section 190:1
S. 190. When agent cannot delegate.-An agent cannot lawfully employ
another to perform acts which he has expressly or impliedly undertaken to per-
form personally, unless by the ordinary custom of trade a sub-agent may, or,
from the nature of the agency, a sub-agent must, be employed.
But there are exceptions. In the following cases the agent may delegate the
work to another:
1. Nature of work
Sometimes the very nature of work makes it necessary for the agent to
appoint a sub-agent. For example, an agent appointed to sell an estate may
retain the services of an auctioneer and the one authorised to file a suit may
engage a lawyer. A banker instructed to make payment to a particular per-
son at the particular place may appoint a banker who has an office at that
place. A banker authorised to let out a house and collect rents may entrust
the work to an estate agent." 175

[Ss. 191 & 193]
2. Trade custom
Duties of agent 769
Secondly, a sub-agent may be appointed and the work delegated to him
if there is ordinary custom of trade to that effect. Thus architects generally
appoint surveyors.17
3. Ministerial action
An agent cannot, of course, delegate acts which he has expressly or
impliedly undertaken to perform personally, e.g., acts requiring personal or
professional skill. But the agent may delegate acts which are purely ministe-
rial in nature, e.g., authority to sign. 177
4. Principal's consent
The principal may expressly allow his agent to appoint a sub-agent. His
consent may also be implied from the conduct of the parties. The principal
may ratify his agent's unauthorised delegation.
A person who is appointed by the agent and to whom the principal's work
is delegated is known as "sub-agent". Section 191 defines "sub-agent" as "a
person appointed by and acting under the control of the original agent in the
business of the agency".
S. 191. "Sub-agent" defined.-A "sub-agent" is a person employed by,
and acting under the control of, the original agent in the business of the agency.
In a case before the Supreme Court:178
A person had sent certain parcels by VPP to a destination in Pakistan.
The articles reached Pakistan. They were delivered to the addressee and
their value was collected. The Government of Pakistan, having snapped
the postal treaty with the Government of India, did not forward the
amount. The Indian Post Office could not pay to the sender. The sender
sued the Government.
Holding the Government not liable, the court said that when two sover-
eign powers enter into a postal treaty, neither of them can be described as an
agent of the other. Neither can be said to be employed or acting under the
control of the other as required of a sub-agent under Section 191.
When a sub-agent is appointed, what relationship is constituted between.
the principal and the sub-agent and the agent? The answer depends upon
whether the sub-agent has been properly or improperly appointed.
1. Improper delegation [S. 193]
S. 193. Agent's responsibility for sub-agent appointed without
authority. Where an agent, without having authority to do so, has appointed
appointing an advocate; Ramdeo Tilokchand Agarwal v Lalu Natha, AIR 1937 Nag 65, a

[S. 192]
a person to act as a sub-agent, the agent stands towards such person in the
relation of a principal to an agent, and is responsible for his acts both to the
principal and to third persons; the principal is not represented by or responsible
for the acts of the person so employed, nor is that person responsible to the
principal.
Delegation is improper when it is not authorised, that is, when it is not
within any of the recognised exceptions. The effect is that the principal is
not bound by the appointment. He is not represented by that person, nor
bound by his acts. That person is also not responsible to the principal. But
the agent will be responsible to the principal for any act of that person. The
agent stands in the position of principal towards that person and is as such
responsible for his acts to third parties.179
2. Proper delegation [S. 192]
S. 192. Representation of principal by sub-agent properly appoin-
ted. Where a sub-agent is properly appointed, the principal is, so far as regards
third persons, represented by the sub-agent and is bound by and responsible
for his acts, as if he were an agent originally appointed by the principal.
Agent's responsibility for sub-agent.-The agent is responsible to the
principal for the acts of the sub-agent.
Sub-agent's responsibility.-The sub-agent is responsible for his acts to
the agent, but not to the principal, except in case of fraud or wilful wrong.
In Calico Printers' Assn v Barclays Bank 180 WRIGHT Jexplained the effect
of proper delegation:
"Even where the sub-agent is properly employed, there is no privity
between him and the principal; the latter is entitled to hold the agent
liable for breach of the mandate, which he has accepted, and cannot, in
general claim against the sub-agent for negligence or breach of duty."
The following effects of the appointment are stated in Section 192:
1. Principal represented by sub-agent
In the first place, so far as regards third persons, the principal is repre-
sented by the sub-agent. He is bound by and responsible for his acts as if he
were an agent originally appointed by the principal.181
179. A person who was appointed as a sole agent was held to have no authority to delegate.

[S. 192]
2. Agent's responsibility for sub-agent
Duties of agent 771
Secondly, the agent is responsible to the principal for the acts of the sub-
agent. If, for example, the sub-agent has misappropriated the principal's
property or its sale-proceeds, the agent is responsible for the same. There is
no privity of contract between the principal and the sub-agent and, there-
fore, he cannot sue the sub-agent, except for fraud or wilful wrong. Even
where fraud or wilful wrong is established the principal has the choice to
sue either the agent or the sub-agent.182 But the agent may exempt himself
from such liability,183
3. Sub-agent's liability to principal
The sub-agent is not directly liable to the principal, except for fraud and
wilful wrong. A well-known illustration is Calico Printers' Assn v Barclays
Bank184
A sub-agent failed to insure the principal's goods, which were destroyed
by fire. But the principal could not recover against the sub-agent.
Similarly, in Summan Singh v N.C. Bank of New York:185
The plaintiff in a foreign country appointed the N.C. Bank to deliver
a sum of money to one Pritam Singh of Jullundur, whose address was
given. The bank instructed its Bombay branch accordingly. The Bombay
branch appointed the Punjab National Bank which delivered the money
to a wrong person.
The plaintiff's action against either bank failed. The Punjab National
Bank was held not liable on the principle that a sub-agent is not liable to
the principal except when he is guilty of fraud or wilful wrong. The wrong
delivery was due only to negligence. The N.C. Bank had exempted itself
from the consequences of wrong delivery.
A sub-agent is, however, bound by all the duties of an ordinary agent.
His rights cannot go beyond those of the main agent and they have to be
exercised through the agent except where direct action would be necessary
to give business efficacy to the appointment of a sub-agent. Where a sub-
agent (fire-protection coating specialist) was appointed on agreed basis for
the purpose of coating the 52-storey building undertaken by the contractor,
it was held to be an implied term that his work would not be rejected except
on reasonable basis. A sub-broker was allowed to recover his agreed com-
mission from the broker irrespective of the fact whether the broker had been

paid by the principal or not. The court said that it wholly depends upon
terms of the appointment as interpreted in the background of factual back-
ground of market practices.187
Substituted agent [Ss. 194-195]
S. 194. Relation between principal and person duly appointed by agent
to act in business of agency.-Where an agent, holding an express or implied
authority to name another person to act for the principal in the business of the
agency, has named another person accordingly, such person is not a sub-agent
but an agent of the principal for such part of the business of the agency as is
entrusted to him.
Illustrations
(a) A directs B, his solicitor, to sell estate by auction, and to employ an auctioneer for the
purpose. B names C, an auctioneer, to conduct the sale. C is not a sub-agent, but is A's
agent for the conduct of the sale.
(b) A authorises B, a merchant in Calcutta to recover the moneys due to A from C & Co B
instructs D, a solicitor, to take legal proceedings against C & Co, for the recovery of the
money. D is not a sub-agent, but is solicitor for A.
S. 195. Agent's duty in naming such person.-In selecting such agent for
his principal, an agent is bound to exercise the same amount of discretion as a
man of ordinary prudence would exercise in his own case; and, if he does this,
he is not responsible to the principal for the acts or negligence of the agent so
selected.
Illustrations
(a) A instructs B, a merchant, to buy a ship for him. B employs a ship surveyor of good rep-
utation to choose a ship for A. The surveyor makes the choice negligently and the ship
turns out to be unseaworthy and is lost. B is not, but the surveyor is, responsible to A.
(b) A consigns goods to B, a merchant, for sale. B, in due course, employs an auctioneer in
good credit to sell the goods of A, and allows the auctioneer to receive the proceeds of
the sale. The auctioneer afterwards becomes insolvent without having accounted for
the proceeds. B is responsible to A for the proceeds.
A sub-agent has to be distinguished from a substituted agent. Sections 194
and 195 contain special provisions about substituted agents. According to
Section 194 when an agent has an express or implied authority of his prin-
cipal to name a person to act for him and the agent has accordingly named
a person, such person is not a sub-agent, but he becomes an agent for the
principal in respect of the business which is entrusted to him. The two illus-
trations to the section further explain the position of a substituted agent.
A solicitor is appointed to sell an estate by auction and to employ an auc-
tioneer for the purpose. The auctioneer thus appointed is not a sub-agent
but an agent of the employer himself for the purpose of the sale. Similarly,
when an agent is authorised to recover debts and he appoints a solicitor for

Duties of agent 773
the purpose, the latter is not a sub-agent, but a full-fledged agent for the
purpose.188
One of the effects of appointing a substitute is that a direct privity of
contract is established between the principal and the "substitute". The agent
is not concerned about the work of the substitute. His only duty is to make
the selection of the substitute with reasonable care. Section 195 says that
"in selecting such agent for his principal, an agent is bound to exercise the
same amount of discretion as a man of ordinary prudence would exercise
in his own case; and, if he does this he is not responsible to the principal
for the acts or negligence of the agent so selected". The two illustrations
appended to the section explain the point. A merchant is instructed to buy
a ship for his principal. The merchant employs a ship surveyor of good rep-
utation to choose a ship for the principal. The surveyor makes the choice
negligently, the ship turns out to be unseaworthy, and is lost. The surveyor,
but not the agent, is liable to the principal. In the second illustration, goods
are consigned to a merchant for sale. The merchant employs an auctioneer
in good credit to sell the goods and allows him to receive the proceeds.
The auctioneer becomes bankrupt without having accounted for the pro-
ceeds to the principal. The merchant is responsible to the principal for the
proceeds.
Remedies of principal for breach of duty
"A principal has threefold rights against an agent who fails in his duty:
(a) to ask for an account and also demand payment of secret and
illicit profits earned by him as an agent;189
(b) to seek damages for disregard of the terms of agency as also for
want of skill and care;
(c) to resist the claim of the agent for commission and indemnity
by the plea that the agent had acted for himself, i.e. as a principal."190

[S. 219]
RIGHTS OF AGENT
The following are some of the important rights of an agent:
1. Right to remuneration [S. 219]
S. 219. When agent's remuneration becomes due.-In the absence
of any special contract, payment for the performance of any act is not due to
the agent until the completion of such act; but an agent may detain moneys
received by him on account of goods sold, although the whole of the goods
consigned to him for sale may not have been sold, or although the sale may not
be actually complete.
191
Every agent is clearly entitled to his agreed remuneration, or if there is no
agreement, to a reasonable remuneration. Where the amount of remuner-
ation is left on principal's discretion, even then reasonableness would be the
criterion.192 The difficult question is as to when remuneration becomes due.
Section 219 says that "in the absence of any special contract, payment for
the performance of any act is not due until the completion of such act...".
This provision raises two questions. When is the act complete? and sec-
ondly, is the act a result of the agent's services? Both questions depend "first
and last on particular terms of the particular contract"193 Thus where an
agent was appointed to secure orders for advertisements in a newspaper,
the commission in respect of an advertisement being payable when it was
published, the agent was held entitled to commission on orders actually
obtained by him although the advertisements to which the orders related
were not published until after the termination of employment.194 As against
it, where an agent was engaged to negotiate for the purchase of a house at a
commission of 2 per cent on the purchase price, he was held not entitled to
any commission till the completion of the purchase of the house.195 Much
depends upon the nature of the service that the agent undertakes to provide.
191. For example, the Lahore High Court held in Khursheed Alam v Asa Ram, AIR 1933 Lah
784 that "where a person is proved to have acted as broker, he is entitled to his commission;
and even if he fails to prove the rate of commission agreed upon, a reasonable amount ought
to be awarded to him as such commission". The mode, manner and time of payment may be
provided for by a special contract. Vasanji Moolji v Karsondas Tejpal, AIR 1928 Bom 270,

Rights of agent 775
Thus, in a case before the Allahabad High Court,1% an agent was appointed
to introduce a purchaser willing to purchase the defendant's property. He
did introduce one and even the sale was settled and earnest money paid, but
it could not be completed through the purchaser's inability to find money.
The agent was nevertheless held entitled to his agreed commission.197
Secondly, the transaction that results must be due to the agent's services.
The bargain must be direct result of his service.19 In Green v Bartlett 199 an
agent was appointed to sell a house. He held an auction but failed to find a
purchaser. One of the persons attending the auction obtained from him the
address of the principal and purchased the house from him without inter-
vention of the agent. Even so the transaction was held to be a result of the
agent's effort entitling him to his commission.
The principle of this case was followed by the Bombay High Court. 200
The defendants appointed the plaintiff, a broker, to obtain a loan on the
mortgage of his premises. He introduced the manager of a bank who would
have made an advance if the security offered had not proved to be insuffi-
cient. Ultimately, the bank did make an advance, but through another bro-
ker. The plaintiff was held entitled to his commission.
Where the agent's services are only remotely connected with the transac-
tion, his remuneration is not earned. Tribe v Taylor201 is an apt illustration.
The defendant requested the plaintiffs to introduce a purchaser of his
premises or a source of capital. The plaintiff introduced one Wood who
advanced a sum of money by way of loan. The agreed commission was
paid to the plaintiffs. Subsequently Wood entered into partnership with
the defendant and advanced a further sum. The plaintiff's action to claim
commission on this second advance failed.
The judge said: "The question which arose was... whether the subse-
quent advance was the result of any act of the plaintiffs. If... the plaintiffs
had introduced any new person, who had advanced the money, I should
have thought the defendant would have been bound to pay the commission
claimed. If they had induced Wood to become a partner and to introduce

further capital, I should have thought they would have been entitled to
commission on that.... Was the subsequent partnership the result of the
introduction or of an independant negotiation? Causa proxima is not the
question; the plaintiffs must show that the act of theirs was the causa cau-
sans. It is true that (second) advance might not, and probably would not
have been made by Wood, but for the original introduction by the plaintiffs.
But that is not enough."
The principal is, of course, under a duty not to prevent the agent from
earning his commission. But this does not prevent the principal from sell-
ing the property himself or from refusing to sell at all. A well-known case is
Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd v Cooper, 20
An agent was promised his commission if he brought about the sale of
the defendant's cinemas. The agent introduced a customer but the com-
pany refused to sell. The agent brought an action for his commission.
The House of Lords held against him: "There was no implied term that
the principal would not dispose of the property himself, or through other
channels or otherwise act so as to prevent the agent from earning his com-
mission." Viscount SIMON LC said:20 "The agent necessarily incurs certain
risks, e.g. the risk that his nominee cannot find the purchase price and will
not consent to terms reasonably proposed to be inserted in the contract of
sale....The agent also takes the risk of his principal not being willing to
conclude the bargain with the agent's nominee. The last risk is ordinarily a
slight one for the owner's reason for approaching the agent is that he wants
to sell."
Where an agent of a foreign company entered into a contract for sale of
machinery to the defendant and one of the terms of the contract was that
payment of commission to be payable by the defendant would be subject to
installation of the machinery, but the defendant could not make the site for
installation ready and, therefore, there could be no installation. The agent,
being not responsible for the same, was entitled to his commission. 205 The
terms of the arrangement showed sufficient privity of contract between the
defendant buyer and the agent of the foreign principal, e.g. provision for
payment of commission to the agent directly by deducting it from price. 206

the plaintiff at Delhi and payment of commission was also made at Delhi,

Effect of misconduct [S. 220]
S. 220. Agent not entitled to remuneration for business miscon-
ducted. An agent who is guilty of misconduct in the business of the agency
is not entitled to any remuneration in respect of that part of the business which
he has misconducted.
Illustrations
(a) A employs B to recover 1,00,000 rupees from C, and to lay it out on good security. B
recovers the 1,00,000 rupees and lays out 90,000 rupees on good security, but lays out
10,000 rupees on security which he ought to have known to be bad, whereby A loses
2000 rupees. B is entitled to remuneration for recovering the 1,00,000 rupees and for
investing the 90,000 rupees. He is not entitled to any remuneration for investing the
10,000 rupees and he must make good the 2000 rupees to B.
(b) A employs B to recover 1000 rupees from C. Through B's misconduct the money is not
recovered. B is entitled to no remuneration for his services, and must make good the
loss.
An agent is not entitled to any commission in respect of that part of the
business which he has misconducted.208 Section 220 accordingly provides
that an agent who is guilty of misconduct in the business of agency, is not
entitled to any remuneration in respect of that part of the business which he
has misconducted.
The effect of misconduct is twofold. Firstly, the agent forfeits his right to
commission. This is irrespective of any loss suffered by the principal. "The
principle underlying the rule is that 'a principal is entitled to have an honest
agent and it is only the honest agent who is entitled to any commission'."209
The commission is forfeited only in respect of that part of the agency busi-
ness which has been misconducted. 210 An agent was employed to sell lease-
hold premises. Great many tailors were interested in acquiring the premises.
The agent, being afraid that the original landlord would not permit lease to
tailors, obtained his permission in advance. This considerably increased the
price. The agent, however, kept this fact from his principal and induced him
207. Ibid.

to accept lower price. This was a misconduct and breach of duty on the part
of the agent. He was not allowed to recover his commission. 211
Secondly, the principal is entitled to recover compensation for any loss
caused by the misconduct. The illustrations to the section make it clear that
payment of damages caused by the misconduct is in addition to the forfei-
ture of commission or remuneration.
2. Right of retainer [S. 217]
S. 217. Agent's right of retainer out of sums received on principal's
account. An agent may retain, out of any sums received on account of the
principal in the business of the agency, all moneys due to himself in respect of
advances made or expenses properly incurred by him in conducting such busi-
ness, and also such remuneration as may be payable to him for acting as agent.
The agent has the right to retain his principal's money until his claims, if
any, in respect of his remuneration or advances made or expenses incurred
in conducting the business of agency are paid. The right can be exercised
on "any sums received on account of the principal in the business of the
agency". He can retain only such money as is in his possession. He is not
entitled to an equitable lien, that is, the right to have his claims satisfied in
preference to other creditors out of the principal's money not in his posses-
sion. But a solicitor or vakil is entitled to an equitable lien on the proceeds
of an action conducted by him till his costs are paid. His fee is first charge
on the proceeds even if they are not in his possession. He is also entitled, for
this purpose, to have the proceeds pass through his hands.212
3. Right of lien [S. 221]
S. 221. Agent's lien on principal's property.-In the absence of any con-
tract to the contrary, an agent is entitled to retain goods, papers and other prop-
erty, whether movable, or immovable, of the principal received by him, until the
amount due to himself for commission, disbursements and services in respect
of the same has been paid or accounted for to him.
In addition to the above right of retainer, the "agent has the right to
retain goods, papers and other property, whether movable or immovable,
of the principal received by him, until the amount due to himself for com-
mission, disbursements and services in respect of the same has been paid or
accounted for to him", 213

Rights of agent 779
The conditions of this right are:
(1) The agent should be lawfully entitled to receive from the principal a
sum of money by way of commission earned or disbursements made
or services rendered in the proper execution of the business of agency.
(2) The property over which the lien is to be exercised should belong to the
principal and it should have been received by the agent in his capacity
and during the course of his ordinary duties as agent.24 The property
is considered to be sufficiently in the possession of the agent where he
has been dealing with it. Thus where an auctioneer was engaged to
sell furniture at the owner's house, he was held to be sufficiently in
possession to exercise lien for his commission. The property held by an
agent for a special purpose cannot be subjected to lien. The existence
of a special purpose implicitly excludes the right.215 Similarly, where
possession is obtained without the principal's authority or by fraud or
misrepresentation, there is no lien. Briefly, the agent's possession must
be lawful.
(3) The agent has only a particular lien. A particular lien attaches only to
that specific subject-matter in respect of which the charges216 are due.
No other property can be retained.
For example, in Bombay Saw Mills Co, re,217 the secretaries and treas-
urers of a company claimed lien over the company's property for their
advances. SCOTT J rejected the claim "because the sums advanced and
expended were not, as required (by S. 221) 'disbursements and services
in respect of the property on which the lien was claimed, but were loans
made on behalf of the company generally and for the purpose of the whole
concern".219
Effect of lien
The effect of lien as between the principal and the agent has been thus
stated by A.H. KHAN J in Gopaldas v Thakurdas220; "The agent's lien does
not give unrestricted authority to the agent to deal with the property in
any manner the agent may like. The right is limited in nature. It enables
Chembur Service Station, (2011) 3 SCC 710: (2011) 2 SCC (Civ) 49, certain railway premises
were in possession of a businessman for his business for over 40 years. His licence was termi-
nated and he was told to handover vacant possession. He claimed compensation for sudden
termination and lien on premises till payment. The court said that he deserved a notice and
hearing so that the court could consider what were the terms of the licence.

the agent to retain the property till his dues are paid. But this confers no
authority on the agent to sell or otherwise dispose of the property without
the consent of the owner".
A partnership firm acting as the clearing and forwarding agents of the
principal detained the goods of the principal because of a dispute about their
commission amount and had the goods sold on an interim court order. The
firm was held to be in the wrong. It had no right to sell because lien does not
give that right. An agent can no doubt dispose of the goods with the consent
of the principal or with court order, but in this case the order of the court
was not valid because the firm being not registered could not have filed a
suit. The sale was wrongful. The court directed the firm to keep intact the
money equivalent of the value of the goods so that the remedy of accounts
would be effectively available to the principal.221
Where, however, in terms of his agreement with the principal, the agent
has become a pledgee of the goods, he may sell them after giving a reasona-
ble notice to the principal of his intention to sell.222
As against third parties the lien is effective only to the extent of the prin-
cipal's rights on the property. If the principal has limited rights, the lien
will be equally limited. If the property is already subject to some rights or
equities in favour of third persons, the lien will also be subject to them. But
where the property on which lien is being exercised is a negotiable instru-
ment, the agent will become a holder for value to the extent of his lien and
will acquire a title free of prior equities if he acts in good faith and without
notice of them.223
If the principal creates any charge on the property subsequently to the
attachment of the lien, that will be subject to the lien.
Loss of lien
The agent's lien is lost in the following cases:
(1) Lien, being a possessory right, is lost as soon as possession is lost.
Possession is lost when the agent delivers the goods to the principal
himself or to a carrier for the purpose of transmission to the princi-
pal. In the latter case, the agent cannot revive his lien by stopping the
goods in transit.224 But where the property has been delivered for a
special purpose, like safe custody, which is inconsistent with lien, the
lien is not lost.
As long as the agent remains in possession, his lien is effective,
and is not affected by the fact that the company to which the

goods belonged has been ordered to be wound up,225 or that the
principal has become insolvent. The agent's possession is not ter-
minated where property has been obtained from him by unlawful
means or by fraud or misrepresentation.
(2) The lien is lost, when the agent waives his right. Waiver may arise out
of an agreement express or implied or may be inferred from conduct
inconsistent with the right.
(3) The agent's lien is subject to a contract to the contrary and, therefore,
does not exist where the agent has by his agreement with the principal
excluded it, 226
4. Right to indemnity [Ss. 222-223]
S. 222. Agent to be indemnified against consequences of lawful
acts. The employer of an agent is bound to indemnify him against the conse-
quences of all lawful acts done by such agent in exercise of the authority con-
ferred upon him.
Illustrations
(a) B, at Singapore, under instructions from A of Calcutta, contracts with C to deliver cer-
tain goods to him. A does not send the goods to B, and C sues B for breach of contract.
B informs A of the suit, and A authorises him to defend the suit. B defends the suit, and
is compelled to pay damages and costs, and incurs expenses. A is liable to B for such
damages, costs and expenses.
(b) B, a broker at Calcutta, by the orders of A, a merchant. there, contracts with C for the
purchase of 10 casks of oil for A. Afterwards A refuses to receive the oil, and C sues B. B
informs A, who repudiates the contract. altogether. B defends, but unsuccessfully, and
has to pay damages and costs and incurs expenses. A is liable to B for such damages,
costs and expenses.
The right to indemnity extends to all losses and expenses incurred by the
agent in the conduct of the business. Where, for example, a stockbroker, on
the instructions of a solicitor, contracted to sell certain shares and had to
incur liability to the purchaser by reason of the owner's refusal to complete
the sale, the stockbroker was held entitled to recover indemnity from the
principal,227
The agent must have been damnified in the lawful conduct of the busi-
ness of agency. A wagering agreement is not unlawful. It is only void.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court in Kishanlal v Bhanwar Lal,228 allowed an
agent to recover indemnity for losses incurred by him in wagering transac-
tions entered into on instructions of his principal.
Where the act done by the agent on instructions from his principal is
apparently lawful, but it turns out to be unlawful or injurious to a third

person, the agent is entitled to indemnity against the consequences of the
act.
Liability of agent under dishonoured cheque
The contract was for supply of goods. The petitioner was working as
a commission agent transacting business on behalf of the company. The
court said that once the cheque was issued duly signed by the petitioner,
he became liable to be prosecuted against. There was failure on the part of
the agent to reply to the notice to inform the complainant that the primary
liability was that of the principal for the amount due, if any. This estopped
him from subsequently saying that only the principal was liable. He was also
not able to prove that there was no real transaction under which the cheque
was issued.229
S. 223. Agent to be indemnified against consequences of acts done in
good faith. Where one person employs another to do an act, and the agent
does the act in good faith, the employer is liable to indemnify the agent against
the consequences of that act, though it causes an injury to the rights of third
persons.
Illustrations
(a) A, a decree-holder and entitled to execution of B's goods, requires the officer of the
Court to seize certain goods representing them to be the goods of B. The officer seizes
the goods, and is sued by C, the true owner of the goods. A is liable to indemnify the
officer for the sum which he is compelled to pay to C, in consequence of obeying A's
directions.
(b) B, at the request of A, sells goods in the possession of A, but which A had no right to dis-
pose of. B does not know this, and hands over the proceeds of the sale to A. Afterwards
C, the true owner of the goods, sues B and recovers the value of the goods and costs.
A is liable to indemnify B for what he has been compelled to pay to C and for B's own
expenses.
One of the illustrations appended to Section 223 seems to be based upon
the facts of Adamson v Jarvis: 230
An auctioneer sold certain cattle on instructions from the defendant
and was held liable to the true owner for conversion. He recovered indem-
nity from the principal because the act in question was apparently lawful.
Where, however, the act in question is apparently unlawful or criminal,
such as beating a person or publication of a libel, the principal will not be
liable upon an express or implied promise to indemnify the agent against the
consequences of such act. For example, an agent, appointed to import adul-
terated mustard oil, suffered loss and punishment, but he could not recover

indemnity, Where, however, the plaintiff on instruction, from the defend-
ant, paid a sum of money to the caste panchayat to have the defendant's
caste disqualifications removed, he was allowed to recover the money from
the defendant. 232
S. 224. Non-liability of employer of agent to do a criminal act.-Where
one person employs another to do an act which is criminal, the employer is not
liable to the agent, either upon an express or an implied promise, to indemnify
him against the consequences of that act.
Illustrations
(a) A employs B to beat C, and agrees to indemnify him against all consequences of the
act. B thereupon beats C, and has to pay damages to C for so doing. A is not liable to
indemnify B for those damages.
(b) B, the proprietor of a newspaper, publishes, at A's request, a libel upon C in the paper,
and A agrees to indemnify B against the consequences of the publication, and all costs
and damages of any action in respect thereof. B is sued by C and has to pay damages,
and also incurs expenses. A is not liable to B upon the indemnity.
Where the act in question is apparently tortious, the agent, who has been
held liable on it, may recover contribution from the principal (not indemnity)
under the Law Reform (Married Women's and Tortfeasors) Act, 1955.233
5. Right to compensation [S. 225]
S. 225. Compensation to agent for injury caused by principal's
neglect. The principal must make compensation to his agent in respect of
injury caused to such agent by the principal's neglect or want of skill.
Thus every principal owes to his agent the duty of care not to expose him
to unreasonable risks.24 The illustration appended to the section makes the
point clear:
A employs B as a bricklayer in building a house, and puts up the scaffold-
ing himself. The scaffolding is unskilfully put up, and B is in consequence
hurt. A must make compensation to B.
Relations of principal with third parties
AGENT'S AUTHORITY
The acts of the agent within the scope of his authority bind the princi-
pal.235 Section 226 of the Contract Act gives statutory effect to the principle

S. 226. Enforcement and consequences of agent's contracts.-
Contracts entered into through an agent, and obligations arising from acts
done by an agent, may be enforced in the same manner, and will have the same
legal consequences, as if the contracts had been entered into and the acts done
by the principal in person.
Illustrations
(a) A buys goods from B, knowing that he is an agent for their sale, but not knowing who is
the principal. B's principal is the person entitled to claim from A the price of the goods,
and A cannot, in a suit by the principal, set-off against that claim a debt due to himself
from B.
(b) A, being B's agent, with authority to receive money on his behalf, receives from Ca sum
of money due to B. C is discharged of his obligation to pay the sum in question to B.
It is necessary for this effect to follow that the agent must have done the
act within the scope of his authority. The authority of an agent and more
particularly its scope are subjects of some controversy,236 The uncertainty is
largely due to the fact that the authority of an agent does not depend upon
one source. It emanates from the principal, but its dimensions depend upon
legal inferences, which, in turn, depend upon the purpose of the agency, the
surrounding circumstances and a desire to protect bona fide commercial
transactions. For, agency came into being to promote and not to hinder
commerce, 237
The authority of an agent means his capacity to bind the principal. It
refers to the sum total of the acts it has been agreed between principal and
agent that the agent should do on behalf of the principal. When the agent
does any of such acts, it is said he has acted within his authority, 238
him. V. Ramesh v Convenor, EAMCET, AIR 1997 AP 79, a candidate who was entitled to
a reserve seat for admission to engineering college was invited by telegram for interview.

an Agent in Cases of Actual and Apparent Authority, (1938) 16 Can BR 757. The following
articles are there considered: Cook, Agency by Estoppel, (1905) 5 Col LR 35; Ewart, Agency

Actual authority
Agent's authority 785
Actual authority of an agent is the authority conferred on him by the
principal. It is of two kinds, namely, express or implied. Sections 186 and
187 provide this:
S. 186. Agent's authority may be expressed or implied.--The authority
of an agent may be expressed or implied.
S. 187. Definitions of express and implied authority.--An authority is
said to be express when it is given by words spoken or written. An authority
is said to be implied when it is to be inferred from the circumstances of the
case; and things spoken or written, or the ordinary course of dealing, may be
accounted circumstances of the case.
Illustration
A owns a shop in Serampure, living himself in Calcutta, and visiting the shop occasionally.
The shop is managed by B, and he is in the habit of ordering goods from C in the name of A
for the purposes of the shop, and of paying for them out of A's funds with A's knowledge. B
has an implied authority from A to order goods from C in the name of A for the purposes of
the shop.
Express authority
Where the authority is conferred by words, spoken or written, it is called
express authority. A power of attorney, for example, which is a kind of
deed and authorises the agent to do certain acts, is an illustration of express
authority. But, however precisely the authority of an agent may be drawn,
disputes as to its scope are likely to arise. The scope of express authority is
worked out by construction of the words used in the documents. For exam-
ple, where a principal, while going abroad, authorised his agent and partner
to carry on the business, and his wife to accept bills on his behalf for his per-
sonal business, he was held not bound when his wife accepted bills for the
business, which the agent was conducting and which was different from his
personal business.239 The decision has been criticised, particularly because
the agent and the third party had acted in good faith to meet the princi-
pal's genuine business needs. Accordingly, in a subsequent case of agency by
power of attorney, where the agent obtained a loan outside his authority by
signing a cheque on behalf of his principal to pay the principal's workmen,
the principal was held bound.240 Where the appointment was for "fixing" a
steamer, intention being to let it out, the principal was held liable when the
agent instead hired a steamer.241
239. Attwood v Munnings, (1827) 7 B&C 278: 108 ER 727. The decision has been criticised in

principal accepted liability to pay for the supply could not subsequently escape by saying that
there was no privity of contract.

https://t.me/LawCollegeNotes_Stuffs
[S. 187]
But where the third party has knowledge of the limitation on the agent's
authority or could have discovered it by reasonable examination, he would
be bound by it. 242 Thus, where an agent was given very wide power of with-
drawing the principal's money "without restriction", the principal was held
not bound when the agent gave a cheque to a car dealer to purchase a car
for himself, and paid a few cheques into his banking account to wipe out
his overdraft. 244 In either case it was the duty of the third party to make a
reasonable inquiry whether the agent had the authority to use the principal's
money for his personal purposes. 245
An agent cannot borrow on behalf of his principal unless he has clear
authority to do so. The power to draw or endorse bills or notes does not
include the power to borrow.246 Where the agent has the power to borrow,
the fact that he borrowed beyond the authorised limit, does not prevent the
third party from holding the principal liable,247 because the third party has
no means of ascertaining that fact. Similarly, the fact that an agent has acted
from improper motive does not take the case beyond the scope of authority.
Thus in Hambro v Burnard:248
An agent was appointed to underwrite policies. He underwrote a
policy which in fact amounted to a guarantee of a company's debts. He
knew the precarious condition of the company, but being interested in it,
wanted to help it. The principal was held liable because the third party
could not have known with what motive the agent was underwriting a
particular policy.
Implied authority
"An authority is said to be implied when it is to be inferred from the cir-
cumstances of the case; and things spoken or written or the ordinary course
of dealing, may be accounted circumstances of the case." [See illustration to
S. 187]
Implied authority is an instance of real or actual authority for it is con-
ferred upon the agent by the conduct of the principal as interpreted in the
circumstances of the case.

ing borrowing.

[S. 187]
Agent's authority 787
The distinction between express and implied authority is not funda-
mental, but depends merely on whether the authority is delimited by
words or by conduct. If P tells A that he is to act as manager, this is really
a compendious way of stating that he is to do all the acts as manager
would ordinarily do. Those acts might well be termed as express author-
ity. However, it is often said that if an agent is placed in a certain position
he has implied authority to do all the acts a person in that position ordi-
narily does.249
An illustration of implied authority is to be found in Ryan v Pilkington.250
An estate agent was appointed to find a purchaser for certain property. He
accepted a deposit from a prospective customer and misappropriated it. The
principal was held liable, because an estate agent has an implied authority to
take a deposit. He cannot, however, receive payment or give any warranty
unless actually authorised.251
Thus the extent of an agent's authority, whether express or implied,
depends upon-
(1) the nature of the act or business he is appointed to do;
(2) things which are incidental to the business or are usually done in car-
rying it out;252
(3) the usual customs and usages of the trade.
This is the essence of Section 188 which defines the extent of the agent's
authority in the following words:
249. J.L. Montrose, Actual and Apparent Authority, (1938) 16 Can 764. The American
Restatement refers to this kind of authority as "incidental". Art. 35 says: "Unless otherwise
agreed, authority to conduct a transaction includes authority to do acts which are incidental
to it, usually accompany it, or are reasonably necessary to accomplish it."

Scope of authority
S. 188. Extent of agent's authority.
[S. 188]
An agent, having an authority to do
an act, has authority to do every lawful thing which is necessary in order to do
such act.
An agent having an authority to carry on a business, has authority to do every
lawful thing necessary for the purpose, or usually done in the course, of con-
ducting such business.
Illustrations
(a) A is employed by B, residing in London, to recover at Bombay a debt due to B. A may
adopt any legal process necessary for purpose of recovering the debt, and may give a
valid discharge for the same.
(b) A constitutes B, his agent to carry on his business of a shipbuilder. B may purchase tim-
ber and other materials, and hire workmen, for the purpose of carrying on the business.
A well-known illustration is the case of Dingle v Hare.253
An agent was authorised to sell artificial manure. He had no authority
to give any warranty about the goods. Yet he warranted to the buyer that
the manure contained 30 per cent phosphate of lime.
The warranty turned out to be false and the principal was sued for its
breach. He was held liable, because it was usual in the artificial manure
trade to give a warranty of this kind. BYLES J said:
"When the jury found that it was usual to sell these artificial manures
with a warranty, the nice distinction as to the extent of the agent's author-
ity became quite immaterial. An agent to sell has general authority to do
all that is usual and necessary in the course of such employment."
Thus every agent has the implied authority to act according to the cus-
toms and usages of a particular market or trade.254 The principal is bound
by such usages even if he is unaware of them 255 or even if they conflict with
his instructions. Thus, where a bill-broker in London was entrusted with
certain bills for discounting, and he pledged them, the principal was held
bound as it was usual for bill-brokers in London to raise money by deposit-
ing their customers' bills en bloc.256
But the custom or usage must not be unlawful or unreasonable. Whether a
custom or usage is unlawful is a question of law. Any custom which changes

Agent's authority 789
the very nature of the agency, as for example, which converts the agent into
a principal is unreasonable. Robinson v Mollett257 is an illustration in point.
R authorised a broker M to purchase for him 50 tons of tallow. M sup-
plied his own tallow as there was a custom in his trade to buy large quan-
tities of tallow in his own name and then to allocate it to his principals.
The House of Lords held the custom to be unreasonable. It made Ma
wholesaler rather than an agent. It also created a conflict between his duty
to the principal and his personal interest.
Similarly, a custom which gives the agent liberty to adjust his personal
account by way of set-off or otherwise for the claims of the principal is
unreasonable. Thus, where an agent was authorised to collect from the
underwriters a sum of money due under a policy of insurance, he was not
allowed to set-off his personal debts to the underwriters against that money
although a custom to that effect was alleged.258 The principal would, how-
ever, have been bound by this custom if he were aware of it.
The principle of Dingle v Hare259 applies to all cases where the agent acts
as a seller. For example, an agent appointed to sell a horse may warrant it
as good if the principal is a horse dealer,200 or if the sale is being held at a
market place, but not if it is a private sale. Similarly, an agent to sell a
property has authority to state the condition and value of the property to
a proposed purchaser and an agent to discount a bill may warrant it as a
good bill, but he cannot endorse it.264
Authority of special agents
Factor
A factor is a mercantile agent who is put in possession of the goods of his
principal for sale. He has the authority to sell them in his own name, 25 to
warrant them if it is usual to do so,266 to fix the selling price and to receive
payment.267
Broker
A broker is a mercantile agent appointed to sell the goods of his principal,
but he is not given possession thereof. He may sell the goods in his own

pal, he cannot receive payment. 269 He may act according to the usual course
of business except where a usage is unreasonable or unlawful. He may sell

Estate or House Agent
"A house or estate agent is in a different position from a broker at the
stock exchange owing to the peculiarities of the property with which he
has to deal and which does not pass by a short instrument as stocks and
shares do, but has to be transferred after investigation of title as to which
various stipulations, which might be of particular concern to the owner,
may have to be inserted in a concluded contract relating to such property.
The parties, therefore, do not ordinarily contemplate that the agent should
have the authority to complete the transaction in such cases. That is why it
has been held both in England and here, that authority given to a broker to
negotiate a sale and find a purchaser, without furnishing him with all the
terms means 'to find a man willing to become a purchaser and not to bind
him and make him a purchaser'." This passage occurs in the judgment of the
Supreme Court in Abdulla Ahmed v Animendra Kissen Mitter.271
The facts of the case were that an estate broker was appointed with
an authority for one month to negotiate the sale of a property on cer-
tain terms as to price and with which his commission was also linked.
Before the expiry of the month he found a customer ready and willing
to purchase and communicated the fact to the principal. The principal
terminated the authority of the agent and directly entered into account
with a nominee of the person found by the agent. The agent claimed his
commission.
It was held that the agent having negotiated the sale and secured a buyer
who made a firm offer acquired the right to commission on the basis of the
preferred price subject to the condition that the buyer should complete the
transaction, and as this condition was fulfilled, the agent's right to commis-
sion became absolute and could not be affected by the circumstances that
the principal for some reason of his own sold the property at a lower price.
A general power of attorney was constituted for dealing with existing
properties of the principal as well as properties acquired after the appoint-
ment of the attorney. A contract made by him in the exercise of the power
could not be cancelled. The purchaser had himself cancelled the agreement
to buy. He claimed refund of the consideration. The vendor wanted to set-off
his claim for damages for breach. The court said that this could be possible
only on showing that he remained ready and willing to perform his part.

Agent's authority 791
The purchaser had justification in cancelling because the vendor's title was
defective. The court said that this right of refund is available also to a person
who had prior knowledge of the defect. 272
Auctioneer
An auctioneer is an agent appointed to sell goods at a public auction.
He, therefore, does not have the authority to sell by private contract.273 He
cannot sell on credit, 274 or accept any payment other than cash, or warrant
the goods.275 He acts both for seller and buyer and, therefore, can sign the
contract for both.2
276
Power of attorney holder
Except where a matter is required to be done personally, acts and state-
ments of a power of attorney are attributable to the principal. The principal
was a non-resident landlord. He wanted to evict the tenant. The statement
made by the attorney to the effect that his principal was in personal need of
the premises was held to be receivable in evidence for ordering eviction.277
Agent of Life Insurance Corporation
An agent of the Life Insurance Corporation did not perform his duty to
deposit the premium amount with LIC. It was held that LIC could not shirk
its responsibility to pay the amount assured under the policy, 278
Ostensible or apparent authority
The apparent authority of an agent is thus explained by DENNING LJ;279
"Ostensible or apparent authority is the authority of an agent as it appears
to others. It often coincides with actual authority. Thus, when the board.
(of directors) appoint one of their members to be a managing director they
invest him not only with implied authority, but also with ostensible author-
ity to do all such things as fall within the usual scope of that office. Other
people who see him acting as managing director are entitled to assume that
he has the usual authority of a managing director. But sometimes ostensible
authority exceeds actual authority. For instance, when the board appoint
the managing director, they may expressly limit his authority by saying he
is not to order goods worth more than £500 without sanction of the board.
In that case his actual authority is subject to the £500 limitation, but his
ostensible authority includes all the usual authority of a managing director.

792 Chapter 15 Agency
[S. 188]
The company is bound by his ostensible authority in his dealings with those
who do not know of the limitation. Thus, if he orders goods worth £1000,
the company is bound to the other party who does not know of the £500
limitation."
"When it is said that an agent's act was within the scope of his apparent
authority all that is meant is that the act appeared to be authorised". 280 A
leading authority is Watteau v Fenwick.281
The defendants had forbidden the manager of their hotel from buying
cigars on credit. The plaintiff gave cigars to the manager on credit, which
were used in business. The manager's name appeared over the board, the
plaintiff trusted him and had never heard of the defendants. Being unable
to recover the price from the manager, the plaintiff sued the defendants.
The court found that "cigars were... such as would naturally be supplied
to and dealt in such an establishment". WILLS J, therefore, held that "once
it is established that the defendant was the real principal, the ordinary doc-
trine as to principal and agent applied, that the principal is liable for all the
acts of the agent which are within the authority usually confided to an agent
of that character, notwithstanding limitations, as between the principal and
the agent, put upon that authority",282 In another similar case, the manager
of a public house was authorised to buy spirits only from A, but he bought
them from another person telling him that he was a manager. The principal
was held not liable, because the fact of agency was disclosed and it was well
known that such managers had authority to buy only from authorised sourc-
es.283 But if in the above case the fact of agency had not been disclosed, the
principal would have been liable in the manner of a dormant partner.
Similarly, in a case before the Kerala High Court, 24 it was held that a per-
son having responsibility to carry on the business of the store of a coopera-
tive society must be deemed to have authority to purchase goods on credit
notwithstanding that the society had advanced him enough money for the
purpose.
A decision of the Allahabad High Court furnishes another illustration. 285
In pursuance of an agreement the plaintiff despatched a wagonload of
potatoes to the defendant. The latter refused to take delivery. The plain-

payment, which the agent accepted. The plaintiff received the money but
brought an action for the balance.
It was held that the defendant could presume that the agent who was sent
to sell at the available price had the ostensible authority to settle with the
defendant at a less price.
In the above-cited Kerala case the court adopted from Smith and Watt's
MERCANTILE LAW 286 the following statement on the distinction between.
"implied" and "ostensible authority": "Implied authority is real authority,
the exercise of which is binding not only as between the principal and the
third party, but also between principal and agent. It differs only from an
express authority in that it is conferred by no express words, but is to be
gathered from surrounding circumstances. The term "ostensible authority",
on the other hand, denotes no authority at all. It is a phrase conveniently
used to describe the position which arises when one person has clothed
another, or allowed him to assume an appearance of authority to act on his
behalf, without actually giving him any authority either express or implied,
by which appearance of authority a third party is misled into believing that
a real authority exists."287
Apparent authority is real authority
The statement portrays the truth in Lord ELLENBOROUGH'S observation.
that "apparent authority is the real authority". 288 Whether there is appear-
ance of authority in a particular case depends upon the facts of the case. An
appearance of authority may, for example, arise from the course of business.
A well-known authority is Humbro v Burnard.29 Here an agent was author-
ised to underwrite insurance policies. The principal was held liable when he
underwrote a gurantee policy because underwriting of guarantee policies
was within the ordinary course of business of a Lloyd's underwriter.
Appearance of authority arising from course of dealing
An appearance of authority may arise from the course of dealing adopted
in a particular case. Thus, where a principal once authorised his servant to
purchase iron on credit and paid for it, he was liable when on a subsequent
occasion he sent the servant with ready cash, but the servant again incurred
credit. 290 But if the original act had been unauthorised, the principal would
not have been liable for the second, even if he had paid for the first. "Thus
in Barrett v Irvine, 291 it was laid down that a mother who has once paid for

a horse for her infant son does not thereby raise an inference of a general
authorisation to him to pledge her credit for his future equine purchases."292
Representation of authority by conduct
A representation of apparent authority has to emanate from some con-
duct of the principal. There must be some conduct on his part which enables
the agent to occupy a position of apparent authority. The representation
which creates "apparent" authority may take a variety of forms of which
the commonest is representation by conduct, that is, by permitting the agent.
to act in some way in the conduct of the principal's business with other per-
sons". For example, a principal used to order goods from the plaintiff. He
had a servant whom he never authorised nor ever sent out for buying goods.
The servant was dismissed and after that on two occasions he bought goods
from the plaintiff in the principal's name. Each time the principal paid the
account in ignorance. He was held entitled to recover back the money, for he
had done nothing to enable his servant to acquire an appearance of author-
ity. Where a Crown agent without ever having been so authorised, sold
steel plates belonging to the Crown, the latter was not bound by the sale.
The agent's own representations could not create an apparent authority,295
On the other hand, in the American case of Kannelles v Locke,296 the princi-
pal was held liable for the act of a complete imposter. The plaintiff arrived at
night at a small hotel. She was greeted by a man in the corridor. He booked
a room for her and took charge of her valuable articles and issued a receipt
in the principal's name. He disappeared with the articles. The hotel-keeper
was held liable because the imposter could not have occupied that position.
of apparent authority without the hotel-keeper's negligence. In Panorama
Development (Guildford) Ltd v Fidelis Furnishing Fabrics297 the facts were:
294
The plaintiff ran a cars-on-hire business. The defendant company's
secretary hired cars from the plaintiff ostensibly for the company's busi-
ness, telling him that the cars were wanted to carry important customers
of the company. He wrote on the company's paper ordering the cars,
signing himself "Company Secretary". In fact, he used the cars himself
and not for the company's purposes.
It was held that the secretary had ostensible authority to enter into con-
tracts for hiring cars for which the company must pay.

Agent's authority 795
Continuance of apparent authority till termination
An apparent authority once created continues to exist unless it is termi-
nated by a notice to the third party. It cannot be terminated or restricted pri-
vately. Thus a principal who had terminated the authority of his agent who
had occasionally bought wool for him was nevertheless held liable for the
agent's further purchases as the supplier had no notice of the termination.298
Similarly, where a man lived with his mistress as husband and wife and used
to pay for the mistress's purchases, he was held liable for the purchases made
after he had left her, because the supplier did not know of that fact.299
Agent's possession
The possession of servant or agent is that of his master or principal for
all purposes. A suit against servant or agent cannot be maintained on the
basis of such possession. 300 "It is well settled that the possession of the agent
is the possession of the principal and in view of the fiduciary relationship
the defendant cannot be permitted to claim his own possession. This aspect
was well emphasised in David Lyell v John Lawson Kennedy, 301 where the
agent who was collecting the rents from the tenants on behalf of the owner
and depositing it in a separate earmarked account continued to do so even
after the death of the owner. After more than 12 years of the owner's death
his heir's assignee brought the action against the agent for possession and
the agent defendant pleaded adverse possession and limitation. The plaintiff
succeeded in the first court. But the action was dismissed by the Court of
Appeal. The House of Lords reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal
and remarked, "For whom, and on whose behalf were those rents received
after Ann Duncan's death? Not by the respondent for himself, or on his own
behalf, anymore than during her lifetime". Emphasising the fiduciary char-
acter of the agent his possession was likened to that of trustee, a solicitor or
an agent, receiving the rent under a power of attorney.
Employer's undertaking to pay insurance premia
Where an employer, in a group savings linked insurance scheme, under-
took to pay monthly premiums to the insurer from wages or salaries of
employees, but when a worker died, it came to light that the premiums were
in default, it was held that the insurer was bound to pay the insurance money
to employee's family. The employer had become the agent of the insurer for
the agreed purpose. Lack of consideration between the insurer and employer

was immaterial because no consideration is necessary at the time creation
of agency. Consideration in such cases is promotion of business. 302 This line
of decisions has found Supreme Court approval in Life Insurance Corpn
v Rajiv Kumar Bhaskar. 303 The employer became the agent of LIC for col-
lection and payment of premia on the account of employees covered by the
scheme. The insurer had to bear responsibility. After noting the contents of
the scheme, the court said:
"The employers in terms of this tripartite arrangement accepted the
responsibility of deducting the premium from the salaries of the same and
send the same to the Corporation by one cheque. The concerned employ-
ees would have no knowledge about the contents of correspondence passed
between the Corporation and their employers."
"The employer's letter to the Corporation indicates that no form of indi-
vidual premium due notice or receipt would be issued by the Corporation
which clearly shows that the entire responsibility was thrust upon the
employer by the Corporation."
Dealing with the arguments as to creation of agency the court said:
An agency can be created expressly or by necessary implication. It may be
true that the employers in response to the proposal made by the Corporation
stated that they would act as agents of their employees and not that of the
Corporation, but, the expression "agent" in such circumstances may not
mean to be one within the meaning of the Life Insurance Corporation of
India (Agents) Regulation, 1972, made in terms of Section 49 of the Act: but
would mean an agent in ordinary sense of the term. An employer would not
be an agent in terms of the said Regulation on the premise that it was not
appointed by the Corporation to solicit or procure life insurance business.
The employers had no duty to discharge to the Corporation either under
the Act or the rules and regulations framed thereunder but keeping in view
the fact that the Corporation did not make any offer to the employees nor
would directly make any communication with them regarding payment or
non-payment of the premium or any other matter in relation thereto or con-
nected therewith including the lapse of the policy, if any, it cannot be said
that the employer had no role to play on behalf of the Corporation.
The Scheme clearly and unequivocally demonstrates that not only the
contract of insurance was entered into by and between the employee and the
insurer through the employer but even the terms and conditions of the policy
were to be performed only through the employer. In that limited sense, the
employers would be the agents of the insurer. In BOWSTEAD & REYNOLDS
302. LIC v K. Rama Iyer, 2004 AIR Kant 594: (2004) 1 Kant LJ 216 (DB), the premiums in
respect of the employee were in default for four months up to the time of his death, the
insurer was held liable. It was the default of the employer who was LIC's agent.

Agent's authority 797
ON AGENCY, 104 it is stated: "Where a person, by words or conduct, repre-
sents or permits it to be represented that another person has authority to act
on his behalf, he is bound by the acts of that other person with respect to
anyone dealing with him as an agent on the faith of any such representation,
to the same extent as if such other person had the authority that he was rep-
resented to have even though he had no such actual authority."
In a scheme of group insurance of policemen, premium amounts were
sent by the Police Department after deducting from respective salaries. The
department failed to communicate to the insurer the fact of death of a police-
man within the time stipulated in the policy and after which the insurer was
not to be liable. It was held that in all matters in respect of the group policy,
the Department was acting as an agent of the insurer. The information of
the Department amounted to information of the insurer. Thus the insurer
had attributed knowledge within time.305
Statutory provision about apparent authority
The doctrine of ostensible authority is given statutory shape in Section 237
of the Contract Act.
S. 237. Liability of principal inducing belief that agent's unauthorised
acts were authorised.-When an agent has, without authority, done acts or
incurred obligations to third persons on behalf of his principal, the principal is
bound by such acts or obligations if he has by his words or conduct induced
such third persons to believe that such acts and obligations were within the
scope of the agent's authority.

C being ignorant of B's instructions, enters into a contract with B to buy the goods at a

(b) A entrusts B with negotiable instruments endorsed in blank. B sells them to C in viola-
tion of private orders from A. The sale is good.
The provision has been used in quite a few cases to fix the principal with
liability for unauthorised acts of his agent. 306 The prominent among them

seems to be a decision of the Nagpur High Court,307 where a banking firm
was held liable for the misappropriation of the funds of a customer by a
person who, to the knowledge of the firm, was accepting deposits from cus-
tomers. The court said:
"Their Lordships of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled
in Ram Pertab v Marshalls that the right of a third party against the
principal on the contract of his agent though made in excess of agent's
actual authority was nevertheless to be enforced when the evidence
showed that the contracting party had been led into an honest belief in
the existence of the authority to the extent apparent to him."
Actual or constructive notice of lack of authority
Where, however, a person contracting with the agent has actual or con-
structive notice of any restriction on the agent's ostensible authority, he
is bound by the restriction. Thus where an agent, authorised by a power
of attorney to operate a business, but not to borrow money, produced the
power of attorney to a lender whom he asked for a loan, but the lender did
not read it and advanced a loan, he could not recover it from the principal
as he had constructive notice that the agent had no power to borrow. 309
Where a broker was permitted to receive payment for his principal's goods
by drawing upon the seller a bill of exchange and securing his acceptance to
it, a payment made in that manner became binding upon the principal. But
where the broker was authorised to receive payment only in respect of one
previous contract, that was held to be not sufficient to create an apparent
authority to receive such payments in the future also. 310 Once an ostensible
authority is created, the principal becomes bound by agent's acts within the
scope of such authority. He cannot rely upon any private restrictions upon
the agent's authority.311

innocent party contracting with him are such as to make it just for the
employer to bear the loss. Such circumstances exist where the employer by
words or conduct has induced the injured party to believe that the servant
was acting in the lawful course of the employer's business. They do not exist
where such belief, although it is present, has been brought about through
misguided reliance on the servant himself, when the servant is not author-
ised to do what he is purporting to do, when what he is purporting to do
is not within the class of acts that an employee in his position is usually
authorised to do and when the employer has done nothing to represent that
he is authorised to do it. Applying these principles to the facts of a case
before it, the House of Lords held that where an agent was authorised to
dispose of a ship, a charter-party granted by him did not bind the principal.
The sale of a ship backed by a three-year charter-party is a transaction of
wholly different character from a straightforward sale.312
Rule 8 of the Life Insurance Corporation (Agents) Rules, 1981 framed
under Section 48(2)(cc) of the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 pro-
hibits agents from collecting premium on behalf of LIC. Accordingly, an
implied or apparent authority could not be inferred for that purpose. The
fact that LIC accepted the premium amount from him, which he had taken
from his client, would not create an apparent authority in favour of the
agent. 313
Agent's authority in emergency [S. 189]
S. 189. Agent's authority in an emergency.-An agent has authority, in
an emergency, to do all such acts for the purpose of protecting his principal
from loss as would be done by a person of ordinary prudence, in his own case,
under similar circumstances.

(b) A consigns provisions to B at Calcutta, with directions to send them immediately to C,

This section creates a special authority in emergency. It constitutes the
agent into an agent of necessity to counteract the emergent situation. An
act done in the exercise of this extended authority would bind the principal
if the agent was not able to communicate with his principal and the course.

Where agent exceeds authority
[Ss. 227-228]
S.227. Principal how far bound, when agent exceeds authority.-When
an agent does more than he is authorised to do, and when the part of what
he does, which is within his authority, can be separated from the part which is
beyond his authority, so much only of what he does as is within his authority is
binding as between him and his principal.
Illustration
A, being owner of a ship and cargo authorises B to procure an insurance for 4000 rupees
on the ship. B procures a policy for 4000 rupees on the ship, and another for the like sum on
the cargo. A is bound to pay the premium for the policy on the ship, but not the premium
for the policy on the cargo.
S. 228. Principal not bound when excess of agent's authority is not sep-
arable. When an agent does more than he is authorised to do, and what he
does beyond the scope of his authority cannot be separated from what is within
it, the principal is not bound to recognize the transaction.
Illustration
A authorises B to buy 500 sheep for him. B buys 500 sheep and 200 lambs for one sum of
6000 rupees. A may repudiate the whole transaction.
Where an agent exceeds his authority, actual or apparent, the principal is
not bound by the excess work, but where it is separable from the authorised
work the principal is bound to that extent. [S. 227] For example, an agent
is authorised to insure a ship. He insures the ship as well as the goods under
separate policies. The principal is bound only by the policy on the ship. If he
had taken out only one policy in excess of instructions, the principal would
not have been bound. 314 Where the agent was authorised to sell half a right
over a property and he contracted to sell all the rights, the principal was
held to be bound to the extent of half rights, they being separable from the
rest. 315
Where the authorised work is not separable from the rest, the principal
may repudiate the whole of the transaction. [S. 228] For example, an agent
is authorised to buy 500 sheep. He buys 500 sheep and 200 lambs for one
sum of 6000 rupees. The principal may repudiate the whole transaction. 316
Where an agent was authorised to draw bills up to Rs 200 each, the princi-
pal was held not liable when the agent drew up to Rs 1000 each. 7 Similarly,
where an agent was instructed to contract for the purchase of cotton to be
delivered at the end of January, the principal was held not liable when the
agent contracted for delivery in the middle of that month, 18

Effect of notice to agent
S. 229. Consequences of notice given to agent.-Any notice given to
or information obtained by the agent, provided it be given or obtained in the
course of the business transacted by him for the principal, shall, as between the
principal and third parties, have the same legal consequences as if it had been
given to or obtained by the principal.
Illustrations
(a) A is employed by B to buy from C certain goods, of which C is the apparent owner, and
buys them accordingly. In the course of the treaty for the sale, A learns that the goods
really belonged to D, but B is ignorant of that fact. B is not entitled to set-off a debt
owing to him from C against the price of the goods.
(b) A is employed by B to buy from C goods of which C is the apparent owner. A was, before
he was so employed, a servant of C, and then learned that the goods really belonged
to D, but B is ignorant of that fact. In spite of the knowledge of his agent, B may set-off
against the price of the goods a debt owing to him from C.
The effect of the provision is that notice given to or information obtained
by an agent in the course of the business transacted by him on behalf of his
principal, shall, as between the principal and third parties have the same
legal consequences as if it had been given to or obtained by the principal.
Acting on the principle of the section the Calcutta High Court held that
where the secretary of a society was de facto as well as de jure incharge of
the affairs of the society, a notice given to him of the fact that a partner of
a firm with which the society had dealings had retired, operated as a notice
to the society, 319
Knowledge of broker
Whether a broker is acting as an agent of the assured or the insurer,
depends upon the facts of each case. It has been held that when a broker has
the power to bind the insurer, popularly known as "binder", he will be an
agent of the insurer and his knowledge will be deemed to be the knowledge
of the insurer. Thus, where a member of the broker's firm knew of the crimi-
nal past of the assured, the insurer was not permitted to deny liability on the
ground that the past had not been disclosed. $20
In such circumstances an assurance given by the broker would bind the
insurer. In one such case the broker orally assured that the new car pur-
chased by the assured would be substituted under the same policy for the
old. The insurer was held liable though he was not in a position to give such
substitution,321
Liability for agent's wrongful acts [S. 238]
Section 238 of the Contract Act lays down the principle by which the lia-
bility of the principal for the wrongful acts of the agent is to be determined.

Misrepresentations made, or frauds committed, by agents acting in the course

principals.

C, at the option of C.
(b) A, the captain of B's ship signs bills of lading without having received on board the
goods mentioned therein. The bills of lading are void as between B and the pretended
consignor.
To fix the principal with vicarious liability for the wrongs of his agent it
is necessary that the wrong must have been committed in the course of the
principal's business. Although the particular act may not be authorised but
if it is done in the course of carrying on the authorised business, the princi-
pal is liable. 322
A master is liable for the wrongs of his servant committed in the course
of the servant's employment, whereas a principal is liable for wrongs done
by the agent in the course of business. The expression "course of business"
has been generally taken to mean the same thing as "course of employment".
Accordingly, the principles governing the master and servant relationship
have been applied to that of principal and agent and also to partners. To
quote Professor Street: "There has never been a time when cases on master
and servant were not cited as authority in the law of principal and agent."323
Secondly, although Section 238 speaks of "misrepresentations" and
"frauds" in reference to "agreements made by agents" the principle is appli-
cable to all cases whether an agreement is involved or not.
322. For example, Lord LINDLEY in Citizens' Life Assurance Co v Brown, 1904 AC 423, 427,
stated the principle of vicarious liability in the following words: "Although the particular
act which gives the cause of action may not be authorised, still, if the act is done in the
course of employment which is authorised then the master is liable for the act of his servant."
This doctrine has been approved and acted upon by this Board in Mackay v Commercial
Bank of New Brunswick, (1874) LR 5 PC 94; Swire v Francis, (1877) LR 3 AC 106 (PC),
and the doctrine is as applicable to incorporated companies as to individuals. All doubt on
this question was removed by the decision of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in Barwick
v English Joint Stock Bank, (1867) LR 2 Ex 259, which is the leading case on this subject.
It was distinctly approved by Lord SELBORNE in the House of Lords, in Houldsworth v
City of Glasgow Bank, (1880) 5 AC 317, 326, and has been followed in numerous other
cases. There can be no agency for doing wrongful acts. A. Thangal Kunju Musaiar v M.
Venkatachalam Potti, AIR 1956 SC 246: (1955) 2 SCR 1196. The agent would be personally
liable.

Misrepresentations and frauds
Agent's authority 803
An agent appointed to sell his principal's goods or property has often to
make statements concerning the nature and quality of the property and, in
his enthusiasm to find a customer, may make exaggerated statements. The
law does not like to hold the principal liable for the agent's extravagant
statements unless it finds some fault with the principal himself. If, for exam-
ple, the principal has authorised a false statement to be made, or knows that
it is being made by the agent or keeps the real facts from the agent, obviously
the principal is liable. The liability of the principal is enforced, at the option
of the third party, by avoiding the contract if it is still executory or by hold-
ing the principal liable in damages. Such liability came to the principal in
the following three cases:
Fuller v Wilson:34 An estate agent stated to the purchaser that the house
under sale was free from rates and taxes. The principal was aware, but the
agent was not, that the house was subject to taxes and taxes were levied soon
after the plaintiff purchased the house. The principal would have been held
liable if the plaintiff had relied on the representation. DENMAN CJ said "...if
the purchaser was actually deceived in his bargain, the law will relieve him
from it. We think the principal and his agent are for this purpose completely
identified, and that the question is, not what was passing in the mind of either,
but whether the purchaser was in fact deceived by them or either of them."
London County Freehold & Leasehold Properties Ltd v Berkerly
Property & Investment Co Ltd:325 Negotiations were afoot for the sale of
a block of flats by the defendant company to the plaintiff company. The
solicitors of the plaintiff company, while going through the draft agreement,
put a marginal note inquiring whether all the tenants were paying their rents
regularly. The solicitors of the defendant company consulted the property
manager of the company and then informed the plaintiffs, also by way of
marginal note to the draft, that the tenants were paying rents regularly with
immaterial exceptions. The statement turned out to be false. The defendant
company was held liable in fraud because one of its agents (property man-
ager) who knew the real facts had made a false statement, and the company
has necessarily to act through its agents.
Briess v Wooley:326 A director of a company started negotiations for a
contract without any authority and made fraudulent misrepresentations.
Subsequently he was authorised to complete the contract, but did nothing to
correct the misrepresentations. The company was held liable.
In the following case the principals were held not liable:

the agent: "if there was any objection to the house", to which he answered
that there was not; the defendant entered into and signed the agreement,
but afterwards discovered that the adjoining house was a brothel, and on
that ground declined to fulfil the agreement. He claimed the right to avoid
the agreement as there was fraudulent concealment of a material fact. But
he was held bound by the agreement. There was no guilt in the principal
because he neither knew nor had authorised the statement to be made. There
was no guilt in the agent because he did not know that there was a brothel.
This decision has been criticised. 328 It should be the duty of the principal
to apprise the agent of the whole situation, otherwise he creates the risk of
innocent misrepresentation being made by the agent. Moreover, rescission is
allowed even for innocent misrepresentation and there was no reason why
this should not have been attributed to the principal. If the principal had
himself said "there was no objection to the house" he would have been.
guilty of fraud, and when he gives an ostensible position to his agent to make
this statement, the elementary principle that "he who acts through another
is deemed to act himself" should have been followed.
Despite criticism, the decision was followed in Armstrong v Strain:129
One Mr Strain, a retired practitioner, "owned a bungalow in an area
notoriously prone to produce settlements because of the heavy clay sub
soil. The bungalow had suffered severely from this scourge and had
already been underpinned three times". He was naturally anxious to dis-
pose it of and entrusted it to his partners for this purpose. His partners
arranged it with another firm, which found Armstrongs as buyers. The
bungalow was described to be "in a very nice condition" and one of the
partners of the latter firm valued it at £2000 for mortgage purposes. The
agents knew of the last underpinning but not of the two earlier ones.
Within two months of the transaction the bungalow collapsed finally. But
Armstrong's action to hold the principal liable in damages for the fraud
failed. The court found no conscious falsehood and, therefore, acquitted
the principal "and the unfortunate Armstrongs were left with the ruins
of a bungalow".
The decision has been described by L.C.B. Gower as one that is socially
undesirable and logically unsatisfying.330 The learned writer has stated the
position of English law in the following words:
The law is that a principal is not liable for fraud in respect of his agent's
acts unless-
(a) he intends or knowingly permits the agent to make a false state-
ment, or

Agent's authority 805
(b) his agent acting within the actual or apparent scope of his author-
ity makes a statement with knowledge of its falsity or recklessly not
caring whether it be true or false.
Agent's torts
"One who chooses to do business through an agent may in certain situa-
tions be liable for a tort committed by the agent. The doctrine of respondeat
superior (let the superior answer) will be applied to make the principal liable
where the agent commits a tort while engaged in the business of the princi-
pal, or, as it is commonly said, when the tort is committed by the agent while
acting in the course of and within the scope of his agency."331
"An agent kicked a boy from a moving streetcar. The principal was held
liable for assault and battery,332 An agent, employed to collect evidence for
his principal in a pending lawsuit, offered to bribe a witness. It was held that
the act was within the course of the employment of the agent and that the
principal was bound by it."333
It was at one time said, on the authority of Barwick v English Joint Stock
Bank 334 that the principal would not be liable where the agent committed a
tort for his personal benefit and not for the benefit of the principal. But the
House of Lords in their decision in Lloyd v Grace Smith & Co³ clearly
ruled that the Barwick case was not an authority for any such principle and
that the only condition of the principal's liability is that the act in question
must be within the course of the agency business. The facts of the case were
as follows:
Grace Smith & Co were a firm of solicitors of some repute and respect-
ability. Mrs Lloyd, a widow, being dissatisfied with the income of her
two cottages, consulted the firm's clerk, who was incharge of the con-
veyancing business, as to how to improve the income. He advised her to
dispose of the cottages. He asked her to bring the title deeds which she
did and obtained her signature on two papers. He converted these papers
into a sale deed to himself and subsequently disposed of the property and
misappropriated the proceeds. It was held "that the firm were responsi-
ble for the fraud committed by their representative in the course of his
employment", 336

RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF UNDISCLOSED PRINCIPAL
The rights and liabilities of a principal under contracts made by his agent
depend upon whether-
(a) The principal's existence and name were disclosed by the agent;
(b) The principal's existence was disclosed but not his name;
(c) Neither existence nor name of the principal was disclosed.
Where the principal is disclosed
Where the existence of the principal is disclosed, Section 226 applies,
according to which the agent's acts and contracts "will have the same legal
consequence as if the contracts had been entered into and the acts done by
the principal in person". The principal may sue the third party upon the con-
tract and vice versa. For example, where the agent is authorised to receive
payment, a payment to him discharges the third party from his liability to
the principal.
The agent can neither sue nor be sued upon a contract made by him on
behalf of his principal. "The contract is the contract of the principal, not
that of the agent, and prima facie at common law the only person who can
sue is the principal and the only person who can be sued is the principal."33
Unnamed principal
Even where the agent does not disclose the name of his principal, but dis-
closes his own representative character, the contract will be the contract of
the principal, unless there is something in its form or signature to show that
the agent intended to be personally liable. Where an agent signed the con-
tract as a broker, "to my principals", but did not disclose who the principals
were, he was not personally liable. 339 "There is nothing whatever on the con-
tract to show that the defendant intended to act otherwise than as a broker."
Undisclosed principal
The doctrine of undisclosed principal comes into play when the agent nei-
ther discloses the existence of his principal nor his representative character.

[S. 231]
Rights and liabilities of undisclosed principal 807
In such circumstances the question arises what are the mutual rights and
liabilities of the principal, the agent and the third party.
There is nothing unusual in this doctrine insofar as the relations between
the agent and the third party are concerned. Since the agent has contracted
in his own name, he is bound by the contract. He may be sued on it and he
has the right to sue the third party, and the principal is not liable in such a
case.³
340
But the principal too has the right to intervene and assert his position as
an undisclosed party to the contract. This right of the principal is protected
by the Contract Act itself. Section 231 declares:
If an agent makes a contract with a person who neither knows, nor has rea-
son to suspect that he is an agent, his principal may require the performance of
the contract; ....
This right of the principal has been described as "anomalous" because it
does not fit in any of the established principles of the law of contract.341 "The
rule which permits an undisclosed principal to sue and be sued on a contract
to which he is not a party, though well-established, is itself an anomaly."342
Similarly, in BoOWSTEAD'S LAW OF AGENCY¹³ the doctrine is described
as "surprising but well-established by the cases." Yet the doctrine has busi-
ness convenience to recommend itself. But for this doctrine, the property
or money of one person would have gone to enrich the estate of another
person. If, for example, an agent sells his principal's property in his own
name and receives the price, the principal is obviously entitled to trace his
money and recover it, even if the agent has gone bankrupt. An action of this
kind was allowed as early as 1710 in Gurratt v Cullum.345
But the principal's right to sue the third party was established with an
initial setback. In what has been considered to be the very first case, namely,'"
Scrimshire v Alderton:46
A farmer's oats were sold by a del credere factor without disclosing
the name or existence of the farmer. The factor became bankrupt. The
farmer discovered the buyer and informed him not to pay the factor. Even
so the buyer paid him.
LEE CJ was of opinion that the buyer should be responsible to the undis-
closed principal in such cases. "Here being notice before actual payment,
there could be no harm done." But the jury obstinately held for the defendant.

https://t.me/LawCollegeNotes_Stuffs
[Ss. 231-232]
The right of the undisclosed principal to intervene and sue the third party
is, however, subject to the following qualifications. They are laid down in
Sections 231 and 232.
S.231. Rights of parties to a contract made by agent not disclosed.-If
an agent makes a contract with a person who neither knows, nor has reason to
suspect that he is an agent, his principal may require the performance of the
contract; but the other contracting party has, as against the principal, the same
rights as he would have had as against the agent if the agent had been principal.
If the principal discloses himself before the contract is completed, the other
contracting party may refuse to fulfil the contract, if he can show that, if he had
known who was the principal in the contract or if he had known that the agent
was not a principal, he would not have entered into the contract.
S.232. Performance of contract with agent supposed to be principal.-
Where one man makes a contract with another, neither knowing nor having rea-
sonable ground to suspect that the other is an agent the principal, if he requires
the performance of the contract, can only obtain such performance subject to
the rights and obligations subsisting between the agent and the other party to
the contract.
Illustration
A, who owes 500 rupees to B, sells 1000 rupees worth of rice to B. A is acting as agent for
C in the transaction, but B has no knowledge nor reasonable ground of suspicion that such is
the case. C cannot compel B to take the rice without allowing him to set-off A's debt.
Subject to equities
Firstly, the other contracting party would have against the principal "the
same rights which he would have had against the agent if the agent had
been principal". This declaration of Section 231 is further supplemented by
Section 232 which says that "the principal, if he requires the performance
of the contract, can only obtain such performance subject to the rights and
obligations subsisting between the agent and the other party to the contract".
The main concern of these sections is to ensure that the third party is not
put to any disadvantage by the intervention of the principal. If, for example,
the agent owes some money to the third party, which the latter could have
set-off against the price of the goods sold to him, he would have the same
right if the principal sues him for the price.47 Montagu v Forwood³48 is an
illustration in point.
The plaintiffs, who were acting for the owners of a cargo, employed
B&Co as their agents to collect from underwriters contributions in
respect of general average loss. B & Co not being brokers, employed the
347. See Greer v Downs Supply Co, (1927) 2 KB 28 (CA), where timber was purchased under the
impression that the buyer would have set-off against the seller and the undisclosed principal
of the seller was not allowed to intervene.

Rights and liabilities of undisclosed principal 809
defendants, who were brokers at Lloyd's, to collect the money, and they
did so. At the time when the defendants received the money there was a
debt due to them from B & Co The defendants did not know and there
was nothing to lead them to suppose, that B & Co were not acting as
principals in the matter and the defendants believed that B & Co were
acting as principals.
It was held that the defendants were entitled to stand in the position in
which they would have stood if B & Co had really been principals; and that
consequently, the defendants were entitled to set-off against the demand of
the plaintiffs for the money which they had collected the debt due to them
from B & Co.
The illustration appended to Section 232 is more or less to the same effect.
A, who owes 500 rupees to B, sells 1000 rupees worth of rice to B. A is acting as agent
for C in the transaction, but B has no knowledge nor reasonable grounds of suspicion
that such is the case. C cannot compel B to take the rice without allowing him to set-off
A's debt.
A contract to underwrite the shares of a company, i.e., to take up that
portion of the shares which is not applied for by the public, was not allowed
to be enforced by the undisclosed principal of the underwriter because an
engagement of this kind proceeds upon the personal reputation and integrity
of the underwriter.349
But where the third party does not believe the agent to be a principal or
there are suspicious circumstances he may not be able to claim a set-off.
Thus, for example, in Isaac Cooke v Henry Douglas Eshelby;350
L&Co sold cotton to C, in their own names, but really on behalf of
an undisclosed principal. C knew that L & Co were in the habit of deal-
ing both for principals and on their own account and had no belief on
the subject whether they made this contract on their own account or for
a principal.
It was held that C could not, in an action brought by the principal for the
price of cotton, set-off a debt due from L & Co.
Third party's right to repudiate executory contract
Secondly, if the principal discloses himself before the contract is com-
pleted, the third party may repudiate the contract if he can show that if he
had known who the principal was or that the agent was not the principal,
he would not have contracted. 351 The right of the third party to repudiate
the contract arises only when the identity of the undisclosed principal would

have been so material to him that if he had known the true facts, he would
not have contracted. Thus in Said v Butt:352
A theatre ticket was purchased by a person through an undisclosed
agent knowing full well that a ticket would not have been issued to him
on personal grounds. It was held that the theatre-owner had the right to
repudiate the contract and exclude him from admission.
It means that an undisclosed principal cannot intervene when he knows
that the other party would not have dealt with him. This principle will apply
only when "some personal consideration (forms) a material ingredient".3
In Dyster v Randall and Sons354 a piece of land was purchased by somebody
for an undisclosed principal. The owner would not have sold the land to
him, yet he was allowed to intervene and enforce the contract. 355
Undisclosed principal cannot intervene against express terms
Lastly, an undisclosed principal cannot intervene if some express or
implied term of the contract excludes him from doing so. Where, for exam-
ple, an agent described himself in the contract as "owner",356 "proprie-
tor", 357 it shows an intention to make a personal contract and consequently
precludes the undisclosed principal from intervening. But where, in a con-
tract of letting out, the agent described himself as the "landlord", evidence
was allowed to show that he was only an agent. Similarly, "the description
in a charter-party of one of the contracting parties as 'charterer' does not, of
itself, designate him as the only person to fill that position", and the undis-
closed principal was allowed to sue for the breach of the charter-party,358
Third party's right against undisclosed principal
Just as the undisclosed principal has the right to sue the third party, the
latter has the right to sue the principal. Difficult questions in this connection
have arisen where the principal has already paid the agent, trusting that he
has paid or will pay the third party, but the agent has defaulted or has gone
bankrupt before payment. This happened in Davison v Donaldson, 359
The managing owner and the ship's husband purchased goods on credit
from the plaintiff for the purposes of the ship. The undisclosed partner
settled his account with the husband believing that the latter had paid the

355. Even where no personal considerations are involved and the third party was told that the
agent was not acting for any principal, the third party can avoid the contract for fraud.

sued the principal.
The court said: "Where a person is supplied with goods it is his duty to see
that the seller is paid....Partners ought not to settle with their co-partners
without satisfying themselves that the payments have been actually made."
PERSONAL LIABILITY OF AGENT [S. 230]
S. 230. Agent cannot personally enforce, nor be bound by, contracts on
behalf of principal.-In the absence of any contract to that effect, an agent
cannot personally enforce contract entered into by him on behalf of his princi-
pal, nor is he personally bound by them.
Presumption of contract to contrary.-Such a contract shall be presumed
to exist in the following cases-
(1) where the contract is made by an agent for the sale or purchase of goods
for a merchant resident abroad;
(2) where the agent does not disclose the name of his principal;
(3) where the principal, though disclosed, cannot be sued.
Agent cannot sue or be sued unless contrary contract
It has already been seen that the chief function of an agent is to establish
contractual relationship between his principal and third parties. The agent
then drops out. He can neither sue nor be sued on contracts made by him
on his principal's behalf. Section 230 accordingly provides: In the absence
of any contract to that effect, an agent cannot personally enforce contracts
entered into by him on behalf of his principal, nor is he personally bound by
them. 360 Where a consignment was landed from a ship but the consignee did
not take delivery and the question arose as to who was liable to pay demur-
rage, it was held that the liability was solely that of the consignee and not
that of the shipping agent. Similarly, in a case before the Calcutta High
Court³ it was apparent from the bill of lading that the document was signed
by the agent of a principal who was named in the document. There was no
contract to the effect that the agent would be bound by the contract. Thus,
unless it is shown that there is a contract to the effect of binding the agent,
entered into on behalf of the named principal, the agent cannot be bound

by it. The attachment of the bank account of the agent was not allowed to
be continued. Earning of commission by the agent cannot make his agency
as one coupled with interest. The mere fact that some of the persons were
directors in the principal company as well as in the agency company was not
a material fact when the principal was fully disclosed. 363
This is known as the principle of the agent's immunity from personal
liability. This rule applies even where the agent has contracted beyond his
authority and the principal would not be liable. Even then the agent cannot
be sued on the contract if he professed to act for the principal,164 though he
will then be liable to compensate the third party for his loss.
But there are certain circumstances in which the agent incurs personal
liability. Section 230, which incorporates the principle of agent's immunity
for personal liability, says that there may be a contract to the contrary. In
other words, the agent may contract to undertake personal liability. The
section further goes on to provide that such contract is presumed in the
following cases:
Presumption of contrary contract
In the following cases there is presumption of a contract to the contrary:
1. Foreign principal
When an agent contracts for "a merchant resident abroad" there is the
presumption that the agent undertakes personal liability. [S. 230(1)] The
original presumption of English law was that the agent alone was liable and
he had no right to pledge the credit of a foreign principal. The presump-
tion still stands, but it has declined in importance. The presumption was
needed at a time when it was difficult to sue foreign principals and for the
convenience of merchants a usage came into existence that the agent of a
363. Another case to the same effect Midland Overseas v C.M.B.T. Tana, AIR 1999 Bom 401,
the contract of carriage was entered into by agent on behalf of foreign principal who was
named and disclosed. The agent did not undertake any personal liability. The agent could
not be sued personally for the alleged breach of contract. K.M. Sankaran v DC, (2004) 2
CTC 101, a power of attorney holder agent working as a disclosed agent was not allowed to
be sued personally for dues against the principal. The judgment in the case of Mackinnon
Mackenzie & Co v Lang, Moir & Co, ILR (1881) 5 Bom 584 an admitted position that the
company was aware of the fact that the other contracting party was acting as an agent for a
third party whose name was already known to the contracting party. Prem Nath Motors Ltd
v Anurag Mittal, (2009) 16 SCC 274: AIR 2009 SC 567, the principal called applications for
booking cars. The agent received applications with cheques drawn in favour of the principal.
The claim of the petitioner was that he filed an application alongwith the cheque, but neither
he received the car nor refund. The plea of the agent that the liability was of the principal
and not his was held to be proper. National Textile Corpn Ltd v Nareshkumar Badrikumar
Jagad, (2011) 12 SCC 695: AIR 2012 SC 264, agent sued when principal known, the agent
challenged it before the Supreme Court for the first time. It being a question of fact, the chal-
lenge was not entertained.

two is sueable, both should be sued. (1989) Malaysian LJ 187, SC Kuala Lumpur.

Personal liability of agent 813
foreign principal incurs personal liability. But now on account of changed
conditions of international trade, merchants trust each other and agents do
not like to incur personal liability. The resulting position has been summed
up by SCRUTTON LJ in the following words: "While I think that one cannot
at the present day attach the importance which used to be attached forty or
fifty years ago to the fact that the supposed principal is a foreigner, it is still
a matter to be taken into account in deciding whether the person said to be
an English agent has or has not made himself personally liable."366
The presumption being still a part of the law, an agent can only over-
throw it by contracting in a manner showing an intention not to incur per-
sonal liability. Thus, where a contract was signed "by the authority of our
principals,... as agents", or "Greenwich Marine Incorporated as agents for
Trader Export S.A."37 it was held that this was sufficient manifestation of
the intention to exclude personal liability. Where a charter-party contract
was signed by agents "for and on behalf of J.M. & Co (as agents), J.A.M."
they were held to be not personally liable under the charter-party, although
they were described as charterers. 369 Where a contract made through an
agent for the import of metallic recovery expressly provided that the obli-
gations of the principal or seller were not enforceable against the agent, a
claim for shortage in metallic recovery against the agent was held to be not
maintainable. 370
Where there was a short landing of goods and a suit for damages was
filed against the foreign principal, the carrier, it was held that the Indian
agent was automatically discharged of liability. The court said that both the
principal and agent could not be sued together.371
366. H.O. Brandt & Co v H.N. Morris & Co Ltd, (1917) 2 KB 784, 797, in some of the cases,
however, it has been stated that the presumption has ceased to exist altogether and the whole
question turns upon the intention of the parties. See, for example, PRITCHARD J in Holt &
Mosley Ltd v Cunningham & Partners, (1949) 83 LIL Reports 141; quoted in Powell, THE
LAW OF AGENCY, 252 (1961). A.H. Hudson in his three contributions, namely, Agent of a
Foreign Principal, (1960) 23 Mod LR 695, and (1957) 35 Can BR 336; Agents for Foreign
Principals, (1966) 29 Mod LR 353 has argued that the presumption still exists as part of the
law. See also Teheran Europe Co Ltd v S.T. Belton (Tractors) Ltd, (1968) 2 QB 545. The
matter depends upon as to whom the third party gave credit or may be presumed to have
given credit. He cannot be presumed to have given credit to a foreign principal about whom
he knows nothing. James Machintosh & Co v Sree Yamuna Mills Co Ltd, (1990) 2 KLJ

[S. 230]
By virtue of the provision in Section 230 the presumption has statutory
force in India. A company registered in England, and having a place of busi-
ness in India, has been held to be a foreign principal for the purposes of this
presumption and the Indian agent acting for it was held personally liable.372
2. Principal unnamed
The presumption of agent's personal liability arises when he "does not
disclose the name of his principal". Where an agent contracts for an undis-
closed principal, he definitely is personally liable, being a party to the con-
tract. 373 But when he contracts for an unnamed principal, there is only
a presumption of his personal liability. The presumption may arise even
where the agent discloses his representative character, but not the name of
his principal. Accordingly, the honorary secretary of a school was held per-
sonally liable for the rent of a house hired by him in his own name though
for purposes of the school. But where an agent disclosed his character as
the secretary of a club, personal liability could not be imposed on him.375
The same result would follow where the representative character is already
known to the third party. 376 But in every such case the form of contract
will be the deciding factor. In an English case, a broker signed a contract in
his own name, but had added: "Messrs Southwell, to my principal, etc." It
was held that he was not personally liable. 377 "There is nothing whatever in
the contract to show that the defendant intended to act otherwise than as
broker." Where an order was placed over telephone by a-broker to another
broker for the supply of bunkers, the ordering broker was held to be not per-
sonally liable. The general practice in placing orders by telephone was not to
disclose the name of the principal and, moreover, the supplier already knew
that the order was sent by a broker. 378 Where, on the other hand, the usual
mode of operation over telex of a forwarding agent was to remark, without
disclosing the name of the principal, "We can do this for you", he was held

personally liable, though in that case he indicated the name of the liner to
whom he was forwarding the goods. 379
Liability of dealer under the Consumer Protection Act
A dealer of motor vehicles was held personally liable under the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 for passing a defective vehicle to a consumer buyer.
His defence was that the real liability should be that of the manufacturer.
The National Commission said that the dealer may have his reimbursement
from his principal against any such liability but so far as the consumer is
concerned he was bound either to rectify the defect or take back the vehicle
and refund the price.380
3. Non-existent or incompetent principal
An agent is presumed to incur personal liability where he contracts on
behalf of a principal who, "though disclosed cannot be sued". An agent
who contracts for a minor, the minor being not liable, the agent becomes
personally liable. This result may not, however, follow where the other party
already knows that the principal is minor.381 Similarly, where promoters buy
goods on behalf of a projected company they become personally liable to
pay for them. The company, being not in existence at the time of the con-
tract, cannot be sued. Now, by virtue of the provision in Section 9(2) of
the European Communities Act, 1972, an agent of an unformed principal
will be deemed to be contracting personally so as to entitle him to sue and
be also sued on the contract. The Calcutta High Court did not permit an
agent of the Russian Government to be sued personally because it was nei-
ther averred nor proved that the Government of Russia could not be sued in
India or elsewhere. The mere fact that such a suit required permission of the
Government of India could not be taken to mean that no suit was possible.343
Directors of company
Directors of a company are not agents of the company in the conven-
tional sense of the principal-agent relationship ordinarily, therefore, they are
not liable in damages for breach of contract committed by their company.
Even if they are agents, Section 230 confers immunity on an agent against
personal liability provided only that the contract has been made in the rep-
resentative capacity for and on behalf of the principal. There are no doubt
some exceptions. But it is a general principal and not an exception that an

agent committing tort or some other wrong, for example, inducing a person
to make a loan to the company by making a fraudulent representation, the
director would be personally liable. 384
Election by third party [S. 233]
S. 233. Right of person dealing with agent personally liable.-In cases
where the agent is personally liable, a person dealing with him may hold either
him or his principal, or both of them liable.
In all the above situations "where the agent is personally liable, a person
dealing with him may hold either him or his principal, or both of them, lia-
ble." The only illustration given in the section says:
A enters into a contract with B to sell him 100 bales of cotton and afterwards discov-
ers that B was acting as agent for C. A may sue either B or C, or both, for the price of the
cotton.
This seems to be a departure from the English law, where the third party
has to elect between the liability of the principal or agent and the election
once made is final and binding on him.385 If, for example, he has obtained
judgment against the agent, he cannot afterwards sue the principal even if
the judgment against the agent has remained unsatisfied. 386 But this rule has
been criticised.7 Clearly it is contrary to justice that T should not be able
to sue P if his judgment against A is unsatisfied. The rule works particu-
larly harshly where T does not even know of P's existence until after he has
obtained judgment against A.388
It is perhaps for this reason that the Indian Legislature marked a depar-
ture from the English rule and allowed the third party to sue the agent
and the principal jointly, COUTTS-TROTTER CJ of the Madras High Court
doubted whether this was the intention of the Legislature and opined that
the English rule should be followed.389 But a subsequent Division Bench of
the same High Court disagreed with him. LEACH CJ said: "There is no ambi-
guity in the language used in the section and I am unable to see anything
unreasonable in the rule, which it embodies. What would be the position
if a suit is brought against the principal after judgment had been obtained
against the agent in an earlier suit is another matter, but we are not called
upon to consider that question here."390 Earlier the Bombay High Court had
also held that the section plainly intends to create joint liability. 391

Personal liability of agent 817
But it seems that even under this section some kind of election is likely to
be involved. The third party has to choose between the liability of the agent,
or the principal or both and the choice once made shall bind him.
Election may be express or implied from conduct. An implied election
takes place when the third party debits the account of the principal or the
agent, 392 receives a negotiable instrument from one or the other in payment
of the price, or sues one or the other. Filing of a suit is a strong prima facie
evidence of election, but is not conclusive. 393
Estoppel of third party [S. 234]
S.234. Consequence of inducing agent or principal to act on belief that
principal or agent will be held exclusively liable.-When a person who has
made a contract with an agent induces the agent to act upon the belief that
the principal only will be held liable, or induces the principal to act upon the
belief that the agent only will be held liable, he cannot afterwards hold liable
the agent or principal respectively.
One method of electing between the principal and the agent is indicated
by Section 234. If the third party leads the agent to believe that only the
principal will be held liable or the principal to believe that only the agent
will be held liable, he cannot afterwards change his stance. He would have
to confine himself to the liability of a person whom he has selected by that
process. Thus where a purchaser of goods gave notice to the seller's agent
that the agent alone would be held responsible if the goods did not turn out
to be of contract quality, he could not proceed against the principal.394
4. Pretended agent [S. 235]
S. 235. Liability of pretended agent.-A person untruly representing
himself to be the authorised agent of another, and thereby inducing a third per-
son to deal with him as such agent, is liable, if his alleged employer does not rat-
ify his acts, to make compensation to the other in respect of any loss or damage
which he has incurred by so dealing.
Thus where a person pretends to act as the agent of another, he may be
saved by the principal by ratifying his act. But if no ratification is forthcom-
ing the pretended agent becomes personally liable to the third party for any
loss that he may have suffered by relying upon the representation of author-
ity. It would make no difference to his liability that he honestly believed that
he had the authority in question or that, even if he did not have it, his princi-
pal would ratify his act. The false representation must be the cause of the

[S. 236]
contract. A person who acknowledged the liability of a firm pretending to
be one of its partners was held to have incurred personal liability under the
acknowledgment. 39 Since the action in such cases is under the tort of deceit,
tort principles as to damages would apply rather than those applicable to
breach of contract. If the truth is already known to the other party, no
liability arises, 398
Where the pretension is as to a matter of law, the agent would not be
liable. For example, the borrowing power of a company is a matter of inter-
pretation of its constitutional documents and governing statutes. A mis-
representation as to this will not create liability. But whether borrowing
powers have been exhausted, is a question of fact. Liability would follow if
this fact is misrepresented.400
The agent himself cannot sue on a contract which he has made pretending
to be an agent. This disability is clinched upon him by Section 236.
S. 236. Person falsely contracting as agent, not entitled to perfor-
mance. A person with whom a contract has been entered into the character
of agent is not entitled to require the performance of it, if he was in reality act-
ing, not as agent, but on his own account.
When a person has, in fact, no principal, yet persuades the other to con-
tract with him as an agent of another, he is estopped from saying that he
had no principal, and since the contract was with his principal and not with
him he has no locus standi to sue under that right. This will be so whether
he feigns a named or unnamed principal. Where a shipping agent gave a
personal commitment of issuing a bill of lading after mate's receipt but did
not do so, he was held personally liable to the principal for the tort of con-
version and for breach of contract under Section 73 of the Contract Act.402
5. Breach of warranty of authority
401
Closely allied to the liability of a pretended agent is the liability of an
agent for breach of warranty of authority. Where a person is in fact an agent,
but exceeds his authority, or represents to have a kind of authority which he
in fact does not have, he commits breach of warranty of authority and is per-
sonally liable to the third party for any loss caused to him by reason of act-
ing on the false representation. This is the principle of Collins v Wright.404

Ratification 819
W was land agent for one G. W agreed to grant to the plaintiff a lease
of G's farm for 12 years. He honestly believed that he had the authority
to do so. But G refused to execute the lease and he proved that he had
given no such authority to the agent. W, having died in the meantime, the
plaintiff sued his executors for the loss he had suffered in entering upon
the farm, and they were held liable.
WILLES J said:405 "The fact that the professed agent honestly thinks that he
has authority that affects the moral character of his act; but his moral inno-
cence, so far as the person whom he has induced to contract is concerned, in
no way aids such person, or alleviates the inconvenience and damage which
he sustains. The obligation arising in such a case is well expressed by saying
that a person, professing to contract as agent for another, impliedly, if not
expressly, undertakes to or promises the person who enters into such con-
tract, upon the faith to the professed agent being duly authorised, that the
authority which he professes to have does in point of fact exist."406
Similarly, in Yonge v Toynbee107 an agent was held liable for prosecuting
an action even after his principal, though unknown to him, had become
insane, for the insanity had determined the agent's authority at once. An
agent was held liable to a person to whom he chartered his principal's ship
without authority of the principal who repudiated the transaction. 408 An
agent gives warranty of his authority; he does not guarantee that, if the con-
tract is within authority, the principal would not commit breach.
RATIFICATION
The doctrine of ratification comes into play when a person has done an
act on behalf of another without his knowledge or consent. The doctrine
gives the person on whose behalf the act is done an option either to adopt
the act by ratification or to disown it. Ratification is thus a kind of affirma-
tion of unauthorised acts. It is thus explained in Section 196:
S. 196. Right of person as to acts done for him without his author-
ity: Effect of ratification.-Where acts are done by one person on behalf of
another, but without his knowledge or authority, he may elect to ratify or to
disown such acts. If he ratify them, the same effects will follow as if they had
been performed by his authority.
405. Collins v Wright, (1857) 8 E&B 647 (657): 27 LJ QB 215: 30 LT 209.
406. The principle of this case applies to all cases where a person induces another to do an act
on the faith of his representation. See, for example, Starkey v Bank of England, 1903 AC
114 (HL), transfer to consols by the bank on the faith of the defendant's representation that
he had the power of attorney to authorise the transfer; Sheffield Corpn v Barclay, 1905 AC
392, a banker innocently inducing a corporation to act on the basis of a forged deed; Bank
of England v Cutler, (1908) 2 KB 208 (CA), the agent innocently introducing certain person
as the owner of stock, when he was not so in fact.

408. Weigall S. & Co v Runciman & Co, (1916) 85 LJKB 187 (CA), the agent was authorised to
hire a ship but he mistook the instruction and let out a ship.

[S. 197]
Where, for example, a person insures the goods of another without his
authority, the owner may ratify the policy and then the policy will be as
valid as if the agent had been authorised to insure the goods.109
Ratification may be expressed or implied. Section 197 provides:
S. 197. Ratification may be expressed or implied.-Ratification may be
expressed or may be implied in the conduct of the person on whose behalf the
acts are done.
Illustrations
(a) A, without authority, buys goods for B. Afterwards B sells them to C on his own account;
B's conduct implies a ratification of the purchase made for him by A.
(b) A, without B's authority, lends B's money to C. Afterwards B accepts interest on the
money from C. B's conduct implies a ratification of the loan.
Where the manager of an insurance company effected an assurance which
he had no authority to do, but the company accepted the money which was
received under the policy, that was held to be a sufficient ratification.410
"Ratification will be implied from any act showing an intention to adopt
the transaction, even silence or mere acquiescence and if an act is adopted
at all, it will be held to have been adopted throughout." Ratification of a
contract required to be in writing need not be in writing, but ratification of
a contract made by deed must be by deed.412
Requirements of ratification
A valid ratification has to fulfil certain conditions. Some of them are as
follows:-
1. On behalf of another
In the first place, it is necessary that the act in question must have been
done on behalf of the person who wants to ratify it. The agent must profess
to act as an agent and on behalf of an identifiable principal. "It is not neces-
sary that he should be named, but there must be such a description of him
as shall amount to a reasonable designation of the person intended to be

Ratification 821
bound by the contract. "413 If the agent acts in his own name and "makes no
allusion to agency"414 his act cannot be ratified by any other person, even if
the agent in his secret mind intended to act for another. This is the principle
of the famous case of Keighley Maxseted & Co v Durant. 415
K.M. & Co, authorised their agent to buy Karachi wheat at specified
rates on their joint account. Wheat was not obtainable at those rates. He
bought wheat from Durant at a higher rate. He did so in the hope and
confidence that his act would be adopted by the principals, but he never
mentioned the principals and contracted in his own name. The principals
approved the purchase, but, when the price of wheat fell, refused to take
delivery. Durant sued the agent and the principals for breach of contract.
But the principals were held not liable. The agent, having contracted in
his own name, his act was not open to anybody's ratification and, therefore,
the purported ratification was ineffective. Lord MACNAGHTEN said: "... [B]y
a wholesome and convenient fiction, a person ratifying the act of another,
who, without authority, has made a contract openly and avowedly on his
behalf, is deemed to be a party to the contract. Does the fiction cover the
case of a person who makes no avowal at all, but assumes to act for himself
and for no one else? On principle I should say certainly not....[O]bligations
are not to be created by, or founded upon, undisclosed intentions."416
Similarly Lord JAMES said: [at p. 251] "To establish that a man's thoughts
unexpressed and unrecorded can form the basis of a contract so as to bind
other persons and make them liable on a contract they never made with per-
sons they never heard of, seems a somewhat difficult task."
The words "on behalf of another" as used in Section 196 expressly rec-
ognise this rule.17 The section, however, does not insist upon the name of
the principal being disclosed. Marine insurance policies are often effected
on behalf of anybody interested and are, therefore, open to anybody's rati-
fication. Where the act is purported to be done on behalf of another, that
other may ratify even if the agent used his name to commit a fraud upon the
third party.419

2. Competence of principal
[S. 200]
Since ratification relates back to the date when the contract was origi-
nally made by the agent, it is necessary that the principal who purports to
ratify must be in existence at the time of the contract and should also be
competent. It is this principle which prevents a person from ratifying a con-
tract made by him during his minority. Similarly, a company cannot ratify
a contract made in its name before its incorporation. But this is subject
to the provisions of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. Section 15 of the Act pro-
vides that where the promoters of a public company have made a contract
before its incorporation, for the purposes of the company, and if the con-
tract is warranted by the terms of incorporation, the company may enforce
it. "Warranted by the terms of incorporation" means within the scope of the
company's objects as stated in the memorandum. The contract should be for
the purposes of the company. A contract to allot shares after the company
is incorporated is not for the purposes of the company so that the company
cannot enforce it against the other party.
Section 19 of the same Act provides that the other party can also enforce
the contract if the company has adopted it after incorporation and the con-
tract is within the terms of incorporation.
3. What acts can be ratified (Act should be lawful) (S. 200]
S. 200. Ratification of unauthorised act cannot injure third per-
son. An act done by one person on behalf of another, without such other
person's authority, which, if done with authority, would have the effect of sub-
jecting a third person to damages, or of terminating any right or interest of a
third person, cannot by ratification, be made to have such effect.
Illustrations
(a) A, not being authorized thereto by B, demands, on behalf of B, the delivery of a chattel,
the property of B, from C, who is in possession of it. This demand cannot be ratified by
B, so as to make C liable for damages for his refusal to deliver.
(b) A holds a lease from B, terminable on three months' notice. C, an unauthorized person,
gives notice of termination to A. The notice cannot be ratified by B, so as to be binding
on A.
ONLY LAWFUL ACTS CAN BE RATIFIED.-Only lawful acts are open to
ratification. An act which is void from the very beginning cannot be ratified.
The Privy Council observed in a case122 that ratification "must be in relation

to a transaction which may be valid in itself and not illegal". Where money
was entrusted to a person for investment and he put it to his own use, it
was held by the Privy Council that the doctrine of ratification could not be
used to validate this breach of fiduciary obligation. Where the manag-
ing director of a corporation removed an employee belonging to a category
of employees whom he was not authorised to remove, it was held that the
act was an illegal termination of employment and could not be cured by
ratification,424
Subject to this, any act may be ratified "whether it is founded on a tort
or on a contract". A forgery of signatures, being a crime, cannot be rati-
fied.425 A minor's agreement being void cannot be ratified by him on attain-
ing majority.
ACTS WHICH WOULD BECOME INJURIOUS BY RATIFICATION. — Similarly,
acts which would become injurious to others by ratification cannot be rat-
ified. This principle is incorporated in Section 200 which says that an act
cannot be ratified which by ratification "would have the effect of subjecting
a third person to damages",426 The illustrations to the section are that an
unauthorised notice terminating a lease cannot be ratified.427
ACTS DONE ON BEHALF OF GOVERNMENT.-Such acts are ratifiable
in the same way in which private acts can be. In one of the cases it was
observed: 428 "If there had been any doubt about the original intention of the
Government, it has clearly ratified and adopted the acts of its agents which
according to the principle in Buron v Denman 29 is equivalent to previous
authority." Thus acts of public servants in excess of their authority may be
ratified by the Government.
Where public officers exceed their authority the State will be liable only
to the extent it has expressly or impliedly ratified or approved the acts of
such officers. This was laid down specifically as early as 1861 in Collector of
of Article 299(1) of the Constitution. Their Lordships observed: "There can in truth be no
notification without an intention to ratify and there can be no intention to ratify an illegal
act without knowledge of illegality."

Masulipatam v Cavaly Vencata Narrianpah, where the court said: "The
acts of a Government officer bind the Government only when he is acting
in the discharge of certain duty within the limits of the authority or if he
exceeds that authority, when the Government in fact or in law directly or by
implication ratifies the excess."
4. Knowledge of facts [S. 198]
S. 198. Knowledge requisite for valid ratification.-No valid ratification
can be made by a person whose knowledge of the facts of the case is materially
defective.
"To constitute a binding adoption of acts a priori unauthorised these con-
ditions must exist: (1) the acts must have been done for and in the name of
the supposed principal, and (2) there must be full knowledge of what those
acts were, or such an unqualified adoption that the inference may properly
be drawn that the principal intended to take upon himself the responsibility
for such acts, whatever they were."
5. Whole transaction [S. 199]
S. 199. Effect of ratifying unauthorised act forming part of a transac-
tion.-A person ratifying any unauthorised act done on his behalf, ratifies the
whole of the transaction of which such act formed a part.
A person cannot ratify a part of the transaction which is beneficial to him
and repudiate the rest. So a ratification of a part of a transaction operates as
a ratification of the whole of the transaction.432
6. Within reasonable time
A ratification to be effective must come within reasonable time. 433 If a time
is fixed for performance of the contract, ratification must come before that
time otherwise it will be too late. For example, a tender for supply of eggs
was approved by a board, but not formally. The time for commencement

Ratification 825
of performance was September. Before this date the tender was withdrawn.
The board ratified its approval of the tender on October 6. It was held this
was too late as it was done after the date fixed for performance. 435 Similarly,
a policy of fire insurance was not allowed to be ratified after the occurrence
of the loss, because the owner himself could not have insured at that time.436
The only exception is marine insurance, where a policy can be ratified even
after the owner has come to know of the loss. "The principal has no right
to pause and wait for the fluctuation of the market, in order to ascertain
whether the purchase is likely to be beneficial. He is bound if he decides to
notify his determination in a reasonable time provided he has an opportu-
nity of doing it."438
Effects of ratification
Ratification has the following effects:
(1) It establishes the relationship of principal and agent insofar as the
act ratified is concerned between the person ratifying and the person
doing the act.
(2) Ratification establishes the relationship of contract between the prin-
cipal and the third party.
Doctrine of relation back
Ratification relates back to the date on which the agent first contracted.
Section 196 declares that if an unauthorised act is ratified by the person on
whose behalf it was done, "the same effects will follow as if they had been
performed by his authority". Thus there is a contract between the principal
and the third party, not from the date of ratification, but from the date when
the agent first contracted. One of the effects of relation back is demonstrated
by Bolton Partners v Lambert, 439
The defendant made an offer to the managing director of a company
who, having no authority to do so, accepted it. That gave the company
an option to ratify the contract. But the company ratified only after the
defendant had withdrawn his offer. The company sued the defendant for
specific performance.
The company was held entitled to it. The company's ratification related
back to the date on which the managing director first accepted the offer.
Thus there was a contract between the company and the defendant from
that date. The defendant's revocation of his offer was ineffective. LINDLEY
LJ believed that it was not a question of withdrawal of offer, but withdrawal

[S. 199]
from contract. The managing director having accepted the offer, though
without authority, there was contract, and it was not an offer, but a contract
that was ratified. He said:
"I can find no authority in the books to warrant the contention that an
offer made, and in fact accepted by a principal through an agent or oth-
erwise, can be withdrawn. The true view on the contrary appears to be
that the doctrine as to retrospective action of ratification is applicable."
The decision has been criticised on the ground that it leaves the third
party in a worse position than he would have been in if he had contracted
with the principal, for then he could have revoked his offer until the prin-
cipal had accepted it. But if he contracts through an unauthorised agent,
he neither has a contract (until ratified) nor can he withdraw from it. The
American Restatement suggests a different rule: "To constitute a ratifica-
tion, the affirmance of a transaction must occur before the other party has
manifested his withdrawal from it either to the purported principal or to the
agent, and before the offer or agreement has been otherwise terminated or
been discharged." [S. 88, Restatement]
The decision has also been justified. The defendant had contracted to sell
the property for certain price and was given the same terms. The ratification
had not caused him any prejudice.+40
But the general trend of opinion is against the decision. That is why it is
not to be extended and was not followed in Watson v Davies. 441
The defendant offered to sell his property to a charitable institu-
tion. The offer was accepted by a few members of the board "subject
to approval by full members of the board". The day on which the board
was to meet, the defendant withdrew his offer. The board ratified it and
brought an action for specific performance.
The ratification was held to be too late, and the revocation effective.
MAUGHAM J said: "An acceptance by an agent... subject in express terms to
ratification by his principal is legally a nullity until ratified, and is no more
binding on the other party than an unaccepted offer which can, of course,
be withdrawn before acceptance."
The above decision may be said to constitute an exception to the principle in
Bolton Partners v Lambert.442 Another exception is where ratification would
prejudice the interests acquired by others. For example, an unauthorised
stoppage of goods in transit cannot be ratified after the transit has ended.443
The doctrine of relation back does not come into play where the contract
made by the agent says that it is "subject to approval or ratification". In such

cases the other party would have the option to withdraw until ratification.444
Retrospective ratification also becomes ruled out where the agent and third
party have already by mutual consent cancelled the contract.445
DETERMINATION OF AGENCY
The relationship of principal and agent may end in any of the ways men-
tioned in Section 201.446
S. 201. Termination of agency.-An agency is terminated by the principal
revoking his authority; or by the agent renouncing the business of the agency;
or by the business of the agency being completed; or by either the principal or
agent dying or becoming of unsound mind; or by the principal being adjudi-
cated an insolvent under the provisions of any Act for the time being in force for
the relief of insolvent debtors.
The section provides for the following modes of termination:
1. Revocation147;
2. Renunciation by agents;
3. Completion of business;
4. Principal or agent's death;
5. Principal or agent becoming person of unsound mind;
6. Insolvency of principal;
7. Expiry of time.
These modes are considered below:
By revocation [S. 203]
The principal may revoke his agent's authority and that puts an end to
the agency.
S. 203. When principal may revoke agent's authority. The principal
may, save as is otherwise provided by the last preceding section, revoke the
authority given to his agent at any time before the authority has been exercised
so as to bind the principal.

v State of Bihar, 2015 SCC OnLine Pat 299: AIR 2015 Pat 110, an agency was created to run

either on establishing its own diagnostic centres or by following the procedure prescribed
by law. There was no clarity about power of termination. The Authority had not established
its own centres. Yet it terminated the agency that too by not giving any prior notice of show
cause, arbitration was also not accepted because work was of emergency nature. Termination
was held to be not proper.

[S. 203]
Section 207 further provides that revocation may be expressed or implied
in the conduct of the principal. An illustration appended to the section says:
A empowers B to let A's house. Afterwards A lets it himself. This is an
implied revocation of B's authority.
Thus where the owner of a colliery appointed a sole selling agent for his
coal for seven years, it was held that the owner could sell the colliery even
before the expiry of this period and thus terminate the agency. He was not
bound to keep his colliery,448
Lord PENZANCE said: "Upon such an agreement as that... unless there
is some special term in the contract that the principal shall continue to carry
on business, it cannot for a moment be implied as a matter of obligation on
his part that, whether the business is a profitable one or not, and whether for
his own sake he wishes to carry it or not, he shall be bound to carry it on for
the benefit of the agent and the commission that he may receive."
Similarly, an agent had provided a charter-party to the owner of a ship to
run for a period of 18 months, the agent receiving commission on hire paid
and earned. The owner sold the ship to the charterers within four months.
The charter-party ended and so did the agency. The agent could not recover
any damages, for the principal was not bound to keep the ship for the period
of the charter-party. An agent was appointed by a shirt manufacturer as
a canvasser and traveller for five-year period to sell such goods as may be
forwarded to him. The principal's factory was burned down by a chance fire
while there were still three years for the agency to go. The principal never
resumed business and ended the agency. He was held liable in damages as
the agency seemed to have been created for a definite term.451
There was an agreement for allotment of distributorship of Gas. The
allottee fulfilled the terms and conditions of the letter of allotment. The
company failed to send its standard agreement to the allottee. It was held
that the terms and conditions of the standard agreement could not legally

apply to agency. See Carnegie, 85 LQR 392 and Treitel, THE LAW OF CONTRACT (5th edn,

tribution system was held to have been wrongfully terminated when the alleged points of

bind the allottee. The termination of the agency on the violation of such
terms was not proper.4
452
An agency was deemed to have ended automatically by operation of law
when a war broke out between the two countries to which the principal and
agent respectively belonged.453 This is so because "agency as a contract is
determined by any event which terminates a contract".454
Withdrawal of vakalatnama
It has been held that a contract of Vakalatnama can be withdrawn by the
client at any time. There is no such thing as an irrevocable Vakalatnama.
After collecting the case papers, the advocate was trying to blackmail the
client. The client lost faith in him. He terminated the vakalatnama and
sought return of his file. It was immaterial that he was working without
his professional fee. Corresponding to the right of the client, he was under
professional duty to handover papers to the client.455
Revocation may be express or implied. Section 207 given below so
provides:45
S. 207. Revocation and renunciation may be expressed or implied.-
Revocation and renunciation may be expressed or may be implied in the con-
duct of the principal or agent respectively.
Illustration
A empowers B to let A's house. Afterwards A lets it himself. This is an implied revocation
of B's authority.
An example of implied revocation was found in a case in which a father,
after executing a power of attorney in favour of his son, fell into strained
relations with him so that the son became an adversary and was, therefore,
no more capable of acting as an agent.457
Execution of power of attorney does not denude the principal of his
power to act independently of the attorney. The principal is not required
to take attorney's consent for so acting. He was not bound to consult his
attorney before signing a compromise petition. Such act on the part of the
principal was held to have operated as an implied revocation of the power
of attorney.45

[S. 204]
An agreement entered into by virtue of the power of attorney before it
was revoked retains its binding effect. If anything is done in relation to such
a transaction, the agent can recover compensation for loss, if any caused to
him. 459
Revocation is subject to the following conditions:
Revocation operates prospectively [S. 204]
S. 204. Revocation where authority has been partly exercised.-The
principal cannot revoke the authority given to his agent after the authority has
been partly exercised, so far as regards such acts and obligations as arise from
acts already done in the agency.
Illustrations
(a) A authorises B to buy 1000 bales of cotton on account of A, and to pay for it out of
A's money remaining in B's hands. B buys 1000 bales of cotton in his own name, so as
to make himself personally liable for the price. A cannot revoke B's authority so far as
regards payment for the cotton.
(b) A authorises B to buy 1000 bales of cotton on account of A, and to pay for it out of A's
money remaining in B's hands. B buys 1000 bales of cotton in A's name, and so as not to
render himself personally liable for the price. A can revoke B's authority to pay for the
cotton.
Even where the agent has partly exercised his authority, the principal may
revoke it for the future. But it is irrevocable "as regards such acts and obliga-
tions as arise from acts already done in the agency". Where, for example, an
agent has been appointed to buy something for the principal and he has pur-
chased it by involving his personal liability, his authority cannot be revoked.
Where a sale deed was executed by an agent under his power of attorney
before his power was revoked by a newspaper notification, it was held that
it could not upset the deed already executed and the registration of the deed
could not have been refused because of the revocation.460
Where the agent carries on business even after his authority has been
revoked by the principal, the latter cannot recover profits, if any, made by
the agent in that business. 461 The agent cannot have any claim to remuner-
ation for a period after the revocation. He can, however, recover com-
pensation for wrongful dismissal. He may even restrain his principal from
appointing any other person in his place if there was a restrictive covenant
to that effect.463

Determination of agency 831
Notice precedent to revocation [S. 206]
S. 206. Notice of revocation or renunciation.-Reasonable notice must
be given of such revocation or renunciation; otherwise the damage thereby
resulting to the principal or the agent, as the case may be, must be made good
to the one by the other.
Where an agency has been created for a fixed period, a reasonable notice
would be necessary to terminate it. The Jength of notice will depend,
among other things, upon the length for which the agency has contin-
ued. Thus the Privy Council held that "the notice of 3½ months given by
the respondents was inadequate to determine an agency which had lasted
for nearly 50 years, under which a very large business had been built up,
and great expense incurred by the agents".445 Their Lordships would have
accepted without question that two years was a reasonable notice.
Liability to compensate [Ss. 205-206]
S. 205. Compensation of revocation by principal, or renunciation by
agent. Where there is an express or implied contract that the agency should
be continued for any period of time, the principal must make compensation to
the agent, or the agent to the principal, as the case may be, for any previous
revocation or renunciation of the agency without sufficient cause.
S. 206. Notice of revocation or renunciation.-Reasonable notice must
be given of such revocation or renunciation; otherwise the damage thereby
resulting to the principal or the agent, as the case may be, must be made good
to the one by the other.
If the agency is determined without reasonable notice, "the damages
thereby resulting to the agent must be made good" by the principal. Where
an agency has been created for a fixed period, compensation would have to
be paid for its premature termination, if the termination is without sufficient
cause. Reasonable notice for premature determination of an agency was not
given. The agent was earning Rs 4000 per month. The court was of the view
that at least three months' notice should have been given. A compensation
of Rs 12,000 was accordingly allowed. The liability to pay compensation
does not arise where the agency is not for a fixed period. The Madras High
Court did not allow any compensation to the agent for the unilateral ter-
mination of an agency, which though created without any stipulation for its
464. A termination without notice is ineffective. Om Prakash Pariwal v Union of India, AIR 1988

duration, had lasted from 1952 to 1964.467 Thus no compensation is payable
in the following cases: (1) Where the agency has not been created for any
definite period; (2) Where, though created for a specified length of time,
reasonable notice for its termination has been given or the termination is
otherwise based upon a sufficient cause.
Power of attorney executed on consideration
A power of attorney was executed in favour of the agent (defendant) after
receiving consideration from him. Its execution was duly made by a number
of conscious signatures on several papers. It was subsequently revoked with-
out giving the agent any compensation or repayment of the loan amount.
Such cancellation was held to be non-est in the eyes of law. 46
Agency coupled with interest [S. 202]
In certain circumstances, however, an agency becomes irrevocable. This
happens when the agent is personally interested in the subject-matter of
agency. Section 202 provides:
S. 202. Termination of agency, where agent has an interest in
subject-matter.-Where the agent has himself an interest in the property
which forms the subject-matter of the agency, the agency cannot, in the
absence of an express contract, be terminated to the prejudice of such interest.
Illustrations
(a) A gives authority to B to sell A's land, and to pay himself, out of the proceeds, the debts
due to him from A. A cannot revoke this authority, nor can it be terminated by his insan-
ity or death.
(b) A consigns 1000 bales of cotton to B, who has made advances to him on such cotton,
and desires B to sell the cotton, and to repay himself, out of the price, the amount of
his own advances. A cannot revoke this authority, nor is it terminated by his insanity or
death.
In the well-known case of Smart v Sanders WILDE CJ stated the rule
thus:
"Where an agreement is entered into on a sufficient consideration,
whereby an authority is given for the purpose of securing some benefit to the
donee of the authority, such an authority is irrevocable. This is what is usu-
ally meant by an authority coupled with an interest, and which is commonly
said to be irrevocable." The simplest case of such agency occurs when
the principal owes something to the agent and authorises him to sell the

Determination of agency 833
principal's goods and pay himself out of the sale proceeds. But an author-
ity to pay debts which the principal owes to some third person does not
make the agency irrevocable. In a case before the Madras High Court, a
person was entitled to be maintained out of the income of a property, known
as tarwad property. He was subsequently given the authority to collect rents
of the property. The authority was held to be not revocable.473 In another
case before the same High Court, in consideration of advances made by the
plaintiff, all the properties of a devason were given over to him on lease for
18 years with authority to receive rents. That was held to be an authority
coupled with interest and, therefore, irrevocable. 474 Thus the essence of the
matter is that "[t]he agent has, as it were, bought his authority in order to
ensure the payment of a debt due from the principal". Where an agent was
authorised to do all acts in connection with the performance of a contract
and to receive running payments, it was held to be an equitable assignment
of the contract for a consideration making the arrangement irreversible.476
The amounts payable to the agent were not permitted to be attached for the
debts of the principal, but the rest of the amounts, such as security deposits
and retention money, which were not assigned, remained attachable.
An agency of this kind is not even terminated by the principal's death.477
A principal owed a sum of money to his agent and gave him an accepted bill
of exchange with an authority to fill in the drawer's name. The principal
died before the agent could complete the bill. His authority to fill in the
drawer's name was held to be not terminated.478 But the matter is not free
from controversy. For, in Watson v R., Lord ELLENBOROUGH said: "How
can a valid act be done in the name of a dead man?" Commenting upon the
decision, Powell says: "The decision overlooks the fact that an authority
coupled with an interest is really a transfer of property."480 An authority
coupled with interest is also not determined by the principal's insolvency."81

834 Chapter 15 Agency
Interest existing at the time of creation of agency
[S. 202]
But the doctrine of agency coupled with interest is not without qualifi-
cation. In the first place, the interest of the agent must exist at the time of
the creation of the agency,182 "[T]his doctrine applies only to cases where
the authority is given for the purpose of being a security, or...as a part of
the security: not to cases where the authority is given independently, and
the interest of the donee of the authority arises afterwards, and incidentally
only. "483 This statement of the law occurs in Smart v Sanders. 484 In this case
goods were consigned to a factor for sale and he subsequently made advances
to his principal on the credit of the goods. It was held that the subsequent
advance could not convert the agency into one coupled with interest. "The
making of such an advance may be a good consideration for an agreement
that the authority to sell shall be no longer revocable, but such an effect will
not arise independently of agreement." An agency created by an irrevocable
power of attorney for enabling the agent to construct houses on the land of
the principal for sale was held to be an agency coupled with interest. The
court said that the interest of the agent need not be a pre-existing interest.
Such interest may be created simultaneously with the agreement. The agent
had to seek approval of the building plan. His agency was not allowed to
be revoked.485 An agency created through power of attorney authorising
the agent to apply for renewal of permits of the vehicles and, if necessary,
to replace the vehicles by transferring them and spend money for this pur-
pose, the agency was held to be one coupled with interest and, therefore, not
revocable to the prejudice of the interest. The acts done by the agent within
the scope of his authority were held to be binding on the principal.486 An
irrevocable power of attorney was created for working a mine. The inten
tion was to transfer the leasehold interest in the mine in favour of the power

mission at the rate of 5 per cent of the market value of the property. Held, this was not an
agency coupled with interest.

Determination of agency 835
of attorney holder. It was held that an interest was created in favour of the
holder. The agency could not be terminated to the prejudice of the holder.487
Protection of existing interest, primary purpose of agency
489
Secondly, "the test to be applied for finding out whether a power of attor-
ney given to an agent is irrevocable or not is to see whether the primary
object in giving the power was for the purpose of protecting or securing any
interest of the agent. If the primary object was to recover on behalf of the
principal the fruits of his decree and, in doing so, the agent's rights were also
incidentally protected, then the power is revocable". Similarly, the pros-
pect of earning a commission is not an interest for this purpose. Again, a
"mere arrangement that the plaintiff's salary should be paid out of the rents
could not be regarded as giving to the agent an interest in the property, the
subject-matter of the agency, within the meaning of Section 202".490 A mere
mention that the agency is irrevocable does not make it so.1 The concept
of irrevocable power of attorney is not known to jurisprudence unless the
power is coupled with interest. Accordingly, an agency to give effect to an
agreement for development of property does not create an interest in the
property. A power of attorney was executed to enable the attorney to look
after the construction work. He was not authorized to take personal loans
for the purpose. The property was not offered as a security for pecuniary
liabilities incurred by the agent. He was not allowed to say that the agency
had become irrevocable by reason of his pecuniary involvement which he
could not even prove.493
Renunciation by agent [S. 206]
An agent may renounce the business of agency in the same manner in
which the principal has the right of revocation. In the first place, if the
agency is for a fixed period, the agent would have to compensate the principal

for any premature renunciation without sufficient cause. [S. 205] Secondly,
a reasonable notice of renunciation is necessary. Length of notice is to be
determined by the same principles which apply to revocation by the prin-
cipal. If the agent renounces without proper notice, he shall have to make
good any damage thereby resulting to the principal. [S. 206]
Completion of business [S. 201]
An agency is automatically and by operation of law determined when its
business is completed. Thus, for example, the authority of an agent appointed
to sell goods ceases to be exercisable when the sale is completed. He cannot
afterwards alter the terms of the sale. But the Allahabad and Calcutta
High Courts have held that agency is not terminated on the completion of
the sale but continues until payment of the sale proceeds to the principal.***
Death or insanity [S. 201]
498
499
An agency is determined automatically on the death 96 or insanity497 of
the principal or the agent. Winding up of a company or dissolution of a part-
nership has the same effect. Acts done by the agent before death would
remain binding. Where an attorney appointed a counsel for his principal, it
was held that such an appointment would survive the death of attorney."
The court cited the following passage from Girshan Industrial Co Ltd v
Interchem Corpn. 500 "An attorney is merely an agent of the principal and
what he does, he does for the principal. So long as the principal is alive, any
act done by the attorney or his counsel is valid and continues to be valid.
irrespective of the fact whether the attorney is alive or dead. But the counsel
for the attorney cannot act if the principal is dead." A reading of Section 201
makes it clear that on the death of an agent his agency comes to an end but
it does not obliterate acts done by the agent on behalf of the principal during
the tenure of his agency.
Where a principal authorised his power of attorney to present a document
disposing of his property for registration, but the principal died before the
agent could do so, a subsequent registration was held to be invalid. In this
case the Registrar also knew that the principal was dead. 501

Principal's insolvency [S. 201]
Determination of agency 837
An agency ends on the principal being adjudicated insolvent.502
On expiry of time [S. 201]
"Where an agent has been appointed for a fixed term, the expiration of
the term puts an end to the agency, whether the purpose of the 'agency has
been accomplished or not."503 An agency comes to an automatic end on the
expiry of its term. Where the agency was to run a petrol pump for a speci-
fied period, it was held that the agent was bound to vacate the premises on
expiry of the period. There was no renewal clause, nor in fact there was any
renewal. 504
Effects of termination [S. 208]
S. 208. When termination of agent's authority takes effect as to agent,
and as to third persons.-The termination of the authority of an agent does
not, so far as regards the agent, take effect before it becomes known to him, or,
so far as regards third persons, before it becomes known to them.
Illustrations
(a) A directs B to sell goods for him, and agrees to give B five per cent commission on the
price fetched by the goods. A afterwards, by letter, revokes B's authority. B, after the
letter is sent, but before he receives it, sells the goods for 100 rupees. The sale is binding
on A, and B is entitled to five rupees as his commission.
(b) A, at Madras, by letter, directs B to sell for him some cotton lying in a warehouse in
Bombay, and afterwards, by letter, revokes his authority to sell, and directs B to send the
cotton to Madras. B, after receiving the second letter, enters into a contract with C, who
knows of the first letter, but not of the second, for the sale to him of the cotton. C pays
B the money, with which B absconds. C's payment is good as against A.
(c) A directs B, his agent, to pay certain money to C. A dies, and D takes out probate to his
will. B, after A's death, but before hearing of it, pays the money to C. The payment is
good as against D, the executor.
As between the principal and the agent, the authority of the agent ends
when he comes to know of the termination. Where, for example, the author-
ity of an agent appointed to sell goods is revoked, but he sells the goods
before receiving the letter of revocation, the sale is good. Illustration (a) is
relevant to this point.
But as regards third persons, the agency does not terminate until they
come to know of the fact of termination. Where, for example, an agent
sells the principal's goods even after receiving notice revoking his authority,
the sale is binding on the principal and the buyer gets a good title provided

terminated the power of attorney but the third party was not aware of the
fact of termination at the crucial moment. 506 The court cited the follow-
ing passage from the decision of the Madras High Court in Khatoon Bivi
Ammal v Arulappa Nadar: "Policy of law apparently in the interest of
trade and commerce is that the agent's action should bind the principal even
though the principal might have cancelled the agent's authority, unless the
third party with whom the agent enters into the contract knows of the ter-
mination of the agency." The court also placed reliance upon the judgment
in Trueman v Loder, 508 "Here A traded as B's agent. With the authority of
B, all parties with whom A made contracts in that business, were held to
have a right to hold B liable to them until B gives notice to the world that
A's authority is revoked and it makes no difference if in a particular case the
agent intended to keep the contract on his own account. The court repelled
the contention that it was very unreasonable to expect that the principal
should inform the whole world that he has cancelled the power of attorney
given to his agent and that he cannot be expected to approach everybody
with whom the agent was likely to enter into a contract and inform him of
the cancellation."
Even when the agency is terminated by the death of the principal, the
termination is effective only when it comes to the knowledge of the agent.
Illustration (c) is relevant to this point. A wife was authorised by her hus-
band to keep buying goods from a dealer. The husband became a person of
unsound mind. The wife kept up her purchases from the seller, the latter not
knowing of the husband's incapacity. The husband was held liable to pay for
the goods. 509
Termination of sub-agency
When the authority of an agent terminates, it entails the termination of
the authority of all sub-agents appointed by him. Section 210 is as follows:
S. 210. Termination of sub-agent's authority. The termination of the
authority of an agent causes the termination (subject to the rules herein con-
tained regarding the termination of an agent's authority) of the authority of all
sub-agents appointed by him.
505. Where in the case of a partnership firm the authority of partners could be terminated by a
public notice which was not done and the bank not knowing took acknowledgment from a
partner, the same was effective. Assiamma v State Bank of Mysore, (1990) 1 KLT 18.

Determination of agency 839
The allotment of works to a contractor is not the creation of an agency or
sub-agency for the purposes of this section. 510
Agent's duty on termination [S. 209]
Section 209 gives the duty of the agent on termination.
S. 209. Agent's duty on termination of agency by principal's death or
insanity. When an agency is terminated by the principal dying or becoming
of unsound mind, the agent is bound to take, on behalf of the representatives
of his late principal, all reasonable steps for the protection and preservation of
the interests entrusted to him.
Section 210 provides that the termination of an agent's authority amounts
to termination of all sub-agents appointed by him. Section 209 charges the
agent with duty to protect his principal's interest where the principal has
died or become a person of unsound mind.

SPECIFIC RELIEF
Introduction to the outline of the Act
A large number of remedial aspects of law have been taken care of by the
Specific Relief Act of 1963 (47 of 1963). This Act is a replacement of the ear-
lier Act of 1877. A mere declaration of rights and duties is not sufficient to
give protection to life and property. Enumeration of rights and duties must
be supplemented by legal devices which can help the individual to enforce
his rights. Every person who is injured in the social process must have a
social redress. Only then it will be possible to say that human societies have
been so organised as to assure that wherever there is a wrong there must
be a remedy. This is the mission of the Specific Relief Act. Generally, reme-
dies are also provided by the branch of substantive law which defines rights
and duties for its own purposes. The law of contract provides the remedy
of damages for breach of contract. The law of torts similarly provides for
recovery of damages in several cases of tortious wrongs. Substantive laws,

[S. 4]
Specific relief 843
however, can never afford to be exhaustive in terms of their remedies and
reliefs. Scope remains for an Act whose only purpose is to provide a network
of reliefs in certain specific terms. Such an Act does not confer any rights in
itself. It only provides a specific relief so as to remedy the violation of a legal
right. The network of reliefs allowed by the Act falls under the following
outlines:
1. Recovery of possession of property
Though the Specific Relief Act is concerned only with the enforcement
of civil rights and not penal laws, even civil law has to take care of certain
rights, the violation of which is capable of creating serious violent clashes,
and these are rights to possession of property. The very first chapter pro-
vides relief to those who have been dispossessed of their property.
2. Specific performance of contracts
One of the most important aspects of civil rights is the fulfilment of expec-
tations created by a contract voluntarily made by the parties. Contracts are
at the base of almost all economic relations. All employments and profes-
sions are contract bound. All property, whether business assets or personal,
remain locked up under contracts. For example, money in banks and in
other forms of investment is contractually bound. Thus contracts constitute
the modern wealth. They are sacred per se. Moreover, a particular contract
is not just an isolated transaction. It is often a link in a chain of several con-
tracts. A failure at one place can cause a serious dislocation of economic and
social life. Contracts must be enforced. But the only way the law of contract
can enforce a contract is by awarding compensation to the injured person.
In many cases, however, compensation fails to serve the economic purpose
of the contract. A hospital is, for example, interested in the fulfilment of
its requirements and not in receiving compensation from a failed supplier.
There was thus the need for a remedy which would compel a defaulting con-
tractor to actually perform his contract. This important function is under-
taken by the second chapter of the Specific Relief Act under the heading:
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS.
3. Rectification and cancellation of instruments and rescission of
contracts
Many transactions are required by law to be in writing. Many more trans-
actions are put into writing because of expediency. A written transaction is
an instrument. An instrument is the result of negotiations. Occasionally it
happens that the instrument that emerges fails to express the intention of
the parties. Its rectification may become necessary. Accordingly, Chapter III
of the Specific Relief Act helps parties who want to have their mistakenly
executed documents rectified.

Page 987
https://t.me/LawCollegeNotes_Stuffs
844 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 4]
Closely allied with documents mistakenly executed is the category of doc-
uments which are afterwards discovered to be void or which become void.
They ought to be cancelled. Chapter V provides relief from such kinds of
documents.
Then there is a category of contracts which, for one reason or another,
such as, for example, lack of free consent, are voidable at the option of
the party whose consent was not free. He has a right to have the contract
rescinded. Relief by way of rescission is provided by Chapter IV of the Act.
4. Preventive relief
There are cases in which the nature of the contract does not admit of
specific performance, nor damages are likely to serve any purpose. In such
cases the court may have to restrain the party threatening breach, to the
extent to which it is possible to do so. For example, a person contracts to
sing at a particular place and also undertakes not to sing elsewhere during
the same period. He threatens breach. The court cannot force him to sing.
The positive side of the bargain is not specifically enforceable. But the neg-
ative undertaking "not to sing elsewhere" can be enforced by restraining
him from giving his performances elsewhere. When he is so prevented from
resorting to other openings, it may exert some pressure upon his mind and
he may be persuaded to go ahead with the performance of his contract.
This type of remedy is known as preventive relief. It is granted by issuing an
order, known as "injunction", upon the party concerned directing him not
to do a particular act or asking him to perform a particular duty, known
as a mandatory injunction. Such relief is granted under the provisions of
Part III of the Act running from Chapter VII to the end."
5. Declaratory relief
There is one more matter of which the Specific Relief Act takes care and
that is "declaratory relief". Occasionally it may happen that a person is enti-
tled to some status or character or has a right in some property, but there
are persons who are denying him the enjoyment of his right. He is allowed
by Chapter VI of the Specific Relief Act to proceed against any person who
is denying or interested in denying him his right and the court may issue a
general declaration as to his entitlement to such right (declaratory decrees).
RECOVERY OF POSSESSION OF IMMOVABLE PROPERTY
Section 5 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 provides that a person entitled
to the possession of specific immovable property may recover it in the man-
ner prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.³
4. Adhunik Steels Ltd v Orissa Mangenese Minerals (P) Ltd, (2007) 7 SCC 125: AIR 2007 SC
2563, the Supreme Court explained the various types of relief under the Act and their nature
and scope.
5. Sanjay Kumar Pandey v Gulbahar Sheikh, (2004) 4 SCC 664, the proceedings under the
section are of summary nature and limited in their scope to finding out the fact of possession

[Ss. 5-6]

Recovery of possession of immovable property 845
S.5. Recovery of specific immovable property.-A person entitled to the
possession of specific immovable property may recover it in the manner pro-
vided by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).
This section deals with action for recovery of possession of specific
immovable property based on title. The essence of the section is that who-
ever proves a "better title" is a person "entitled to possession". The title
may be on the basis of ownership or possession. Thus, suppose A enters
into peaceful possession of land claiming it as his own although he might
have no title to it, still he can sue another who has forcibly ousted him from
possession and who has no better title to it, because A, although he has no
legal title, has at least a possessory title. The purpose behind Section 6 is to
restrain a person from using force and to dispossess a person without his
consent otherwise than in due course of law.
A suit under Section 5 is an ordinary suit under the general law and the
plaintiff has to prove that he has a better title. Further, specific performance
can be decreed only against the executant of the contract having the right to
dispose of the property in question."
It is a principle of law that a person who has been in long continuous
possession of an immovable property, can protect the same by seeking an
injunction against any person in the world other than the true owner. It is
also well settled that even the owner of the property can get back his posses-
sion only by resorting to the due process of law."
A decision as to a specified part of the property in question may not con-
stitute res judicata in respect of any subsequent proceedings about the entire
property.'
S. 6. Suit by person dispossessed of immovable property.-(1) If any
person is dispossessed without his consent of immovable property otherwise
within period of six months preceding to the institution of the suit. The question of title
is ignored in these proceedings. If the summary proceeding is unsuccessful, the person in
question should file a regular suit for title to be decided on merits. The remedy of revision is
available but only by way of exception and not as a general rule. A case has to be made out
under S. 115 CPC. Bajranglal Shivchandrai Ruia v Shashikant N. Ruia, (2004) 5 SCC 272,
for success of his suit the plaintiff would have to establish his title.
6. Puthukkattil Parangodan v Puthukkattil Parameswaran, AIR 2002 Ker 221, the subject-mat-
ter of the tenancy was completely destroyed and the lease automatically terminated. But even
so the landlord could claim and recover possession only through the court process. ITC Hotels
Ltd v Adarsh Coop Housing Society Ltd, (2013) 10 SCC 169: (2012) 94 AIR 682, remedy
under the section is only for recovery of possession of the person who has been dispossessed.
A regular suit has to be filed for establishing title or ownership.
7. Annapoorani Ammal v G. Thagapalam, (1989) 3 SCC 287.
8. Prataprai N. Kothari v John Braganza, (1999) 4 SCC 403: AIR 1999 SC 1666. Ram Chander
Aggarwal v Hans Raj Banga, AIR 2003 NOC 109 (Del): 2002 AIHC 4102 (Del), the plain-
tiff has to prove his right to possession. He could not prove in this case that he had pur-
chased the premises. The sale certificate produced by him was found to be not reliable. Market
Committee, Hodal v Sukhdevi, (2016) 1 SCC 290: AIR 2016 SC 2226, no suit lies for recov-
ery of possession of land which had already been acquired under statutory provisions, i.e.
Land Acquisition Act, 1894.

[S. 6]
than in due course of law, he or any person claiming through him may, by sult,
recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be set up
in such suit.
(2) No suit under this section shall be brought-
(a) after the expiry of six months from the date of dispossession; or
(b) against the Government.
(3) No appeal shall lie from any order or decree passed in any suit instituted
under this section, nor shall any review of any such order or decree be allowed.
(4) Nothing in this section shall bar any person from suit to establish his title
to such property and to recover possession thereof.
Sections 5 and 6 give alternative remedies and are mutually exclusive.
Under Section 5 a person dispossessed can get possession on the basis of
title, whereas under Section 6 a person dispossessed may recover possession
merely by proving previous possession and subsequent wrongful disposses-
sion. Under Section 6 he need not prove a better title against the occupier.
The occupier will not be allowed to show his title by ownership, contract,
prescription or inheritance.
Clause (4) of Section 6, however, provides that the person against whom
a decree may be passed under clause (1) of Section 6 may, notwithstanding
such a decree, sue to establish his title and to recover possession. The objects
of Section 6 are:
(i) To discourage people from taking the law into their own hands,
however good their title may be.
(ii) To provide a summary, cheap and useful remedy to a person dispos-
sessed of immovable property otherwise than in due course of law.
Section 6 is applicable only if the plaintiff proves-
(1) that he was in juridical possession of the immovable property in
dispute;10
(2) that he had been dispossessed without his consent and otherwise
than in due course of law;" and
10. Prem Sharma v Nishi Sharma, AIR 2003 HP 45, entries in the Municipal Register of
Assessments and the report lodged with the police of dispossession showed that the com-
plainant was in possession of the house immediately before he was dispossessed. Relief for
recovery of possession was granted. Siya Ram v Nagar Palika Parishad, AIR 2010 NOC 1111
(All), a footpath cannot be allotted to any person for business or otherwise. A person selling
his goods by laying them on a footpath gets no right to make such use. His dispossession is
not illegal. Shantabai Sonba Madavi v Nanibai Udebhan Uike, AIR 2015 NOC 47 (Bom),
plaintiff's case was that the suit property was purchased by her father and that she inherited it
after her parents' death. Entries in Village Panchayat record, payment of taxes and electricity
bills supported her claim of being the rightful owner. The defendant trespassed and was in
wrongful possession. She was allowed to recover possession and mesne profit.
11. Narbada Devi Gupta v Birendra Kumar Jaiswal, (2003) 8 SCC 745: AIR 2004 SC 175, receipt
for payment of rent shown with thumb impression of the land lady at back side and also signed
by her son (plaintiff) at the back. The plaintiff admitted his signature. Thus tenancy became
established ruling out a case of dispossession. The court said that the tenant had not to pro-
duce further evidence on the point. Raj Narayan Pandey v Kameshwar Thakur, AIR 2011

[S. 6]
Recovery of possession of immovable property 847
(3) that the dispossession took place within six months from the date of
the suit.12
Possession here means legal possession which may exist with or without
actual possession and with or without a rightful origin. The plaintiff need
not establish his title. It is enough to prove long standing peaceful posses
sion.13 Questions of title can be ignored. Relief can also be given on the basis
of title with a permanent injunction against the defendant not to interfere
in the plaintiff ownership and possessory rights.14 A property was donated
to All India Congress Party. There was split in the party. The party led
by Indira Gandhi was declared by the Election Commission as the Indian
National Congress. Its right of possession of the property was protected.
The defendants who were in possession were ordered to vacate the prop-
erty. Thus where a trespasser is allowed to continue on the property and
the owner sleeps upon his rights and makes no efforts to remove him, he
will gain possession under Section 6. The possession of a tenant after the
termination of the tenancy continues to be a juridical possession. His right
to possession remains unless the owner gets a decree of eviction against
him. Till then if he is dispossessed he is entitled to seek restitution of his
possession. In Express Newspapers (P) Ltd v Union of India" the Supreme
Court reminded the Government that even where a perpetual lease for con-
struction of an office block provided for the lessor's right of re-entry upon
forfeiture of lease upon breaches of the conditions of the lease, the lessor
Jha 13, shop tenant thrown out without recourse to the applicable Bihar tenancy legislation,
restored to his possession by court order.

suit for possession could not be filed within six months, the court said that a regular civil suit
could be filed thereafter. George Thomas v Srividya, AIR 2003 Mad 290, property in wife's
name, assessment in her name for payment of taxes, the building plan was also sanctioned in
her name. The court did not accept the theory of benami for evasion of taxes. She was allowed
to recover possession and damages. Annakili v A. Vedanayagam, (2007) 14 SCC 308: AIR
2008 SC 346, the High Court finding was that the title of the plaintiff had attained finality,
it was for the defendant to prove that they had hostile possession under which the plaintiff's
title became extinguished. The defendant could not do so. The plaintiff had not to file a suit
for declaration of his title. R. Rama Rao v R. Appala Swamy, AIR 2011 Ori 1, six months
have to be taken from the date of dispossession which may be found by the court on its own
evidence and not on the basis of police report.

damental rights.

would not have the right to declare such forfeiture all by itself and then
take to itself to throw out the lessee either directly or through the summary
procedure under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants)
Act, 1971. The court said that where a breach is found, the lessor must
adopt the due process of law by filing a civil suit to enforce the right of re-en-
try. Such a lessee is not an "unauthorised occupant" of a "public premises".
He will be entitled to relief against such eviction.
A tenant was dispossessed forcibly. The court said that he could institute
his suit for repossession at that stage immediately. But he himself gained
forcible repossession. He became a trespasser and therefore could not be
regarded to be in lawful possession. He did file a suit subsequently but did
not pursue it for numbering. It was numbered after three years. Relief of
possession was not granted to him.18
Regarding appeals, the section itself says that there is no right of "appeal"
against a decree in a suit under this section. Similarly a "review" of the deci-
sion is also barred. But a revision under Section 115 of the CPC may lie to
the High Court, although courts have not favoured this remedy because the
aggrieved party has another remedy open to him by way of a regular suit.
An interesting question may arise: Whether an action under Section 6 can
be maintained in relation to incorporeal or intangible property, e.g. right of
ferry, right of fishery, right to collect rents, right to cut grass, etc. There is a
conflict of decisions on the point. The High Courts of Bombay and Madras
have answered this question in the affirmative." These courts have held
that a man is said to be in possession of a right when he can exercise it, and
he recovers possession of an incorporeal right when the obstruction which
interfered with it is removed. But a contrary view has been expressed by
the Calcutta High Court,20 which has pointed out that this section does not
extend to incorporeal rights because they are not rights of which possession
can be taken and delivered to the plaintiff.
No injunction was issued against the owner of an item of movable prop-
erty (vehicle) which had been delivered on hire purchase to prevent him from
entering the premises of the hirer on his default in payments and to take
away the vehicle. There was a clause to that effect in the contract."
Further, it should be noted that the only prayer in a suit under Section 6
can be a prayer for recovery of possession. Consequently a claim for dam-
ages cannot be combined with that for possession. The section does not
apply to suits based on title to property.22

[S. 6]
Recovery of possession of immovable property 849
Possession, under the section, may be actual (i.e. physical) or construc-
tive. Hence the possession of a mortgagee or a lessee is that of the mortgagor
or the lessor and vice versa. 23
A person who is in settled possession cannot be summarily dispossessed.
Settled possession creates such a right that even the rightful owner may
recover only by taking recourse to a court of law. The settled possession
even of a trespasser may be protected.24
Relief cannot be refused only on the ground that the property in question
is a joint family property. One of the co-owners was ousted from the prop-
erty. He was allowed to exercise his right to seek possession of his share. 25
The right acquired by adverse possession, if not perfected by resort to
Section 6, would cease to exist if possession is interrupted in the meantime.26
Recovery of possession where possession gratuitous [S. 6]
Where the grant of possession was purely gratuitous, the owner had the
right to reclaim possession even without the knowledge of the person in pos-
session. The party in possession in this case was using the garage owned by
his sister. The owner dispossessed him. The trial court ordered restoration
of possession. The High Court confirmed this order. The Supreme Court
described this as an error.
It was evident that the respondent was using the garage of the appellant
on permission having been granted by the sister to the brother. According
to the judgment of the High Court the respondent was claiming no legal
interest in the said garage as he was not claiming its ownership because he
was not claiming to be a tenant or even a licensee. His possession was purely
gratuitous and even if without the knowledge of the respondent the appel-
lant has reclaimed the possession, it was not a fit case for the High Court to
have interfered under Article 227 of the Constitution.27
The person who was in permissive possession and whose claim of adverse
possession proved to be false, was directed to handover possession to the
owner.28 Where possession was given for repairs but the premises happened
to come down, it was held that there was no question of seeking restoration
of possession. The proper course would have been to claim damages.29

Prayer for declaration of title
[S. 6]
Although normally such a suit is not maintainable in the absence of a
prayer for declaration of title, it was held on facts that as the necessary aver-
ments were made in the plaint (that registered lease deed for 99 years in favour
of appellant-lessee was void and not binding and that suit property was trust
property), and answered in the written statement, issues framed, evidence
led and arguments advanced, no prejudice was caused to the appellant-de-
fendant by the fact that there was no formal prayer seeking a declaration.
The High Court rightly dismissed the LPA filed by the appellant-defendant
under Order 6, Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. The court said:
"Even though there was no formal prayer, no prejudice has been caused to
the appellant inasmuch as he has not been prevented from leading evidence
on this aspect and has not been precluded from raising contentions in this
behalf. All that was necessary to cure the defect was an amendment by
incorporating one prayer. This could have been done at any stage."30
The Supreme Court has once again held that a suit for possession simplic-
iter without declaration of title is maintainable. On the facts here, however,
title could not be successfully questioned.
No appeal or review [Sub-s. (3)]
No appeal lies from a decision in a suit under Section 6, nor any review is
maintainable. But where a suit upon title is wrongly treated as a suit under
Section 6, an appeal lies. The proper procedures for the appellate court in
such a case is to remand the suit for fresh disposal. In a suit decided under
Section 6, revision can be preferred on various grounds. If the error is pal-
pable and the remedy is clear, the High Court can interfere in its revisional
jurisdiction, but could not interfere on point of law especially when it is
raised for the first time in revision. In the absence of jurisdictional error, the
finding of the lower court cannot be disturbed by the High Court.
Where an interim order was passed in a suit under Section 6 of the Specific
Relief Act, it was held that the grant of such an order was not appealable
under Order 43, Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908.33
Application of Limitation Act
Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 applies to proceedings against
dispossession. One of the effects would be that time taken in prosecuting
proceedings under writ jurisdiction would be excluded."

Recovery of possession of movable property 851
Six months limitation not applicable to proceedings under CrPC
The finding that the appellants should have come within six months from
the date of dispossession was held to be not tenable as the Specific Relief
Act has no application to proceedings under Section 145(6) of the Criminal
Procedure Code.35
Counterclaim and court fee
The defendant was unlawfully dispossessed and wanted enforcement of
his statutory right under Section 6 of regaining possession. A counterclaim
was filed against it. The counterclaim being in the nature of a plaint in a
suit, the court said, it did not require to be valued under Section 6(v) of the
Bombay Court Fees Act, 36
RECOVERY OF POSSESSION OF MOVABLE PROPERTY [SS. 7-8]
Sections 7 and 8 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 provide methods for
recovery of possession of some specific movable property.
S. 7. Recovery of specific movable property.-A person entitled to the
possession of specific movable property may recover it in the manner provided
by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).
Explanation I.-A trustee may sue under this section for the possession of
movable property to the beneficial interest in which the person for whom he is
trustee is entitled.
Explanation II.-A special or temporary right to the present possession of
movable property is sufficient to support a suit under this section.
Main ingredients
By Section 7, it is provided that a person entitled to the possession of the
specific movable property may recover the same in the manner prescribed
by the Code of Civil Procedure.37 The main ingredients of this section are:
35. Shakuntala Devi v Chamru Mahto, AIR 2009 SC 2075.
36. Sushila Uttamchand Jain v Rajesh Kumar Prakashchand Jain, AIR 2012 Bom 22.
37. Punjab Urban Planning & Development Authority v Shiv Saraswati Iron & Steel Re-Rolling
Mills, (1998) 4 SCC 539, the plaintiff has to prove his own case. He cannot think of succeed-
ing because of the weakness of the defendant's case. This "section" corresponds to S. 10 of the
erstwhile Specific Relief Act, 1877. That section carried the following illustrations:
(a) A bequeaths land to B for his life, with remainder to C. A dies. B enters on the land,
but C, without B's consent, obtains possession of the title-deeds. B may recover them
from C.
(b) A pledges certain jewels to B to secure a loan. B disposes of them before he is entitled
to do so. A, without having paid or tendered the amount of loan, sues B for possession
of the jewels. The suit should be dismissed, as A is not entitled to their possession,
whatever right he may have to secure their safe custody. [Based on Donald v Suckling,
(1866) LR 1 QB 585.]
(c) A receives a letter addressed to him by B. B gets back the letter without A's consent.
A has such a property therein as entitles him to recover it from B. [Based on Oliver v
Oliver, (1861) 11 CB NS 139.]

852 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 7]
(i) The plaintiff must be entitled to the possession. A person may be enti-
tled to possession either by ownership or as provided by Explanation 2
to Section 7 by virtue of a special or temporary right. It is not necessary,
however, that the plaintiff should have been previously in possession, or
that the goods should have been removed from his possession. A special
or temporary right may arise by either:
(a) the act of the owner of the goods, e.g., bailment, pawn, etc. In this
case the bailee or pawnee has special right, or;
(b) not by the act of the owner of goods, e.g., finder of lost goods. In this
case the finder of lost goods has a special right to possession except
against the true owner.
Explanation I makes it clear that a trustee is the person entitled to the
immediate possession of trust property. Hence if trust property is taken
away by someone, he can recover the same.
A person who does not have a right to present possession of movable
property cannot maintain a suit under this section. An illustration in
point is: A pledges certain jewels with B to secure a loan. B disposes
the jewels to C before he is entitled to do so. A without having paid the
amount of the loan, sues C for possession of jewels. The suit should be
dismissed, as A is not entitled to immediate possession of jewels, what-
ever interest he may have to secure their safe custody.
(ii) Property in question must be specific movable property. Specific means
that which is ascertained or ascertainable. Specific property means the
very property itself, not its equivalent. Thus coins or grains are not spe-
cific movable property, because they cannot be distinguished from other
coins or grain.
The specific movable property must be capable of being seized and deliv-
ered. Where the goods have ceased to be recoverable or are not in possession
or control of the defendant, the plaintiff is not entitled to a decree for recov-
ery in specie; his only remedy then being damages or compensation.
Suit for title
The substantive prayer in the plaint was for a declaration that the plain-
tiffs "were fully entitled" to the suit bonds and certain reliefs which were
founded upon this declaration. A suit for such a declaration would certainly
be a title suit so far as the suit bonds were concerned. On dismissal of the
suit, the appeal against it was brought on the footing that the plaintiff had
fully proved its title to the suit bonds and that the Special Court had errone-
ously held against the plaintiff. The court said that looking at the suit from
(d) A deposits books and papers for safe custody with B. B loses them and C finds them,
but refuses to deliver them to B when demanded. B may recover them from C, subject
to C's right, if any, under Section 168 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.
(e) A, a warehouse-keeper, is charged with the delivery of certain goods to Z, which B
takes out of A's possession, A may sue B for the goods.

Recovery of possession of movable property 853
any point of view it could not be held that the suit was a mere declaratory
suit, it had to be regarded as a title suit.38
Limitation
Article 91(b) of the Limitation Act, 1963 prescribes a period of three
years' limitation for the suit computable from the date when the property
is wrongfully taken or injured or when the detainer's possession becomes
unlawful.
Liability to deliver possession to person entitled
S. 8. Liability of person in possession, not as owner, to deliver to per-
son entitled to immediate possession.-Any person having the possession
or control of a particular article of movable property, of which he is not the
owner, may be compelled specifically to deliver it to the person entitled to its
immediate possession, in any of the following cases:
(a) when the thing claimed is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee
of the plaintiff.
(b) when compensation in money would not afford the plaintiff adequate
relief for the loss of the thing claimed."
(c) when it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual damage
caused by its loss,40
(d) when the possession of the thing claimed has been wrongfully trans-
ferred from the plaintiff."
Explanation.-Unless and until the contrary is proved, the court shall
in respect of any article of movable property claimed under clause (b) or
clause (c) of this section, presume-
(a) that compensation in money would not afford the plaintiff ade-
quate relief for the loss of the thing claimed, or, as the case may be,
(b) that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual damage
caused by its loss.
38. Standard Chartered Bank v Andhra Bank Financial Services Ltd, (2006) 6 SCC 94.
39. Proof of entrustment of the property in question would be necessary. Ganga Bishan v Jai
Narain, (1986) 1 SCC 75: AIR 1986 SC 441. There may be a thing which may not have much
intrinsic value, but, by reason of peculiar association or some special consideration, have
obtained in the eyes of its holders a value that cannot be estimated in money, e.g. family idol.
It would be great injustice if an individual cannot have his property without being liable to the
estimate of people who have not their feelings upon it. A thing may have a pretium aflections
which it is impossible to value in sordid gold or silver. However, the principle must not be
extended to cases founded in weakness and folly. It would, therefore, be a perversion of the
rule to apply it to the delivery of a lady's lap dog.
40. There exists no standard to ascertain their value, e.g. rare picture painted by a dead painter,
articles of antiquity and the like.
41. E.g. by a tort, or where defendant has obtained the goods by fraud or where servant has
pawned the goods of master without the authority of the master.
42. This section corresponds with S. 11 of the repealed Specific Relief Act, 1877. That section
carried the following illustrations:
Illustration as to clause (a).-A, proceeding to Europe, leaves his furniture in charge of B,
as his agent during his absence. B, without A's authority, pledges the furniture to C, and C,

854 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
Ingredients
[S. 8]
In order that Section 8 may come into operation the following ingredients
must coexist
(1) the defendant has possession or control of the particular article
claimed;
(2) such article is movable property;
(3) the defendant is not the owner of the article;
(4) the person claiming, that is, the plaintiff, is entitled to immediate
possession; and
(5) the thing claimed is held by the defendant as the plaintiff's agent or
trustee; or when compensation in money would not afford adequate
relief for the loss of the thing claimed; or
when it is extremely difficult to ascertain the actual damage caused
by the loss of the thing claimed; or
when the possession of the thing claimed has been wrongfully trans-
ferred from the claimant.
An illustration of the types of cases falling under this section would be
like this. A person, while going abroad, leaves his furniture under the care
of his friend. The friend is a trustee of the articles and is bound to return
them when demanded. If the friend pledges the furniture, the pledgee will
also remain subject to the same trust and similarly bound to return to the
owner when demanded by him.13
An illustration under clause (b) would be, for example, when the idol of
a family temple is in the custody of a retired priest, he is bound to return it
to the family.
Cases coming under clause (c) would be, for example, when articles of
rare value, like original paintings of a deceased painter, are in the possession
of another. Since they are articles of irreplaceable nature and their market
value is of unascertainable nature, the owner has a right to recover them in
specie.44
Under clause (a) the onus is on the plaintiff to prove the fiduciary rela-
tionship and under clause (d) the onus is on the plaintiff to prove the wrong-
ful transfer. The Explanation deals with the onus under clauses (b) and
(c), which is placed on the defendant and the defendant has to prove that
knowing that B had no right to pledge the furniture, advertises it for sale. C may be compelled
to deliver the furniture to A, for he holds it as A's trustee. [Based on Wood v Rowcliffe, (1844)
3 Hare 304: 64 RR 303].
Illustration as to clause (b).-Z has got possession of an idol belonging to A's family, and
of which A is the proper custodian. Z may be compelled to deliver the idol to A.
Illustration as to clause (c).-A is entitled to a picture by a dead painter and a pair of
rare China vases. B has possession of them. The articles are of too special a character to bear
an ascertainable market value. B may be compelled to deliver them to A. [Based on Falcke v
Gray, (1859) 4 Drew 651: 113 RR 493].
43. Based on Wood v Rowcliffe, (1844) 3 Hare 304: 64 RR 303.

Specific performance of contracts 855
compensation in money would be adequate relief and that it would not be
extremely difficult to ascertain the actual damage caused by the loss of the
chattel.
Difference between Sections 7 and 8
(i) Under Section 8, no suit can be brought against the owner, while under
Section 7, a person having a special or temporary right to present possession
may bring the suit even against the owner of the property.
(ii) Under Section 7, a decree is for the return of movable property, or for
the money value thereof in the alternative, while under Section 8 the decree
is only for the return of the specific article.
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS
Specific performance is equitable relief given by a court in case of breach
of contract in the form of a judgment that the defendant is to actually per-
form the contract according to its terms and stipulations.
A contract, according to the Indian Contract Act, is an agreement enforce-
able by law. From every contract there immediately and directly results an
obligation on each of the contracting parties towards the other to perform
such of the terms of the contract as he has undertaken to perform. And if
the person on whom this obligation rests, fails to discharge it, there results.
in morality to the other party a right at his election either to insist on the
actual performance of the contract or to obtain satisfaction for the non-per-
formance of it.
An obligation includes every duty enforceable by law. Consequently,
whenever a man comes under a liability to do or forbear from doing any-
thing, he remains under an obligation. This liability may be a consequence
of either a contract or a tort. An obligation to forbear is a positive duty gen-
erally imposed by a contract. This form of specific relief is described as "the
specific performance of contract".
S. 9. Defences respecting suits for relief based on contract.-Except as
otherwise provided herein, where any relief is claimed under this Chapter in
respect of a contract, the person against whom the relief is claimed may plead
by way of defence any ground which is available to him under any law relating
to contracts.
Defences under law of contracts
Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 provides that except as provided
in this chapter (i.e. Chapter II, Sections 9 to 25) all defences open under
the law of contract shall be open to a defendant, where any relief is claimed
under this Chapter in respect of a contract. Defences that are available
45. Kumari Anandan v T. Balamukunda Rao, AIR 2002 Mad 472; Ameer Mohd v Barkat Ali,
AIR 2002 Raj 406, in both these cases the action was founded upon oral agreement, but the
details of the agreement were not proved and, therefore, no relief could be allowed.

856 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 9]
under the law of contract, such as incapacity of parties, the uncertainty of
contracts, coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, mistake, etc.
have all been dealt with in the Indian Contract Act. This section avoids their
repetition in the Specific Relief Act. Thus it is necessary that the contract
in question should be valid and enforceable. The Supreme Court refused
to grant the relief of specific performance where the contract was in an
alternative form and one form had failed to materialise and the other was
void, being not enforceable by virtue of uncertainty. It was a contract of sale
stipulating that if the co-seller failed to sign the sale deed then the principal
seller would execute a sale deed of her own "one of two shares", otherwise
pay back the advance and compensation in the same amount. The co-seller
did not sign. The alternative for the promisor was either to sell her share or
pay compensation. If she opted for compensation there was no breach and
no question of specific performance, which was also not possible because
her share was not defined nor was there any indication of the part of the
lump sum consideration which was applicable to her share."
A contingent contract to the effect that the mortgaged house would be
sold as soon as the mortgage was redeemed was held by the Supreme Court
to be specifically enforceable on the redemption of the mortgage, though no
relief could be provided on facts because the claim was filed more than three
years after the date of redemption."
Government contracts
It has been held that a Government contract which is concluded without
fulfilling the requirements prescribed by Article 299 of the Constitution of
India cannot be specifically enforced.48
Validity of original contract
In a suit for specific performance, the subsequent purchaser challenged
the contention that the original contract to sell was fictitious and not genu-
ine, but the suit was ultimately decreed. It was held that the first appellate
court ought to have considered the evidence and recorded its own finding as
to whether the original agreement was true and valid.49
46. Mayawanti v Kaushalya Devi, (1990) 3 SCC 1. A contract with the Government which did
not comply with the requirements of Art. 299 of the Constitution was not allowed to be
enforced. Sohan Lal v Union of India, (1991) 1 SCC 438: AIR 1991 SC 955. C. Bala Subba
Reddy v Lakshmi Narasamma, (2002) 10 SCC 247: AIR 2002 SC 390, a new plea not allowed
to be raised at the appellate stage.
47. Ramzan v Hussaini, (1990) 1 SCC 104: AIR 1990 SC 529. Parmanand v Bajrang, (2001) 7
SCC 705, the defence raised was that money was not taken as a consideration for sale but by
way of loan and the property was offered as a security for repayment of loan and he sought
adjournment for adducing evidence to prove the real nature of the transaction, rejecting his
defence without giving him the opportunity to prove was held to be wrong. The suit was
remanded for retrial.
48. Bishandayal & Sons v State of Orissa, (2001) 1 SCC 555: AIR 2001 SC 544.
49. Ram Niwas v Bano, (2000) 6 SCC 685: AIR 2000 SC 2921. Hansa V. Gandhi v Deep Shankar
Roy, (2013) 12 SCC 776: (2013) 116 Cut LT 457, a letter of intent does not bring about a con-
cluded contract, without such contract there is no right to seek specific performance.

Specific performance of contracts 857
The defence that the purchase was made bona fide for consideration with-
out notice of the earlier agreement for sale would have to be proved by the
second purchaser. This defence can be defeated by showing that a notice of
the sale was given to him. Where the only evidence of prior notice was a copy
of an application appearing to be endorsed by the Sub-Registrar but there
was no corresponding record or entry in the records of the Sub-Registrar, it
was held that such an application would not constitute prior notice.50
Privity of contract between the parties to the suit is also a thing of cardi-
nal importance for a decree of specific performance."
Delay as ground of defence under law of contract
Where a suit was within the period of limitation, but delay had resulted
in third parties acquiring rights in the subject-matter of the suit or had given
rise to a plea of waiver it was held that it would provide grounds of defence in
a suit for specific performance of contract for sale of immovable property.52
The present appeal arises out of an agreement for sale of the suit prop-
erty, between the appellant would-be purchaser and respondent vendor.
Under the agreement the consideration fixed was Rs 25,000; of this sum the
appellant paid Rs 17,000 at the time of the execution of the contract on 20
February 1977. The balance amount was to be paid within five months, i.e.
before 19 July 1977, at the time of the execution of the sale deed. According
to the appellant, the respondent would not accept the balance amount due
and did not execute the sale deed. Therefore the appellant sent three notices
dated 15 March 1978, 4 April 1978 and the last on 26 November 1978,
through his lawyer to no avail. On 10 August 1979, about nine months
after the date of the last notice, the appellant filed a suit for specific perfor-
mance and, in the alternative, for damages to the sum of Rs 38,000. The
respondent-defendant denied the execution of the agreement for sale, his
signature on it and the receipt of Rs 17,000 as part-consideration. The trial
court found that the agreement had been executed as averred and decreed
the suit for specific performance.
On appeal the Bombay High Court affirmed the finding as to the exist-
ence of the agreement but set aside the relief as to specific performance and
allowed compensation. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal against this
judgment with costs. The court said:
"The aspects of delay which are relevant in a case of specific perfor-
mance of contract for sale of immovable property are:
(i) delay running beyond the period. prescribed under the Limitation
Act;

,
[S. 10]
(ii) delay in cases where, though the suit is within the period of limita-
tion, yet:
(a) due to delay the third parties have acquired rights in the sub-
ject-matter of the suit;
(b) in the facts and circumstances of the case, delay may give rise
to plea of waiver or otherwise it will be inequitable to grant a
discretionary relief.
Here none of the above-mentioned aspects applied. The last notice was
issued on 26-11-1978 and from that date the suit was filed only after
nine months and not after more than a year as noted by the High Court.
Therefore on the facts of this case the ground of delay cannot be invoked
to deny relief to the plaintiff."53
Section 10 of the Specific Relief Act enumerates those cases in which the
specific performance of contracts can be enforced.
S. 10. Cases in which specific performance of contract enforcea-
ble. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the specific performance of
any contract may, in the discretion of the Court, be enforced-
(a) when there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused
by the non-performance of the act agreed to be done; or
(b) when the act agreed to be done is such that compensation in money, for
its non-performance would not afford adequate relief.
Explanation.-Unless and until the contrary is proved, the Court shall
presume-
(i) that the breach of a contract to transfer immovable property can-
not be adequately relieved by compensation in money; and
(i) that the breach of a contract to transfer movable property can be
so relieved except in the following cases-
(a) where the property is not an ordinary article of commerce, or is
of special value or interest to the plaintiff or consists of goods
which are not easily obtainable in the market;
(b) where the property is held by the defendant as the agent or
trustee of the plaintiff."

54. Clauses (a) and (b) of this section correspond with clauses (b) and (c) of S. 12 of the repealed
Specific Relief Act, 1877. The relevant illustrations appended to the provision in that Act may
be reproduced:
Illustration as to clause (a).-A agrees to buy, and B agrees to sell, a picture by a dead
painter and two rare China vases. A may compel B specifically to perform this contract, for

Specific performance of contracts 859
Contracts which are specifically enforceable [S. 10]
Where no other suitable remedy
In a case before the Supreme Court a family woman (appellant's mother)
borrowed a sum of money from a family member (respondent's father) and
executed a deed of sale of her property in favour of the lender's minor son
with an agreement of reconveyance on repayment of the loan. The dues
under the loan were paid back and on denial of reconveyance, the Supreme
Court upheld the decree of specific performance ordering reconveyance. The
mortgagee having disposed of the property, the decree was allowed to be
enforced against such buyer also,
The shares of a private company have been held to be goods of such a
nature as they are not easily obtainable in the market. The court, therefore,
laid down that specific performance should be granted in such cases." The
court cited the following opinion of the Privy Council:57 "It is also the opin-
ion of the Board that having regard to the nature of the company and limited
market for its shares, damages would not be an adequate remedy."
Valid contract in existence
There should be a concluded contract. In the present, there was an agree-
ment for transfer of property. The transferor did not dispute the agreement
in his reply to the notice from the transferee. He did not even dispute in his
written statement averments made in the plaint as to the agreement. No such
also to construct a siding and a wharf as specified in the contract. Z is entitled to have
this contract specifically enforced, for his interest in its performance cannot be adequately
compensated for by money; and the court may appoint a proper person to superintend the
construction of the archway, road, siding and wharf. [Based on Storer v Great Western Rly
Co, (1842) 2 Y & CCh Cas 48: 63 ER 21.]
(3) A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, a certain number of railway-shares of
a particular description. A refuses to complete the sale. B may compel A specifically to
perform this agreement, for the shares are limited in number and not always to be had in
the market, and their possession carries with it the status of a shareholder, which cannot
otherwise be procured.
(4) A contracts with B to paint a picture for B, who agrees to pay therefor Rs 1000. The
picture is painted. B is entitled to have it delivered to him on payment or tender of Rs 1000.

plea was raised before the High Court or the trial court. Hence, existence of
the agreement was not disputed.58
The other two requirements for seeking specific relief are that the defend-
ant committed breach of the contract and that the plaintiff was always ready
and willing to perform his part of the obligation in terms of the contract."
Where an agreement for sale prescribed a retrospective date for execu-
tion, the court said that it was not permissible. It would make the contract.
vague and therefore, incapable of execution. Such an agreement cannot be
sought to be specifically enforced.60
Contract not extinguished by decree
The passing of decree for specific performance does not extinguish the
contract between the parties. The parties continue to be entitled to their
rights and bound by their obligation under the contract. The decree for
specific performance merely recognises entitlement to the claim for specific
performance.
Agreement for reconveyance or repurchase
An agreement to repurchase property which had been sold, popularly
know as agreement for reconveyance, has been held to be specifically enforce-
able. Referring to such an agreement in V. Pechimuthu v Gowrammal, the
Supreme Court said:
"Such an agreement, not being merely a privilege or concession, such
as an option to purchase, granted to the owner, remains an agreement for
sale of immovable property and must be governed by the same provisions
of law as are applicable to ordinary agreements for sale. Decision as to
whether an agreement is an option to purchase or an ordinary agreement
depends on interpretation of its terms. It was held on the facts that the
reconveyance agreement in favour of the appellant-plaintiff, the original
vendor, was an ordinary agreement for sale. The High Court in second
appeal erred in reversing the decree of specific performance in his favour
granted by trial court and affirmed by first appellate court."
Delay
Unreasonable delay by a plaintiff in performing his part of the contract
operates as a bar to his obtaining specific performance, provided that-

Specific performance of contracts 861
(i) time was originally the essential element of the contract; or
(ii) it was made an essential element by a subsequent notice; or
(iii) the delay has been so unreasonable and long that it amounts to aban-
donment of the contract.63
As a general proposition of law, in the case of sale of immovable property
there is no presumption as to time being the essence of the contract. Even
if it is not of the essence of the contract the Court may infer that it is to be
performed within a reasonable time if the conditions are evident:
(i) from the express terms of the contract;
(ii) from the nature of the property; and
(iii) from the surrounding circumstances, for example, the object of
making the contract.
From the expression, "Rs 98,000 (rupees ninety-eight thousand only) will
be paid by the second party to the first party within a period of ten days
only" in the contract, it is clear that the amount of Rs 98,000 ought to have
been paid on or before the 10th day. Failure to do so constituted a breach
committed by the defendant. The word "only" has been used twice over
(1) to qualify the amount of Rs 98,000, and (2) to qualify the period of 10
days. The evidence also showed that the plaintiff was not willing to pay this
amount unless vacant delivery of possession of one room on the ground
floor was given. The notices which were exchanged between the parties have
to be looked into in determining readiness and willingness."
It has been held that a person seeking specific enforcement of a contract
must approach the court within reasonable time even if time is not of the
essence of the contract. It was further held that "reasonable time" means as
soon as circumstances permit. Where the defendant was to remove a tele-
graph pole from a property and then to execute the sale deed, but he only
removed the pole and did not execute the sale deed despite notice and the
plaintiff filed a suit within one month of removal of the pole, it was held, on
the facts, that the suit was filed within reasonable time. Time was not of the
essence of the present contract. The court said: "The word 'reasonable' has
in law a prima facie meaning of reasonable in regard to those circumstances
of which the person concerned is called upon to act reasonably knows or
ought to know as to what was reasonable. It may be unreasonable to give an
exact definition of the word 'reasonable'. The reason varies in its conclusion
according to idiosyncrasy of the individual and the time and circumstances
in which he thinks. The dictionary meaning of 'reasonable time' is to be so
much time as is necessary, under the circumstances, to do conveniently what

words it means, as soon as circumstances permit."
"The legal action initiated by the appellant-plaintiff was rightly held by
the trial court and the first appellate court to have been commenced with-
out delay and definitely within a reasonable time. The High Court was not
justified in disturbing the finding of fact arrived at on appreciation of the
evidence, while disposing of the second appeal."65
A valid contract of sale must be proved by producing the original docu-
ment. In this case a copy of the contract typed in duplicate was produced
before the court. The son of the deceased vendor admitted the signature of
his father. The High Court found on evidence that the original document
was retained by the vendor and he did not produce it. The High Court
accepted the document as genuine and its contents as true. The Supreme
Court held that on the evidence on the record, sufficient foundation for
accepting the document by way of secondary evidence in terms of Section 65
of the Evidence Act had been laid.66
It has been held by the Supreme Court that specific performance of a con-
tract cannot be decreed against a defendant who is devoid of title-Nemo
dat quod non habet,67
Sale by joint owners
The Supreme Court propounded the following proposition: "Where any
property is held jointly, and once any party to the contract has agreed to
sell such joint property by agreement, then, even if the other co-sharer has
not joined, at least to the extent of his share, he is bound to execute the
sale deed. However, in the absence of the other co-sharer there could not
be any decree of any specified part of the property to be partitioned and
possession given. The decree could only be to the extent of transferring the
share of the appellants in such property to other such contracting party. In
the present case, it is not in dispute that the appellants have 5/6ths share in
the property. So, the plaintiff's suit for specific performance to the extent of

to file the suit.

S. 11. Cases in which specific performance of contracts connected with
trusts enforceable.--(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Act, specific per-
formance of a contract may, in the discretion of the court, be enforced when the
act agreed to be done is in the performance wholly or partly of a trust.
(2) A contract made by a trustee in excess of his powers or in breach of trust
cannot be specifically enforced.
Performance of trusts
Section 11(1) provides another circumstance in which contracts can be
specifically enforced.
Enforcement of trustee's duty
The creation of a trust imposes a duty on the trustees, which may be
enforced even by strangers to the transaction who may not have been in
existence at its date, if they have an interest under the contract. Thus con-
tracts connected with trusts can be specifically enforced either at the instance
of the beneficiaries or at the instance of the trustees.
Section 11(2), however, provides that a contract made by a trustee:
(i) in excess of his powers, or
(ii) in breach of trust,
cannot be specifically enforced.
In the first case it is beyond his competence and, in the second case, it is
unlawful. "In breach of trust" means acting in violation of the duties and
obligations imposed by the trust.69

she was not a party to the contract. The court dissented from the decision in Kartar Singh

the joint property on payment of half of the consideration money. Awadesh Yadav v Suresh

petent to sell.
69. S. 11 brings together Ss. 12(a) and 21(e) of the repealed Specific Relief Act, 1877. The relevant
illustrations appended there that Act may be reproduced:
(1) A holds certain stock in trust for B. A wrongfully disposes of the stock. The law cre-
ates an obligation on A to restore the same quantity of stock to B, and B may enforce specific
performance of this obligation. [This illustration was repealed wherever the Indian Trusts
Act, 1882 is in force-see S. 2 and Schedule of that Act.]
(2) A is a trustee of land with power to lease it for seven years. He enters into a contract
with B to grant a lease of the land for seven years, with a covenant to renew the lease at the
expiry of the term. This contract cannot be specifically enforced. [Based on Mortlock v Buller,
(1804) 10 Ves 292: 7 RR 417.]
(3) The directors of a company have power to sell the concern with the sanction of a
general meeting of the shareholders. They contract to sell it without any such sanction. This
contract cannot be specifically enforced.
(4) Two trustees, A and B, empowered to sell trust property worth a lakh of rupees, con-
tract to sell it to C for Rs 30,000. The contract is so disadvantageous as to be a breach of trust.

Limitation
[S. 12]
A suit for specific enforcement should be filed for specific performance
within the period stipulated under Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963."
In a contract where no date for performance was final, the court said that
the period of limitation would start running from the date on which the
plaintiff comes to know that the other party was refusing performance."
S. 12. Specific performance of part of contract.-(1) Except as otherwise
hereinafter provided in this section, the court shall not direct the specific per-
formance of a part of a contract.
(2) Where a party to a contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it,
but the part which must be left unperformed bears only a small proportion to
the whole in value and admits of compensation in money, the court may, at the
suit of either party, direct the specific performance of so much of the contract
as can be performed, and award compensation in money for the deficiency.72
(3) Where a party to a contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it,
and the part which must be left unperformed either-
(a) forms a considerable part of the whole, though admitting of compensa-
tion in money; or
(b) does not admit of compensation in money;
he is not entitled to obtain a decree for specific performance; but the court
may, at the suit of the other party, direct the party in default to perform specifi-
cally so much of his part of the contract as he can perform, if the other party-
() in a case falling under clause (a), pays or has paid the agreed considera-
tion for the whole of the contract reduced by the consideration for the
part which must be left unperformed and in a case falling under clause
(b), "[pays or has paid] the consideration for the whole of the contract
without any abatement; and
(ii) in either case, relinquishes all claims to the performance of the remaining
part of the contract and all right to compensation, either for the defi-
ciency or for the loss or damage sustained by him through the default of
the defendant.74
C cannot enforce its specific performance. [Based on Mortlock v Buller, (1804) 10 Ves 292:
7 RR 417.]
(5) The promoters of a company for working mines contract that the company, when
formed, shall purchase certain mineral property. They take no proper precautions to ascertain
the value of such property-and in fact agree to pay an extravagant price therefor. They also
stipulate that the vendors shall give them a bonus out of the purchase money. This contract
cannot be specifically enforced.

of both the parties, cl. (3) does so in favour of the party not in default. Party in default is the
party who is unable to perform the whole of his part of the contract. The principle underlying
cl. (3) is that the party who is not at default is entitled to specific performance of so much of a

(4) When a part of a contract which, taken by itself, can and ought to be
specifically performed, stands on a separate and independent footing from
another part of the same contract which cannot or ought not to be specifically
performed, the court may direct specific performance of the former part.
Explanation.-For the purposes of this section, a party to a contract shall
be deemed to be unable to perform the whole of his part of it if a portion of
its subject-matter existing at the date of the contract has ceased to exist at the
time of its performance."
Specific performance of part of contract [S. 12]
Section 12 deals with specific performance of a part of a contract. It pro-
vides in clause (1) that as a general rule, the court shall not grant specific
performance of a part of a contract. The section, however, recognises in-
contract as the other can perform. Rachakonda Narayana v Ponthala Parvathamma, (2001)
8 SCC 173, the relief of directing the defendant party to perform specifically so much of his
part of the contract as he can perform can be pleaded at the appellate stage also when the fact
of the defaulting party's inability to perform a part of the contract comes to the knowledge of
the party seeking specific performance.
75. For example, if, at an auction, a person purchases several plots of land, the inability of the
vendor to make out good title to one plot will not prevent him from enforcing specific per-
formance of the sale of other plots. Balkar Singh v Mohabat Singh, AIR 2004 P&H 340,
agreement for sale of defendant's share in property as well as share of his minor son with-
out court permission, enforceable to the extent of defendant's share reducing consideration
proportionally.
76. Sub-sections (1), (2), (3), (4) and Explanation of this section correspond with Ss. 17, 14, 15, 16
and 13 of the repealed Specific Relief Act, 1877. That Act carried the following illustrations:
Illustrations as to sub-section (2).-(a) A contracts to sell B a piece of land consisting of
100 bighas. It turns out that 98 bighas of the land belong to A, and the two remaining bighas
to a stranger, who refuses to part with them. The two bighas are not necessary for the use
or enjoyment (of the 98 bighas, nor so important for such use or enjoyment) that the loss of
them may not be made good in money. A may be directed at the suit of B to convey to B the
98 bighas and to make compensation to him for not conveying the two remaining bighas; or B
may be directed, at the suit of A, to pay to A on receiving the conveyance and possession of the
land, the stipulated purchase money, less a sum awarded as compensation for the deficiency.
[Based on Richardson v Smith, (1870) LR 5 Ch App 648.]
(b) In a contract of the sale and purchase of a house and lands for two lakhs of rupees, it is
agreed that part of the furniture should be taken at a valuation. The Court may direct specific
performance of the contract notwithstanding that the parties are unable to agree as to the
valuation of the furniture, and may either have the furniture valued in the suit and include it
in the decree for specific performance, or may confine its decree to the house.
Illustrations as to sub-section (3).-(a) A contracts to sell to B a piece of land consisting
of 100 bighas. It turns out that 50 bighas of the land belong to A, and the other 50 bighas to
a stranger, who refuses to part with them. A cannot obtain a decree against B for the specific
performance of the contract; but if B is willing to pay the price agreed upon, and to take the
50 bighas which belong to A, waiving all rights to compensation either for the deficiency or
for loss sustained by him through A's neglect or default, B is entitled to a decree directing A
to convey those 50 bighas to him on payment of the purchase money.
(b) A contracts to sell to B an estate with a house and a garden for a lakh of rupees. The
garden is important for the enjoyment of the house. It turns out that A is unable to convey
the garden. A cannot obtain a decree against B for the specific performance of the contract;
but if B is willing to pay the price agreed upon, and to take the estate and house without the
garden, waiving all rights to compensation either for the deficiency or for loss sustained by
him through A's neglect or default, B is entitled to a decree directing A to convey the house to
him on payment of the purchase-money.

[S. 12]
clauses (2) to (4) certain exceptions to the above rule. Whether specific per-
formance of a part of the contract is to be ordered or not has been wholly
left by the section to one deciding factor, namely, the proportion the part
which can be performed bears to that which cannot be performed. Where
the part which cannot be performed bears only a small proportion to the
whole in value and the unperformed part can be compensated adequately in
terms of money, the court may order specific performance of one part and
compensation for the other.
A slightly different principle comes into play where the part which cannot
be performed forms a considerable part of the whole. In such cases the court
has first to see whether the major part which has to be left out admits of
money compensation or does not do so. If the unperformed portion can be
compensated in terms of money the court may order specific performance
of the rest, provided that the party seeking relief has paid his consideration
under the contract as reduced by the amount of compensation for the unper-
formed portion. Where the matter does not admit of compensation the court
may order specific performance only when the party seeking relief has paid
his whole consideration without any reduction whatsoever.
Where the part that would remain unperformed does not admit of com-
pensation in terms of money, the court would order specific performance
only if the party seeking performance undertakes to pay the consideration
for the whole of the contract without any abatement.
In either situation, the party seeking performance of a part of a contract
has to relinquish all claims to the performance of the remaining part and
also all rights to compensation either for the deficiency or for any loss or
damage sustained through the defendant's default as to performance.
An illustrative account of the working of the principle is to be found in
Rutherford v Acton Adams."
If a vendor sues and is in a position to convey substantially what the
purchaser has contracted to get, the court will decree specific performance
with compensation for any small and immaterial deficiency, provided that
the vendor has not, by misrepresentation or otherwise, disentitled himself
to this remedy. Another possible case arises where a vendor claims specific
performance and where the court refuses it unless the purchaser is willing to
consent to a decree on the terms that the vendor will make compensation to
the purchaser who agrees to such a decree on condition that he is compen-
sated. If it is the purchaser who is suing, the court holds him to have even a
larger right. Subject to considerations of hardship, he may elect to take all
he can get, and to have a proportionate abatement of the purchase money.
But this right applies only to a deficiency in the subject-matter described in
the contract.

Specific performance of contracts 867.
The Specific Relief Act, 1877 (now repealed) carried the following illus-
tration in the corresponding Section 14:
A contracts to sell to B a piece of land consisting of 100 bighas. It turns out that 98 bighas
of the land belong to A, and the two remaining bighas to a stranger, who refuses to part with
them. The two bighas are not necessary for the use or enjoyment of the 98 bighas, nor so
important for such use or enjoyment that the loss of them may not be made good in money.
A may be directed at the suit of B to convey to B 98 bighas and to make compensation to him
for not conveying the two remaining bighas; or B may be directed, in the suit of A, to pay to
A, on receiving the conveyance and possession of the land, the stipulated purchase money
less a sum awarded as compensation for the deficiency.78
In a contract for the sale and purchase of a house and lands for Rs 2
lakhs, it is agreed that part of the furniture should be taken at a valuation.
The court may direct specific performance of the contract notwithstanding
the parties are unable to agree as to the valuation of the furniture, and may
either have the furniture valued in the suit and include it in the decree for
specific performance, or may confine its decree to the house.
Where a contract was incapable of being performed and a party categori-
cally refused to accept part-performance; it was held that there was no read-
iness and willingness at all stages to accept part-performance. Therefore
such a party could not be permitted later to change its position and elect to
accept part-performance." The court said:
"In cases where a contract is not capable of being performed in whole
then the readiness and willingness, at all stages, is the readiness and will-
ingness to accept part-performance. If a contract is not capable of being
performed in whole and a party clearly indicates that he is not willing to
accept part-performance, then there is no readiness and willingness, at all
stages, to accept part-performance. In that case there can be no specific
performance of a part of the contract at a later stage."
In a case under the J&K Specific Relief Act, 1977 [S. 15] it was held that
where a party was unable to perform the whole of his part, the court could
direct the performance of so much of his part as he was capable of perform-
ing (1/3rd share of the property)."
The requirements of the section were stated by the Supreme Court as
follows:82
"The ingredients which would attract specific performance of the part
of the contract under the latter part of sub-section (3) of Section 12 are:

[S. 13]
(i) if a party to an agreement is unable to perform a part of the contract,
he is to be treated as defaulting party to that extent, and (ii) the other
party to an agreement must, in a suit for such specific performance, either
pay or have paid the whole of the agreed amount, for that part of the con-
tract which is capable of being performed by the defaulting party and also
relinquish his claim in respect of the other part of the contract which the
defaulting party is not capable of performing and relinquishes the claim
of compensation in respect of loss sustained by him. If such ingredients
are satisfied, the discretionary relief of specific performance is ordinarily
granted unless there is delay or laches or any other disability on the part
of the other party."
Illustrations as to Explanation.-(a) A contracts to sell a house to
B for a lakh of rupees. The day after the contract is made, the house is
destroyed by a cyclone. B may be compelled to perform his part of the
contract by paying the purchase-money.
(b) In consideration of a sum of money payable by B, A contracts to
grant an annuity to B for B's life. The day after the contract has been
made, B is thrown from his house and killed. B's representative may be

Rights of purchaser or lessee where seller's or lessor's
title imperfect [S. 13]
S. 13. Rights of purchaser or lessee against person with no title or
imperfect title.--(1) Where a person contracts to sell or let certain immovable
property having no title or only an imperfect title, the purchaser or lessee (sub-
ject to the other provisions of this Chapter), has the following rights, namely-
(a) if the vendor or lessor has subsequently to the contract acquired any
interest in the property, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to make
good the contract out of such interest;
(b) where the concurrence of other persons is necessary for validating the
title, and they are bound to concur at the request of the vendor or lessor,
the purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure such concurrence,
and when a conveyance by other persons is necessary to validate the
title and they are bound to convey at the request of the vendor or lessor,
the purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure such conveyance;
(c) where the vendor professes to sell unencumbered property, but the
property is mortgaged for an amount not exceeding the purchase money
and the vendor has in fact only a right to redeem it the purchaser may
compel him to redeem the mortgage and to obtain a valid discharge,
and, where necessary, also a conveyance from the mortgagee;
(d) where the vendor or lessor sues for specific performance of the contract
and the suit is dismissed on the ground of his want of title or imperfect
title, the defendant has a right to a return of his deposit, if any, with

interest thereon, to his costs of the suit, and to a lien for such deposit,
interest and costs on the interest, if any, of the vendor or lessor in the
property which is the subject-matter of the contract.
(2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall also apply, as far as may be, to con-
tracts for the sale or hire of movable property.
Section 13 deals with the rights of a purchaser or lessee against a per-
son with no title or imperfect title. The idea underlying this section is that
when a person enters into a contract without the power for performing that
contract and subsequently he acquires the power of performing the same,
he is bound to do so. This section is, however, limited to contracts to sell
or let property. This result may not necessarily follow particularly where
the purchaser was aware of the lack of title. In this case, the seller was the
cultivating tenant of the land in question. The purchaser (plaintiff) from
him was very much aware that he had no title. The court said that such
purchaser had no right to seek specific enforcement of the agreement to sell.
Even subsequent acquisition of title by the seller would not enure to the ben-
efit of such purchaser, because he could not say that he had come with clean
hands,3
The different clauses of Section 13 affect the remedy of the buyer and
the obligation of the seller. The section comes into play when the seller of
immovable property has no title or only an imperfect title. If he acquires any
interest in the property subsequently, the purchaser can compel him to make
good the contract out of such interest. Where concurrence of or conveyance
by some other person is necessary to enable the vendor to validate his trans-
fer, and if that person is bound to concur at the direction of the vendor, the
purchaser can compel the vendor to procure such concurrence and validate
the transfer. Where the vendor purported to sell the property as free from
any encumbrance, etc., but the property is in fact subject to a mortgage
and, if the amount of the mortgage is equal to the sale price, the buyer may
compel the vendor to redeem the mortgage and transfer the property to
him free from the mortgage. Where the contract of transfer was subject to
the responsibility of the vendor to apply for and to get the agricultural land
converted into non-agricultural use and though he had not obtained such
permission, the land in question was held to be specifically recoverable from
him when, by virtue of an intervening statutory enactment, the vendee was
able to get the land converted to his use." Where the vendor sues the buyer
for specific performance and the suit is dismissed on the ground of want of
title or imperfect title, the vendee would be entitled to refund of his deposit
along with interest and also costs and this claim will operate as a charge
upon the interest, if any, of the vendor in the property.

Amendment of plaint for relinquishment of performance
of remaining part
[S. 13]
The relinquishment of claim as contemplated under Section 12(3)(a) as
regards performance of the remaining part and rights as to compensation
need not be specifically pleaded. The sub-section does not lay down any
limitation for filing such an application for amendment. It can be filed at
any stage of the proceedings and also before the Supreme Court. Delay is
immaterial for this purpose."5
Purchaser of share in unpartitioned property
The case involved sale by two brothers only of their shares in the unparti-
tioned jointly inherited property. The other co-owners were two sisters who
had not joined the sale. The Supreme Court said: "Section 12 of the Specific
Relief Act would be of no assistance in the situation obtaining here. In the
absence of sisters being parties to the agreement, the vendee can at best
obtain the undivided interest of the two brothers in the property. Section 12
cannot be involved by the vendee in the sale of undivided share of the two
brothers with a right to force partition on the sisters who were not parties
to the agreement of sale. Such a relief cannot be obtained under Section 12
by a vendee on purchase of an undivided share in the property of some of
the co-owners against other co-owners who were not parties to the sale."86
The defendant was the owner of 3/4th undivided share in the property.
The court said that even such share could be sold. His property was identi-
fied by a specific share. The plaintiff was ready to pay the full price. A decree
for specific recovery of such share could be passed.37
Specific performance of part of contract
The whole of the property belonging to the joint owners was contracted
to be sold. One of them was a minor whose share was to be transferred on
obtaining court permission. Such permission could not be obtained. The
vendee claimed specific performance of that part of the property which
belonged to the adult joint-owners. It was held that since they could transfer
their shares in the property and they being owners of definite shares and no
court permission being necessary for that purpose, the decree was granted.
The contract was not of contingent nature. It was nowhere provided that
85. Surinder Singh v Kapoor Singh, (2005) 5 SCC 142. The claimant has to pay only a propor-
tional part of the consideration. The promise in this case was for sale of property of the seller
and his sister. He could not persuade the sister. Specific recovery of his part was allowed. Jeet
Singh v Daulat Ram, AIR 2012 P&H 3, the vendor was not able to perform the contract to
the full extent because 3/4th of the property had already been decreed in favour of co-sharers,
the vendee was willing to pay full price even for getting 1/4. This was allowed. He could relin-
quish a part of his claim at any stage of proceeding.

Specific performance of contracts 871
the contract was to become void or unenforceable on the failure of the court
permission.
S. 14. Contracts not specifically enforceable.-(1) The following con-
tracts cannot be specifically enforced, namely-
(a) a contract for the non-performance of which compensation in money is
an adequate relief;
(b) a contract which runs into such minute or numerous details or which is
so dependent on the personal qualifications or volition of the parties, or
otherwise from its nature is such, that the court cannot enforce specific
performance of its material terms;
(c) a contract which is in its nature determinable;
(d) a contract the performance of which involves the performance of a con-
tinuous duty which the court cannot supervise.
(2) Save as provided by the Arbitration Act, 1940, no contract to refer pres-
ent or future differences to arbitration shall be specifically enforced; but if any
person who has made such a contract (other than an arbitration agreement to
which the provisions of the said Act apply) and has refused to perform it sues
in respect of any subject which he has contracted to refer, the existence of such
contract shall bar the suit.
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (a) or clause (c) or clause (d)
of sub-section (1), the court may enforce specific performance in the following
cases-
(a) where the suit is for the enforcement of a contract,―
() to execute a mortgage or furnish any other security for securing
the repayment of any loan which the borrower is not willing to
repay at once:
Provided that where only a part of the loan has been advanced the
lender is willing to advance the remaining part of the loan in terms
of the contract; or
(ii) to take up and pay for any debentures of a company;
(b) where the suit is for-
(i) the execution of a formal deed of partnership, the parties having
commenced to carry on the business of the partnership; or
(ii) the purchase of a share of a partner in a firm;
(c) where the suit is for enforcement of contract for the construction of any
building or the execution of any other work on land:
Provided that the following conditions are fulfilled, namely:-
the building or other work is described in the contract in terms suf-
ficiently precise to enable the court to determine the exact nature
of the building or work;

husband only.

(ii) the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the performance of the
contract and the interest is of such a nature that compensation in
money for non-performance of the contract is not an adequate
relief; and
(iii) the defendant has, in pursuance of the contract, obtained posses-
sion of the whole or any part of the land on which the building is to
be constructed or other work is to be executed.89
89. Illustrations in preceding 1877 Act. The section is based on S. 21(a), (b), (d) and (g) of the
repealed Specific Relief Act, 1877. That Act carried the following illustrations:
Illustrations as to sub-section (1)(a).-A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, a lakh
of rupees in the four per cent loan of the Central Government;
A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, 40 chests of indigo at Rs 1000 per chest:
In consideration of certain property having been transferred by A to B, B contracts
to open a credit in A's favour to the extent of Rs 10,000, and to honour A's drafts to that
amount.
The above contracts cannot be specifically enforced, for in the first and the second both A
and B, and in the third A, would be reimbursed by compensation in money.
Illustrations as to sub-section (1)(b).-A contracts to render personal service to B:
A contracts to employ B on personal service:
A, an author, contracts with B, a publisher, to complete a literary work.
B cannot enforce specific performance of these contracts.
A contracts to buy B's business at the amount of a valuation to be made by two valuers, one
to be named by A and the other by B. A and B each name a valuer, but before the valuation is
made, A instructs his valuer not to proceed;
By a charter-party entered into in Calcutta between A, the owner of a ship, and B, the
charterer, it is agreed that the ship shall proceed to Rangoon, and there load a cargo of rice,
and thence proceed to London, freight to be paid, one-third on arrival at Rangoon, and two-
thirds on delivery of the cargo in London;
A lets land to B and B contracts to cultivate it in a particular manner for three years next
after the date of the lease;
A and B contract that, in consideration of annual advances to be made by A, B will for
three years next after the date of the contract grow particular crops on the land in his posses-
sion and deliver them to A when cut and ready for delivery;
A contracts with B that, in consideration of Rs 1000 to be paid to him by B, he will paint
a picture for B;
A contracts with B to execute certain works which the Court cannot superintend;
A contracts to supply B with all the goods of a certain class which B may require;
A contracts with B to take from B a lease of a certain house for a specified term, at a spec-
ified rent, "if the drawing-room is handsomely decorated", even if it is held to have so much
certainty that compensation can be recovered for its breach;
A contracts to marry B.
The above contracts cannot be specifically enforced.
Illustration as to sub-section (1)(c).-A and B contract to become partners in a certain
business, the contract not specifying the duration of the proposed partnership. This contract
cannot be specifically performed, for, if it were so performed, either A or B might at once
dissolve the partnership. [Based on Scott v Rayment, (1868) LR 7 Eq 112].
Illustration as to sub-section (1)(d).-A contracts to let for twenty-one years to B the right
to use such part of a certain railway made by A as was upon B's land, and that B should have a
right of running carriages over the whole line on certain terms, and might require A to supply
the necessary engine-power, and that A should during the term keep the whole railway in good
repair. Specific performance of this contract must be refused to B.

Specific performance of contracts 873
Contracts which cannot be specifically enforced
The effect of the provisions in Section 14 can be stated in terms of certain
propositions, namely, that in the case of the following contracts the relief of
specific performance cannot be allowed:
1. Where compensation is adequate [S. 14(1)(a)]
Courts will not order specific performance of a contract where the
aggrieved party can be adequately compensated in terms of money. An ordi-
nary contract to lend or borrow money whether with or without security
is an example of a contract which cannot be specifically enforced, though
where a loan has been already advanced on the understanding that a secu-
rity would be provided against it, this can be specifically enforced."
2. Contracts involving personal skill (S. 14(1)(b)]
It is not possible for the court to supervise the performance of a contract
which runs into minute and numerous details or is dependent upon the per-
sonal qualifications of the promisor or is otherwise of volitional nature.
Contracts of employment, contracts of personal service, contracts involving
performance of artistic skill, like contracts to sing, to paint, to act, con-
tracts of authorship, are ordinary examples of things requiring personal
skill and, therefore, beyond the capacity of the judicial process to enforce
their actual performance. The only choice in such cases is to be content with
damages." An employer may not be compellable to keep an employee in
accordance with a contract of employment, but the position will be differ-
ent where an employee has been removed, for, in that case, if the removal
is wrongful, the employee can be reinstated. The Supreme Court, however,
did not approve of an arbitrator's award reinstating a professor removed by
the Delhi University. 92 A contract to publish a piece of music and a contract
to build a house"s have been specifically enforced because both are purely
mechanical functions. It is observed in CHITTY ON CONTRACTS:4

ment, the employee did not comply with order of transfer and sought declaration that the
transfer was illegal, that her service and benefits must be maintained, and that the employer
should be restrained from holding inquiry against her. The court said that such a relief, if
granted, would amount to enforcing a contract of personal service, which is not possible
under the law. Shiv Kumar Tiwari v Jagat Narain Rai, (2001) 10 SCC 11: AIR 2002 SC 211,

874 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 14]
"But specific performance of a contract to build can be decreed if (i)
the work is precisely defined; (ii) damages will not adequately compensate
the plaintiff; and (iii) the defendant is in possession of the land on which
the work is to be done so that the plaintiff cannot get the work done by
another builder."
Clauses of uncertain nature.-The suit was for specific performance of
the agreement of renewal of lease. There was a concurrent finding of the
court below that the option of renewal was exercised against the terms of
the renewal clause. The clause required fixation of the terms and condi-
tions of renewal and also its period under mutual agreement or alternatively
through the village Mukhiya or Panchas. Such persons were not named
in the agreement. The lessee served legal notice of renewal without fulfill-
ing the requirement of initial mutual assent. The relief of renewal was not
allowed to the lessee.95
Contracts involving personal, confidential and fiduciary service.-The
specific performance of a contract for personal, confidential and fiduciary
service dependent on mutual trust, faith and confidence has been held to be
barred under Section 14(1)(a), (b) & (d)."
3. Contracts of determinable nature [S. 14(1)(c)]
Specific performance is not ordered of a contract which is in its nature
determinable. An illustration appearing under the corresponding provision
in the repealed Act of 1877 sufficiently explains this point:
A and B contract to become partners in a certain business, the contract
did not specify the duration of the proposed partnership. The contract
cannot be specifically performed, for, if it were so performed, either A or
B might at once dissolve the partnership."
Similarly, no order of specific performance is likely to be passed when the
contract is revocable at the option of the opposite party. A revocable lease
is in this category," But a tenancy from year to year, determinable by either
party by half a year's notice to quit, is specifically enforceable.99
A contract of employment is not specifically enforceable. A person who
was selected was not allowed to get the position to which he was selected.
The court observed: "Courts do not ordinarily enforce performance of
contracts of a personal character, such as a contract of employment. The

Specific performance of contracts 875
remedy is to sue for damages. The grant of specific performance is purely
discretionary and must be refused when not warranted by the ends of jus-
tice. Such relief can be granted only on sound legal principles. In the absence
of any statutory requirement, courts do not ordinarily force an employer
to recruit or retain in service an employee not required by the employer.
There are, of course, certain exceptions to this rule, such as in the case of a
public servant dismissed from service in contravention of Article 311 of the
Constitution; reinstatement of a dismissed worker under the Industrial Law;
a statutory body acting in breach of statutory obligations, and the like. The
facts of this case do not fall within the exceptions. Therefore, the plaintiff's
suit for mandatory injunction, on the facts of the case, was rightly dismissed
by the trial court and wrongly decreed by the first appellate court and the
High Court."100
102
A distributorship was held to be determinable in nature. An order could
not be passed for its restoration.101 Where the plaintiff claimed that an
agreement in his favour to run a restaurant was illegally terminated, the
court said that the contract not being, specifically enforceable an interim
injunction to restrain the termination could not be granted. The licence to
run the petrol pump was terminated. The licence was granted under a revo-
cable agreement. The court said that the only remedy for the licencee was to
sue for damages and not for enforcement of the agreement. The suit as filed
was liable to be rejected.00
4. Contract requiring constant supervision [S. 14(1)(d)]
Clause (d) of Section 14(1) says that a contract cannot be specifically
enforced where it involves the performance of a continuous duty which the
court cannot supervise.
For this reason courts have refused specifically to enforce an undertaking
by the lessor of a service flat to have a porter "constantly in attendance";104
a tenant's undertaking to cultivate a farm in a particular manner; 10s the
obligation of a railway company to operate signals and to provide engine

eviction was passed, it would not be enforced and the parties would enter into a fresh tenancy
agreement. Even so, the tenant did not pay rent for 14 years and also did not pay the premium
amount. It was also not clear what would be the terms of the new rent deed. Thus the tenant
was not performing his part of the contract. He was not able to get an order from the court
directing the landlord to execute the deed.

instalments,109
Where a tenant vacated a site for purposes of reconstruction under an
understanding that a portion of the building would be reallotted to him,
the court held that the landlord was bound to provide the premises as
promised.110
Sub-section (3) qualifies to a certain extent the operation of the clauses
dealing with situations where compensation is an adequate relief and where
the contract is unilaterally revocable. It says that an agreement to provide a
security or to execute a mortgage against a loan which has already been pro-
vided is specifically enforceable, if the borrower is not willing to pay back
the loan at once. Where the lender has advanced only a part of the loan,
he can claim specific relief only when he is ready and willing to advance
the remaining part of the loan also. An agreement to take up, and pay for,
the debentures of a company is also specifically enforceable. Agreements to
execute a formal deed of partnership where the partners have already com-
menced business and to purchase the share of a partner in a firm are also
specifically enforceable.
Construction contracts [S. 14(3)(c)]
As for agreements for the construction of a building, the principles crys-
tallised in English law have been adopted by sub-section (3)(c). The agree-
ment will be enforceable if the nature of the building is of exact nature, the
plaintiff has a substantial interest in the work and the work is also of such
nature that it cannot be compensated for in terms of money and the defend-
ant is in possession of the whole or a part of the site.
In a case before the Supreme Court, the Authority which had to super-
vise the performance of the contract had ceased to exist. The Court said:
"There is also force in the contention that the agreement is not specifically
enforceable in view of clause (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Specific
Relief Act, 1963. This provision provides that a contract, the performance
of which involves the performance of a continuous duty which the court
cannot supervise, is not specifically enforceable. Having regard to the nature
of the Scheme and the facts and circumstances of the case, it is clear that the
performance of the contract involves continuous supervision which is not
possible for the court. After repeal, such continuous supervision cannot be

directed to be undertaken by the competent authority as such an authority
is now non-existent."
Where the contract involved a project of public interest and the plaintiff
was not able to prove any prima facie case in his favour and his loss was also
ascertainable in monetary terms, the court refused to grant an injunction
restraining the execution of a public project.112
Arbitration
Section 14 provides in sub-section (2) that, except as provided by the
Arbitration Act, 1940, (now Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996) a con-
tract to refer a present or future dispute to arbitration shall not be specifi-
cally enforced. An arbitration agreement operates as a bar to the filing of a
suit.
Lack of free consent and situation of no contract
Where the plea that the sale deed was executed under distress was not
taken by the vendor in his written statement and this being a question of
fact, it was not allowed to be raised for the first time in second appeal. The
court found the sale agreement to be genuine and also supported by lawful
consideration. The plea raised at this stage that the decree, if passed, would
cause hardship to him, was not entertained.113
An agreement which was not signed by the vendee and was signed only
by the vendor was held to be a concluded contract. The court said that what
was necessary for enforceability was consensus ad idem. Suit for specific
performance can be maintained even on the strength of an oral agreement.114
A trust was created by a lady. Under the trust deed, two trustees were
appointed who were to act jointly. Yet the lady herself acted as a trustee and
entered into an agreement of sale on behalf of the trust. Thus, the agreement
was made in breach of the trust and in excess of the powers of individual
trustee. The buyer could not seek specific enforcement,115
Family settlement
An agreement for transfer of property which was found to be a part of
the settlement was held to be not bereft of consideration. The settlement is
a consideration in itself. The deed of settlement was produced. It carried the
provision for the transfer in question. The court held that it could not be said
that the settlement had not been proved. The decree of specific performance
was passed.116

[S. 15]
S. 15. Who may obtain specific performance.-Except as otherwise pro-
vided by this Chapter, the specific performance of a contract may be obtained
by-
(a) any party thereto;
(b) the representative-in-interest or the principal, of any party thereto:
Provided that where the learning, skill, solvency or any personal qual-
ity of such party is a material ingredient in the contract, or where the
contract provides that his interest shall not be assigned, his represent-
ative-in-interest or his principal shall not be entitled to specific perfor-
mance of the contract, unless such party has already performed his part
of the contract, or the performance thereof by his representative-in-in-
terest, or his principal, has been accepted by the other party;
(c) where the contract is a settlement on marriage, or a compromise of
doubtful rights between the members of the same family, any person
beneficially entitled thereunder;
(d) where the contract has been entered into by a tenant for life in due exer-
cise of a power, the remainderman;
(e) a reversioner in possession, where the agreement is a covenant entered
into with his predecessor-in-title and the reversioner is entitled to the
benefit of such covenant;
(f) a reversioner in remainder, where the agreement is such a covenant, and
the reversioner is entitled to the benefit thereof and will sustain material
injury by reason of its breach;
(g) when a company has entered into a contract and subsequently becomes
amalgamated with another company, the new company which arises out
of the amalgamation;
(h) when the promoters of a company have, before its incorporation, entered
into a contract for the purposes of the company, and such contract is
warranted by the terms of the incorporation, the company:
Provided that the company has accepted the contract and has communi-
cated such acceptance to the other party to the contract.
Persons for or against whom contracts may be specifically
enforced [S. 15]

right to purchase the property and, therefore, he would have the title to
claim specific performance. The deed of assignment of a decree for specific

Specific performance of contracts 879
performance does not create any right, title or interest in immovable prop-
erty in favour of the assignee. Hence, such deed does not require any com-
pulsory registration. The decree in this case was assigned in favour of one
of the plaintiffs. The assignee being representative in interest as defined in
Section 15(b) was entitled to seek enforcement of the decree under Order 21,
Rule 16, CPC. The assignment in question was that of a decree for specific
performance of an agreement to sell. The court said that no consideration
was required to be shown for such assignment. 118
Lease or sale in favour of company before incorporation
Where a lease was granted in favour of a company before its incorpora-
tion and the promoters of the company, instead formed only a partnership,
it was held that such partnership firm could not claim any rights or interest
under clause (b) in the property. The lease deed was signed only by the les-
sor. The transaction was ineffective even otherwise.119
The promoters of an unincorporated company purchased certain prop-
erty for the purposes of the company. Clause (b) provides that such transac-
tion can be enforced by the company after incorporation provided that it has
accepted the contract and communicated its acceptance to the other party.
In this case, after its incorporation, the company filed a suit against the
seller for a declaration that the company was the owner of the property. The
court said that this amounted to an acceptance of the contract and commu-
nication to the other party. On the facts, however, the company could not
get the relief of recovery of property because there was undesirable conduct
of frivolous litigation on the part of both parties. The company was allowed
compensation and refund of the earnest money with 12 per cent interest.120.
All buyers or contractees must join
In order to obtain the relief of specific performance, all co-contractees.
must be before the court but all of them need not be on the same side. Others
can be joined as co-defendants. Where there is a single indivisible contract
to convey land to several persons, some of them only cannot seek specific
performance if the others do not want it.121
S. 16. Personal bars to relief.-Specific performance of a contract cannot
be enforced in favour of a person-
(a) who would not be entitled to recover compensation for its breach;
(b) who has become incapable of performing, or violates any essential term
of, the contract that on his part remains to be performed, or acts in fraud
Subbedar, AIR 2002 All 13, refusal of permission by ceiling Authority, repeal of Ceilings

of the contract, or wilfully acts at variance with, or in subversion of, the
relation intended to be established by the contract; or
(c) who fails to aver and prove that he has performed or has always been
ready and willing to perform the essential terms of the contract which
are to be performed by him, other than terms the performance of which
has been prevented or waived by the defendant.
Explanation.-For the purposes of clause (c),-
() where a contract involves the payment of money, it is not essential for
the plaintiff to actually tender to the defendant or to deposit in court any
money except when so directed by the court;
(ii) the plaintiff must aver performance of, or readiness and willingness to
perform, the contract according to its true construction.
Persons not entitled to relief of specific performance
The relief of specific performance cannot be awarded in favour of the
following persons:
1. A person cannot seek specific performance where the circumstances
are such that he would not have been entitled to compensation for
breach of contract.
2. A person who is guilty of any of the following cannot claim specific
performance:
(a) he has become incapable of performing his part of the contract;
(b) he has violated any essential term of the contract that on his part
remained to be performed;
(c) he has acted in fraud of the contract;
(d) he has wilfully acted at variance with or in subversion of the rela-
tion intended to be established by the contract.
3. A person who has failed to aver and prove that he has performed or
has always been ready and willing to perform the essential terms of
the contract which were to be performed by him except those terms
which he has been prevented from performing by the other party or
the performance of which the other party has waived.
Where the contract involves payment of money, it is not essential for the
plaintiff to actually tender to the other party or to deposit in court any
money except when so directed by the court. Performance must be offered
according to the true construction of the contract.
Before acting under Order 8, Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, the
court in a suit for specific performance has to scrutinise the facts set out in
the plaint to find out whether all the requirements, in particular those indi-
cated in Section 16 of the Specific Relief Act regarding readiness and willing-
ness, have been complied with or not.122 There has also to be a finding that
all the requirements of an enforceable agreement are there. The Supreme

Specific performance of contracts 881
Court has observed that decreeing a suit for specific performance only on
the basis of a finding that the agreement was genuine, is not proper. Several
other aspects like readiness and willingness have also to be considered.123
Ready and willing [Cl. (c)]
Explanation II makes it necessary for a party claiming specific perfor-
mance to aver and prove that he has been all the time ready and willing to
perform his part of the contract.124 Continuous readiness and willingness to
perform his part of the contract on the part of the plaintiff is a condition
precedent for the grant of the relief. Where the plaintiff was found to be

sible in evidence of the contract of sale for order of specific performance.

v Brij Pal, (1997) 2 SCC 200: AIR 1996 SC 2510, the fact that the party was present in the
Sub-Registrar's office with necessary funds was held to be a proof of the party's readiness
and willingness. The plea that the vendee did not show readiness and willingness can be
taken by vendor only and not by the subsequent buyer. Jugraj Singh v Labh Singh, (1995)

evant factor, suit within limitation. Specific relief allowed. Dularo Devi v Asturna Devi,

proved, allowed relief. M.K. Makbool Khan v Shamsunisa, AIR 2002 NOC 87 (Kant), the
tenant who purchased the premises was deducting expenditure made on repair and also for
payment of taxes, the court said that this showed that he had no intention to pay the full
agreed price. Specific relief was not allowed to him. Valliamal v Angammal, AIR 2002 Mad
292, the vendee was supposed to pay the price by redeeming the mortgages to which the
property was subject, but he did not do so as a result of which the vendor had to sell some
other property to pay off the bank. This showed that the vendee was not willing to do his
part Ceean International (P) Ltd v Ashok Surana, AIR 2003 Cal 263, the property under
sale was mortgaged to the LIC, the agreement stipulated that the plaintiff was to take the
property in "as it is" state, but he made it clear that he was not going to take the property
until a good and a marketable title was made out. The court said that he could not seek
enforcement. He was not ready and willing to take the property as it was. Time was also of
the essence which the plaintiff did not keep. Dutta Seethamalakshmamma v Yanamadala
Balaramaiah, AIR 2003 AP 430, the vendee made part payment and that too after expiry
of the stipulated period, vendor cancelled the agreement, the vendee kept silent and filed a
suit after a long period. His suit was rejected. He showed no credentials of either bona fides
or willingness. Sardar Joginder Singh v Vasandran Kakani, AIR 2003 NOC 340 (Ori), the
purchaser doubting seller's title, he also admitted that he had no sufficient money with him
on the appointed date to seeking execution of sale deed, not ready and willing. He had to pay
interest on daily basis on default. Interest not paid. Provision showed that time was consid-
ered to be important. Failure to keep time-bound commitments debarred the plaintiff-buyer
from specific relief. N. Satyanarayana v Vedprakash Dusaj, (2003) 3 ALD 884, only small
amount paid, no evidence that the buyer was ready and willing to pay the substantial bal-
ance amount, specific relief not allowed. The agreement was for sale of leasehold interest in
immovable property, price rise in pendente lite period, not relevant to relief. The contract
was cancelled by notice. Suit filed three years after that. Art. 54, Limitation Act applied suit
barred. T. Mohan v Kannammal, (2002) 10 SCC 82, the vendor parted with possession in
favour of the purchaser even before the expiry of the period, the requirement of being ready
and willing lost its significance. The finding of the High Court was held to be justified that
the purchaser had satisfied the legal requirement of being ready and willing.

[S. 16]
dabbling in real estate transactions without means to purchase the property
and failed to pay the consideration money within the time given to him by
the trial court, it was held that he was not ready and willing to perform his
part.125 Where a contract for sale of a house stipulated making of part-pay-
ment of purchase price within a specified period so as to enable the owner
who was residing in the house to purchase a suitable residence by utilising
the amount, it was held that the part-payment must be made within a rea-
sonable time and failure to do so would seriously affect the proposed ven-
dor's right to acquire an accommodation and show that the proposed vendee
was not ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. The court
said that the grant of a decree for specific performance in the circumstances
would amount to an instrument of oppression giving an unfair advantage to
the proposed vendee which the court should take care to avoid. 126
In a suit, for specific performance of a contract for sale of land, the read-
iness and willingness of plaintiff to perform his part of the contract is to be
ascertained from his conduct and attending circumstances. Where the plain-
tiff neither had sufficient funds to pay the consideration amount nor was he
acting promptly within the stipulated time where time was the essence of
the contract, it was held that he was neither ready nor willing to perform his
part of the contract. Hence he was not entitled to a decree for specific per-
formance of the contract,127 The making of a conditional offer for payment
of the stipulated amount does not fulfil the requirement of law contained in
Forms 47 and 48 of Appendix A to the Civil Procedure Code.128 Depositing
of any amount in the court at the appellate stage would not meet the require-
ment of Section 16(c),129 Where the land under sale was mortgaged to the
bank and the buyer had agreed to pay back the loan and redeem the mort-
gage but he did nothing in that direction nor showed any inclination to
do so, rather he was appropriating the usufruct of the land to himself, the
Supreme Court held that he was not ready and willing to perform his part.130
Where the vendee sent a legal notice rescinding the contract and filed a
suit for refund of advance paid and that was decreed by the trial court, his
application for revision and for specific performance was dismissed. The
court said that it would not lie in his mouth to say that he was ready and

Specific performance of contracts 883
willing to go ahead with performance from his side.131 Where the purchaser
clearly averred his readiness and willingness to perform, the court said that
it was not necessary for him to show his possession of money to the court.
The court found that the transferor was trying to scuttle the sale in favour of
the transferee. He executed a sale in favour of his relative for a lesser amount
who knew of the earlier sale. Grant of relief of specific performance to the
first purchaser was held to be proper.132
A person who makes himself a party to an illegal contract cannot enforce
his rights under this section. 133
Where one of the terms of an agreement for sale was that the appellants
would withdraw their suit for specific performance and the suit was not
withdrawn, it was held that the appellants-plaintiffs could not be said to be
ready and willing to perform their part of the agreement. The finding in the
impugned judgment that the condition regarding withdrawal of the suit was
a condition precedent, was also correct. As the appellants did not withdraw
the suit they could not be said to be ready and willing to perform their part
of the agreement. For this reason also the claim for specific performance
could not have been enforced.134
Averment as to readiness and willingness in a plaint has been held to be
sufficient if the plaint, read as a whole, clearly indicates that the plaintiff
was always and is still ready and willing to fulfil his part of the obligations.
Such averment is not a mathematical formula capable of being expressed
only in certain specific words or terms.135 The court said: "An averment of
readiness and willingness in the plaint is not a mathematical formula which
should only be in specific words. If the averments in the plaint as a whole

do clearly indicate the readiness and willingness of the plaintiff to fulfil his
part of the obligations under the contract which is the subject-matter of the
suit, the fact that they are differently worded will not militate against the
readiness and willingness of the plaintiff in a suit for specific performance
of contract for sale.
In the instant case, a perusal of the plaint does clearly indicate the readiness
and willingness of the plaintiff. The only obligation which he had to comply
with was payment of balance of consideration. The appellant-plaintiff had
parted with two-thirds of the consideration at the time of execution of the
agreement for sale. There is no reason why he would not pay the balance
of one-third consideration to have the property conveyed in his favour."136
The judgment of the High Court was set aside and the judgment and
decree of the trial court were restored.
Thus, there can be no straight jacket formula about readiness and will-
ingness. It depends upon overall conduct of the parties prior to and sub-
sequent to filing of the suit. The provision in the agreement was that the
balance amount was to be paid to the IT Authorities. The court said that the
vendor could not insist that it should be paid to him. He could not on that
ground say that the vendee was not ready and willing.137
An agreement between the parties stipulated terms of reconveyance on
payment of loan amount. The plaintiffs sent notices time and again for
execution of sale deed and also deposited money in the court before the
date fixed in the judgment which was passed for specific performance. This
showed their readiness and willingness. Plaintiffs were held entitled to spe-
cific performance,138
of a private company for transfer of shares on the death of a member, suit filed within 10
months of the death of the widowed mother, could not be said to be delayed. Aniglase
Yohannan v Ramlatha, (2005) 7 SCC 534: AIR 2005 SC 3503, where the essential points
contained in the plaint led to an interference of the plaintiff's readiness and willingness, the
Supreme Court held that the High Court rightly concluded that the requirement of S. 16(c)
was satisfied. Subhash Maini v Nathi Ram, AIR 2012 All 67, the court saw averment as to
readiness from the total state of the pleadings. The vendee repeatedly requested the vendor to
take balance money and to get the transfer registered, he appointed a place where he would
come with balance money but vendor did not turn up. The court said that the vendee was
ready and willing and was entitled to specific performance.
136. Deendayal v Harjot Kanwar, AIR 2003 Raj 202, the vendor postponed the purchaser's
request for execution of sale deed by saying that her husband was not well, he filed the suit
just after one month from the date of refusal, the court said that the purchaser was ready
and willing to complete the transaction. The second purchaser was not found to be in a state
of bona fides. Emani Krishna Rao v Vijaya Chitra Films, AIR 2003 NOC 142 (AP): 2003

other facts and circumstances. Dharamveer v Suresh Chandra Bhardwaj, AIR 2016 All 48,

Specific performance of contracts 885.
Where the plaintiff showed that he was ready and willing to pay the pur-
chase price and continued to be so, the failure to plead that he had money in
the bank and had not withdrawn it, was immaterial because this was a mat-
ter of evidence and had not to be pleaded.139 Possession of adequate means
is not a material factor where the vendee has not taken any steps to dis-
charge his part of the obligation as provided in the agreement. Prohibition
of Section 16(c) gets attracted in such a case. The court said that if there
was undue delay or indifference on his part, his willingness deserves to be
doubted. The refusal to grant relief was proper.140
When the purchaser had not sent any communication to the vendor regard-
ing his readiness and willingness, had paid only an insignificant amount as
advance, had not obtained permission from Ceiling Authorities, had taken
no steps towards the valuation of the superstructure on the land as required
under the sale agreement, neither led evidence nor entered the witness box
in support of his willingness, the Supreme Court held that the High Court
had rightly upheld the dismissal of his suit for specific performance. 141 A
plea was set up that two applicable statutes prohibited the transfer in ques-
tion. This plea was not raised before the trial court or Appellate Court.
No evidence was produced on the point. The Acts only carried restrictions
which were capable of being cleared. There were concurrent findings of fact
in favour of the plaintiff. The court said that they were not liable to be inter-
fered with. The decree passed for specific performance could not be faulted.
The court added than the fact that there was a considerable increase in the
price of the suit land, even if true, could not be a ground for denying specific
performance. 142
Where the buyer pleaded that he was ready and willing but did not pay
because the seller did not get the site measured. The court found that the
buyer had already paid a part of the consideration in different spells in four
years which would not have been done if measuring was an essential con-
dition. He had takenover possession yet did not pay the balance and insist
upon registration. Hence he was not ready and willing.143

[S. 16]
The plaintiff (buyer) undertook the responsibility of getting the premises
vacated from the unauthorised occupier. He sought specific performance
without fulfilling such undertaking. The court said that how the plaintiff
could say that he was ready and willing to perform his part of the contract.144
The purchaser was required under the agreement to get permission for
transfer of the surplus within a specified time which he could not manage.
The seller offered to return him his earnest money but he refused to take it.
Without disclosing this fact, he sought recovery of the earnest money with
24 per cent interest. Looking at his conduct, the court did not allow him the
relief of specific performance. 145
The mere making of a plea in the plaint is not sufficient. There must be
proof with satisfactory evidence of the fact at all the material times of the
case. The court said that the conduct of the plaintiff in issuing notice after
a period of three years was sufficient in itself to disentitle the plaintiff from
claiming the discretionary relief.146
Where the acknowledgement receipt of payment of earnest money showed
overwriting and banker's cheque for final payment was cancelled, it showed
no proper conduct. Specific enforcement was not allowed even though the
man showed enough money in his bank account.147
Unregistered sale agreement
An unregistered sale agreement was tendered in evidence. This was held
to be not an evidence of a completed sale, but as proof of an agreement of
he could not claim specific relief or refund of earnest money.

because the majority shareholder did not consent to it and he was not willing to provide
funds for the purpose. The company therefore, had no basis to say that it was ready and will-
ing. The purchaser had also obtained at his expense no objection certificates. But there was
neither any application for the same, nor any effort in that direction. Specific performance,
not allowed.

sale. It was admissible in evidence as an oral agreement of sale. The pur-
chaser was entitled to relief of specific performance. 148
Amendment of plaint
The amendment was sought by the plaintiff vendee to incorporate the
legal plea of readiness and willingness to perform his part of the contract.
The plea happened to be omitted in the plaint. The court said that the plea
was not new to the defendant and there was no change in the cause of action.
The amendment was accordingly allowed."
Default of first buyer available as defence to subsequent buyer
The fact that the buyer defaulted with payment and was, therefore, not
ready and willing to perform, which is a defence available to the seller, would
also be available to the second buyer. An appeal being a continuation of the
proceedings the subsequent purchaser was allowed to take that defence.150
Necessary or proper party
It has been held that persons who are likely to secure interest in the suit
property after decision in the pending suit, are neither a proper nor neces-
sary parties.151
Jurisdiction
The declaratory relief entails determination of rights to or interests in
immovable property. Such relief can be granted only by court within whose
local jurisdiction the property is situate. The plaintiff in this case had
sought declaratory relief in respect of property when he had only a chance
or hope of getting title to the property. His case was rejected. He had an
equally efficacious remedy of applying to the Probate Court under Part VII,
Chapter XXIII of the Indian Succession Act, 1925.152
Decree, ex p. In a suit for specific performance by the purchaser, the
seller (defendant) did not file his written statement. A decree was passed as
prayed for under Order 7, Rule 10, CPC. The decree, though ex parte, was
held to be valid for all purposes. The parties allowed the decree to become
final. The seller could not turn around and challenge the decree as unexecut-
able. The court passing a decree in a specific enforcement suit retains control
over the decree in the process of its execution. The purchaser had applied for
execution after six and a half years. During this period prices of land shot
up. The purchaser did not pay the balance consideration amount because

the transferor had not fulfilled his obligations. Neither party approached the
court for appropriate directions. Both parties were at fault. The court has
to balance equities in such a situation. The purchaser had to pay increased
land value.153
Selling or letting property without title [S. 17]
A person who contracts to sell or let out immovable property with knowl-
edge that he has no right to do so cannot ask for specific enforcement in his
favour. This will be so even if he honestly believed that he had the title but
is not able to give at the time of performance a title free from reasonable
doubt. The same principle is applicable to sale or letting of movable property
also. Section 17 is as follows:
S. 17. Contract to sell or let property by one who has no title, not spe-
cifically enforceable.-(1) A contract to sell or let any immovable property
cannot be specifically enforced in favour of a vendor or lessor-
(a) who, knowing himself not to have any title to the property, has con-
tracted to sell or let the property;
(b) who, though he entered into the contract believing that he had a good
title to the property, cannot at the time fixed by the parties or by the
court for the completion of the sale or letting, give the purchaser or les-
see a title free from reasonable doubt.
(2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply, as far as may be, to con-
tracts for the sale or hire of movable property.
Where performance not possible without variation [S. 18]
Where the contract is in writing and, as against the party seeking specific
performance, the other party sets up the defence of variation, then in the
following cases specific performance cannot be awarded:
(a) where by reason of fraud, mistake of fact or misrepresentation, the
written contract is different from what the parties agreed to, or does
not contain all the terms on the basis of which they entered into the
contract;
(b) where the object of the parties was to produce a certain legal result
which the contract, as framed, is not calculated to produce;
(c) where the parties have varied the terms of the contract subsequent to
its execution.
The provisions of Section 18 are as follows:
S. 18. Non-enforcement except with variation.-Where a plaintiff seeks
specific performance of a contract in writing, to which the defendant sets up a
variation, the plaintiff cannot obtain the performance sought, with the variation
so set up, in the following cases, namely-

Specific performance of contracts 889
(a) where by fraud, mistake of fact or misrepresentation, the written con-
tract of which performance is sought is in its terms or effect different
from what the parties agreed to, or does not contain all the terms agreed
to between the parties on the basis of which the defendant entered into
the contract;
(b) where the object of the parties was to produce a certain legal result
which the contract as framed is not calculated to produce;
(c) where the parties have, subsequently to the execution of the contract,
varied its terms.
Where a part of the property was inalienable on account of being excess
land under a ceiling legislation and another part was inalienable because
of acquisition by the State, it was held that the buyer could not seek spe-
cific performance of such a contract in respect of the remaining portion of
the property only. The court said that such a situation was not covered by
Section 18,154
The word "court" includes an "arbitrator". Only because Section 20 con-
fers discretion on courts to grant specific performance it does not mean that
the parties cannot agree that the discretion may be exercised by a forum of
their choice.155
S. 19. Relief against parties and persons claiming under them by
subsequent title.-Except as otherwise provided by this Chapter, specific
performance of a contract may be enforced against-
(a) either party thereto;
(b) any other person claiming under him by a title arising subsequently to
the contract, except a transferee for value who has paid his money in
good faith and without notice of the original contract;
(c) any person claiming under a title which, though prior to the contract and
known to the plaintiff, might have been displaced by the defendant;
(d) when a company has entered into a contract and subsequently becomes
amalgamated with another company, the new company which arises out
of the amalgamation;
(e) when the promoters of a company have, before its incorporation, entered
into a contract for the purpose of the company and such contract is war-
ranted by the terms of the incorporation, the company:
Provided that the company has accepted the contract and communicated
such acceptance to the other party to the contract.
Relief against parties, legal representatives or subsequent transferee
Section 19 provides that the relief of specific performance can be obtained.

2. against any other person who claims title arising subsequently to
the contract, but not against a transferee for value who paid for the
property in good faith and without notice of the original contract;
3. against any person claiming under a prior title which was known
to the plaintiff, where the title was such that it could have been dis-
placed by the defendant;
4. against a new company which arises out of the amalgamation of the
transferor company;
5. against a company whose promoters entered into a contract for the
purposes of the company before its incorporation, provided that
the contract is warranted by the terms of the incorporation of the
company.
Relief against legal representative [S. 19]
Section 19(b) provides that relief can be claimed against any person who
claims title arising subsequently to the contract. This would not be so where
the legal representative is not competent under the applicable personal law.
A vendor died after entering into the agreement. After his death, his widow
took further advance from the vendee. According to the Muslim law appli-
cable to the vendor, the widow (mother) is not the legal guardian of her
minor children. The advance taken by her for alienation of the property of
her minor children did not bind them. The court said that she could not be
compelled to execute the sale on the basis of the advance taken by her.156
Parties claiming title under original owner
Subsequent bona fide buyer [S. 19(b)]
Under Section 19(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, a specific perfor-
mance of a contract can be enforced not only against either party thereto but
against any other person claiming under him by a title arising subsequently
to the contract, except a transferee for value who has paid his money in
good faith and without notice of original contract. Further, Section 91 of
the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 provides that where a person acquires property
with notice that another person has entered into an existing contract affect-
ing that property, of which a specific performance could be enforced, the
former must hold the property for the benefit of the latter to the extent nec-
essary to give effect to the contract. In a case defendants 4 to 7 had notice of
the contract between the plaintiff and Defendant 1 and they were not bona
fide purchasers, therefore, the High Court was quite justified in passing a
decree against them as well.157

Specific performance of contracts 891
In the case of a bona fide purchaser in good faith for value without notice
of the original contract between persons in actual possession and owner
of the property, it was held by the Supreme Court that in order to estab-
lish his bona fides such purchaser must show that he had made appropriate
enquiries.158 The court said: "Section 19(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963
protects the bona fide purchaser in good faith for value without notice of
the original contract. This protection is in the nature of an exception to the
general rule. Hence, the onus of proof of good faith is on the purchaser who
takes the plea that he is an innocent purchaser. Good faith is a question of
fact to be considered and decided on the facts of each case. Section 52 of the
Penal Code emphasises due care and attention in relation to good faith. In
the General Clauses Act emphasis is laid on honesty."
"A transferee for value, who has paid his money in good faith and with-
out notice of the original contract, is excluded from the purview of clause
(b) of Section 19 of the Specific Relief Act providing for specific performance
against "any other person claiming under him by a title arising subsequently
to the contract". In order to fall within the excluded class, a transferee must
show that:
(a) he has purchased for value the property (which is the subject-matter
of the suit for specific performance of the contract);
(b) he has paid his money to the vendor in good faith; and
(c) he had no notice of the earlier contract for sale (specific performance
of which is sought to be enforced against him).
The said provision is based on the principle of English law which fixes pri-
ority between a legal right and an equitable right. This principle is embodied
in Section 19(b) of the Specific Relief Act.159

owner executed a sale deed in favour of another person, who was not aware of the pen-
dency of the suit. He was protected by S. 19. Plaintiff not allowed any relief. Ashan Devi v
Phulwasi Devi, (2003) 12 SCC 219: AIR 2004 SC 511, objection allowed to execution of ex
parte decree by a third party purchasers who claimed that he was in possession of the vacant
land under a registered sale deed; their names were also mutated in Municipal records, they
would be dispossessed by delivery of possession to the decree holder. The fact that they were
physically there when the property was handed over to the decree holder was held to be
immaterial. Ranganatha Gounder v Sahadeva Gounder, AIR 2004 Mad 520, a subsequent
buyer to whom the property was handed over under registered sale deed and who was not
aware of the earlier agreement acquired good title. The buyer under the earlier agreement
did not pay the balance money for long and did not object to the subsequent sale except after
2½ years. Padmakumari v Dasayyan, (2015) 8 SCC 695: (2015) 4 SCC (Civ) 428, there was
failure on the part of the buyer under an agreement of sale to pay the agreed amount of the
balance price within the agreed time, hence he could not claim specific enforcement. In the

892 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 19]
Where these requirements were not satisfied by the subsequent buyer, the
court said that specific performance could be granted against the subsequent
transferee. He could be directed to reconvey the property to the original
buyer or the sale to the subsequent buyer may be set aside, the property
revested in the original seller who may then transfer-it to the first buyer. The
second buyer may also be ordered to pay compensation to the first buyer.160
"Notice" may be (i) actual, (ii) constructive, or (ii) imputed. Under
Section 3, Transfer of Property Act and Explanation II thereof, a statutory
presumption of "notice" arises against any person who acquires any immov-
able property or any share or interest therein of the title, if any, of the person
who is for the time being in actual possession thereof.
"The principle of constructive notice of any title which a tenant in actual
possession may have, was laid down by Lord Eldon in Daniels v Davison."
"In the present case, the purchasers have acquired a legal right under the
sale deed. The right of the tenant under it, if it is true and valid, though car-
lier in time, is only an equitable right and it does not affect the purchasers
if they are bona fide purchasers for valuable consideration without notice of
that equitable right."141
Where the first purchaser was a tenant in possession, but did not comply
with the agreement for one year and nine months, his contention that the
second purchaser, in order to establish his bona fides, should have enquired
from him as to the nature of his possession, the court said that it was not
necessary to make any inquiry from the person in possession.162
Where there are unnatural circumstances which may put the purchaser
on his guard, an inquiry from the person actually in possession may become
necessary in order for the second buyer to establish his bona fides. In this
case the price of the land was less than 2/3rd of the price for which the land
had been agreed to be sold earlier. The second purchaser did not seem to
have any intention of making enquiry about the encumbrance. The matter
of the land must have become a talk of the village because the first pur-
chaser was put into possession and subsequently dispossessed. The second
purchaser could not have been ignorant about all that. The burden of proof
meantime, the property was purchased by a bona fide buyer without notice of the existing
sale agreement which was held to be effective and binding. S. Prasanna v Shany Jalal, AIR
2015 Kar 172, during the subsistence of earlier agreement of sale to plaintiff, the property
was sold to another buyer, burden lay on such buyer to prove that he was a bona fide buyer
for value in good faith without notice of the earlier agreement, burden is not on the plaintiff.

same property was then transferred to another party for a higher price. The subsequent

was on him to show that he was a bona fide purchaser for value and without
notice.163
A person claiming a title adverse to the title of the vendor does not fall
in any of the categories of Section 19. The Supreme Court also added that
the section is exhaustive of the persons against whom and by whom specific
performance can be allowed.164
Transfer executed by only some of owners
The suit property was jointly owned by respondents. The sale deed was
executed by some of them without authorisation from others. The transac-
tion being improper it could not be set right by ratification by others. The
execution of ratification by those joint owners who were not parties to the
sale deed had no legal value. The sale deed in favour of the subsequent trans-
feree was not saved by Section 19(b),165
Acquiring title during pendency of suit
Where a person purchasers a property which had already been sold ear-
lier and a suit about that sale is pending, he does not have the right to say
that he is a bona fide buyer for value. Such transfer is hit by the principle of
lis pendense.166
Discretion and powers of court [S. 20]
S. 20. Discretion as to decreeing specific performance.-(1) The jurisdic-
tion to decree specific performance is discretionary, and the court is not bound
to grant such relief merely because it is lawful to do so; but the discretion of the
court is not arbitrary but sound and reasonable, guided by judicial principles
and capable of correction by a court of appeal.
(2) The following are cases in which the court may properly exercise discre-
tion not to decree specific performance-
(a) where the terms of the contract or the conduct of the parties at the time
of entering into the contract or the other circumstances under which the
contract was entered into are such that the contract, though not voida-
ble, gives the plaintiff an unfair advantage over the defendant; or
(b) where the performance of the contract would involve some hardship on
the defendant which he did not foresee, whereas its non-performance
would involve no such hardship on the plaintiff;
(c) where the defendant entered into the contract under circumstances
which though not rendering the contract voidable, makes it inequitable
to enforce specific performance.

contract is onerous to the defendant or improvident in its nature, shall not be

deemed to constitute an unfair advantage within the meaning of clause (a) or
hardship within the meaning of clause (b).
Explanation 2.-The question whether the performance of a contract would
involve hardship on the defendant within the meaning of clause (b) shall, except
in cases where the hardship has resulted from any act of the plaintiff, subse-
quent to the contract, be determined with reference to the circumstances exist-
ing at the time of the contract.
(3) The court may properly exercise discretion to decree specific performance
in any case where the plaintiff has done substantial acts or suffered losses in
consequences of a contract capable of specific performance.
(4) The court shall not refuse to any party specific performance of a contract
merely on the ground that the contract is not enforceable at the instance of the
other party.
Discretion
Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act further lists certain circumstances in
which the court may at its discretion refuse specific enforcement. The section
opens with the remark that the jurisdiction to decree specific performance is
discretionary and the court is not bound to give such relief merely because
it is lawful to do so. The section, however, immediately adds that such dis-
cretion shall not be arbitrarily exercised. It has to be exercised on sound and
reasonable basis. Its exercise shall be guided by judicial principles and shall
be open to correction by a court of appeal.167 A person seeking equitable
relief should come with clean hands. Where the plaintiff's case was based
on certain false and incorrect facts, the relief of specific performance was
not granted to him.168 Specific recovery of property was granted where the
buyer was all the time ready and willing to perform his part of the contract
and had filed a suit for specific performance and yet the property was sold to
another person who was not a bona fide buyer.19 Where the vendor alleged
that the land was mortgaged to a bank and was, therefore, not transferable,
but there was a concurrent finding of the courts below that the mortgage
stood discharged on repayment of the loan, the bar to transfer ended, the
court held that the purchaser was entitled to seek specific performance of the
agreement with him.170
Where the owner of the property in question agreed to sell it subject to
approval under an applicable ceiling legislation but the same was rejected and
the authorities permitted transfer in favour of a co-operative society, it was
167. Kallathil Sreedharan v Kamath Pandyala Prasanna, (1996) 6 SCC 218, impecuniosity of

held that the society having had no notice of the earlier transfer, it obtained
a good title in good faith for a valuable consideration. The first buyer was
not entitled to any relief except that of refund of advance amount,171
The Supreme Court has restated the factors which have to be kept in
mind in exercising the power of discretion:172
1. Whether the plaintiff was ready and willing to perform his part of
the contract in terms of Section 16;
2. Whether it was a case for exercise of discretion by the court for
decreeing specific performance under Section 16;
3. Whether there were laches on the part of the plaintiff in approaching
the court. 173
In some cases it will be substantive question of law as to whether discre-
tion is to be exercised or not. The grant of relief is discretionary and not
arbitrary. The trial court had exercised its discretion. The appellate court
should not exercise discretion against grant of specific performance on
extraneous considerations or sympathetic consideration.175
No discretion was exercised in favour of a person to whom lease of two
properties was promised and of which possession having been given of one,
he made illegal reconstitution and, therefore, possession of the other was
not given. In such circumstances also there was no question of awarding
him any compensation.1% Discretion was not exercised in favour of a person
who instead of performing the contract was setting up the counter claim
that the property had already been gifted to her and the gift deed should be
produced. There was no mention of such gift deed in the contract of sale.177
A person who becomes entitled to specific performance of his right under
an agreement also becomes entitled to a decree of permanent injunction
to restrain his vendors from in any manner dealing with selling, pledging,
alienating or transferring or creating third party interest in the suit property
except in favour of the vendee in perpetuity."

Buyer with notice of previous sale
[S. 20]
A sale agreement was made with the plaintiff for discharging family debts.
Possession was handed over on the date of the agreement. Subsequent to this
a sale deed was executed in favour of a third party in respect of the same
property. The latter was made aware of the first agreement. The court held
that it could not be said that the third party acted in good faith. The plaintiff
also produced the mortgage deed and the fact of payment for redemption of
the mortgage was endorsed on it. The third party did not produce any such
discharged mortgage bond. The court accordingly allowed the plaintiff to
enforce the agreement against the third party buyer also.179
"Granting of specific performance is an equitable relief, though the same
is now governed by the statutory provisions of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.
These equitable principles are incorporated in Section 20 of the Act. While
granting a decree for specific performance, these salutary guidelines shall
be in the forefront of the mind of the court. The trial court, which had the
added advantage of recording the evidence and seeing the demeanour of
the witnesses, considered the relevant facts and reached a conclusion. The
appellate court should not have reversed that decision disregarding these
facts and the appellate court seriously flawed in its decision. Therefore, it is
held that the respondent is not entitled to a decree of specific performance
of the contract." 180
Discretion should be exercised in accordance with justice, equity, good
conscience and fairness to both the parties. Where in suit for specific per-
formance filed by the respondent in 1970, alternative relief of Rs 12,000 as
damages was also claimed, and the defendant-appellant was then prepared
to pay Rs 10 lakhs as alternative relief, it was held that the decree for specific
performance at this distance of time would be unrealistic and unfair. Hence,
an alternative relief of payment of Rs 10 lakhs was ordered.

Specific performance of contracts
897
Where the subsequent purchaser did not make enquiries at the office of
the sub-registrar so as to find out whether the property had already been
transferred to another person, the court said that it could be concluded that
the subsequent purchaser had knowledge of the first sale. They could not be
termed as bona fide buyers. No discretion could be exercised in their favour.13
Sub-section (2) then enumerates situations in which the court can prop-
erly at its discretion refuse to order specific performance.
1. Unfair contracts
The court may refuse specific performance where a contract gives an
unfair advantage to the plaintiff over the defendant. The unfairness of the
contract may appear from the terms of the contract, from the conduct of the
parties at the time of entering into the contract, or other surrounding circum-
stances. It is not necessary that the contract should be voidable. It is enough
if it is exploitative. An ordinary example would be a case where a signature
is obtained under a state of utter surprise or drunkenness. Where a person
contracted to purchase a leasehold estate, the seller suppressing information
that the landlord had served notice for repair of a dilapidated portion, spe-
cific performance was denied to the seller although the suppression was not
sufficient in itself to allow rescission to the buyer. Inadequacy of consider-
ation may not be sufficient in itself unless it is shocking and it appears that
the defendant has taken advantage of his superior bargaining position.185
The conduct of the person claiming specific relief also has an important
bearing upon the discretion of the court. Specific relief has been refused on
this ground to persons who induced others to enter into contracts with them
by holding out oral assurances which they did not fulfil though such assur-
ances may not be expressed in the contract. A person purchased another
man's right to certain property but the sale could not be completed because
of the death of the seller before the execution of the sale deed. Subsequently
186
treated time to be an essential factor, he also suffered no loss because there was no price rise,
the seller allowed to enforce the sale against the buyer.

CTC 814, the official liquidator notified the sale of the company's property as per directions
of the court on "as is, where is, what is" basis. The auction purchaser had all the time to see
the property and examine documents connected with it. But he did not do so. Applied for
setting aside of the purchase because OL had not disclosed things like overhead high tension
wires in a portion of the property and a TV room in a corner. The court said that any one
could have noticed these things on a mere visit to the sight.

[S. 20]
the purchaser acquiesced in the widow of the seller disposing of the same
property to another person. Subsequently still, the original purchaser dis-
posed of his rights under the contract to another person who instituted the
present proceedings to specifically recover the property. The Supreme Court
did not favour him with a decree of specific performance. The original buyer
had lost or waived his rights by virtue of his acquiescence. The transferee
of his rights had no better rights than the letter's rights. Thus he was only
entitled to recover the advance-money.187
A provision in a sale agreement for refund of the entire advance money is
a normal feature in every agreement of sale. Such a clause cannot give unfair
advantage to purchasers,18
The terms of the contract in question gave an unfair advantage to the
plaintiff purchaser. The amount of earnest money received at the time of
agreement was differently stated in the agreement and receipt. The defend-
ants took the plea that they only took a loan of Rs 85,000 and mortgaged
their land as security and were tricked into putting their thumb impression
on the purported agreement of sale. It was held to be proper that relief of
specific performance was refused.189
Contingent contracts. In an agreement for sale of land, the condition
was that the sale deed would be executed after the seller obtained permis-
sion for use of the land as village land. It was held that the contract was not
contingent. It was specifically enforceable. The suit filed within three years
after obtaining permission was not time-barred.150
187. Parakunnan Veetill Joseph's Son Mathew v Nedumbara Kuruvila's Son, 1987 Supp SCC
340: AIR 1987 SC 2328. The old Act contained the following illustrations on this point:
(1) A, a tenant for life of certain property, assigns his interest therein to B. C contracts
to buy, and B contracts to sell, that interest. Before the contract is completed, A receives
a mortal injury from the effects of which he dies the day after the contract is executed. If
B and C were equally ignorant or equally aware of the fact, B is entitled to specific per-
formance of the contract. If B knew the fact, and C did not, specific performance of the
contract should be refused to B.
(2) A contracts to sell to B the interest of C in certain stock-in-trade. It is stipulated that
the sale shall stand good, even though it should turn out that C's interest is worth nothing.
In fact, the value of C's interest depends on the result of certain partnership accounts, on
which he is heavily in debt to his partners. This indebtedness is known to A, but not to B.
Specific performance of the contract should be refused to A.
(3) A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, certain land. To protect the land from
floods, it is necessary for its owner to maintain an expensive embankment. B does not
know this circumstances, and A conceals it from him. Specific performance of the contract
should be refused to A.
(4) A's property is put up to auction. B requests C, A's attorney, to bid for him. C does
this inadvertently and in good faith. The persons present, seeing the vendor's attorney bid-
ding, think that he is a mere puffer and cease to compete. The lot is knocked down to B at
a low price. Specific performance of the contract should be refused to B.

Specific performance of contracts
899
The seller cannot sue for the price unless he obtains the necessary per-
missions first.191
According to a decision of the Supreme Court subsequent events can also
be taken into account in exercising discretion under the section.192 The court
said:
"Jurisdiction of courts under Section 20 is discretionary. Subsequent
events can be taken into consideration to decide to exercise or not to exer-
cise jurisdiction. Hence, where the agreement to sell land stipulated that
it was subject to grant of permission by the competent authority under the
Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 and the authority refused
to grant such permission, it was held, that such order of the competent
authority should have been necessarily taken into consideration to decide
as to whether to exercise the discretionary jurisdiction to direct specific
performance of the agreement or not. Till the order of the competent
authority stood, decree for specific performance of the contract could
not be granted. Where the discretionary jurisdiction was not exercised in
favour of the plaintiff by the trial court and the appellate court (Single
Judge, High Court in this case), the Division Bench of the High Court
could not, in exercise of its Letters Patent jurisdiction, normally interfere
with such decisions of the courts below.
Contracts Incomplete.-Where in an agreement for sale of flats, there
was no consensus between the parties as to the price payable, the court
said specific performance could not be ordered. The builder was directed
to refund the amount received from the purchaser and thereafter he was to
vacate the flats. The court also said that the discretion in the grant of spe-
cific performance has to be exercised on sound judicial principles and not
arbitrarily. The plaintiff must prove beyond doubt the existence of a valid
and enforceable contract.193

[S. 20]
The mortgagor of property executed an unregistered document to sell
the mortgaged property to the mortgagee as and when he might decide to
do so at the prevailing market rate. But he sold the property to his nephew.
The mortgagee filed the suit for specific performance. He was not able to
place on record any material to show that the cousin was aware of the earlier
agreement. The court accordingly held that the suit could not be decreed.
The agreement was an inchoate agreement and also vague. The mortgagee
was trying to secure an undue advantage whereas the cousin was a bona
fide buyer for consideration.194 In an auction sale of the borrower company's
assets, the highest bidder deposited the earnest amount but not 25 per cent
of the bid money within the stipulated period. Thus there was no concluded
contract. The highest bidder was held to be not entitled to the decree of spe-
cific enforcement of the agreement of sale in his favour. 195
The area of land agreed to be sold was not clear and final. The plaintiff
could not be said to have done substantial acts or suffered losses due to
expenditure in construction, etc. The court said that the contract was not
capable of supporting an order of specific enforcement. On facts, it would
be equitable, fair and proper to direct the seller to pay back the amount of
earnest money with interest at 18 per cent p.a.19
196
Transfer by unauthorised partners.-A partnership firm comprised of
14-15 partners. The prospective purchaser of a property of the firm entered
into an oral agreement with only two partners. Neither they were so author-
ised, nor it was a part of their implied authority. The agreement being not
enforceable against the firm, the court did not allow any relief under the
Specific Relief Act, 197
Transfer by unauthorised person.-The transferor was only half owner
of the property. The other half belonged to his wife. Yet he purported to
transfer the whole. The court held that the wife, being non-consenting, was
not bound by the purported sale. There could be no decree of specific per-
formance against her.198
Oral agreement.-A suit was filed for specific performance of an oral
agreement to purchase the premises in question. The court said that the
plaintiff would be entitled to an interim relief only upon showing his readi-
ness and willingness to perform his part of the contract. Under Section 49 of
the Registration Act, a suit for specific performance can be filed on the basis
of an unregistered document and also upon an oral agreement.199

Specific performance of contracts 901
A plea for possession in part performance of an oral agreement of sale
cannot be raised by the vendee in a suit for specific performance.200
In the case of an oral agreement, heavy burden lies on the plaintiff to
prove that there was consensus ad idem between the parties. An oral agree-
ment cannot be presumed unless there is evidence of the date on which the
parties had come to the concluded oral agreement. There should be no find-
ing of this kind on the basis of conjectures and assumptions.201
Memorandum of understandings
A memorandum of understanding to purchase immovable properties on
its basis was held to be neither equivalent to registered agreement, nor spe-
cific about any properties and therefore could not support the plea of specific
performance or an injunction.202
2. Hardship
Specific enforcement is refused where it would cause considerable hard-
ship to the defendant which he did not foresee, whereas non-performance
would cause no such hardship to the plaintiff. Specific enforcement was not
granted where the buyer of land for farming purposes found it to be land-
locked from all sides without any right of way;203 where the cost of perfor-
mance to the defendant was wholly out of proportion to the benefits to the
plaintiff;204 and where it involved litigation with uncertain results to enable
the defendant to perform.205
Ordinarily, the fact that the performance would cause severe hardship to
the defendant has to be considered on the basis of facts existing at the time
of the contract. And where the plaintiff has caused the hardship by his subse-
quent conduct, that would also be taken into account. The explanation gives
effect to this principle. Where the grant of specific relief would have resulted
in a special hardship to the defendants who had already built costly struc-
tures on the land in question, it was held by the Supreme Court that Section
20(2)(b) should be invoked even though the plaintiffs were ready and willing
to perform the contract and it were the defendants who committed breaches
of the contract. Accordingly, instead of executing the sale deed in favour
of the plaintiffs, the defendants were directed to pay to the plaintiffs the
specified present value of the land in instalments. 206 The jurisdiction under

902 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 20]
Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 to decree specific performance is
discretionary and the court is not bound to grant such relief merely because
it is lawful to do so; the discretion of the court is not arbitrary but sound
and reasonable, guided by judicial principles and capable of correction by
a court of appeal. Performance of the contract involving some hardship on
the defendant which he did not foresee, while non-performance involving
no such hardship, on the plaintiff, is one of the circumstances in which the
court may properly exercise discretion not to decree specific performance.
The doctrine of comparative hardship has been statutorily recognized in
India. However, mere inadequacy of consideration or the mere fact that the
contract is onerous to the defendant or improvident in its nature shall not
constitute an unfair advantage to the plaintiff over the defendant or unfore-
seeable hardship on the defendant. 207 The fact that the house under sale was
the available residence with the seller and without it he would be rendered
homeless was held to be not a hardship because he was aware of this fact
when he made the agreement of sale. 208
Where the purchasers had purchased the property some 25 years before
the case reached the Supreme Court and had spent huge sums of money on
improvements, it was held that decreeing the suit in favour of the opposite
party would have meant hardship to the purchasers. Therefore, compen-
sation was awarded in favour of the opposite party. 209 The plaintiff kept
postponing registration. It was held that this conduct caused hardship to
the defendant-owner inasmuch as he could not purchase another property
out of the consideration money which would have come into his hand if the
agreement had been performed. Discretion could not be exercised in favour
of such plaintiff.210
A man sold the whole of the property whereas half of it belonged to his
wife who did not sign. Both of them died. The transferee sought specific
recovery of half portion of the man's share. His 10 daughters who were liv-
ing in the single dwelling house, resisted the suit on the ground of hardship.
The Supreme Court allowed recovery of half share because that was not
likely to cause any hardship. 211
Price Escalation.-"Where the court is considering whether or not to
grant a decree for specific performance for the first time, the rise in the price
of the land agreed to be conveyed may be a relevant factor in denying the relief
of specific performance. But in this case, the decree for specific performance

Specific performance of contracts 903
has already been passed by the trial court and affirmed by the first appellate
court. The only question before the Supreme Court was whether the High
Court in second appeal was correct in reversing the decree. Consequently
the principle enunciated in K.S. Vidyanadam will not apply."212
In another case, the Supreme Court observed:
The grant of a decree for specific performance of contract is not auto-
matic and is one of the discretions of the court and the court has to consider
whether it will be fair, just and equitable. The court is guided by principles
of justice, equity and good conscience.
The court should meticulously consider all facts and circumstances of the
case and motive behind the litigation should also be considered.
"In view of the clear finding of the High Court that the appellant tried
to wriggle out of the contract between the parties because of escalation
in prices of real estate properties, the respondent is held entitled to get a
decree as he has not taken any undue or unfair advantage over the appel-
lant. It will be inequitable and unjust at this point of time to deny the decree
to the respondent after two courts below have decided in favour of the
respondent."213

Specific relief not refused because there was a possibility of renewal of lease and revalidation
of building plan. The court said that there was no general rule that the plaintiff must neces-
sarily be denied the benefit of price increase. While balancing equities, the court must bear
in mind as to who was the defaulting party. R. Aravindhan v K.R.S. Janakiraman, AIR 2016
NOC 240 (Mad), seller trying to get out of the contract only because of price rise, the court
in its discretion allowed specific performance.
The old Act contained the following illustrations on this point:
(1) A is entitled to some land under his father's will on condition that if he sells it within
twenty-five years, half the purchase-money shall go to B. A, forgetting the condition, con-
tracts, before the expiration of twenty-five years, to sell the land to C. Here the enforcement
of the contract would operate so harshly on A, that the Court will not compel its perfor-
mance in favour of C.
(2) A and B, trustees, join their beneficiary, C, in a contract to sell the trust estate to D,
and personally agree to exonerate the estate from heavy incumbrances to which it is subject.
The purchase-money is not merely enough to discharge those incumbrances, though, at the
date of the contract, the vendors believed it to be sufficient. Specific performance of the
contract should be refused to D. [Based on Wedgwood v Adams, (1843) 6 Beav 600: 63 RR
195: 49 ER 958.]
(3) A, the owner of an estate, contracts to sell it to B, and stipulates that he, A, shall not
be obliged to define its boundary. The estate really comprises a valuable property, not known
to either to be part of it. Specific performance of the contract should be refused to B unless
he waives his claim to the unknown property. [Based on Baxendale v Seal, (1855) 19 Beav
601: 105 RR 261.]
(4) A contracts with B to sell him certain land, and to make a road to it from a certain
railway station. It is found afterwards that A cannot make the road without exposing himself

[S. 20]
Subsequent rise in price is not to be treated as a hardship to entail refusal
of decree for specific performance.214
The vendor was willing to complete the transaction as early as possible.
But there was delay of nearly two years on the part of the purchaser in
obtaining the requisite permission of the Collector which was necessary for
completion of the transaction. There was a substantial rise in the market
prices of property including that of the property in question. Even if time
was not of the essence, parties are supposed to perform their obligations
within reasonable time when the market has become price sensitive. The
court said that in such a case it would be inequitable to give the relief of
specific performance to the purchaser. But he was held entitled to a money
decree for repayment of consideration paid by him to the transferor along-
with interest at 18 per cent p.a. from the date of payment.215
A suit for specific performance of sale of an urban property was filed
after the lapse of a long period. The court said that it could refuse to grant
the relief of specific performance as the value of such property escalates very
fast.216
Thus, the relief of specific performance cannot be denied on the ground
of efflux of time and escalation of price of the property in the meantime. In
such cases, the court can grant relief under revision of the price according to
the then market value.217
3. Inequitable, unconscionable
Where the circumstances of a contract are such that, though they do not
make the contract voidable, they definitely render specific enforcement ineq-
uitable, the contract is one-sided, an imposition by one upon the other, the
parties are not on equal footing, are some of the circumstances which the
to litigation. Specific performance of the part of the contract relating to the road should be
refused to B, even though it may be held that he is entitled to specific performance of the rest
with compensation for loss of the road. [Based on Peacock v Penson, (1848) 11 Beav 355:
50 ER 854.]
(5) A, a lessee of mines, contracts with B, his lessor, that any time during the continuance
of the lease, B may give notice of his desire to take the machinery and plant used in and
about the mines, and that he shall have the articles specified in his notice delivered to him at
a valuation on the expiry of the lease. Such a contract might be most injurious to the lessee's
business, and specific performance of it should be refused to B. [Based on Talbot v Ford,
(1842) 13 Sim 173: 60 RR 314.]
(6) A contracts to buy certain land from B. The contract is silent as to access to the land.
No right of way to it can be shown to exist. Specific performance of the contract should be
refused to B. [Based on Denne v Light, (1857) 8 DM&G 774: 44 ER 588.]
(7) A contracts with B to buy from B's manufactory and not elsewhere all the goods of
a certain class used by A in his trade. The Court cannot compel B to supply the goods but
if he does not supply them, A may be ruined, unless he is allowed to buy them elsewhere.
Specific performance of the contract should be refused to B. [Based on Hills v Croll, (1845)
2 Ph 60: 78 RR 23.]

Specific performance of contracts 905
court keeps in mind in considering whether an order of specific enforcement
would give rise to inequitable results. One of the illustrations appended to
Section 22 of the repealed Act of 1877 affords an example. A contracts with
B to buy from B's manufactory and not elsewhere all the goods of a certain
class used by him in his trade. The court cannot compel B to supply the
goods but if he does not supply them, A may be ruined, unless he is allowed
to buy them elsewhere. B cannot specifically enforce the contract against
A.218
"The jurisdiction to decree specific relief is discretionary and the court
can consider various circumstances to decide whether such relief is to be
granted. Merely because it is lawful to grant specific relief, the court need.
not grant the order for specific relief; but this discretion shall not be exer-
cised in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner. Certain circumstances have
been mentioned in Section 20(2) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 as to under
what circumstances the court shall exercise such discretion. If under the
terms of the contract the plaintiff gets an unfair advantage over the defend-
ant, the court may not exercise its discretion in favour of the plaintiff. So
also, specific relief may not be granted if the defendant would be put to
undue hardship which he did not foresee at the time of agreement. If it is
inequitable to grant specific relief, then also the court would desist from
granting a decree to the plaintiff."
From the terms and conditions adumbrated in the second agreement it is
clear that the respondent had been trying to take unfair advantage of the
appellant and that the circumstances in which this agreement was executed
was within a short period of termination of the first contract by the respond-
ent, make it highly probable that the appellant might not have readily agreed
to this contract. There are other circumstances also to hold that the plain-
tiff-respondent had not approached the court with clean hands. It is clear
that she had been trying to get possession of the house even before execution
of the sale deed, for which she had apparently colluded with the tenant.
Moreover, the appellant in this case was clearly in impecunious circum-
stances and so many loans were outstanding against him. He had executed
the first agreement to pay off these debts and in order to raise some funds.
From the first agreement it is clear that the parties were not very serious
about the sale of the house. The fact that after a few months the respondent
resiled from the agreement and sought repayment of the money also proves
this fact. The appellant had voluntarily retired from service. Admittedly,
he had no other house to stay in after retirement. The respondent-plaintiff
had tried to take unfair advantage of the defendant and throughout the
course of the transaction she had not been fair. The trial court, which had
the added advantage of recording the evidence and seeing the demeanour of
the witnesses, considered the relevant facts and reached a conclusion. The

[S. 20]
appellate court should not have reversed that decision disregarding these
facts and the appellate court seriously flawed in its decision. Therefore, it is
held that the respondent is not entitled to a decree of specific performance
of the contract."219
Where the true object of an agreement (construction of houses under
Section 21 of the Urban Land Ceiling Act for weaker sections of society
in this case) could not be fulfilled (as a result of changes in the master plan
in this case), it would be inequitable to enforce specific performance of the
agreement. Harm to the reputation of the plaintiff was irrelevant. Specific
relief was not allowed where the transferor was not capable of dealing with
the property because of the doctrine of lis pendens, the same being already
the subject-matter of dispute in a court case.220
"Grant of decree for specific performance is a matter of discretion under
Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. The court is not bound to grant
such relief merely because it is lawful to do so. Discretion is to be exercised
on sound and settled judicial principles. One of the grounds on which the
court may decline to decree specific performance is where it would be ineq-
uitable to enforce specific performance. The present is clearly such a case.
It would be wholly inequitable to enforce specific performance for (i) resi-
dential houses for weaker sections of society cannot be constructed in view
of the existing master plan and, thus, no benefit can be given to the said
section of society; (ii) in any case, it is extremely difficult, if not impossi-
ble, to continuously supervise and monitor the construction and thereafter
allotment of such houses; (iii) the decree is likely to result in an uncalled-for
bonanza to the plaintiff; (iv) patent illegality of the order of the Competent
Authority dated 20-6-1998; (v) absence of law or any authority to determine
excess vacant land after construction of 4356 dwelling units; and (vi) agree-
ment does not contemplate the transfer of nearly 600 acres of land in favour
of the plaintiff for construction of 4356 units for which land required is
about 65 acres. The object of the Act was to prevent concentration of urban
land in the hands of a few and also to prevent speculation and profiteering
therein. The object of Section 21 is to benefit weaker sections of society
and not the owners. If none of these objects can be achieved, which is the

3 SCC 342: AIR 2005 SC 1940, the owner contracted to sell the property to the plaintiff,
the owner did not execute the sale deed with the plaintiff and instead attempted to sell the
property to the second buyer. The latter filed a collusive suit on the seller. The suit resulted
in a compromise decree under which sale deed was executed in favour of second buyer. The
Supreme Court set aside the order of specific performance in favour of the second buyer and
awarded it to the first buyer. The court said that there was no such equity left in the conduct
of the second buyer as the suit filed by him was preconceived and prearranged with the seller
in order to cheat the first buyer.

factual position, it would be inequitable to still maintain decree for specific
performance."221
Plaintiff to come with clean hands.-Where a party instituted different
proceedings in different forums within a short span of time, it was held that
such a party who abuses the process of courts could not be said to be pos-
sessed of clean hands and is, therefore, not entitled to equitable relief under
the Act.222
Where the value of the property was much more than was mentioned in
the agreement to sell, the plaintiff was in possession as a tenant and stopped
paying rent since the date of the agreement, the court said that the mere
fact of the agreement did not confer ownership on the plaintiff. He was not
entitled to the equitable relief of specific performance.223 Where the claimant
was not able to prove that the sale deed was validly executed by the vendor
and the vendor proved that his signature was taken on a blank paper, and
on this basis as combined with other defects in the document, the court said
that the refusal of the relief of specific performance was justified.
The right to specific performance of a buyer of property was not defeated
by the fact that he added the names of two independent persons as marginal
witnesses to the sale deed, 224
The relief is discretionary. The bona fides of the person claiming this relief
should be above-board. Lack of bona fides in any of the pleadings, be it as to
the contents of the agreement, factum of payment, etc., disentitles the party
from claiming relief even if the transaction is within the framework of law
in other respects. The purchaser in this case paid a small amount and took
possession at the time of the agreement. He did not pay anything further up
to 8 years and claimed specific performance only by way of counter-claim to
the owner's suit for recovering his possession. He did not even pay the court
fee for his counter-claim saying that he did not have the means to pay. This
showed that he had no means to pay the balance price. His conduct was not
fair. He was not entitled to the equitable relief. 225

Agreement opposed to public policy.-The court may not exercise dis-
cretion in favour of the claimant where the agreement is opposed to public
policy. On the facts of the case, however, the court found that there was
nothing against public policy. There was readiness and willingness. The
power of attorney acting for the company was doing so within its limits.
The company had clearly resolved to sell its property, 226
Object forbidden. An allotted plot was agreed to be transferred after
receipt of a particular sum. The plot in question was not transferable for a
period of 10 years. The agreement to sell was held to be not an enforceable
contract. The decree passed by the High Court with the knowledge of that
fact was set aside. 227
4. Substantial performance by one side
Where a party to a contract has already substantially performed his part
of it, it would be highly inequitable to him if the other is not compellable to
perform his part. Sub-section (3) accordingly provides that the court may
properly exercise the discretion to decree specific performance in any case
where the plaintiff has done substantial acts or suffered losses in conse-
quence of a contract capable of specific performance. The old Act contained
the following illustration on this point:
A sells land to a railway company, who contract to execute certain
works for his convenience. The company take the land and use it for their
railway. Specific performance of the contract to execute the works should
be decreed in favour of A.228
sale consideration was given to the vendor at the time of the agreement itself, possession of
property was also given, seller's plea that he should be allowed to return the money because
of the price rise was not accepted. Puvvada Chiranjeeva Rao v Busi Koteswara Rao, AIR

provisions. It being a mala fide act, deprived the vendee of the right to seek specific perfor-
mance. Chodi Mahalakshmi v Koppadda Sathiraju, AIR 2011 AP 125, the vendee falsely

plaintiff suppressed the material fact that the defendant vendor had returned the earnest

off certain debts owed by the seller to the buyer. The plaintiff buyer cleared off the debts.
Evidence showed that the agreement was intended to be acted upon. He was allowed to spe-
cifically recover the property. But no damages were allowed to him for delay in the execution
of the sale deed in his favour. Ranjana Nagpal v Devi Ram, AIR 2002 HP 166, delay of 19
years was caused due to inaction on the part of the seller. The seller was not to be permitted
to take advantage of his own inaction. Relief of specific recovery was granted though there
had been considerable rise in the prices of real estates. There was a concurrent finding of fact
by the lower courts that the plaintiff was all the time ready and willing to perform his part.
No interference in such finding.

Specific performance of contracts 909
Where the father borrowed amount from the plaintiff to meet a family
necessity and agreed to sell the land to the plaintiff on his failure to pay back
the amount, and all this was proved by clear evidence, specific enforcement
against the father and one son who was living in the family was allowed.
One son had already gone out of the family and, therefore, no relief could
be allowed against him. 229
5. Mutuality of remedy (ready and willing)
Sub-section (4) declares that the court shall not refuse to any party spe-
cific performance of a contract merely on the ground that the contract is not
enforceable at the instance of the other party. It had been a common belief
in this field "that the court will not order specific performance at the suit of
one party unless it could do so at the suit of the other". The Privy Council
had laid down in Mir Sarwarjan v Fakhruddin Mahomed Chowdhury,230
that a contract of purchase of land on behalf of a minor was not specif-
ically enforceable at the instance of the minor because it could not have
been enforced against him. Their Lordships said that as the minor was not
bound by the contract, there was no mutuality and that consequently the
minor could not obtain specific enforcement of the contract. But beginning
with Srikakulam Subrahmanyam v Kurra Subba Rao,231 the Privy Council
allowed specific enforcement even in cases where there was no mutual equal-
ity. Thus the doctrine of mutuality ceased to have any force. In English law
also the requirement of mutuality has been subjected to such a large number
of exceptions that it has been observed in CHITTY: "the number and impor-
tance of these exceptions has given rise to a doubt as to the existence of the
requirement of mutuality."212 The provisions of Section 12 are sufficient in
themselves to rid the law of the requirement of mutuality. That section has
been further supported by this sub-section which quite clearly says that the
court should not decline specific relief only because of lack of mutuality.
It is also necessary that the plaintiff should have either done his part or
should be ready and willing to do his part. In the case of a transfer of prop-
erty, the Supreme Court observed that a transferee of immovable property.
can claim specific performance of the contract only by showing his perfor-
mance or willingness to perform his part of the contract.233 Accordingly,
where the court in granting relief under Section 16 paid no attention to

instead of paying the full amount within six months as contemplated in the agreement, the
buyer insisted upon delivery of possession proportionate to the amount paid, the court said

[S. 20]
the side of the seller and confined its findings to the purchaser's side, this
was described by the Supreme Court as a serious error.24 In this case the
plaintiff said that he had deposited the requisite amount in a bank account
and though he did not produce the passbook of his own accord no adverse
inference could be drawn against him because neither the defendant nor the
court had called upon him to produce the passbook. The concurrent find-
ing of the trial court and High Court was described by the Supreme Court
as contrary to the evidence and palpably unreasonable. The court did not
hesitate to set aside the finding and decreed the plaintiff's suit for specific
performance. The court said that the only inference that could reasonably be
drawn was that the defendant wanted to defeat the claim of the plaintiff and
wanted to wriggle out of the obligation undertaken by him. In another case,
the High Court had refused to grant the relief of specific performance on the
ground that it would be unjust to do so in view of passage of time resulting
in escalation of prices and the Supreme Court did not agree with this view
of the matter. The court went by the facts that the whole of the price had
been paid long ago and the premises were in the possession of the purchaser
in part-performance of the agreement. The case was remanded to the High
Court for decision on merits.235
Where the buyer proved his being ready and willing throughout and only
the seller was sheltering himself behind the provision in the agreement that
in case the seller failed to perform his part, he would pay double the amount
of earnest money, it was held that such clause could not lead to the inference
that the buyer could not seek specific performance of the agreement to sell.
Damages could not be treated as adequate compensation. The court passed
decree of specific performance. 236
Specific performance was not decreed where the parties were under a
mutual mistake as to the identity of the land agreed to be sold. The pur-
chaser did not cooperate with the transferor in sorting out the area to be
transferred. The transferor had done some construction work on the land.
He offered the other area to the purchaser which the latter did not accept.
The purchaser could not get any order of directing the transferor to transfer
the land to him.27 Specific relief was also not granted where the transferee
claimed that he had paid half the amount by cheque and the other half by
cash, and the amount being huge in cash also, he was not able to offer any
proof of the fact of presence of so much cash with him. 238

Specific performance of contracts 911
Protecting interest of vendor
In respect of an agreement to purchase immovable property, it was proved
that the purchaser had been in possession for several years and had also
been enjoying the usufruct of the property. The court accordingly ordered
maintenance of status quo; but directed the purchaser to deposit in the trial
court a fixed amount annually in order to protect the interest of the ven-
dor. The suit may then be finally disposed of in favour of the transferee.239
A lady buyer was not able to prove that she had been all along ready and
willing to perform her side of the bargain. But her family members had
been living in the property for more than 30 years in their own right. They
could not therefore be forced to vacate the property. In the interest of jus-
tice, the court directed her to pay Rs 60,000 to the plaintiff inclusive of
advance paid by her.240
Limitation
The contract for transfer of property stipulated a time-period for payment
of full consideration and registration of sale deed. The transferee made only
part payment and that too after expiry of the stipulated date, but the trans-
feror accepted it without stipulating any further date. The court said that
limitation would start from the date of refusal by the vendor in response to
the notice by the vendee of specific enforcement and not from the date stip-
ulated in the agreement.241
Though the prescribed period of limitation is three years, the court said
that courts have power to dismiss a suit even before three years if it is found
that in the interregnum between the date of agreement and the date of suit,
certain events, such as steep increase in prices of property, etc. have taken
place. The time stated in the agreement for completion also assumes its
importance. A very short period for completion was stipulated. In such a
case the party cannot be permitted to wait for three years and file the suit at
leisure. The court could ignore the fact that property was agreed to be sold
because of accute necessity, 243
The question as to bar of limitation is not a pure question of law. It can-
not be decided as a preliminary issue. 243

912 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
Limitation for execution of decree
[S. 20]
In a compromise decree execution proceedings were not filed in the same
court which passed the decree. As per the terms of the agreement the decree
was executable within one month. The decree holder sought execution after
more than four years. The judgment debtor objected because of limitation.
It was held that the proceedings were liable to be dismissed because the exe-
cuting court had no power to extend time for execution of the compromise
decree.244
Pre-emptive orders under tax measures
Where there is a pre-emptive order under a taxing measure about some
property, it has the effect of vesting the property in the Government. Such
an order does not become set aside by the filing of a civil suit. Relief about
the sale of such property cannot be granted automatically. So long as the
order remains in force, no title can be conveyed. The Act applies to transfers
by acts of parties and not to vesting of rights under statutory operations.245
Amendment of plaint
In a suit for declaration of title and injunction, there was omission to
claim relief of specific performance of agreement to sell. The court said
that it amounted to relinquishment of that part of the claim. Subsequent
inclusion of the plea of specific performance by way of amendment after
eleven years of the suit was not allowed, being barred by limitation under
Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 246
Nature of jurisdiction under the Act
The nature of jurisdiction under the Act has been held to be legal and
equitable. This observation of the Supreme Court occurred in a case in
which a person entered into a contract of sale of land. His sons, who were
already major, opposed the suit for specific performance saying that they
were joint-owners and they were neither consulted nor even informed of
the transaction. But the vendee stated before the court orally that one of
the sons had participated in the negotiations. The Supreme Court did not
believe the sons to say that they had no knowledge of things when negoti-
ations for sale and execution of documents took place, they being not chil-
dren at the time. There was no equity in their favour because even after the
suit they did not approach the Authorities under the U.P. Consolidation of
Holdings Act, 1953 for having their names recorded as joint owners. Such
Authorities had exclusive jurisdiction for that purpose.247

Specific performance of contracts 913.
No relief was sought for declaration of title to property or for possession
of property. The suit was for specific performance simpliciter and not suit for
land. It was held that the suit was triable by the Calcutta High Court even
it the premises agreed to be assigned by way of lease were situated outside
the territorial limit of the court. The return of the plaint was not proper.248
The court does not lose jurisdiction after grant of decree of specific per-
formance in view of Section 28(1) of the Act. The seller applied for rescission
of the decree. The decree holder deposited the balance amount in the bank
to show his bona fides as a purchaser. The seller applied for extension of
time about his application for rescission. Extension was granted to him.
Such enlargement of time was held to be proper.249
Impleadment (addition of party)
In a suit for specific performance, a third party-stranger asserted that she
was in possession of the disputed property. The court said that such rights
could not be adjudicated in a suit for specific performance. A stranger is nei-
ther necessary nor a proper party for effective adjudication of such suit.250
Power of court to award compensation [S. 21]
S. 21. Power to award compensation in certain cases.-(1) In a suit for
specific performance of a contract, the plaintiff may also claim compensation
for its breach, either in addition to, or in substitution of, such performance.
(2) If, in any such suit, the court decides that specific performance ought not
to be granted, but that there is a contract between the parties which has been
broken by the defendant, and that the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for
that breach, it shall award him such compensation accordingly.
(3) If, in any such suit, the court decides that specific performance ought
to be granted, but that it is not sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case, and
that some compensation for breach of the contract should also be made to the
plaintiff, it shall award him such compensation accordingly.
(4) In determining the amount of any compensation awarded under this sec-
tion, the court shall be guided by the principles specified in Section 73 of the
Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872).
(5) No compensation shall be awarded under this section unless the plaintiff
has claimed such compensation in his plaint:
Provided that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such compensation in
the plaint, the court shall, at any stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend the
plaint on such terms as may be just, for including a claim for such compensation.
Explanation. The circumstance that the contract has become incapable of
specific performance does not preclude the court from exercising the jurisdic-
tion conferred by this section.

CASE PILOT
[S. 21]
Compensation in addition to or substitution of specific performance
Every party seeking the relief of specific performance is allowed by this
Section to claim compensation for the breach of the contract. Such relief
may be claimed either in addition to specific performance or in substitu-
tion of it. If the court is of opinion that specific performance ought not to
be ordered, the court may award compensation if a valid contract and its
breach are established. 251 Should the court find that specific performance
by itself would not be sufficient relief, it may, in addition, award compen-
sation also to meet the ends of justice. Compensation would be assessed
in accordance with the principles stated in Section 73 of the Contract Act.
Even where the contract has become incapable of specific enforcement, the
court can exercise the power under this section to award compensation. In
a case where reconveyance was refused, the court on ordering the same,
observed as follows: "When the plaintiff by his option has made specific
performance impossible, Section 21 does not entitle him to seek damages.
Where the contract, for no fault of the plaintiff, becomes impossible of per-
formance Section 21 enables the award of compensation in lieu and substi-
tution of specific performance." The court continued: "So far as the proviso
to sub-section (5) of Section 21 is concerned, two positions must be kept
clearly distinguished. If the amendment relates to the relief of compensa-
tion in lieu of or in addition to specific performance where the plaintiff has
not abandoned his relief of specific performance the Court will allow the
amendment at any stage of the proceeding. That is a claim for compensation
falling under Section 21 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and the amendment
is one under the proviso to sub-section (5). But different and less liberal
standards apply if what is sought by the amendment is the conversion of a
suit for specific performance into one for damages for breach of contract
in which case Section 73 of the Contract Act is invoked. This amendment
is under the discipline of Rule 17, Order 6, CPC. The fact that sub-sec-
tion (4), in turn, invokes Section 73 of the Contract Act for the principles
of quantification and assessment of compensation does not obliterate this
distinction."252
The measure of compensation is by the standards of Section 73 of the
Indian Contract Act. Dealing with the facts, the court said: "In the present
case assuming that the respondent had not actually sought the amendment
251. Jai Narain Parasrampuria v Pushpa Devi Saraf, (2006) 7 SCC 756, promoters contracted
to buy property for the company before incorporation. The company after incorporation
adopted the contract and informed the vendor. But afterwards, vendors changed their mind
and refused to sell. This provoked frivolous litigation between both parties. Either party
being equally guilty of misconduct, the court refused to grant specific performance to the
company to which it was otherwise entitled. Instead compensation of Rs 50 lakhs and refund
of earnest money with 12 per cent interest was allowed.
252. Harjeet Singh v Amrik Singh, (2005) 12 SCC 270, no compensation was allowed to a person
who had not been ready and willing to do his part. Rizvi Builders v Lamarck R.C. Clemente,
AIR 2015 Bom 192, no compensation where the contract was not yet formed and no loss was
shown to have been caused.

Specific performance of contracts 915
of plaint for compensation in lieu of specific performance, the amendment
was hereby permitted so that complete justice could be done. The quan-
tum of compensation is ascertainable with reference to the determination
of the market value in the land acquisition proceedings. The compensation
awarded may safely be taken to be the measure of damages, subject, of
course, to the deduction therefrom of money value of the services, time and
energy expended by the appellant in pursuing the claims of compensation
and the expenditure incurred by him in the litigation culminating in the
award. Accordingly, there will be a decree awarding to the respondent com-
pensation in lieu and substitution of one for specific performance which, but
for the acquisition, the respondent would have been entitled to the quantum
and the measure of the compensation being the entire amount of compen-
sation determined for the acquisition of the suit properties together with all
the solatium, accrued interest and all other payments under the law author-
ising the acquisition, less a sum of Rs 1,50,000 which was to go to the appel-
lant towards his services, time and amounts spent in pursuing the claims for
compensation as well as the consideration stipulated for reconveyance."253
It is necessary that the plaintiff should have asked for the relief of com-
pensation. The court may, however, allow the plaint to be amended at any
stage to enable the plaintiff to claim compensation,254
Where, for example, a buyer of land is allowed to recover it specifically
and it takes him about a year to get the relief, the court may award compen-
sation for the loss of time. The following four illustrations appeared under
the earlier 1877 Act:
(1) A contracts to sell a hundred maunds of rice to B. B brings a suit to compel A to perform
the contract or to pay compensation. The Court is of opinion that A has made a valid
contract and has broken it, without excuse, to the injury of B, but that specific perfor-
mance is not the proper remedy. It shall award to B such compensation as it deems just.
(2) A contracts with B to sell him a house for Rs 1000, the price to be paid and the possession
given on the 1st January, 1877. A fails to perform his part of the contract, and B brings
his suit for specific performance and compensation, which is decided in his favour on
the 1st January, 1878. The decree may, besides ordering specific performance, award to
B compensation for the loss which he has sustained by A's refusal.
(3) A, a purchaser, sues B, his vendor, for specific performance of a contract for the sale of a
patent. Before the hearing of the suit the patent expires. The court may award A com-
pensation for the non-performance of the contract, and may, if necessary, amend the
plaint for that purpose.
(4) A sues for the specific performance of a resolution passed by the Directors of a pub-
lic company, under which he was entitled to have certain shares allotted to him, and
for compensation for the non-performance of the resolution. All the shares had been

erty had already been sold to the plaintiff and he did so mala fide with a view to defeat the
plaintiff's title.

[S. 21]
allotted before the institution of the suit. The court may, under this section, award A
compensation for the non-performance. [Based on Ferguson v Wilson.]
Order for delivery of goods
The court can issue a direction for delivery of goods despite there being
an alternative plea for damages. On the facts of this particular case, 256
court said:
"In case of non-delivery of goods, where there was an alternative plea
for damages, court may not direct delivery of the goods (Units of UTI)
after their purchase from open market along with benefit of rights issue.
Instead the court can compensate the plaintiff with return of the money
paid by him with interest and award of reasonable damages."
An agreement was entered into for sale of units of UTI by the appellant
to the respondent. Payments by way of consideration for purchase of the
units were made by the respondent to the appellant and banker's receipt
was issued by the appellant in respect of the said transaction. But units were
not delivered by the appellant. By a letter dated 1 July 1992 the respond-
ent claimed compensation for breach of contract treating the same to have
taken place on 30 May 1992 and on that basis it claimed difference in price
between the rate that was paid and the rate of UTI as on 30 May 1992. Since
no amount was paid by the appellant, a suit was filed by the respondent
claiming delivery of the units in respect of which payments had been made.
An alternative prayer was also made for payment of a certain amount as
damages plus further interest at 17.5 per cent p.a. on the said amount till the
date of payment. The Special Court constituted under the Special Court Act
of 1992 granted relief of specific performance requiring the appellant to buy
the units for which payment had been made and also to purchase and sell
to the respondent the units representing the right issue which the respond-
ent was deprived of availing because of the non-delivery of the units. Costs
of Rs 27,87,000 were also awarded. Disposing of the appeal, the Supreme
Court said: "The appellant admits that the respondent, to whom delivery of
the units was not made, would be entitled to the refund of the money plus
damages thereon calculated in accordance with the principles contained in
Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Considering the fact that there
was an alternative plea for damages, on the facts of the present case a decree
for specific performance in the manner in which it was passed was probably
not appropriate especially when the respondent could be compensated with
the return of money and award of reasonable damages."

Specific performance of contracts 917
[Ss. 24 & 22]
Loss of right to compensation
The right to sue for compensation is lost where the suit for specific perfor-
mance is dismissed in whole or in part, but other rights, if any, will survive.
This is the effect of Section 24.
S. 24. Bar of suit for compensation for breach after dismissal of suif for
specific performance.-The dismissal of a suit for specific performance of a
contract or part thereof shall bar the plaintiff's right to sue for compensation for
the breach of such contract or part, as the case may be, but shall not bar his right
to sue for any other relief to which he may be entitled, by reason of such breach.
Relief of possession, partition, etc. [S. 22]
Where the relief sought is for the transfer of immovable property, the
court may also grant, if so prayed by the party, relief by way of possession,
partition and separate possession. The court may also grant any other relief,
such as refund of earnest money or deposit paid in case specific performance
is refused. Where the party has not made any such prayer in the original
plaint, the court may permit amendment of the plaint.257
S. 22. Power to grant relief for possession, partition, refund of earnest
money, etc. (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), any person suing for the specific
performance of a contract for the transfer of immovable property may, in an
appropriate case, ask for-
(a) possession, or partition and separate possession, of the property, in
addition to such performance; or
(b) any other relief to which he may be entitled, including the refund of any
earnest money or deposit paid or [made by] him, in case his claim for
specific performance is refused.
(2) No relief under clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall be granted by
the court unless it has been specifically claimed:
Provided that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such relief in the plaint,
the court shall, at any stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on
such terms as may be just for including a claim for such relief.
(3) The power of the court to grant relief under clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall
be without prejudice to its powers to award compensation under Section 21.
Relief for possession has to be pleaded (alternative relief)
Relief of possession can be granted only if it is specifically prayed for.258
Sub-section (1) of Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 is an enabling
provision. A plaintiff in a suit for specific performance may ask for further
257. The section is an enabling provision, Adcon Electronics (P) Ltd v Daulat, (2001) 7 SCC 698:
AIR 2001 SC 3712.
258. Lavinder Kumar Sharma v Pramod Kumar, AIR 2011 P&H 30, the alternative relief of
possession, partition, refund of earnest money, etc. can be granted only when specifically
pleaded.

Page 1061
https://t.me/LawCollegeNotes_Stuffs
918 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 22]
reliefs mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) thereof. Clause (a) contains reliefs of
possession and partition and separate possession of the property, in addition
to specific performance. The mandate of sub-section (2) of Section 22 is that
no relief under clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) shall be granted by the
court unless it has been specifically claimed. Thus it follows that no court
can grant the relief of possession of land or other immovable property, sub-
ject-matter of the agreement for sale in regard to which specific performance
is claimed, unless the possession of the immovable property is specifically
prayed for.
Where an execution of sale deed was made in favour of the plaintiff by
process of the court itself, it was held that the onus upon the court became
further extended to ensure delivery of possession through execution pro-
ceedings for the purpose of satisfying the decree. Even if there was no prayer
for delivery of possession in terms of Section 22, the decree holder was enti-
tled to be in possession of the demised property.25
259
In the instant case the suit is for specific performance of the agreement for
sale of the suit property wherein relief of delivery of the suit property was
not specifically claimed, as such it could not be treated as a "suit for land". It
was not possible to accept the contention that in the present case the suit was
for acquisition of title to the land and is a "suit for land". In its true sense,
a suit simpliciter for specific performance of a contract for sale of land is a
suit for enforcement of the terms of a contract. The title to the land as such
is not the subject-matter of the suit.260
Refusal of relief
Where the property in question was transferred by a co-sharer whose
share was very small and it was not possible to direct specific performance
of the entire property as it could not be divided into small shares, it was held
that exercise of discretion by the trial court in not decreeing the suit even
to the extent of the selling co-sharer's share was proper and was not to be
interfered with,261
In such cases generally the alternative relief of refund of money paid to
the seller is allowed with interest. 262
Alternative relief
In a claim for specific performance of an agreement to sell, the defendant
proved that he never intended to sell the property in question because the
259. Sunita Devi v Dinbandhu Shah, AIR 2010 Jhar 151; Krishnamurthy Gounder v
Venkatakrishnan, AIR 2012 Mad 105, the decree was silent about delivery of possession.
But once specific performance is allowed, possession should be granted, whether pleaded
or not.

v Devaki Amma Balambika Devi, (2005) 8 SCC 486, the relief for partition or exclusive
possession can be granted in addition to the main relief of specific performance.

Specific performance of contracts 919
intention was to provide the property as a security for a loan. The court said
that it could grant the alternative relief of repayment of the loan amount to
the plaintiff lender. Section 22 enables the court to take into its fold the relief
of return of the amount lent. 263
Amendment of plaint
An amendment of plaint was sought for including prayer for return of
advance money with interest. The court said that the amendment was cov-
ered by Section 22(2) and not Order 6, Rule 17, CPC. The plaintiff was
entitled to amend his pleadings at any stage of the proceedings.264
The plaintiff failed to pray for relief of possession, nor any decree for
possession was passed. The court said that the plaintiff could be allowed
to amend his plaint for including prayer of possession at any stage includ-
ing execution. This was necessary to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and
advance the cause of justice. 265
Liquidation of damages no bar [S. 23]
Where the parties to the contract have fixed the amount of compensation
which would be payable in the event of default, this would not constitute
any bar to the relief of specific performance. The court may examine the cir-
cumstances of the case. If they show that compensation was fixed in order to
secure performance and not to allow the defaulting party an option to pay
compensation, the court may allow specific performance. Where, on facts,
the plaintiff-respondent was found ready, willing and able to perform his
part of the agreement for the sale of orchard, it was held that such plaintiff
was entitled to specific performance despite the existence of a penalty clause
providing for payment of Rs 10,000 by the party violating the terms and
conditions of agreement. The Division Bench of the High Court rightly dis-
missed the appeal of the appellant-Defendant 1 vendor. 266 The court cannot,
however, in the same decree order the payment of the fixed amount also.
The Act of 1877 carried this power under Section 20 and had the follow-
ing illustration:
A contracts to grant B an under-lease of property held by A under C, and that he will
apply to C for a licence necessary to the validity of the under-lease, and that, if the licence is
not granted, A will pay B Rs 10,000. A refuses to apply for the licence and offers to pay B the
Rs 10,000. B is nevertheless entitled to have the contract specifically enforced if C consents.
to give the licence.
Earnest money
An agreement for sale of property did not contain any stipulation for
forfeiture of earnest money or advance made towards sale consideration.

920 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 27]
The vender did nothing further which could be regarded as steps towards
performance. He was ordered to refund the amount with 6 per cent simple
interest from date of suit. 27
Alternative relief provided in contract
Where the agreement (for sale of agricultural land) itself providing for
contingencies of (i) seller refusing to sell and (ii) purchaser refusing to buy
by stipulating the return of earnest money plus another sum in either cir-
cumstance, it was held, that on facts, there was no obligation on the seller
to complete the sale transaction and the contract could not be specifically
enforced. The High Court erred in upholding the decree of specific perfor-
mance awarded by the first appellate court. 268
Even otherwise the plea of alternative relief of refund of earnest money
and damages cannot by itself be a bar to claim the decree of specific
performance,209
Enforcement of arbitral awards and direction to execute settlements
Section 25 of the Act provides that the provisions of this chapter (i.e.
Chapter II) shall apply to awards to which the Arbitration Act, 1940 does
not apply and to directions in a will or codicil to execute particular settle-
ment. (Now the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996)
RESCISSION OF CONTRACTS
The rescission of contract necessarily constitutes a bar to its performance
by either of the party to it (Fry: Chapter XXIV). The grounds for bringing
a suit for rescission have been given in Sections 27 and 28 of the Specific
Relief Act, 1963:
S. 27. When rescission may be adjudged or refused.-(1) Any person
interested in a contract may sue to have it rescinded, and such rescission may
be adjudged by the court in any of the following cases, namely:-
(a) where the contract is voidable or terminable by the plaintiff.
(b) where the contract is unlawful for causes not apparent on its face and
the defendant is more to blame than the plaintiff.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the court may
refuse to rescind the contract-
(a) where the plaintiff has expressly or impliedly ratified the contract; or
(b) where, owing to the change of circumstances which have taken place
since the making of the contract (not being due to any act of the defend-
ant himself), the parties cannot be substantially restored to the position
in which they stood when the contract was made; or

[S. 27]
Rescission of contracts 921
(c) where third parties have, during the subsistence of the contract, acquired
rights in good faith without notice and for value; or
(d) where only a part of the contract is sought to be rescinded and such part
is not severable from the rest of the contract.
Explanation.-In this section "contract", in relation to the territories to
which the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, does not extend, means a contract in
writing.2%
When rescission available
The relief of rescission comes handy to a person who has become the
victim of an imposition by means of a contract. This burden of a contract
has been imposed upon him by means of a fraud or illegality or something
equivalent which makes the contract either void or voidable. He may ask
the court that the contract should be declared as not binding upon him.
This is rescission, that is, getting rid of a contract. Section 27 accordingly
provides that the court may allow the relief of rescission in the following
cases:
(1) Where the contract is voidable or terminable by the plaintiff;
(2) where the contract is unlawful for causes not apparent on its face
and the defendant is more to blame.
Loss of right of rescission
The relief of rescission is available subject to very important limits. This is
so because every voidable contract is valid as long as it is not avoided. If the
relief of rescission is not quickly obtained, circumstances may so seriously
change that it may then not be desirable to put an end to the contract. Sub-
section (2) accordingly provides that the right of rescission is not available
in the following cases:
1. Affirmation
The plaintiff loses the right of rescission when on becoming aware of
his right he chooses to ratify the contract. Once the contract is affirmed it
cannot afterwards be avoided. Affirmation may be express or implied. An
express affirmation takes place when the right to rescind is openly waived.
An implied affirmation takes place when the party having the right to
rescind is instead enjoying the benefits of the contract.
270. This section corresponds with S. 35 of the repealed Specific Relief Act, 1877. That section
carried the following illustrations:
Illustration as to sub-section (1)(a).-A sells a field to B. There is a right of way over the
field of which A has direct personal knowledge, but which he conceals from B. B is entitled
to have the contract rescinded.
Illustration as to sub-section (1)(b).-A, an attorney, induces his client, B, a Hindu
widow, to transfer property to him for the purpose of defrauding B's creditors. Here the
parties are not equally in fault, and B is entitled to have the instrument of transfer rescinded.

2. Where restitution not possible
[S. 28]
The right of rescission is also lost where the position of the parties has
been altered to such an extent that they cannot be put back to their original
status. Where one party has already resold the goods or consumed them,
restoration of the status quo ante becomes impossible.
The transferee obtained possession of the property in part performance
of the contract. The court said that possession over property was to be pro-
tected even if the period of limitation for bringing a suit for specific per-
formance had expired. The transferee was required to fulfil the necessary
conditions in order to defend and protect his possession. The Limitation Act
does not extinguish defences. It only bars the remedy. 271
3. Intervention of third parties
Where the rights of third parties have intervened, rescission cannot be
allowed to the prejudice of such rights. Where, for example, a person has
obtained goods by fraud and, before the seller is able to catch him, he trans-
fers the goods to a bona fide buyer, the deceived seller would not now be
allowed to get rid of the sale on account of the fraud.
4. Severance
Rescission is not allowed where the plaintiff is seeking rescission of only
a part of the contract and that part is not severable from the rest of the
contract.
S. 28. Rescission in certain circumstances of contracts for the sale or
lease of immovable property, the specific performance of which has been
decreed. (1) Where in any suit a decree for specific performance of a contract
for the sale or lease of immovable property has been made and purchaser or
lessee does not, within the period allowed by the decree or such further period
as the court may allow, pay the purchase money or other sum which the court
has ordered him to pay, the vendor or lessor may apply in the same suit in which
the decree is made, to have the contract rescinded and on such application the
court may, by order, rescind the contract, either so far as regards the party in
default or altogether, as the justice of the case may require.
(2) Where a contract is rescinded under sub-section (1), the court-
(a) shall direct the purchaser or lessee, if he has obtained possession of the
property under the contract, to restore such possession to the vendor or
lessor, and
(b) may direct payment to the vendor or lessor of all the rents and profits
which have accrued in respect of the property from the date on which
possession was so obtained by the purchaser or lessee until restoration

of possession to the vendor or lessor, and, if the justice of the case so
requires, the refund of any sum paid by the vendee or lessee as earnest
money or deposit in connection with the contract.
(3) If the purchaser or lessee pays the purchase money or other sum which he
is ordered to pay under the decree within the period referred to in sub-section
(1), the court may, on application made in the same suit, award the purchaser or
lessee such further relief as he may be entitled to, including in appropriate cases
all or any of the following reliefs, namely:-
(a) the execution of a proper conveyance or lease by the vendor or lessor;
(b) the delivery of possession, or partition and separate possession, of the
property on the execution of such conveyance or lease.
(4) No separate suit in respect of any relief which may be claimed under this
section shall lie at the instance of a vendor, purchaser, lessor or lessee, as the
case may be.
(5) The costs of any proceedings under this section shall be in the discretion
of the court.
Inbuilt remedy of rescission in decree of specific performance
Section 28 enables the court to put an inbuilt remedy of rescission in a
decree of specific performance. Where a decree of specific performance has
been passed in respect of a contract for the sale or lease of immovable prop-
erty, but the party to whom such relief has been granted does not pay the
price within the time delimited, the seller may ask the court for rescission.
The court will direct the purchaser or lessee, if he has already taken over
possession, to restore it to the seller and also to pay him rent for the period
during which he enjoyed the benefits of possession. Where justice so requires
the court may order refund of the earnest money, if any, paid by the vendee
or lessee. Where, on the other hand, the vendee or lessee has deposited the
money as directed by the court, he may be allowed any relief as may seem
just to the court in the circumstances. 272
272. Relief was allowed even where the deposit was late but it was made during the pendency of
the appeal. The court retains control over the matter even after the passing of the decree,

Contract not automatically extinguished on decree of
specific performance
[S. 28]
The contract between the parties is not extinguished on passing of decree
of specific performance. The court does not lose its jurisdiction, nor does it
become functus officio. The decree of specific performance is in the nature
of a preliminary decree. The suit is deemed to be pending even after the
grant of such decree. The court retains its control over the entire matter even
after the decree. Section 28 itself is indicative of such a consequence. The
court has power to enlarge time in favour of the decree holder to enable him.
to pay the amount or to perform the conditions mentioned in the decree.
There was no default clause in the decree in the sense that if the conditions
were not satisfied within a certain time, it could be avoided. The decree
holder had, during the course of the proceedings stretching over 24 years,
paid the entire premium amount and large sums in respect of accrued rents.
It could not be said that he, being the lessee, intended to abandon the agree-
ment. He was directed to pay the balance amount within 30 days on which
the lessor was to execute the lease deed. 273
Where there was no outer limit for payment of balance amount of the
price and on the asking of the court the purchaser deposited the balance
amount in the court and it was found that the vendors were not carrying
out their part of the agreement, the remedy of rescission was not allowed to
such vendors. 274
The court which passes a decree for specific performance retains control
over the decree. But the parties cannot deviate from the terms of the decree.
Proceedings for execution of decree do not fall within the expression "pen-
dency of suit". The suit attained finality as no appeal was preferred. During
the pendency of execution proceedings, the judgment debtor sold away the
suit property. The court said that this did not amount to assignment or crea-
tion of any interest during the pendency of a suit. No leave of the court was
obtained before purchasing the property. The purchaser was not allowed to
be impleaded as a party to execution proceedings. 275
273. Kumar Dhirendra Mullick v Tivoli Park Apartments (P) Ltd, (2005) 9 SCC 262. Susheela
Devi v Maharshi Commerce Ltd, AIR 2010 NOC 819 (AP), rescission can be ordered for
non-deposit of any other sum ordered by the court, not necessarily the balance amount of
consideration. The plaintiff (buyer) was directed to deposit costs of stamp papers, expenses
of registration and other incidental charges within one month. Refusal to grant relief of
rescission on deposit of such amounts was held to be improper. Khoobiram v Urmilla
Chauhan, AIR 2010 MP 211, there was no direction to the decree holder in the decree to pay
the balance consideration within two months, it was for the other party to receive the bal-
ance and to execute sale deed. There was no default on the part of the decree holder within
the meaning of S. 28.

Rescission of contracts 925
Extension of time for payment under decree
The decree was signed and sealed on a particular date under which the
decree holder was given about three weeks' time to pay under the decree. His
application for extension of time was dismissed on the same day. Such order
of dismissal was held to be erroneous. 276
Limitation
An application for rescission ought to be filed within 3 years from the
date of the decree for specific performance. The cause of action commences
from the date of decree, and not from the date of dismissal of application
filed by the vendee for extension of time to pay the decretal amount. But,
even after dismissing the petition for rescission of contract as time-barred,
a direction to the vendee for deposit of the sale consideration alongwith
interest would be lawful.277
For execution of proper conveyance by vendor and delivery of posses-
sion, the precondition for the plaintiff is to pay the balance purchase money
within the time mentioned in Section 28(1). There was failure on the part
of the plaintiff-purchaser to deposit the balance sale consideration in court.
He made a false averment in the affidavit as to have paid the balance con-
sideration. He played fraud on the court. He became disentitled to relief of
execution under Section 28(3). The vendor became entitled to get the con-
tract rescinded, 278
Appealable order
An order under Section 28 for rescinding an agreement amounts to a
decree. An appeal lies against such order and not revision.279
Alternative prayer for rescission in suit for specific performance [S. 29]
As provided by Section 29 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, the plaintiff
may in a suit for specific performance make a prayer that if such relief can-
not be granted, the contract may be rescinded. He has to make delivery of
the instrument for being cancelled.
But the converse is not true. So, the prayer for the rescission of the
contract or, in the alternative, for a decree of specific performance is not
permissible. 20
S. 29. Alternative prayer for rescission in suit for specific perfor-
mance. A plaintiff instituting a suit for the specific performance of a contract

enforced it may be rescinded and delivered up to be cancelled; and the court, if
it refuses to enforce the contract specifically, may direct it to be rescinded and
delivered up accordingly.
Extension of time
Where the court, while ordering specific performance in favour of the
plaintiff, directed him to pay the balance amount within a specified date and
that, on his failure to do so, his case would be dismissed, it was held on his
failure to do so, that the court could grant him extension of time.281
Rescission and equity
Section 30 lays down that the court may require parties rescinding to do
equity. It provides:
S. 30. Court may require parties rescinding to do equity.-On adjudg-
ing the rescission of a contract, the court may require the party to whom such
relief is granted to restore, so far as may be, any benefit which he may have
received from the other party and to make any compensation to him which jus-
tice may require.
It is a maxim of law that "he who seeks equity must do equity" in the
transaction in respect of which relief is sought. So while decreeing rescission
the court might direct not only payment of compensation to the defend-
ant but also restoration of any benefit received by the plaintiff under the
contract.
A party seeking specific relief may at the same time ask that if specific per-
formance cannot be allowed, the contract may be ordered to be rescinded. If
the court refuses one relief, it may order the other.
The Supreme Court has been of the opinion that while dealing with an
application under Section 28(1) for rescission of contract in a case in which
the relief of specific performance has been earlier allowed, the court does
not cease to have jurisdiction over the matter. The court retains control
over the decree even after the decree has been passed. It is open to the court
to exercise power under Section 28(1) either for extension of time or for
rescinding the contract.282
Where the purchaser deposited the money in the court as directed by the
court, he was not allowed to withdraw it without first applying to the court
for a direction to the vendor to execute the sale deed, because until then it

enures not only for the benefit of the plaintiff but also that of the defendant; the passing of

are equally available to the defendant. Mohd Ali Sahib v Abdul Khadir Saheb, (1927) 59 MLJ

power to grant extension of time on sufficient cause shown though the application was made
after the time fixed for performance had expired.

Rectification of instruments 927
could not be said that the vendor had failed to comply with the order of the
court. 283
The party at whose instance the contract is cancelled may be asked by the
court to restore the benefits, if any, received under the contract to the extent
to which justice requires.
RECTIFICATION OF INSTRUMENTS [S. 26]
Section 26 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 provides remedy for rectifica-
tion of instruments. The term "instrument" has been defined in Section 2,
clause (14) of the Indian Stamp Act (II of 1899), Accordingly, "instrument"
includes every document by which any right or liability is or purports to be
created, transferred, limited, extended, extinguished or recorded. A suit,
therefore, lies for the rectification of a will, a decree and also for the rectifi-
cation of an award-decree on the ground of fraud. The word "instrument",
however, does not include "Articles of Association",284
S. 26. When instrument may be rectified.-(1) When, through fraud or
a mutual mistake of the parties, a contract or other instrument in writing [not
being the articles of association of a company to which the Companies Act, 1956
(1 of 1956), applies] does not express their real intention, then-
(a) either party or his representative-in-interest may institute a suit to have
the instrument rectified; or
(b) the plaintiff may, in any suit in which any right arising under the instru-
ment is in issue, claim in his pleading that the instrument be rectified; or
(c) a defendant in any such suit as is referred to in clause (b), may, in addition
to any other defence open to him, ask for rectification of the instrument.
(2) If in any suit in which a contract or other instrument is sought to be recti-
fied under sub-section (1), the court finds that the instrument, through fraud or
mistake, does not express the real intention of the parties, the court may, in its
discretion, direct rectification of the instrument so as to express that intention,
so far as this can be done without prejudice to rights acquired by third persons
in good faith and for value.
(3) A contract in writing may first be rectified, and then if the party claiming
rectification has so prayed in his pleading and the court thinks fit, may be spe-
cifically enforced.
(4) No relief for the rectification of an instrument shall be granted to any party
under this section unless it has been specifically claimed:
Provided that where a party has not claimed any such relief in his pleading,
the court shall, at any stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend the pleading
on such terms as may be just for including such claim.285

284. CIT v Kamla Town Trust, (1996) 7 SCC 349: AIR 1996 SC 620, power to order rectification
of trust deed; rectification was ordered to declare that the trust was a charitable one.
285. Sub-section (1) and cl. (a) of this S. corresponds with S. 31 and sub-section (3) of this section
corresponds with S. 34 of the repealed Specific Relief Act, 1877. That Act carried the follow-
ing illustrations:

Page 1071
https://t.me/LawCollegeNotes_Stuffs
928 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 26]
In the matter of rectification, the true question, is what was the intention
of the parties at the time of its execution and not what the parties inten-
tionally omitted.286 The plaintiff must establish that the alleged intention to
which he desires the document to be made conformable, continued concur-
rently in the minds of all parties down to the time of its execution. [Ibid]
For, if the parties after an agreement changed their minds and it is their
changed intention that is embodied in the instrument, there is no ground for
rectification. What is done on purpose, is obviously not done by mistake.
[Ibid]
Essentials to be proved
(1) That there was a mutual mistake or fraud, and
(2) that the instrument on that account did not truly express the intention
of the parties.287
Mistake
The mistake to form a ground for the relief of rectification must be mutual
and not unilateral. A mistake on one side may be a ground of defence or a
ground for rescinding a contract, but not for correcting or rectifying an
instrument. The mistake may be either of fact or of law although the court
of equity will not generally grant relief against a mistake of law, except
where the mistake results in an inequitable result.238
The principle of granting relief by way of rectification is that where a con-
tract as finally made fails to express or embody the agreement between the
parties as originally made, it can be had rectified so as to bring it in accord
Illustrations as to sub-section (1) and clause (a).-(a) A, intending to sell to B his house
and one of three godowns adjacent to it, executes a conveyance prepared by B, in which,
through B's fraud, all three godowns are included. Of the two godowns which were fraudu-
lently included, B gives one to C and lets the other to D for a rent, neither C nor D having any
knowledge of the fraud. The conveyance may, as against B and C, be rectified so as to exclude
from it the godown given to C, but it cannot be rectified so as to affect D's lease.
(b) By a marriage settlement, A, the father of B, the intended wife, covenants with C, the
intended husband, to pay to C, his executors, administrators and assigns, during A's life, an
annuity of Rs 5000. C dies insolvent and the official assignee claims the annuity from A. The
Court, on finding it clearly proved that the parties always intended that this annuity should
be paid as a provision for B and her children, may rectify the settlement and decree that the
assignee has no right to any part of the annuity.
Illustrations as to sub-section (3).-A contracts in writing to pay to his attorney, B, a
fixed sum in lieu of costs. The contract contains mistakes as to the name and rights of the cli-
ent, which, if construed strictly, would exclude B from all rights under it. B is entitled, if the
Court thinks fit, to have it rectified, and to an order for payment of the sum, as if at the time
of its execution it had expressed the intention of the parties. [Based on Stedman v Collett,

Cancellation of instruments 929
with the intention of the parties. Thus where the final draft mentioned the
price in weight when in fact it was agreed to be in count and riot risk was
mentioned in an insurance cover by mistake, the court allowed rectification.
The court said that the matter came within Section 26 of the Specific Relief
Act of 1963 which provides that an instrument can be rectified if through
fraud or a mutual mistake of the parties, the contract does not express their
real intention, 289
Under an agreement for sale of property, buyer sent notice to the seller for
execution of the sale deed. The seller replied that he had agreed to sell only
5 cents of the land. There was a concurrent finding of the courts in favour
of the purchaser that the agreement was to sell 5 cents plus some structures
specified in the deed. The court said that Section 26 was not applicable as
there was no ambiguity in the deed. There could be no interference in a
concurrent finding of fact. The suit for specific performance was rightly
decreed.290
In the case of a gift deed, only the donor may seek its rectification. In other
cases it is permissible only to the parties to the contract and none else.291
CANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS [SS. 31-33]
Sections 31 to 33 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 provide for the cancel-
lation of instruments.
S.31. When cancellation may be ordered.-(1) Any person against whom
a written instrument is voidable, and who has reasonable apprehension that
such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him serious injury, may sue
to have it adjudged void or voidable; and the court may, in its discretion, so
adjudge it and order it to be delivered up and cancelled.
(2) If the instrument has been registered under the Indian Registration
Act, 1908 the court shall also send a copy of its decree to the officer in whose
office the instrument has been so registered; and such officer shall note on the
copy of the instrument contained in his books the fact of its cancellation.292

(b) A conveys land to B, who bequeaths it to C and dies. Thereupon D gets possession
of the land and produces a forged instrument stating that the conveyance was made to B in
trust for him. C may obtain the cancellation of the forged instrument.
(c) A, representing that the tenants on his land were all at will, sells it to B, and conveys
it to him by an instrument, dated the 1st January, 1877. Soon after the day, A fraudulently
grants to C a lease of part of the lands, dated the 1st October, 1876, and procures the lease
to be registered under the Indian Registration Act. B may obtain the cancellation of this
deed.

930 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 31]
A sale deed which was executed by practising a fraud on the transferor
who was also not of sound mind, was held liable to be quashed and not to
be specifically enforced. 293 Cancellation of a sale without issuing notice to
the vendee has been held to be not permissible. A unilateral cancellation and
its registration are of no effect. The High Court directed the writ petitioner
who had unilaterally cancelled the sale deed executed by him to approach a
civil court. The court said that the cancellation of a sale deed and its regis-
tration are valid only when there is declaration to that effect by a competent
court. In this case there was no such declaration. Further, no notice was
issued to the other party. The Supreme Court set aside the cancellation and
its registration. A sale deed was executed at the time when it was proved
by documentary evidence that the executant was already dead. It was held
to be non est and therefore liable to be cancelled. 295
Who can seek cancellation
A sale deed was executed in respect of an ancestral property. The trans-
feror's sons challenged it and sought a declaration that the sale was null and
void. There was nothing to show their ages and whether they had birth-right
in the property. They were not allowed to challenge it on the ground of the
competence of the transferor. The suit was also time-barred because it could
be filed only within three years of the cause of action whereas 13 years had
already passed,296
The transfer of a coparcenary property by one of the coparceners with-
out the consent of others was allowed to be cancelled at the action of a
coparcener. The court said that no other person can seek cancellation of
such a transaction. 197
There is a presumption that a registered document has been validly exe-
cuted. It is, therefore, a prima facie valid document in law. The onus of
proof would be on the person who leads evidence to rebut the presumption.
(d) A agrees to sell and deliver a ship to B, to be paid for by B's acceptances of four bills
of exchange, for sums amounting to Rs 30,000, to be drawn by A or B. The bills are drawn
and accepted, but the ship is not delivered according to the agreement. A sues B on one of
the bills. B may obtain the cancellation of all the bills. [Based on Anglo-Danubian Co v

Cancellation of instruments 931
The respondent in this case could not do so.29 The ground of seeking can-
cellation was that because of the fiduciary relationship, the beneficiary was
in a position to exert undue influence on the executant. The court said that
the burden of proving goodfaith in the transaction was on the beneficiary.
He could not do so. The sale deed was therefore liable to be cancelled,299
In a case for cancellation of a sale deed on the ground that the deed was
void, it was held that the suit could be filed in a civil court by the recorded
tenure holder, executant of the deed or his successor. The suit filed by a third
party was not maintainable.300
When a document is valid, no question arises of its cancellation. When
a document is void ab initio, a decree for setting aside the same would not
be necessary as the same is non est in the eye of the law, as it is a nullity.
Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 refers to both void and voidable
documents. It provides for a discretionary relief.301 The deed in this case was
void by reason of the fact that it purported to convey the interest of a minor.
The court said:
"If a deed was executed by the plaintiff when he was a minor and it
was void, he had two options to file a suit to get the property purport-
edly conveyed thereunder. He could either file the suit within 12 years of
the deed or within 3 years of attaining majority. Here, the plaintiff did
not either sue within 12 years of the deed or within 3 years of attaining
majority. Therefore, the suit was rightly held to be barred by limitation
by the trial court."
A person who made misrepresentations to induce a person to purchase his
land was not allowed to seek setting aside because of his own misconduct.
He could not be allowed to take advantage of his own misdeed.102
Cancellation of a sale deed cannot be sought only on the basis of unpaid
sale price. 303
No unilateral cancellation, only by court order
A transfer by way of sale was made absolute by transfer of the property
from the transferor to purchaser. The court said that such transfer could not

be annulled as cancelled unilaterally by vendor by executing a cancellation
deed. Such deed could not be accepted for registration. Cancellation of sale
deed can be ordered only by the court under Section 31 of the Specific Relief
Act. 304
It is not within the powers of the Registrar of Partnership firm to declare
that the partnership deed in question was null and void. The remedy is to
approach a civil court under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act. 305
On execution and registration of a sale deed, the owner completely loses
his right over the property and the purchaser becomes absolute owner. The
sale deed cannot be nullified by executing a deed of cancellation. It cannot
be annulled even by consent or agreement between the parties. The power to
cancel such deeds vests with the court. It cannot be exercised by the trans-
feror of a property. Hence, the Bangalore Development Authority could not
cancel the registered sale deed under which it had transferred property, 306
Limitation
There was no pleading in the plaint seeking exemption from the law of
limitation in terms of Order 7, Rule 6, CPC. The plaintiff was not allowed.
to raise the plea of limitation for the first time in second appeal. The suit was
for.cancellation of the sale deed which was executed in 1997. The limitation
had to be reckoned from that date. Suit was filed in 2004, seven years after
execution. The suit was held to be barred by limitation.307
S. 32. What instruments may be partially cancelled.-Where an instru-
ment is evidence of different rights or different obligations, the court may, in a
proper case, cancel it in part and allow it to stand for the residue.
This section corresponds with Section 40 of the repealed Specific Relief
Act, 1877. That section carried the following illustration:
A draws a bill on B who endorses it to C, by whom it appears to be endorsed to D, who
endorses to E. C's endorsement is forged. C is entitled to have such instrument cancelled,
leaving the bills to stand in other respects.
S. 33. Power to require benefit to be restored or compensation to be
made when instrument is cancelled or is successfully resisted as being
void or voidable.-(1) On adjudging the cancellation of an instrument, the
court may require the party to whom such relief is granted, to restore, so far as
may be, any benefit which he may have received from the other party and to
make any compensation to him which justice may require.
(2) Where a defendant successfully resists any suit on the grounds-
(a) that the instrument sought to be enforced against him in the suit is void-
able, the court may, if the defendant has received any benefit under the

instrument from the other party, require him to restore, so far as may be,
such benefit to that party or to make compensation for it;
(b) that the agreement sought to be enforced against him in the suit is void
by reason of his not having been competent to contract under Section 11
of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, the court may, if the defendant has
received any benefit under the agreement from the other party, require
him to restore, so far as may be, such benefit to that party, to the extent
to which he or his estate has benefited thereby.
The relief provided in Section 33 of the Specific Relief Act is based on the
principle of protective or preventive justice. This section applies to instru-
ments executed by the plaintiff as well as to other instruments which he
seeks to have adjudged void or voidable.308 It is not necessary that the plain-
tiff must be a party to a contract; he can maintain the suit under this section
if the instrument is against his interest.
The conditions precedent to the applicability of this section are-
(a) the instrument should be void or voidable against the plaintiff;
(b) there is a reasonable apprehension of a serious injury;109
(c) that the case is fit for the exercise of the court's discretion to grant
the prayer. [Ibid]
When agreement void
An agreement not enforceable by law is said to be void (S. 2(8) of the
Indian Contract Act). A contract is void-
(i) where the consideration or object or an agreement is forbidden by
law, or
(ii) is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions
of any law, or
(iii) is fraudulent, or
(iv) involves or implies injury to the person or property of another, or,
(v) the court regards it is immoral or opposed to public policy [S. 23 of
the Indian Contract Act].
It will also be noted that an agreement in restraint of marriage of any
person other than a minor, [S. 26, Contract Act] or by which anyone is
restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business [S. 28, ibid]
or legal proceedings, or agreements of unmeaning or of wagering nature and
an agreement without consideration as a general rule [S. 25, ibid] are void.
A contract by a minor is void, 310

When contract voidable
[S. 33]
An agreement which is enforceable by law, at the option of one or more
parties thereto, but not at the option of the other or others, is a voidable
contract. [S. 2(i) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872]
When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or misrep-
resentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party,
whose consent was so caused. [S. 19, ibid]
A contract induced by undue influence is voidable at the option of the
party whose consent was so caused. [S. 19-A, ibid]
Reasonable apprehension
The relief provided under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act is based
upon protective justice and upon the idea of "quia time" (for fear) and,
therefore, where there is no apprehension of injury to the plaintiff, no suit
can be instituted. Reasonable apprehension is to be determined with ref-
erence to the circumstances of each case which the court has to deal with.
Requirements of ground of relief
(1) The relief under Section 31 of Specific Relief Act cannot be claimed
as a matter of right; the court will act upon the principle of the exercise of
sound discretion, having due regard to the conduct of the parties.312
(2) Where the parties are in pari delicto and fraud is alleged as the ground
for cancellation, the court may refuse the relief to the plaintiff, as he is
equally to blame as is defendant. 313
(3) No relief can be granted under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act
where there is a question of mere inadequacy of consideration.314
(4) No suit for the cancellation of a will can be instituted during a testa-
tor's lifetime.
Partial cancellation
Section 32 of the Specific Relief Act will be applicable only when rights
and obligations under an instrument are distinct and separable.315
Compensation
The plea of compensation must be taken in the first court.316

Cancellation of instruments 935
[S. 33]
Limitation
Article 59 of Indian Limitation Act, 1963 prescribes a period of three
years for a suit for cancellation of an instrument computable from the date
when the fact entitling the plaintiff to have the instrument cancelled first
becomes known to him.
The provisions have been frequently used by the courts in rescuing minors
from the burden of contracts made by them. One of the outstanding cases is
the decision of the Privy Council in Mobori Bibee v Dhurmodas Ghose.317
A minor, declaring himself to be of full age, mortgaged his two houses as
against a loan, a part of which was paid to him in cash. He then applied
to the court for cancellation of the mortgage. The court had to cancel the
mortgage because it was in fact void. The moneylender pleaded for refund of
his money. The provisions do authorise courts to require a minor to restore
the benefits obtained or make compensation, but only to the extent to which
justice so requires. In the present case their Lordships said that justice did
not require any relief in favour of the lender because he was reckless in his
dealings with the minor.
The provisions quite clearly contemplated that the court could ask only
that person to make compensation who was seeking the relief of cancella-
tion. In a case before the Lahore High Court relief was sought by a person
against a minor who had taken the price in advance of the land which he
purported to sell but refused to complete the sale. It was powerfully con-
tended that the provisions would permit relief only against a person who
himself seeks cancellation and not against one who came to the court as a
defendant. But the court ordered the minor to refund the money. As against
it, the Allahabad High Court refused to ask the minor, who was a defendant
in the court, to refund the mortgage money, 319 When the Specific Relief Act
was re-enacted in 1963, in terms of the proposals of the Law Commission,
Section 33 which provided for the relief of restitution on the cancellation of
a contract contained provisions to cover both situations, namely, whether
the person seeking relief is the plaintiff or the defendant. The provisions can
be presented in terms of the following propositions:
(1) Where a void or voidable contract has been cancelled at the instance of
a party thereto, the court may require him to restore such benefits as he
has received under the contract and to make any compensation to the
other party which justice may require.
(2) Where a defendant successfully resists any suit on the ground that the
contract, by reason of his being incompetent, is void against him, he
may be required to restore the benefits, if any, obtained by him under
the contract, but only to the extent to which he or his estate has bene-
fited thereby.

936 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
DECLARATORY DECREES
[S. 34]
Sections 34 and 35 lay down the law relating to declaratory decrees. A
declaratory decree is a decree declaratory of a right which is doubtful or
which requires to be cleared. The object of declaratory decrees is to prevent
future litigation by removing the existing cause of the controversy. In other
words, if a cloud is cast upon the title or legal character of the plaintiff, he
is entitled to seek the aid of the court to dispel it.
Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act lays down the circumstances under
which a declaratory decree may be passed.
S. 34. Discretion of court as to declaration of status or right.-Any per-
son entitled to any legal character, or to any right as to any property, may insti-
tute a suit against any person denying or interested to deny, his title to such
character or right, and the court may in its discretion make therein a declaration
that he is so entitled, and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any further
relief:
Provided that no court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff,
being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title, omits to do so.
Explanation. A trustee of property is a "person interested to deny" a title
adverse to the title of someone who is not in existence, and for whom, if in exist-
ence, he would be a trustee.
Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act does not sanction every kind of dec-
laration but only a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to any legal char-
acter or to any property. 320 It is not a matter of absolute right to obtain a
declaratory decree and it is discretionary for the court to grant or refuse to
grant it.
It is essential for a decree under Section 34 that the plaintiff must be
entitled to any legal character to any right to property. "Legal character"
is a position recognised by law, and a person's legal character is made up
of the attributes which law attaches to him in his individual and personal
capacity and the phrase is synonymous with the word "status". It includes
the right of franchise and the right of election. It may be observed that the
words "legal character" and "to any right as to any property" are separated
by the disjunctive "or" and, therefore, the plaintiff can maintain a suit for
a mere declaration, if he can show that he is entitled to any legal character,
even though he cannot lay an immediate claim to any property.

ing evidence. High Court failed to consider the specific finding made by the lower appellate
court that the plaintiff had failed to establish title.

Declaratory decrees 937
(i) Essentials to be set up for relief under Section 34
(1) That the plaintiff is entitled to a legal character at the time of the suit,
or to any right as to any property.3
(2) Defendant has denied these or he is interested in denying that charac-
ter or right of the plaintiff, and
(3) The plaintiff is not in a position to ask for relief consequential upon
the declaration.
If these conditions are satisfied, the plaintiff need not ask for any further
relief than a mere declaration. But the court shall not make any such decla-
ration if he, being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title,
omits to do so. 325
(ii) Frame of plaint
The plaint must disclose-
(1) the title or right claimed by the plaintiff,
(2) the circumstances in which the cloud was cast over the same or the
same was denied or threatened,
(3) the prayer. 326

938 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 34]
The right to any property, mentioned in this section, must be a right
actually existing at the date of the suit, though the enjoyment itself may be
deferred, e.g., a right of the reversioner. 327 But when the plaintiff had no
vested or contingent right to any property but only a faint hope of being
selected as a shebait after the death of the existing shebait, he could not
maintain a suit for declaration. 328 In Qabool Singh v Board of Revenue, 129
it was held that the plaintiff must show subsisting right not only on the date
of the suit but also on the date of decree.
The defendant should be a person who actually denies or is interested to
deny the plaintiff's title, status, right to any property; even the lease denied
by a person or the agent of a person who is interested to deny invests the
plaintiff with a cause of action for a declaratory suit under Section 34,
Specific Relief Act, 330 but a mere apprehension existing in the mind of the
plaintiff does not give him any right to bring a suit for declaration.331
When suit for declaration does not lie.-A suit for declaration will not
lie in the following cases:
(1) for a declaration that the plaintiff did not infringe the defendant's trade
mark. Negative declaration will not be allowed;
332
327. City Municipal Council Bhalki v Gurappa, (2016) 2 SCC 200, onus on the plaintiff to prove

facts, plaintiff succeeded in establishing title.

Masjid, 2001 SCC OnLine AP 1148: 2002 AIHC 1811 the party claiming title over property
under registered sale deed proved that the property was not a part of the wakf property,
entitled to declaration of title, possession and consequential relief of permanent injunction.
Pennaiah v Thippamma, AIR 2004 Kant 444, variance between pleading and proof, prop-
erty described in the plaint not matching with the property at the site, no relief. Ramchandra
Sakharam Mahajan v Damodar Trimbak Tanksale, (2007) 6 SCC 737: AIR 2007 SC 2577,
the suit was for recovery of possession on the strength of title. The defendant also set up rival
title, but because of weakness of his evidence he was not able to establish it. The plaintiff
was not entitled to claim relief on the weakness of the defence evidence. He has to establish
his own case by his own evidence. The question of title was also not to be decided by survey
records alone. The court emphasised the need for appointment of Commission to get the
property identified and demarcated.

which the defendant claimed in his favour was shown to be forged because its date was after

claimant which he could not discharge. Babu Sheriff v Maqbool Sheriff, AIR 2003 Mad 355,

that it was a Government land, but they could not prove their stand by their records. The
suit was decreed. Surajbai Galiyana Solanki Bhil v Roopa Nevji Dabhar Bhil, AIR 2011

document. She could not be dispossessed.

ration of title and possession.

Declaratory decrees 939
(2) for a declaration that a disposition made by the father of the plaintiff in
a will is invalid and that the property is ancestral and that the plaintiff
is entitled to a share in it. This suit would be barred by the proviso of
Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, because the plaintiff can claim fur-
ther relief or partition;335
(3) for a declaration, during the lifetime of the testator, that the will is inva-
lid. The reason is that the will is revokable and no property is trans-
ferred during the lifetime of the testator;334
(4) for a declaration that the plaintiff is a purchaser under an unregistered
deed of sale;
(5) no declaratory suit lies to set aside a succession certificate granted under
Act XXVII of 1860;336
(6) no one can ask for a declaration of a non-existent right, as of succession,
i.e., the chance or possibility of acquiring a right in the future;
(7) a suit by a student against a University for a declaration that he has
passed an examination;37
(8) a declaration tending to affect the free flow of capital and commercial
operations would be unjust. 338
(iii) Further relief where plaintiff entitled to it (proviso)
All that the proviso to Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act forbids is a suit
for mere declaration without further relief if the plaintiff can sue for further
relief. The term "further relief" means "the relief to which the plaintiff is
necessarily entitled on the basis of declaration of the title". This is done in
order to avoid multiplicity of suits. Further, relief must be in relation to the
legal character or right to such character or the right which the defendant
denies or is interested in denying. It must also be relief appropriate to, and
consequent on the right asserted.339
For example, where A claims that he is entitled to half portion of the
house in the occupation of B, he must pray in his suit:-
(i) that a declaration be made that A is entitled to half portion of the
house and:
(ii) that the defendant be asked to deliver the half portion of the house
to A. This is consequential relief.40

The court while declaring title of the plaintiff cannot decline to adjudi-
cate consequential questions of possession, removal of encroachments, dem-
olition of encroaching structure upon a portion of the land to which the title
of the plaintiff has been declared. 341
In Ram Saran v Ganga Devi,32 the defendant was in possession of some
of the suit properties and the plaintiffs in their suit did not ask for the pos-
session of those properties. They merely prayed for a declaration that they
were the owners of the suit properties. It was held that the suit was not
maintainable and was hit by Section 42 of the Act of 1877 [now S. 34 of the
Specific Relief Act, 1963].
A declaration was sought in respect of a property which was in the pos-
session of a charitable trust. The property was purchased by the adoptive
mother of the plaintiff in his name and given over to the trust under a valid
trust deed. The plaintiff was minor at the time. He himself was a party to
the trust deed and convenor of the trust. There was no evidence to show that
he had let out the property to the trust. Documentary evidence showed that
the trust was in possession of the property and was paying in respect of it
property tax, electricity, water charges, etc. It was held that in the circum-
stances the plaintiff was not entitled to the relief of declaration of title.343
relief without seeking the main relief was held to be self-defeating. Munilakshmamma v

tion sought, the suit could not be dismissed for omission to seek further relief because no
further relief could be sought against a trespasser, the suit was proceeding ex parte, the buyer
was put in possession under an agreement to sell to him, his possession had to be protected
against the trespasser, but he was not entitled to a declaration that he was the owner of
the property. Gangaram Rambhau Zite v Chindhu Dagadu Tikone, AIR 2003 Bom 1, dis-
pute over lane between two houses, the party claiming possession and declaration could not
prove. The court said that the description of the house property in certified copy of the house
maps was conclusive and clinching evidence and that showed that the plaintiff did not own
and possess the lane, as it was included in the area of the defendant. Plaintiff's case rejected.

erty by virtue of a partition decree passed in an earlier proceeding. The defendants did not
produce anything to prove their title over the property. They rather admitted the plaintiff's
ownership and possession. The plaintiff was held entitled to the declaration. The defendant
could not take advantage of the fact that the measurement of the property was different from
that shown under the earlier suit for partition.

Declaratory decrees 941
Section 34 is a reproduction of the original Section 42 of the repealed Act.
That section carried certain illustrations reproduced here in the footnote.344
.. Declaration of rights or status is one at the discretion of the court under
Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. Equally, the grant or refusal
of the relief of declaration and injunction under the provision of that Act
is discretionary. The plaintiff cannot claim the relief as of right. It has to
be granted according to sound principles of law and ex debito justitiae.
The court cannot convert itself into an instrument of injustice or vehicle of
oppression. While exercising its discretionary power, the court must keep in
its mind the well-settled principles of justice and fair play and the discretion
would be exercised keeping in view the ends of justice since justice is the
hallmark and it cannot be administered in vacuum. Grant of declaration
and injunction relating to commercial transactions tend to aid dishonesty
and perfidy. Conversely, refusal to grant relief generally encourages candour
in business behaviour, facilitates free flow of capital, prompt compliance
with covenants, sustained growth of commerce and above all inculcates
respect for the efficacy of judicial adjudication. Before granting or refusing
to grant relief of declaration or injunction or both the court must weigh pros
and cons in each case, consider the facts and circumstances in their proper
perspective and exercise discretion with circumspection to further the ends
of justice. In this backdrop of fact situation it was held in a case that the
relief of declaration granted was unjust and illegal as it tended to impede
the free flow of capital, thwarted the growth of mercantile business and
deflected the course of justice. 345
344. (a) A is lawfully in possession of certain land. The inhabitants of a neighbouring village
claim a right of way across the land. A may sue for a declaration that they are not entitled to
the right so claimed.
(b) A bequeaths his property to B, C and D, "to be equally divided amongst all and each
of them, if living at the time of my death, then amongst their surviving children". No such
children are in existence. In a suit against A's executor, the court may declare whether B, C
and D took the property absolutely, or only for their lives, and it may also declare the inter-
ests of the children before their rights are vested.
(c) A covenants that, if he should at any time be entitled to property exceeding one lakh of
rupees, he will settle it upon certain trusts. Before any such property accrues, or any persons
entitled under the trusts are ascertained, he institutes a suit to obtain a declaration that the
covenant is void for uncertainty. The court may make the declaration.
(d) A alienates B's property in which A has merely a life interest. The alienation is invalid
as against C, who is entitled as reversioner. The court may in a suit by C against A and B
declare that C is so entitled.
(e) The widow of a sonless Hindu alienates part of the property of which she is in posses-
sion as such. The person presumptively entitled to possess the property if he survive her may,
in a suit against the alienee, obtain a declaration that the alienation was made without legal
necessity and was therefore void beyond the widow's lifetime. (S. 14 of the Hindu Succession
Act has now changed the position into this that a widow is entitled to full rights over her
property.)
(f) Out of date illustration, hence omitted.
(g) A is in possession of certain property. B, alleging that he is the owner of the property,
requires A to deliver it to him. A may obtain a declaration of his right to hold the property.

[S. 34]
A declaration of ownership of land cannot be sought by the plaintiff on
the basis of adverse possession. But a claim of ownership by adverse posses-
sion can be made by way of defence when he is arrayed as a defendant in
proceedings against him. 346
In a suit for declaration of title, the onus to prove his title is on the plain-
tiff. He cannot succeed on the weakness of the defendant's case. Revenue
record is not a proof of title. The plaintiff relied on the family settlement. He
offered no explanation of the fact as to why the suit land was not mentioned
in the family settlement. Thus, the court felt that his title became doubtful.
It was not proper to have decreed the suit on the weakness of the defendant's
case. 347
In a suit for declaration of title, the dispute was as to the extent of the
land covered by the agreement. The Supreme Court said: "The High Court
finding that plaintiff made out his title in respect of 8 guntas of land decreed
the suit to that extent. Though the plaintiff had purchased 4 guntas of culti-
vable land and 4 guntas of kharab land (land unfit for cultivating), when the
entire extent of land was converted to non-agricultural use, the land ceased
to be "cultivable land" and "kharab land" also became non-agricultural
land. It was held that the High Court, therefore, rightly found on the facts
that plaintiff succeeded in establishing his title and possession in regard to 8
guntas and he was entitled to permanent injunction.348
Power to do justice
The plaintiff claimed to have perfected title by adverse possession and
sought declaration of title and possession. The suit was dismissed as the plain-
tiff was found to be in an unauthorised occupation for years. The plaintiff
offered to purchase the suit land at market value. The court, in order to do
justice, offered him the possible solution to purchase the land in question.349
Transfer by partner of firm
The suit property belonged to a partnership firm. Records showed that
after retirement of a partner, the property came to the share of other part-
ners. The retiring partner (plaintiff) had relinquished his right to the prop-
erty by the deed of dissolution. He never questioned the ownership of the
was entitled to the membership of the club was not granted. The fact that some others were
admitted wrongly would not by itself entitle him to admission to membership. Art. 14 of the
Constitution was not applicable to the club. Gangadhar Behera v Surendra Barik, AIR 2003
NOC 322 (Ori): (2003) 1 Ori LR 51, proceeding under S. 145 of the CrPC, possession taken

firm over the property. The partners of the firm transferred the property.
The retired partner was not allowed to question the alienation. The suit for
declaration of ownership, mandatory injunction and restoration of posses-
sion was allowed. 350
The suit was for restraining the defendants and other partners of the firm
from alienating property of the firm as stated in the schedule to the plaint.
The partnership was at will. The court said that an injunction could not be
granted without there being a prayer for dissolution of the firm and settle-
ment of account. 351
Suit for declaration and injunction without seeking
relief of possession
The property in question was non-agricultural land. Entries in the record
of rights could not help to prove possession. Physical possession, the court
said, was required to be verified from records produced by the parties.
According to the evidence the plaintiff's father was in enjoyment of pos-
session whether symbolic or real. The plaintiffs also produced tax receipts.
The defendants produced no contra evidence. The plaintiffs, having already
established their possession, there was no need for them to claim possession
as a consequential relief.352
Suit for declaration of possession and injunction
The plaintiff claimed possession on the basis of an oral sale. The court
said that an oral sale is not recognised by law. The law recognises only
two modes of transfer and conveyance, namely by registered instrument
or by delivery of possession. The plaintiff was not entitled to a declaration
even assuming there was some evidence to show that she was settled in
possession.353
Simultaneous consumer complaint and civil suit
A simultaneous consumer complaint and civil suit have been held to be
maintainable. The hirer had taken away forcible possession of the vehicle.
The purchaser filed a complaint before the District Forum claiming compen-
sation for forcible deprivation of possession. He also filed a civil suit for dec-
laration that he was the sole owner of the vehicle. The court said that such
proceedings are not mutually destructive. They can run concurrently, 354
Declaration as to status of wife
A declaration was sought under Section 5(1) of the Hindu Marriage
Act, 1955, for being a legally wedded wife. The suit was by the second wife.

[S. 34]
This fact could not be proved that the first wife remained unheard of for
seven years. There was no proof also of a custom in the community for sec-
ond marriage after obtaining customary divorce. The resolution passed by
the Gram Panchayat dissolving first marriage was not valid because the first
wife was not a party to it. The certificate was managed only for sub-serving
the purpose of declaration. The court refused to grant the declaration, the
marriage in question being null and void.355
A suit was filed for declaration of the legal status of a legally wedded
wife and children of the deceased. Identity of persons who participated in
the marriage ceremony was not disclosed and none-examined. Daughter
and son-in-law of the alleged wife supported her evidence but did not have
direct knowledge about marriage. The court said that there is a presump-
tion in favour of validity of marriage and legitimacy of children, if from
the time of the alleged marriage, the parties have been accepted as husband
and wife by the relatives and others or the fact of it has been mentioned in
any document prepared after the fact of marriage. Evidence was not suf-
ficient to prove the ceremony of marriage or the fact of customary mar-
riage. Legal status of wife and children was therefore not proved. Sale deed
executed by the actual wife was held to be valid and was therefore not to
be cancelled. Appellants failed to prove their status as wife and children
of the deceased. Respondents on the other hand proved title and posses-
sion of the property. Appellants were not entitled to an injunction under
Section 38,336
Declaration as to title as against wife
Where a property was purchased in the name of wife, but the husband
contended that he purchased it for his own and family benefit, the court
said that family includes wife. Hence, there was no proof that the property
was not purchased for the benefit of wife. The husband was not entitled to
declaration of title for himself only, 357
In a case of paternity declaration and against denial of paternity, the
putative father was unwilling to subject himself to DNA test. The High
Court held that it could use reasonable force by taking police assistance if
the blood sample was not willingly given. The Supreme Court dismissed
putative father's special leave petition but modified that High Court direc-
tion to this extent that confidentiality would be afforded to the petitioner
by taking the sample at his residence and not compelling him to come to the
court for the purpose. The petitioner's old age was also taken into consider-
ation. The putative son and his mother were permitted to be present at the
home collection of the sample so that genuineness of the sample remained

free from controversy. The DNA lab was directed to furnish the report in a
sealed cover.358
Declaration as to Will
A suit was filed under Section 63 of the Succession Act, 1925 for decla-
ration and possession. The entitlement was claimed to be on the basis of
the earlier Will executed in favour of the plaintiff which was duly proved
and registered. The subsequent Will in favour of the defendants was not
registered. It was not dictated by the testator, but by some other person.
The court said that the subsequent Will was shrouded by suspicious circum-
stances. The plaintiff was allowed possession of the land in question on the
basis of the earlier Will.359
Who can seek relief (locus standi)
It was a joint suit by daughter and collateral of owner in possession. It
was held that in the event of death of the owner in possession, the ancestral
property (agricultural land in this case) was to devolve upon his four daugh-
ters and not upon the collateral. The collateral had no locus standi to file
suit. 360
Questioning sale deed on ground of fraud
The document containing the sale deed was questioned on the ground
of fraud alleged to have been practised by the purchaser. But fraud was not
proved. The transaction was, therefore, not void. The transaction could have
been repudiated in accordance with the time-limit prescribed by Article 59
of the Limitation Act, 1963.361 Entries made in the revenue record by playing
fraud with the Record Office were not allowed to be used for showing title
and establishing ownership. A declaration of title was not granted only on
the basis of revenue records. 362
Right of way
There was dispute as to right over the common pathway. The plaintiff and
his wife had a joint right over the pathway, but it was transferred as a whole
by the wife alone. The court said that the wife was not entitled to alienate the
entire common pathway in which the plaintiff husband also had the right.
It made no difference to the matter of title that the husband had attested the
sale deed made by his wife. The defendant's right not being complete, he was

not entitled to put any obstruction to the ingress and egress of the plaintiff
over the common pathway. The plaintiff was entitled to a declaration of his
common right and also permanent injunction.363
Court fee
A suit for declaration that the sale deed executed by the plaintiff father was
null and void and for seeking joint possession was held to be not a suit for
cancellation of sale deed. The court fee has not to be paid on sale considera-
tion mentioned in the sale deed. It is to be computed under Section 7(IV)(c)
of the Court Fees Act, 1870,364
Jurisdiction
A claim for hereditary interest or right in respect of Watan property based
on adoption. The court said that jurisdiction of civil courts has not been
excluded in the matter under the Bombay Inferior Village Watan Abolition
Act, 1959. Such a claim could not be decided by the Collector. Questions
regarding adoption involve declaration as to status, character, etc. of a par-
ticular person. Such questions can be decided only a civil court. 365 There was
acquisition of land without notice to land owner and forcible possession by
acquiring authority. Acquisition proceeding without notice was held to be
nullity. Civil court jurisdiction for declaration to be bad in law and injunct
authorities from taking forcible possession has not been barred.36
Effect of limitation
The defendants lost their case in proceedings under Section 145 of the
Criminal Procedure Code. They did not file their suit for declaration of tittle
within three years from that date. It was held that the right, title and interest
of the defendants in the suit land became extinguished after expiry of three
years.

Declaration that statement is defamatory
It has been held that the relief of declaration falls outside the scope of
Section 34, even so the power of court to grant the declaration of a civil
nature under Section 9 CPC, is not barred. The relief was sought in this
case that the statement made by the defendants in their daily newspaper
were defamatory. The court said that the plaint could not be rejected as the
plaintiff also prayed for relief of permanent injunction not to repeat such
publication in the future and a further relief of damages for the loss caused
to the reputation of the plaintiff.368

Injunctions 947
[S. 35]
Parties who are bound by declaration
S. 35. Effect of declaration.-A declaration made under this Chapter is
binding only on the parties to the suit, persons claiming through them respec-
tively, and where any of the parties are trustees, on the persons for whom, if in
existence at the date of the declaration such parties would be trustees.
Section 35 lays down that a declaration made under this chapter (i.e.
Chapter VI of the Act) is binding only:
() on the parties to the suit,
(ii) on persons claiming through them respectively, e.g. reversioners,
widows and sons etc., and
(i) where any of the parties are trustees, on the persons for whom, if
in existence at the date of the declaration such parties would be
trustees.
For example, A, a Hindu, in a suit to which B, his alleged wife,
and her mother, are defendants, seeks a declaration that his mar-
riage was duly solemnised and an order for the restitution of con-
jugal rights. The court makes the declaration and order. C claiming
that B is his wife, then sues A for the recovery of B. The declaration
made in the former suit is not binding upon C.
(iv) Limitation.-The governing articles in the Indian Limitation
Act, 1963 are Articles 56, 57 and 58.
Amendment of plaint and limitation
A suit for declaration was filed within limitation. The plaintiff subse-
quently became aware of the fact that he had failed to include his money
claim. An amendment of the plaints was allowed. It was held that the entire
claim as such must be deemed to have been filed within time. 39
INJUNCTIONS
The term "injunction" has been the subject of various attempts at a defini-
tion. It has been defined by Joyce as "An order remedial, the general purpose
of which is to restrain the commission or continuance of some wrongful act
of the party informed."
In Burney "injunction has been defined to be a judicial process, by which
one who has invaded or is threatening to invade the rights, legal or equita-
ble, of another is restrained from continuing or commencing such wrongful
act.
"370
Both of these definitions are expressive more of what is called a pro-
hibitory injunction that mandatory injunction. The definition which clearly
includes both is the one given by Lord HALSBURY. According to him "An
369. S. Veerabandra v S. Sambanda Naicker, AIR 2003 Mad 19.

[Ss. 36 & 37]
injunction is a judicial process whereby a party is ordered to refrain from
doing or to do a particular act or thing".
Injunction acts in personam. It does not run with the property. For exam-
ple A, the plaintiff, secures an injunction against B forbidding him to erect
a wall. A sells the property to C. The sale does carry the injunction with the
property.
An injunction may be issued for and against individuals, public bodies or
even the State. Disobedience of an injunction is punishable as contempt of
court.
There are three characteristics of an injunction:
(i) it is a judicial process,
(ii) the relief obtained thereby is a restraint or prevention, and
(iii) the act prevented or restrained is wrongful.
Nelson suggests that "the nature of discretion and the rules for its guid-
ance, in the case of Indian Courts are the same as in England". Under
English Law:
(1) if the injury to the plaintiff's legal rights is small; and
(2) is one which is capable of being estimated in money; and
(3) is one which can be adequately compensated by a small money pay-
ment; and
(4) the case is one, in which it would be oppressive to the defendant to
grant an injunction,
then damages in substitution for an injunction may be given.
In India some of these points have been incorporated into rules of juris-
diction by being enacted as sections of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.
They may be stated as below:
An injunction will not be issued-
(i) where damages are the appropriate remedy,
(ii) where injunction is not the appropriate relief,
(iii) where the plaintiff is not entitled to an injunction on account of his
conduct,
(iv) where the contract cannot be specifically enforced,
(v) where the injunction would operate inequitably.
Kinds of injunction
S. 36. Preventive relief how granted.-Preventive relief is granted at the
discretion of the court by injunction, temporary or perpetual.
Injunctions are either temporary (interlocutory) or perpetual. They are
defined in Section 37, Specific Relief Act, which reads-
S. 37. Temporary and perpetual injunctions.-(1) Temporary injunctions
are such as are to continue until a specified time, or until the further order of the

Injunctions 949
court and they may be granted at any stage of a suit, and are regulated by the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
(2) A perpetual injunction can only be granted by the decree made at the
hearing and upon the merits of the suit, the defendant is thereby perpetually
enjoined from the assertion of a right, or from the commission of an act, which
would be contrary to the rights of the plaintiff.
Temporary injunctions
The procedure for granting temporary injunction is governed by the rules
laid down in Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, Civil Procedure Code which
reads as under:
Cases in which temporary injunction may be granted
A temporary injunction may be granted in the following cases:
1. For protection of interest in property
This category will cover the following cases:
(a) that any property in dispute in a suit is in danger of being wasted,
damaged or alienated by any party to the suit, or wrongfully sold in
execution of a decree, or
(b) that the defendant threatens, or intends, to remove or dispose of his
property with a view to defraud his creditors,
(c) that the defendant threatens to dispossess the plaintiff or otherwise
cause injury to the plaintiff in relation to any property in dispute in
the suit. 372
the court may by order grant a temporary injunction to restrain such
act, or make such other order for the purpose of staying and preventing the
wasting, damaging, alienation, sale, removal or disposition of the property
as the court thinks fit until the disposal of the suit or until further orders.
2. Injunction to restrain repetition or continuance of breach
(1) In any suit for restraining the defendant from committing a breach
of contract or other injury, of any kind, whether compensation is claimed

950 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 37]
in the suit or not, the plaintiff may, at any time after the commencement of
the suit, and either before or after judgment, apply to the court for a tem-
porary injunction to restrain the defendant from committing the breach of
contract or injury complained of, or any breach of contract or injury of a
like kind arising out of the same contract or relating to the same property or
right.
(2) The court may by order grant such injunction, on such terms as to the
duration of the injunction, keeping an account, giving security, or other-
wise, as the court thinks fit.
The matter of temporary injunctions is not governed by the Specific Relief
Act.373
Discretionary relief
It should be noted that grant of injunction is discretionary with the
court. Section 36 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 expressly lays down that
"Preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the court by injunction, tem-
porary or perpetual". Therefore the court will grant temporary injunction
if the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) The plaintiff must establish a prima facie case. He is not required to
make out a clear title but he must establish that there is a substantial
question to be investigated and that matters should be preserved in
status quo until the injunction is finally disposed of.
(ii) An irreparable injury would result if the injunction were refused and
that there is no other remedy open to the applicant by which he could
protect himself from the consequences of the apprehended injury.
(iii) The conduct of the plaintiff has not been blameworthy.
(iv) The balance of convenience requires that the injunction should be
granted.375
Interim injunction when perpetual injunction is prayed for
In a suit for specific performance of an agreement to buy land, there was
no prayer for a decree of perpetual injunction restraining the defendant from
transferring the suit land by way of sale to some other person etc., till the
disposal of the suit. But he prayed for an interim injunction which was not
allowed. The court followed its own earlier ruling in which it was said:³77
"It is also a settled principle that in a suit where there is no permanent

374. Ravi Singhal v Manali Singhal, (2001) 8 SCC 1, in an application for interim relief in respect
of a settlement, the court said that it is at the discretion of the court to grant interim relief
and exercise of discretion should not be perverse or irrational.

injunction sought for, in the final analysis, ordinarily a temporary injunc
tion cannot be granted. The principles that govern the grant of a perpetual
injunction would govern the grant of a temporary injunction also."
Disobedience or breach of injunction
Section 94(c) and Rule 2-A of Order 39 of the Civil Procedure Code
(Act V of 1908) provide for the consequences of disobedience or breach of
injunction. Section 94(c) provides:
In order to prevent the ends of justice from being defeated the Court
may, if it is so prescribed... grant a temporary injunction and in case
of disobedience commit the person guilty thereof to the civil prison and
order that his property be attached and sold.
And Rule 2-A of Order 39 provides:
"R. 2-A. Consequence of disobedience or breach of injunction.-(1) In
the case of disobedience of any injunction granted or other order made under
Rule 1 or Rule 2 or breach of any of the terms on which the injunction was
granted or the order made, of the Court granting the injunction or making the
order, or any Court to which the suit or proceeding is transferred, may order the
property of the person guilty of such disobedience or breach to be attached,
and may also order such person to be detained in the civil prison for a term not
exceeding three months, unless in the meantime the Court directs his release.
(2) No attachment made under this rule shall remain in force for more than
one year, at the end of which time, if the disobedience or breach continues, the
property attached may be sold and out of the proceeds, the Court may award
such compensation as it thinks fit to the injured party and shall pay the balance,
if any, to the party entitled thereto."
The above provisions provide for the penalty of either arrest or attachment
of property of the person who has committed disobedience or breach of the
injunction. But the detention in civil prison shall not exceed three months
and the attachment of property shall not remain in force for more than one
year. If the disobedience or breach continues, the property attached may be
sold and out of the proceeds the Court may award such compensation as it
thinks fit to the injured party.
Perpetual injunctions
Section 37(2) lays down that a permanent injunction can be granted only
by a decree at the hearing and upon the merits of the suit. In other words
for obtaining a permanent injunction, a regular suit is required to be filed
in which the right claimed by the plaintiff is examined on merits and finally
the injunction is granted by means of the decree. A permanent injunction
therefore finally decides the rights of parties whereas a temporary injunction
does not do so. A permanent injunction forbids the defendant from asserting

https://t.me/LawCollegeNotes_Stuffs
952 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 38]
a right or committing an act which would be contrary to the rights of the
plaintiff.
Restraint on person or property outside jurisdiction
The court which passed a decree has power to restrain a person from
handing over property in his possession to the judgment debtor (suit prop-
erty) alongwith the title documents and keeping them in safe custody. Such
an order is in the nature of a freezing order, or mareva injunction and order
akin to a Anton piller order even if the property or the person concerned is
outside the jurisdiction of the court. 378
Permanent injunction
Section 38 of the Specific Relief Act states the circumstances in which a
permanent injunction can be granted. It provides:
S. 38. Perpetual injunction when granted.-(1) Subject to the other pro-
visions contained in or referred to by this chapter, a perpetual injunction may
be granted to the plaintiff to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in his
favour, whether expressly or by implication.
(2) When any such obligation arises from contract, the court shall be guided
by the rules and provisions contained in Chapter II.
(3) When the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff's right
to, or enjoyment of, property, the court may grant a perpetual injunction in the
following cases, namely-
(a) where the defendant is trustee of the property for the plaintiff;
(b) where there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage
caused, or likely to be caused, by the invasion;
(c) where the invasion is such that compensation in money would not afford
adequate relief;
(d) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial
proceedings.
Requirements for applicability
The conditions prerequisite to the applicability of this section are-
(1) there must be a legal right express or implied in favour of the applicant;379
(2) such a right must be violated or there should be a threatened invasion;380

(4) the case should be fit for the exercise of court's discretion.381 Where the
inconvenience likely to result from granting injunction is greater than

from doing so, the latter having already admitted the right of the co-sharer to the use of the
passage.
(k) A lets certain arable lands to B for purposes of husbandry, but without any express
contract as to the mode of cultivation. Contrary to the mode of cultivation customary in the
district, B threatens to sow the land with seed injurious thereto and requiring many years to
eradicate. A may sue for an injunction to restrain B from sowing the lands in contravention
of his implied contract to use them in a husbandry-like manner. [Based on Partt v Brett, ILR
(1817) 2 Mad 62: 17 RR 187.]
(1) A, B and C are partners, the partnership being determinable at will. A threatens to do
an act tending to the destruction of the partnership property. B and C may, without seeking
a dissolution of the partnership, sue for an injunction to restrain A from doing the act. [Based
on Miles v Thomas, (1839) 9 Sim 606: 47 RR 320.]

(n) A, B and C are members of an undivided Hindu family. A cuts timber growing on the
family property, and threatens to destroy part of the family house and sell some of the family
utensils. B and C may sue for an injunction to restrain him.
(o) A, the owner of certain houses in Calcutta, becomes insolvent. B buys them from the
official assignee and enters into possession. A persists in trespassing on and damaging the
houses, and B is thereby compelled, at considerable expense, to employ men to protect the
possession. B may sue for an injunction to restrain further acts of trespass.
(p) The inhabitants of a village claim a right of way over A's land. In a suit against several
of them, A obtains a declaratory decree that his land is subject to no such right. Afterwards
each of the other villagers sues A for obstructing his alleged rights of way over the land. A
may sue for an injunction to restrain them.
(q) A, in an administration suit to which a creditor, B, is not a party, obtains a decree for
the administration of C's assets. B proceeds against C's estate for his debts. A may sue for
an injunction to restrain B.
(r) A and B are in possession of contiguous lands and of the mines underneath them. A

(iii) Tort, 35
(iv) Any other legal obligation.
Section 38 expressly states that where such obligation arises from a con-
tract, the court shall be guided by the principles and rules given in connec-
tion with the specific performance of contracts. Thus a permanent injunction
will be granted to prevent breach of contract only in those cases where the
contract is capable of specific performance. It is again made clear by the
language of Section 41(e) which says that an injunction will not be granted
to prevent breach of a contract which is not capable of specific performance.
Section 42, however, says that where a contract comprising of a positive
agreement to do a certain act is coupled with a negative agreement not to do
a certain act, whether expressly or impliedly, the fact that positive part is not
capable of specific performance will not preclude the court from enforcing
the negative part of the agreement by means of an injunction, provided that
the plaintiff performs his part of the contract. For example, A contracts to
sing at B's theatre for one year and not to sing elsewhere. "To sing at B's

of B. B may sue for an injunction to restrain A from so doing. [Based on Routh v Webster,

C, who is B's residuary legatee, proposes to make money by publishing A's letters. D, who is
A's executor, has a property in the letters, and may sue for an injunction to restrain C from
publishing them.
(z) A carries on a manufactory and B is his assistant. In the course of his business, A
imparts to B a secret process of value. B afterwards demands money of A, threatening, in
case of refusal, to disclose the process to C, a rival manufacturer. A may sue for an injunction
to restrain B from disclosing the process. Daewoo Motors India Ltd v Brijendra Prasad, AIR
2003 Del 2, defendant was an employee of the plaintiff company and after severing relation-
ship he started vilification campaign against the company. He, with his brother, started issu-

statutory authorities to take care of the violations. The court issued an injunction restraining
the defendants from harming reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff company.

385. In a case before the Supreme Court an injunction was prayed for directing the Municipal
Corporation, not to issue a licence for running or operating a "bhatti" (baking oven) for a
bakery. The court said: "Insofar as the Municipal Corporation is concerned, the dismissal of
the suit against it by the trial court was not challenged by the plaintiffs by filing an appeal.
Grant of licence is a statutory function to be discharged by the Municipal Corporation. The
licence having already been issued by the Municipal Corporation to appellant-Defendant 1,
the trial court rightly observed that the plaintiffs were at liberty to approach the Municipal
Corporation and seek cancellation of licence or pray for withholding the renewal thereof by
making out a case for the grant of such relief within the framework of the legal provisions
governing the grant and renewal of such licence. In the event of the plaintiffs being illegally
or unreasonably denied relief by the Municipal Corporation, they would be at liberty to
pursue the remedy of appeal or approach the superior authorities within the framework of
the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act or such other remedy as may be available to them in
accordance with law. Kuldip Singh v Subhash Chander Jain, (2000) 4 SCC 50: AIR 2000

theatre for one year" is a contract which depends upon the personal qualifi-
cations or volition of the parties and hence cannot be specifically enforced.
But the negative part of this contract that A will not sing elsewhere can be
specifically enforced. Hence A can be compelled by injunction not to sing
elsewhere. Section 42 corresponds with Section 57 of the earlier Specific
Relief Act and that provision carried certain illustrations which are repro-
duced below. 386
The essence of the section is that where a contract contains both affirm-
ative and negative agreements and although it may be beyond the powers
of the court to compel specific performance of the affirmative part, a party
may be restrained from committing a breach of the negative part, provided
that the plaintiff has performed his part of the contract.
The conditions essential to the applicability of this section are-
(1) the contract must contain two agreements, that is, (i) an affirmative
agreement to do a certain act, and (ii) a negative agreement (express
or implied) not to do a certain act and the negative part must be
capable of being separated from the rest of the contract; and
(2) the applicant must have fully carried out his part of the contract.
The court is not bound to grant an injunction in every case. An injunction
to enforce a negative covenant would be refused if it would indirectly com-
pel the employee either to idleness or to serve the employer. 387
386. Ramesh Kumar v Chaman Lal, AIR 2003 Del 202, the property in question belonged to
the purported seller and his sister, the seller by misrepresenting his exclusive right received
advance, buyer could not get any right, he was allowed refund of his earnest money and
compensation for his loss.
Illustrations
(a) A contracts to sell to B for Rs 1000 the goodwill of a certain business unconnected
with business premises, and further agrees not to carry on that business in Calcutta. B pays
A the Rs 1000 but A carries on the business in Calcutta. The Court cannot compel A to send
his customers to B, but B may obtain an injunction restraining A from carrying on business
in Calcutta.
(b) A contracts to sell to B the goodwill of a business. A then sets up a similar business
close by B's shop and solicits his old customers to deal with him. This is contrary to his
implied contract, and B may obtain an injunction to restrain A from soliciting the customers,
and from doing any act whereby their goodwill may be withdrawn from B.
(c) A contracts with B to sing for twelve months at B's theatre and not to sing in public
elsewhere. B cannot obtain specific performance of the contract to sing, but he is entitled to
an injunction restraining A from signing at any other place of public entertainment. [Based
on Lumley v Wagner, (1852) 1 De GM & G 604.]
(d) B contracts with A that he will serve him faithfully for twelve months as a clerk. A
is not entitled to a decree for specific performance of this contract. But he is entitled to an
injunction restraining B from serving a rival house as clerk.
(e) A contracts with B that, in consideration of Rs 1000 to be paid to him by B on a day
fixed, he will not set up a certain business within a specified distance. B fails to pay the
money. A cannot be restrained from carrying on the business within the specified distance.

Injunctions 957
Again, where the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff's
right to or enjoyment of property, the court may grant permanent injunction
in the following cases:
(i) Where the defendant is a trustee of the property for the plaintiff. For
example, in the course of A's employment as an advocate, certain
papers belonging to his client B, came into his possession. A threat-
ens to make these papers public or communicate their contents to a
stranger. B may sue for an injunction to restrain A from so doing. A
legal practitioner is under an obligation in the nature of trust not to
disclose secrets of his clients. 388
(ii) Where there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage
caused, or likely to be caused by the invasion:
For example, A pollutes the air with smoke so as to interfere mate-
rially with the physical comfort of B and C, who carry on business
in the neighbourhood. B and C may sue for an injunction to restrain
A from polluting the air. The installation of an electric transformer
in front of the plaintiff's land causing nuisance, hindrance and
obstruction to free access to the highway was restraint by issuing
a permanent injunction. There was nothing to show that consent of
the landowner was taken or sanction of any statutory authority was
arranged.389
(iii) Where the invasion is such that compensation in terms of money
will not afford adequate relief, for example, A, a professor of law,
delivers lectures to his students, the lectures being his own literary
composition, he does not communicate such lectures to the whole
world. These lectures are the property of the professor and not of
the students. A is entitled to restrain the students from publishing the
notes without his consent.
(iv) Where it is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings.
The suit was for an injunction simpliciter. The ownership of the plaintiff
was not disputed. But the defendants threatened to invade the plaintiff's
right to enjoy his plot. The court said that a simpliciter suit for an injunction

the decree for permanent injunction was to be set aside. Mohd Abdullah Butuk v Zainab

and ignoring material evidence, set aside. Yamuna Nagar Improvement Trust v Khariati Lal,
(2005) 10 SCC 30: AIR 2005 SC 2245, the plaintiff in the first proceedings failed to prove his
case, his suit was liable to be dismissed, by the time of the second proceedings, the land had
become vested in the State free from all encumbrances and the plaintiff had no right, title or
interest in it, his second suit was also liable to be dismissed.

958 Chapter 16 Specific Relief Act, 1963
[S. 38]
The grant of discretionary relief, such as an injunction, is equitable in
nature. It must be granted, inter alia, on considerations of equity and jus-
tice. The appellant who was himself guilty of inequitable conduct could not
claim such relief. He obtained possession under the order of an Authority
that had no jurisdiction. The respondent deserved in equity to be put back
into possession so as to restore the status quo ante. The order of restoration
deserved no interference. 391
An injunction cannot be issued in favour of a trespasser against the true
owner. Where the plaintiff fails to establish his legal right to the property
or his legal right to continue in possession, he could not be granted perpet-
ual injunction against the owner or the manager of the property. The fact
that a trespasser has established his possession and, therefore, cannot be
thrown out except by court orders does not entitle him to an injunction.³ 394
Where two persons were in joint possession and enjoyment of property,
one of them was not allowed to seek a mandatory injunction to exclude the
other from the property and leave it for exclusive enjoyment of the plaintiff.
The title to the property was in dispute. The court would have to determine
the title to the property first after giving opportunity to both parties. The
plaintiff was not entitled to final relief merely on the basis of possession. 395
Injunction to restrain possession
If an issue relating to a flaw in the title of the person in possession is
not raised, the parties to the suit or those claiming under them would be
estopped from challenging the flawed title in any future suit based on title.
The title to the suit property in this case was flawed for not being written
or registered. The person who claimed a permanent title to restrain his pos-
session had not challenged his title on that basis. Accordingly, when he sold
the suit property to a third person, the latter was also estopped from chal-
lenging the flawed title on the ground of non-registration in the suit filed for
declaration of title and possession. The court said that the unregistered title
of the allottee of the suit from a Cooperative Housing Society is better than
the claim based on an unregistered relinquishment of ownership of the suit
property.39

Suppression of material facts
Where the vendor seeking the relief of permanent injunction against the
vendee suppressed the material fact that he was still under dues towards the
vendee, the court said that he was not entitled to the discretionary relief of
permanent injunction.197
Order for rescuing arbitration process
Where one of the parties was attempting to sabotage the arbitration pro-
cess, the court emphasised its role in providing underlying support. The
power to grant an injunction by way of a specific relief is covered by the
1963 Act. Specific relief is one of the types of relief available for preventing
breach of an obligation.39*
Refusal of injunctive relief
Section 41 lays down the circumstances when perpetual injunction will
be refused by the court. In other words, Section 41 lays down the defences
that can be raised against the prayer for grant of an injunction. It provides:
S. 41. Injunction when refused.-An injunction cannot be granted-
(a) to restrain any person from prosecuting a judicial proceeding pending at
the institution of the suit in which the injunction is sought, unless such
restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of proceedings,399
(b) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in
court not subordinate to that from which the injunction is sought
(c) to restrain any person from applying to any legislative body;
(d) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in
a criminal matter;401

others. An injunction was granted against him.

sought to be sold in execution of decree. Perpetual injunction sought to stay execution.
Declaration of title was sought on the basis of unregistered will, which was also suspicious
and not genuine. But the defendant become successful in putting the property in execu-
tion of the decree and the other defendant became successful bidder. The court declined
interference.
400. SBI v Madhumita Construction (P) Ltd, AIR 2003 Cal 7, the expression "court" does not
include the Debts Recovery Tribunal either for purposes of appeal or revision. The High
Court cannot stay further proceedings pending before the Tribunal in the exercise of the

person or authority from lodging an FIR. A temporary injunction cannot be issued where
permanent is not possible.

(e) to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of which would not
be specifically enforced;
(f) to prevent, on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is not reasona-
bly clear that it will be a nuisance;
(g) to prevent a continuing breach in which the plaintiff has acquiescenced;
(h) when equally efficacious relief can certainly be obtained by any other
usual mode of proceeding except in case of breach of trust;402
() when the conduct of the plaintiff or his agents has been such as to disen-
title him to the assistance of the court;403
() when the plaintiff has no personal interest in the matter.
Illustrations in preceding 1877 Act
This section corresponds with Section 56 of the repealed Specific Relief
Act, 1877. That section carried the following illustrations:
(a) A seeks an injunction to restrain his partner, B, from receiving the partnership debts and
effects. It appears that A had improperly possessed himself of the book of the firm and
refused B access to them. The Court will refuse the injunction.
(b) A manufactures and sells crucibles, designating them as "patent plumbago-crucibles",
though in fact they have never been patented. B pirates the designation. A cannot
obtain an injunction to restrain the piracy.
(c) A sells an article called "Mexican Balm", stating that it is compounded of divers rares
essences, and has sovereign medicinal qualities. B commences to sell a similar article to
which he gives a name and description such as to lead people into a belief that they are
buying A's Mexican Balm. A sues B for an injunction to restrain the sale. B shows that A's
Mexican Balm consists of nothing but scented hog's lard. A's use of his description is not
an honest one and he cannot obtain an injunction. [Based on Perry v Truefitt.404]
In a suit by a coparcener for a permanent injunction for restraining the
Karta or manager of the joint Hindu Family from transferring the joint fam-
ily property in pursuance of a sale agreement with a third party, it was held
402. Thus where a wrong can be compounded in money, compensation will be an equally effi-
cacious relief. But in such a case also if the defendant is an insolvent or pauper, a decree for
damages would be a mere mockery and therefore the court may grant injunction. R. Ramani
v Shanthi Damodaran, AIR 2011 Mad 60, acquisition of ownership on the basis of unpro-
bated Will, transfer by such a person not valid, no question of ordering specific performance
against him.
403. This clause incorporates the maxim: "He who comes to equity must come with clean hands."
For example, where an article name as "Mexican Balm" is said to be consisting of rare medic-
inal qualities, but which really is nothing but an ordinary ointment, the vendor's description
being dishonest no injunction can be issued to restrain another dealer from selling a similar
article under the same name in order to misguide the people. Premji Ratansey Shah v Union
of India, (1994) 5 SCC 547 at p. 550, no injunction can be issued in favour of a trespasser or
a person who gained unlawful possession as against the true owner. S. Jaffarval v B. Pedda
Siddaiah, AIR 2003 NOC 219 (AP) no injunction was granted to a person about whom the
official report was that he was not in possession of the land in question. This report was veri-
fied by the court finding of fact. The finding was not interfered with. M.S. Madhusoodhanan
v Kerala Kaumudi P Ltd, (2004) 9 SCC 204: AIR 2004 SC 909, application for permanent
injunction against obstruction to peaceful enjoyment of office premises, suit filed two years
after the obstruction began. Refusal of injunction was held to be improper. The right to
enjoyment of property could not be taken to be extinguished by inaction for two years.

that such an injunction could not be granted. The court said that though in
the case of waste or ouster an injunction may be granted against the manager
but a blanket injunction restraining permanently from alienating the family
property, even in the case of legal necessity, cannot be granted. The court
further said that Section 38 of the Act has to be read with Section 41. As
the coparcener has an adequate remedy to impeach the alienation under the
family law, he cannot, in view of Section 41(b) move the court for an injunc
tion restraining the Karta from alienating the coparcenary property.405
A suit was filed by the occupant corporation for restraining demolition
and dispossession. The corporation had already been dispossessed. The land
in question was required by the owner railways for its own public purposes.
The corporation having not opposed the notice of termination, accepted its
correctness be it termination of rights as lessee or licencee. The court said
that even if the dispossession was wrongful, the right and entitlement of the
corporation to continue in possession had come to an end. No injunction
could be granted.406
Mandatory injunctions
S. 39. Mandatory injunctions.-When, to prevent the breach of an obliga-
tion, it is necessary to compel the performance of certain acts which the court
is capable of enforcing, the court may in its discretion grant an injunction to
prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel performance of the req-
uisite acts.
The injunction which commands the defendant to do something is termed
as "Mandatory Injunction". Salmond defines mandatory injunction as "an
order requiring the defendant to do a positive act for the purpose of putting
an end to a wrongful state of things created by him, or otherwise, in fulfil-
ment of the legal obligations, for example, an order to pull down a building
which he has already erected to the obstruction of the plaintiff's lights".407
Section 39 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, reads: "When, to prevent the
breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel the performance of certain
acts which the court is capable of enforcing, the court may in its discretion.
grant an injunction to prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel
performance of the requisite acts."
Illustrations in old Act of 1877
This section corresponds with Section 55 of the repealed Specific Relief
Act, 1877. That section carried the following illustrations:
(a) A, by new buildings, obstructs lights to the access and use of which B has acquired a
right under the Indian Limitation Act, [now Limitation Act, 1963] Part IV. B may obtain

an injunction, not only to restrain A from going on with the buildings, but also to pull
down so much of them as obstruct B's lights.
(b) A builds a house with eaves projecting over B's land. B may sue for an injunction to pull
down so much of the eaves as so project.
(c) In the case put as Illustration (i) to Section 54, the Court may also order all written com-
munications made by B, as patient, to A, as medical adviser, to be destroyed.
(d) In the case put as Illustration (y) to Section 54, the Court may also order A's letters to be
destroyed.
(e) A threatens to publish statements concerning B which would be punishable under
Chapter XXI of the Indian Penal Code. The Court may grant an injunction to restrain the
publication, even though it may be shown not to be injurious to B's property.
(f) A, being B's medical adviser, threatens to publish B's written communications with him,
showing that B has led an immoral life. B may obtain an injunction to restrain the publi-
cation.
(g) In the cases put as Illustrations (v) and (w) to Section 54 and as Illustrations (e) and (f)
to this section, the Court may also order the copies produced by piracy, and the trade
marks, statements and communications, therein respectively mentioned, to be given
up or destroyed.
When a mandatory injunction is granted under this section, two ele-
ments have to be taken into consideration: In the first place, the court has
to determine what acts are necessary in order to prevent a breach of the
obligation; in the second place, the requisite acts must be such as the Court
is capable of enforcing. These acts may assume a variety of forms, e.g.
pulling down of a building as in Illustration (a) above, the pulling down
of caves as in Illustration (b), the destruction of written communications
and letters as in Illustrations (c) and (d), destruction of copies produced by
piracy of copyright and of trade marks improperly used by the defendant as
in Illustrations (v) and (w) of former Section 54, set out under Section 38
above, and Illustration (g) above.
A mandatory injunction for eviction of a gratuitous licensee or a per-
son in permissive possession upon revocation of permission by the owner is
possible. Its grant by the trial court was held to be proper. 409 Such person
in possession is entitled to an order for retaining his possession or claim for
repossession.410
When not granted
Mandatory injunction, however, will not be granted in the following
cases:
(i) Where compensation in terms of money would be an adequate relief
to the plaintiff.
(ii) Where the balance of convenience is in favour of the defendant.

(iii) Where the plaintiff is guilty of allowing the obstructions to be com-
pleted before coming to the court, i.e. where plaintiff has shown
acquiescence in the acts of the defendant.
(iv) Where it is desired to create a new state of things. Mandatory injunc-
tion, as is clear, is granted to restore status quo. It cannot be granted
to create a new state of things. Thus, it was held by the Allahabad
High Court in Sheo Nath v Ali, that where the defendant con-
structed a structure which interfered with the privacy of the plain-
tiff's house, he could not be ordered to erect a wall on the roof, so as
to prevent a view of the plaintiff's house from the roof.
In a dispute between a brother and his sister, the background was that
the sister constructed a house adjacent to that of her brother and the brother
actively participated in the construction activity and also allowed her to
take the support of his wall. He never objected. Two years later, he changed
his mood and claimed removal or demolition of the construction. The trial
court refused to order demolition but granted an order against further con-
struction. Such order was held to be proper. The order of the appellate court
for demolition by resorting to the Easements Act, 1882 was held to be not
proper since an easementary right was never claimed. 412
Damages in lieu of or in addition to injunction [S. 40]
S. 40. Damages in lieu of, or in addition to, injunction.--(1) The plain-
tiff in a suit for perpetual injunction under Section 38, or mandatory injunction
under Section 39, may claim damages either in addition to, or in substitution for,
such injunction and the court may, if it thinks fit, award such damages.
(2) No relief for damages shall be granted under this section unless the plain-
tiff has claimed such relief in his plaint:
Provided that where no such damages have been claimed in the plaint, the
court shall, at any stage of the proceedings, allow the plaintiff to amend the
plaint on such terms as may be just for including such claim.
(3) The dismissal of a suit to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in
favour of the plaintiff shall bar his right to sue for damages for such breach.
This section provides that the plaintiff in a suit for perpetual injunction
under Section 38, or mandatory injunction under Section 39, may claim
damages either in addition to, or in substitution for, such injunction, and the
court may, if it thinks fit, award such damages. The plaintiff has specifically
to include in his plaint a claim for damages also. If he has not done so, he
may seek permission of the court for the amendment of his pleadings. But
where a suit, in which damages were not claimed, is dismissed, a subsequent
separate suit for damages would not lie. The court can award damages in
lieu of injunction where the injury is threatened though not yet caused. The

House of Lords in Leeds Industrial Coop Society Ltd v Slack,13 laid down
that damages could be allowed to a person whose tenement is sure to suffer
loss of his right to light when a planned building structure comes up. Where,
for example, a person happened to raise his building to encroach upon the
land of his neighbour up to three inches, the court allowed the neighbour
compensation instead of an order for demolition of the building." Damages
have also been allowed under this principle where information delivered in
confidence was put to use.41

Contract and Specific Relief by Dr. Avtar Singh is an authoritative and most sought
after book on the subject. The book deals with the intricacies of contract law in a
straightforward and lucid style. It covers many new developing areas in contract law
which are of practical and academic importance.
The current twelfth edition of the book has been thoroughly revised and updated
by the author. The book covers recent decisions on issues arising out of modern day
trade and commerce, which have thereby contributed to the development of the law
on the subject. For example, whether an agreement entered into by e-mail process,
though not signed by parties has binding effect; whether BCCI can have an interest in
events organised by the Board; whether pledgee's right for his dues prevails over all
other rights and claims; and whether privity of contract is necessary for seeking
specific performance.

Reviews
"This book on the law of Contract by Avtar Singh, a distinguished
author is more comprehensive than an equivalent American book as it
covers additional topics such as agency, some aspects of partnerships,
bank guarantees and bailment."-Law Books in Review, U.S.A.
"The book includes chapters on quasi-contracts, contracts of
indemnity, guarantee, bailment, pledge, and agency. Copious
reference is also made to English as well as to the Indian cases and
statutes." - Malaya Law Review (Faculty of Law, National University
of Singapore)
