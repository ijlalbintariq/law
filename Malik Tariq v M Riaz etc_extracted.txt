That, plaintiff in agreement to all the terms executed the cheque of amount Rs.300,000/-, numbered 1116349273 dated 07.02.2023 of the Branch of Bank of Punjab, on Ali View Garden main Bedian Road, Lahore (‘cheque no.2’), as a collateral and/or guarantee.

That a written agreement was executed dated 07.03.2022 (‘agreement no.3’), vide stamp paper no. 4 marked as serial no. PB-LHR-9E2317D77E95ABE0, dated 02.03.2022, issued through Iqram Ayub Bhatti Stamp vendor, Shalimar Link Road Branch Lahore, between plaintiff and defendant no.3, which has already matured on 07.03.2023 (Copy of the agreement no.3 is attached with the plaint for kind perusal of the learned court as Annexure 5- the original document is with the defendant no. 3). 

That as per agreement defendant no.3 invested cash of Rs.150,000/- capital in plaintiff’s fruit business. 

That perusal of the agreement shows that the intention of defendant no.3, was also to become a sleeping partner in the fruit business, and to receive profits on daily basis; recover the capital investment by the maturity date of the agreement i.e., 07.03.2023.

That, plaintiff in agreement to all the terms executed the cheque of Rs.150,000/-, numbered 1313248401 dated 03.03.2024 of the Branch of Bank of Punjab, on Ali View Garden main Bedian Road, Lahore (‘cheque no.3’), as a collateral and/or guarantee.

Fruit Business

That plaintiff avers that he was competently carrying out his fruit business operations from Lahore since 2020. He usually buys seasonal fruits through a broker in bulk quantity, from Quetta and Waziristan, to sell them as a wholesaler to retailers in Lahore. The usual mode of payement for the consignment is in cash and no receipts were ever given of the payment as brokers are reliable source to buy the product in contention. Defendants approached plaintiff to invest in his business, as mentioned above, on different dates, given his good and flourishing reputation. 

That plaintiff and defendants went in to a partnership, where defendants were the sleeping partners and plaintiff was responsible for buying and selling the seasonal fruits including logistics. As per agreement plaintiff had submitted profits in the form of cash to the defendants on many occasions. Plaintiff and defendants’ partnership flourished for a year and more, as evident from the clause 4, of the first three agreements, where defendants had contemplated to extend the agreement period beyond one year maturity date of their respective agreements. 

That however, plaintiff ordered a consignment of apples between late August and early September of 2022, which costed him Rs. 16,00,000/-. Plaintiff investment consisted of 50% of the capital i.e., Rs. 8,00,000/- and rest of the 800,000/- investment belonged to defendants in this instant case. 

That the consignment was to be delivered on trucks to plaintiff in Lahore from Quetta and Waziristan, but due to act of God, circumstances out of plaintiff’s reach and unforeseeable disaster (flooding), trucks were stuck at the place of crossing at their respective area. Where they were stuck for 14 days due to continuous flooding and apples in the truck went rotten, which were later wasted. Plaintiff went himself and took one of his workers to visit the area, where disaster occurred and inspected the situation and the consignment of apples. The inspection shown that the consignment was positively rotten and had to be destroyed, and plaintiff informed the defendants of the loss that they have suffered, equally. Therefore, the case falls under the ambit of frustration of contract, which make the all three agreements mentioned in the preceding paragraphs liable to be void. 

That to plaintiff’s amazement, defendants started to demand unreasonably about return of their invested capital in the fruit business. Plaintiff on several occasion explained the nature of their partnership but of no avail. Therefore, on 12.04.2023, Defendants attacked plaintiff at his residence, in that attack they threaten of dire circumstances for him and his family, in case, plaintiff does not return their invested capital amount, respectively. Defendants also took away three-specific movable properties, which were not even the part of the three original. The description whereof is scribed in clause 4 of the agreement no.4.  

Agreement no. 4 mentioned in preceding paragraph was between plaintiff and all defendants. Which was purportedly executed without plaintiff’s free will, with undue influence through dangerous people accompanying them and coercion by implicating about dire consequences for him and his family, if plaintiff does not execute and sign the fourth agreement. The details where of is given in the next paragraphs.

AGREEMENT No.4 (PUNCHIAT NAMA) BETWEEN P & D1-D3 DATED: 12.04.2023

That a written agreement (‘agreement no.4’) was purportedly executed between plaintiff and defendants dated 12.04.2023, which will mature on 11.07.2023 (Copy of the agreement no. 4 is attached with the plaint for kind perusal of the learned court as Annexure 7- the original document is with the defendant no.1).

That the perusal of the agreement shows that in addition to above mentioned material facts, plaintiff had previously receipted a cash amount of Rs. 150,000/- in the form of capital investment from defendant no.1 as sleeping partner, vide stamp paper no. 1 dated 23.08.2021, serial no. T80283, entry no. 160, issued by M. Javed stamp vendor Al Faisal Town Lahore Cantt, license no.139. Therefore, the total capital invested by defendant no.1 comes to Rs. 350, 000/-.

That clause 2 shows that the total capital investment made by the defendants in plaintiff’s fruit business was Rs.800,000/-, in the following division/manner:

defendant no.1’s total capital investment is Rs. 350,000/-;

defendant no.2’s total capital investment is Rs. 300,000/-;

defendant no.3’s total capital investment is Rs. 150,000/-.  

The maturity of the fourth contract is set to be on 11.07.2023, by when defendant unreasonably demand return of their total capital invested in to plaintiff’s fruit business.

That plaintiff submits that defendants induced him without free consent, with undue influence and coerced him to agree and sign the fourth agreement, by threatening his family’s wellbeing and his, therefore, fourth agreement was made on wrong pretexts.

That under the garb of the fourth contract, defendants induced and/or coerced plaintiff to execute following three cheques as guarantee of return of their total invested capital, belonging to his account in Branch of Bank of Punjab, Main Bedian Road, Lahore, which are advertently and maliciously not mentioned in the fourth contract- 

Cheque no. 4, numbered 1313248449;

Cheque no. 5, numbered 1313248447;

Cheque no. 6, numbered 1313248448.

(Copy of the cheque no. 4,5,6 is attached with the plaint for kind perusal of the learned court as Annexure 8,9,10, respectively- the original cheques are with the defendants).

That it is pertinent to mention here about the latter cheques that Plaintiff has forgotten what amount he had scribed on those cheques or whether he has even written any amount, due to the pressure at that moment.     

That further defendants with undue influence and deceit took without permission following specific movable property belonging to plaintiff and his friends as provided in clause 3 of the fourth agreement-

defendant no. 1 took loader Riskha as a guarantee against the return of his total invested capital amount of Rs. 350,000/- by plaintiff;

defendant no. 2 took Motorbike CG-125, Bike no. LEK-7803 as a guarantee against the return of his total capital amount of Rs. 300,000/- by plaintiff;

defendant no. 3 took real/original file of Mehran Car no. LWR-3343 and related documents, Chassis no.986627, White color, belonging to Syed Muhammad Afzal Shah S/o Muhammad Anwar Shah, NIC no. 35202-2533989-5, as a guarantee against the return of his total capital amount of Rs. 150,000/- by plaintiff.

That it is essential to mention here that plaintiff did not give any consent for any of the cheques and specific movable properties mentioned in paragraphs 29 & 31, respectively, to be taken as guarantee. However, defendants with undue influence, coercion and without plaintiff’s free will executed the fourth agreement and took specific movable properties and cheques with them.

That the cause of action arose in favor of the Plaintiffs and against the defendant No.2 and the concerned authorities due to aforesaid facts and circumstances and it is continuing. 

That since the cause of action arose at Lahore the parties to the suit resides at Lahore, hence this Honorable court has jurisdiction to adjudicate in the matter. 

That the value of the suit for purposes of court fee and jurisdiction is fixed at Rs.800,000/-. The court fees will be submitted to the honorable court as per its order.   



PRAYER:

	It is respectfully prayed that agreement no. 1, 2, and 3 may be rescinded and/or declared void due to frustration of contract, consequentially first three cheques (labelled 1,2,3) given as guarantee in the latter mentioned contracts may be cancelled in the interest or justice and equity. 

	Further, prayed that agreement no. 4 may be cancelled due to execution under undue influence, coercion and without free consent. Consequently, all three later cheques (labelled 5,6,7) taken under the garb of the agreement no.4 and maliciously not mentioned in the fourth contract taken as guarantee may be cancelled too, in the interest justice, equity and fair play. 

	It is also prayed that defendants may be directed to deposit all the specific movable properties mentioned in the clause 3 of the agreement no.4, in to this Honorable Court.  

	Lastly prayed that a permanent injunction may be granted against defendants for not presenting all the six cheques anywhere and defendant may be restrained from approaching plaintiff at his home to threaten him with dire consequences, in the interest of public policy, justice and due process of law.  		

	Any other relief which this Hon’able Court deems fit may also be awarded.

APPLICATION UNDER ORDER XXXIX, RULE 1 & 2 OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, 1908 FOR GRANT OF TEMPORARY INJUNCTIONS





Respectfully Sheweth;





That the petitioner has filed the accompanying suit before this Honorable Court, the contents of which may kindly be read as an integral part of this application for temporary injunctions and no date of hearing has been fixed so far.



That the Petitioner has a good prima facie and arguable case in their favor.



That petitioner is a reputable businessman and has established wholesale fruit business. Defendants approached plaintiff to invest in his business as a sleeping partner but due to act of God and /or natural disaster, beyond the control of plaintiff, the consignment of goods containing apples was destroyed. Plaintiff and defendants equally suffered the loss. Therefore, it is a case of frustration of contract, which must be adjudged by the Honorable court on merits. Further, plaintiff was made to sign the fourth contract under due influence, coercion and without his free consent. Therefore, plaintiff also has a good case for cancellation of documents including all the cheques taken under the garb of guarantee. Plaintiff has all the proves related to the matter and has annexed the copies whereof with the plaint but the originals of the documents are with the defendants as they are the dominant party.

 

That therefore, the balance of convenience also lies in favor of the Petitioner.



That the petitioner will suffer irreparable loss if the defendants are not restrained from cashing all the cheques and approaching plaintiff and/or his family for their detriment.





PRAYER







It is therefore respectfully prayed that during the pendency of the instant suit, all defendants, its employees, agents, or any other person acting for and/or on its behalf, directly or indirectly be restrained from taking any steps/actions towards cashing all the cheques issued on behalf of Plaintiff.
