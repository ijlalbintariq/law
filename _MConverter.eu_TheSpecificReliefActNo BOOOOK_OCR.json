PREFACE.
NEXT to the XII Tables the Prætorian Edict ranks as the
most important source of Roman law.
in the Edict was a declaration of the
In form each item
Prætor that under
given circumstances he would grant an action or a special
defence. The perpetual edict was thus a collection of
actions supplementing and amending the Twelve Tables.
The Chancellor of the King acted in England somewhat
in the way in which the Prætor had acted at Rome (1)
creating and enforcing supplementary or improved reme-
dies where the common law gave none or only inadequate
ones.
The Specific Relief Act collects many of the cases where
the ordinary remedy by damages could not be obtained or
if obtainable was inadequate and incompetent to offer that
entire justice which demanded an actual specific perform-
ance of the legal obligation sometimes with sometimes with-
out damages according as circumstances should require.
The Act though a most useful legislative measure is not
a complete code of all the cases in which the Chancellor
played so important a part as a legal reformer. But most
of the omitted cases have been provided for in other Acts
of the Legislature. The Indian Trusts Act deals with the
administration of trust property. (2) The Civil Procedure

PREFACE.
Code regulates the taking of the accounts of a deceased
person. (1)
The Transfer of Property Act carries into effect all the
subsidiary rights involved in the redemption and foreclosure
of the right to redeem in the reconveyance or sale of
mortgaged property. (2) And the Contract Act together
with the Civil Procedure Code determine when a partner-
ship may be dissolved and how the complicated rights of
the partners amongst themselves and of the creditors of the
firm may be adjusted. (3) And lastly that most compre-
hensive legislative measure, the Insolvency Act furnishes
a method of realizing the assets of insolvent individuals
partners and firms. (4)
In annotating any act of the Legislature which defines
the remedy but not the right it is the duty of the commen-
tator to explain with sufficient fulness the rights which
were in the contemplation of the legislator. Such rights
being very numerous the province of the author has been
very extensive. He has however endeavoured to occupy it
thoroughly and to give to both the student and the practi-
tioner all adequate information.
Lord Macaulay and his successors have acted wisely in
appending illustrations to the dry statement of legal prin-
ciples contained in their codes. The simply stated princi-
ple dignifies the illustration and raises the ordinary pursuits
of life whence the illustrations are drawn to the level of
arts and sciences. On the other hand the illustration

illuminates as well as gives precision to the principles, takes
away from the dryness of the subject and embellishes it
with a kind of poetic painting. While too the codifiers
have arranged the principles in order and thereby facilitated
the comprehension of their logical force the illustration is
calculated to make a deeper impression on the memory and
to habituate the mind to the practice of the rules of justice.
And now to the students of Equity and to the practitioners
in the High Courts and in the Mofussil we commend our
treatise, trusting that they will find it very useful.

A declaratory decree cannot be obtained where it is open to
the plaintiff to ask for an account of moneys received by him
under a certificate of heirship and for payment of moneys not

clause.
Obligation.'
3. In this Act, unless there be
something repugnant in the subject
or context, -
obligation' includes every duty
enforceable by law:
Obligation duty may arise from trust, contract or tort.
obligation is defined as "vinculum lægis quo alicui astringi-
mur.”
'trust.'
'trust' includes every species of
express, implied, or constructive fidu-
ciary ownership:
"Trust." Mr. Griffith's edition of the Indian Trusts Act will
give the reader clearer notions of the different species of that
source of rights and duties called Trusts.
Mr. Stokes suggests that the following improvements might
be made in the Act. The classification of trusts should har-
monize with that of Act II of 1882.
Section 10 should show that when the court compels the
delivery of title deeds it may impose terms.
It should also be stated whether laches is a defence in a suit
for specific performance that a decree can be made coupled
:

with an award of indemnity, and also that decrees can be made
where the subject-matter of the contract is land out of British
India if the defendant is within the local jurisdiction. The
discretion of the court in the appointment of receivers should
be explained by illustrations.
The Indian Trusts Act, see Griffith's edition, Chap. IX classes
constructive and resulting trusts under the head of quasi trusts
or obligations in the nature of trusts. It will be seen on a
cursory inspection of the section that such a definition of a con-
structive trust differs from that of the present section. Some
resulting trusts are implied trusts; others are constructive
trusts.
Voluntary trusts for the payment of creditors are usually by
deeds in the first instance revocable by the debtor which, how-
ever, become irrevocable settlements on the creditors becoming
parties or quasi parties thereto. A creditor by altering his
position on faith of the deed obtains rights against the trustee.—
Johns v. James, 8 Ch. D. 744. But as long as the trustee is only
trustee for the debtor the creditor cannot intermeddle.-Garrard
v. Landerdale, 3 Sim. 1 Re. D'Angibau, 15 Ch. D. 242.
In Cave v. Mackenzie, 46 L. J. Ch. 564, a case of sale of im.
moveable property to an agent it was held that immediately the
contract was signed the estate passed to the true purchaser from
the vendor. In Heard v. Rilley, L. R. 4 Ch. 548, the real pur-
chaser was allowed at the same time to establish the agency and
enforce the contract against the vendor. In Bartlett v. Pichers-
gill, 477n, though the agent was convicted of perjury it was held
that after conveyance to him the statute of frauds, s. 7, requir
ing a trust to be in writing debarred the real purchaser of a
remedy. In the case of James v. Smith, 1891, 1 Ch. 384 the
court of first instance followed Bartlett v. Pichersgill. The
Statute of Frauds, s. 7, has been repealed in India, but Griffith's
Indian Trusts Act, s. 5, p. 30, shows that writing is still requisite
in most trusts affecting immoveables. The author, however,
suggests that Cave v. Mackenzie is a good authority and that the
proviso as to Illustration (a) is an implied trust. Illustrations
(b) to (h) are constructive trusts.
The proper sense of the word contingency signifies any event
which is uncertain future and not belonging to the very nature

(a.) Z bequeaths land to A, 'not doubting that he will pay
thereout an annuity of Rs. 1,000 to B for his life.' A accepts
the bequest. A is a trustee within the meaning of this Act for
B to the extent of the annuity.
(b.) A is the legal, medical, or spiritual adviser of B. By
availing himself of his situation as such adviser, A gains some
pecuniary advantage which might otherwise have accrued to B.
A is a trustee for B within the meaning of this Act of such
advantage.
(c.) A, being B's banker, discloses for his own purpose the
state of B's account. A is a trustee within the meaning of this
Act for B of the benefit gained by him by means of such dis-
closure.
(d.) A, the mortgagee of certain leaseholds, renews the lease
in his own name. A is a trustee within the meaning of this
Act of the renewed lease for those interested in the original
lease.
(e.) A, one of several partners, is employed to purchase
goods for the firm. A, unknown to his co-partners, supplies
them, at the market-price, with goods previously bought by
himself when the price was lower, and thus makes a consider-
able profit. A is a trustee, for his co-partners, within the mean-
ing of this Act of the profit so made.

(f.) A, the manager of B's indigo-factory, becomes agent for
C, a vendor of indigo-seed, and receives, without B's assent,
commission on the seed purchased from C for the factory. A
is a trustee, within the meaning of this Act, for B, of the com-
mission so received.
(g.) A buys certain land with notice that B has already con-
tracted to buy it. A is a trustee, within the meaning of this
Act, for B, of the land so bought.
(h.) A buys land from B, having notice that C is in occu-
pation of the land. A omits to make any inquiry as to the
nature of C's interest therein. A is a trustee, within the mean.
ing of this Act, for C, to the extent of that interest.
Words precatory and recommendatory as in the Roman law
they might so with us they may create an implied trust. Parsons
v. Baker, 18 Ves. 476, Griffith's Institutes 51.-Eaton v. Watts,
L. R. 4 E. C. 151. But positive gifts, possible trusts and dis-
cretionary powers require careful discrimination.
"Where there is a power to appoint part of a settled fund, the
execution of the power takes the part appointed entirely out of
the settlement; although, therefore, the beneficial interest in it
is not in terms immediately disposed of, yet there can be no result-
ing trust for the benefit of any person under the deed creat-
ing the power; for where the principal of a fund is appointed
it must be considered as if it had never been comprised in the
trust, because it is absolutely taken out of it by the execution of
the power. Therefore, where a wife, under a settlement of her
personal property, which was settled on herself and her husband
and the survivor, and was afterwards to be laid out in land to be
settled on the heirs of her body by him, remainder to the sur-
vivor in fee, had a general power to appoint 1,5001, part of the
money, and she did appoint it to a trustee, to pay to her nieces
1,500l. and 500%. respectively when twenty-one or at marriage ;
it was held, that the sum was wholly taken out of the settle-
ment, and that there was no resulting trust, and the trustee
having the whole capital money in his hands for the benefit of
the cestuis que trust, the capital would draw the interest with
it."-Sugden's Powers, 8th ed., p. 467.
The above doctrine is important with reference to succession
and legacy duty.—A.-G. v. Brackenbury, J. (63), 257.

PRELIMINARY.
[SEC.
The court cannot execute a power where the donee declines to
do so.-Sugden's Powers, ch. xi, s. 6, 8th ed., p. 588. But in
laying down this broad rule we must be careful to distinguish
between mere powers and powers in the nature of trusts. The
distinction between a power and a trust is marked and obvious.
"
'Powers," as Chief Justice Wilmot observed, are never im-
perative.—A.-G. v. Lady Downing, Wilmot, 23. They leave the
act to be done at the will of the party to whom they are given.
Trusts are always imperative, and are obligatory upon the con-
science of the party intrusted." But sometimes trusts and
powers are blended; a man may be invested with a trust to be
effected by the execution of a power given to him, which is in
that case imperative; and if he refuse to execute it, or die
without having executed it, Equity, on the general rule that
the trust is the land, will carry the trust into execution at the
expense of the remainderman, and without any regard to the
person in whose favour it is to be executed being a mere volun-
teer, and not a purchaser, creditor, wife or child. This is the
case where a power is given by a will to trustees to sell an estate
and apply the money upon trusts. The power is in the nature
of a trust. The legal estate, until the execution of the power,
of course descends to the heir at law, and if the power be
defeated at law by the death of the person to whom it was given,
the legal estate would ramain in the heir at law for his own
benefit; but Equity, acting upon the trust, will compel the heir.
to join in the sale of the estate for the purposes designated by
the testator.
On the other hand, the discretion to be exercised in the exe-
cution of a power must be distinguished from the bare trust:
e. g., a testator devised real estate to trustees, and gave them
a power of granting leases for the term of twenty-one years.
The trustees disclaimed the trust, and the heir at law, who was
tenant for life of a moiety, granted a lease: Lord Chancellor
Westbury held that the lease was invalid.-Robson v. Flight, J.
(65), 147; Tempest v. Lord Camoys, W. N. 67, 296.
In King v. Denison, Lord Eldon pointed out the distinction
between gifts by will upon trusts, and gifts by will subject to
trusts.-1 P. & B. 260; cited Clarke v. Hilton, by V.-C. S., 2 E.
C. 810. "If I give to A and his heirs all my real estate charged
with my debts, that is a devise to him for a particular purpose,

Page 32
3.]
PRELIMINARY.
7
but not for that purpose only. If the devise is upon trust to
pay my debts, that is a devise for a particular purpose and
nothing more, and the effect of those two modes admits just
this difference: The former is the devise of an estate of inherit-
ance for the purpose of giving the devisee the beneficial-estate
subject to a particular purpose; the latter is a devise for a par-
ticular purpose, with no intention to give him any beneficial
interest."
Equity gives relief in transactions tainted by undue influence
not only against the persons acting unduly but also against
third persons who while innocent of actual fraud yet with notice
or without consideration participate in the benefit. Thus a
debtor induced his niece, lately a ward of court, to join in a
guaranty. The creditors taking it with notice of the relation
and that she received no consideration for it relief was given
against them.-Maitland v. Irving, 15 Sim. 43. Innocent rela-
tions will have to surrender the prey.-Bridgman v. Green,
2 Ves. 627. But purchasers for valuable consideration without
notice may retain the property.-Basset v. Nosworthy, 2 L. C.
in Eq. 1; Blackie v. Olark, 15 Bea. 595.
Confirmation or acquiescence may validate avoidable trans-
action which is the origin of a constructive trust. But the con-
firmation is not sufficient unless the donor knows that it will
validate a voidable transaction and that the transaction was
itself voidable. It must not be done under the force pressure
or influence of the former transaction it must be separate and
distinct from it and not a mere conveyance executed in conse-
quence of a contract or covenant connected with it.-Morse v.
Royal, 12 Ves. 370. Similarly when a party defends by plead-
ing acquiescence he must unequivocally show knowledge in the
person acquiescing.-Randall v. Errington, 10 Ves. 428.
The same principle appears in the fiduciary relations of parent
and child, guardian and ward, trustee and beneficiary. See
Griffith's Institutes of Equity and Indian Trusts Act, p. . The
burden of proving fairness in the transaction falls upon the
person taking the advantage. Griffith's Indian Evidence Acts,
188-240 and L. R. 1 Ind. App. 206.
See Griffith's Institutes of Equity.-Constructive Trusts, and,
Bentley v. Oraven, 18 Bea. 75, fraud by a partner on the firm.

Notice. See Griffith's Trusts Act, s. 3 and Griffith's Transfer
of Property Act, s. 3.
(g.) "Contracted to buy." The better opinion is that the
word contract here excludes the requirements of the Registra-
tion Act and so far adopts the principle of the cases decided on
the English Statute of Fraud. See note to section 4 (c.)
Questions of notice are partly questions of law partly of fact,
for the definition see Griffith's Trusts Act, 1882, s. 3.
"Will or Codicil." As to the trusts thereof, see s. 12, cl. (a)
and s. 30.
By the "Indian Contract Act, 1872," the words proposal,
promise, consideration, agreement, contract, are interpreted.
Coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, mistake
are defined.
(h.) Where a person purchases or advances money on pro-
perty, having at the time actual or constructive notice that a
third person already has a prior right to or over the property,
such prior right carries with it in Equity priority of remedy.
A disregard of notice which is actual, not resting on rumour
nor the statements of strangers, but coming from the person
interested, is not to be distinguished from positive fraud. Con-
structive notice, however, creates a constructive trust properly
so called.
Whenever, in the investigation of title or otherwise, recitals
in deeds or other circumstances exist which ought to have put
the
person on inquiry, and which would have led to the discovery
of another's interest, Equity considers the person neglecting to
make the inquiry bound by the other's interest.
Thus neglect to call for title deeds may give an equitable
mortgagee, or other person holding the same, priority, though
production of documents, without an opportunity of examining
them, may not.-Brumfit v. Morton, V.-C. 8., J. (57), 1198.
A condition not to call for the lessor's title fixes with notice
of the same.—Robson v. Flight, L.-C. W., J. (65), 147.
Information of a partial restriction is constructive notice of
the whole covenant.—Wilson v. Hart, V.-C. W., J. (65), 730.
A lis pendens creating an incumbrance is constructive notice.

The Indian Contract Act, 1872, defines the words proposal,
promise, promisor and promisee, consideration, agreement, reci-
procal promises, void agreement contract, contingent contract,
voidable contract, void contract; (2) consent, free consent,
coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation. As to words

Settlements are either voluntary or for a valuable consider-
ation. An intended marriage however no less than money is if
solemnized valuable to support an agreement for settlement
of property on the parties married and their issue. Griffith's
Institutes of Equity.
Destination refers to the persons indicated by the terms of
the settlement: devolution to the transfer of the property by
operation of law, as the law of inheritance, without act of the
parties. Settlements are sometimes merely covenants, the trusts
whereof are executory and require some further act of convey-
ancing to carry out the trusts and change them into executed
trusts or they contain express trusts in the first instance. See
Griffith's Institutes, p. 31. Lord Glenorchy v. Bosville cases
Talbot 3 a leading authority on this subject, is as follows: A
devised real estate to his sister Band C and their heirs and assigns
upon trust until his granddaughter D should marry or die to
receive the profits and thereout to pay her £100 a year for her
maintenance; the residue to pay debts and legacies and after
payment thereof in trust for the said D; and upon further trust
that if she lived to marry a Protestant of the church of England
and at the time of such marriage be of the age of 21 or upwards
or if under that age such marriage be with the consent of B, then
to convey the estate with all convenient speed after the marriage
to the use of the said D for life without impeachment of waste
voluntary waste in houses excepted remainder to her husband
for life remainder to the issue of her body with remainders over.
Lord Chancellor Talbot held that though D would have taken

the trust being executory was to be executed in a more care-
ful and accurate manner and that a conveyance to D for life
remainder to her husband for life with remainder to their first

But a most important distinction obtains between volun-
teers and persons possessing a valuable consideration. For the
assistance of the court cannot be had without consideration to
constitute a party cestui que trust as upon a voluntary covenant
to transfer stock, &c., but if the legal conveyance is actually
made constituting the relation of trustee and beneficiary as if
the stock is actually transferred, &c., though without consider-
ation the equitable interest will be enforced.-Eldon, L. C.,

P by a voluntary settlement assigned to trustees certain debts
specified in the schedule thereto owing to him on the security
of certain bills of sale in such schedule also specified and all
interest therein respectively. And he directed the trustees to
get in the debts and empowered them to do whatever was neces-
sary for that purpose. The settlement contained no express
assignment of the bills of sale nor of the chattels contained
therein; but the redemption clauses in the bills were to the
effect that on payment of the money due they should be void.
No notice of the assignment was ever given to the debtors. P
died having received from the debtors the debts in question.
Held, that the settlement amounted to a complete assignment of
the debts that the want of notice did not render the gift incom-
plete and that the settlor's estate was liable to account to the

exhibits the points in which it approaches and in which in
respect of part performance it differs from the Indian.
Specific Performance.
Where the common law remedy of damages for a breach of
contract is not adequate, equity will decree a specific perform-
ance. We have already stated that the common and ordinary
contracts fall within the jurisdiction of the Common Law Courts,
because where expedition is required, and a similar thing or
article to that contracted for, whether consols or a carriage
horse, is easily procured, damages meet the equity of the case.
On the other hand, a contract for a particular house or piece of
land must be specifically performed. The Year Book, 8 Edw.
IV. 4 b. exhibits the early origin of the remedy.—Cf. Moly-
neux's Case, temp. Charles I.
An agreement to lend a sum of money is not enforced in
equity.-Sichel v. Mosenthal, J. (62), 275, M. R. Articles of
partnership may be, but the court will hesitate if there exists
ill will between the parties. Sale of shares in a partnership
may be enforced.-Homfray v. Fothergill, 1 E. C. 567. Still
more the sale of shares in a company ordered to be wound up.—
Paine v. Hutchinson, 3 E. C. 257 ; L. J. 2 D. & S. 283. Though
the payment of an annuity might extend over several years,
yet specific performance was decreed at the suit of the grantee.
The Ship Registry Acts forbid the application of this doctrine
to contract regarding the ownership of a ship, yet contracts
regarding the proceeds of the sale of a ship or the produce of
freight are enforced.-Armstrong v. Armstrong, 21 Beav. 78.
The Merchant Shipping Amendment Act, 1862, while keeping
the register clear from notice of trusts, enacts that equities may
be enforced against owners and mortgages in the same manner
as equities may be enforced against them in respect of any other
personal property.-Sect. 3. Specific performance of a contract
to construct a railway is beyond the powers of the court to control,
and therefore has been refused.-Peto v. The Brighton, Uckfield
and Tonbridge Railway Company, “The Times,” 26th June, 1863.
Turner, L.J., held, affirming the decree of the Master of the
Rolls, that a covenant, for the use of a railway and harbour
might be enforced; Bruce, L.J., dissented.-Wilson v. West
Hartlepool Railway and Harbour Company, J. (65), 124. But

specific performance of an award to execute a lease of a right
to use a railway has been refused.-Blackett v. Bates, 1 Ch.
Ap. 117. Argumentum ab inconvenienti plurimum valet.
An agreement to let a house for three years at a yearly rent,
bound the landlord to grant the tenant a lease for a term, from
the expiration of the three years' occupancy, at the same rent,
the tenant to keep the house in repair. Romilly, M.R. decreed
specific performance four years after the expiration of the three
years.-Moss v. Barton, 1 E. C. 474; 21 & 22 Vict. c. 27
enables the Equity Courts to give damages where there is a
right to specific performance. But the damages are given as
an incident to and not in substitution of the usual remedy.-
Lewers v. Earl of Shaftesbury, 2 E. C. 270.
It is sometimes said that there must be mutuality in the
contract. By this is meant mutuality of remedy, not of consi-
deration, for absence of the latter would, as at law, vitiate the
contract itself. And the rule refers to cases where something
is to be done, that is, where one promise is made in consider-
ation of another. As equity cannot well enforce the substantial
performance, it usually leaves the parties to their common law
remedies.—The cases on Railways, p. 111. To this rule there
seems to be an exception when a party, who is freed from
liability by the Statute of Frauds, prays for specific performance
of a contract touching land. But a person seeking equity being
bound to do equity in this case a mutuality arises when plaintiff
files his bill.
Contract for the Sale of Land.
This contract is so frequently to be met with in counsel's
chambers, and so often calls for adjudication by an equity judge,
that in justice to our readers we shall consider it somewhat in
detail. Sometimes these contracts are in the form of particu-
lars of the property and conditions of sale, signed in accordance
with the Statute of Frauds by the parties or their agent the
auctioneer. At other times in the form of articles of agreement,
also signed in like accordance. The terms relate to the price,
deposit, title, evidence, abstract, time of payment, and convey-
ing, interest, and remedy for misdescription, &c. Each of these
heads might form the subject of a chapter, as is the case in the

able works on Vendors and Purchasers by Lord St. Leonards
and Mr. Dart. Our method, however, does not permit us to
enter upon the common law doctrines further than they are con-
nected with equity, and of the equity doctrines many are noticed
in other parts of this work.
In both departments of the law a rescission of the contract
by either party is allowed when the other is unable or un-
willing to perform his agreement; except that in equity-
(1) Time is not of the essence of the contract; (2) If there
be but a small defect in the quantity or quality of the
estate or title, specific performance with compensation will be
decreed.
80
If such misrepresentation or fraud is practised as to ground
on action for deceit, the conveyance, even though executed,
may in equity be set aside. Inadequacy of price, unless so
gross as to be conclusive evidence of fraud, or unless accom-
panied with circumstances of imposition and oppression, is no
bar to the discretion of the court in granting specific perform-
ance. Acquiescence bars a remedy and confirmation releases a
right. If the parties have been at arms-length a subsequent
discovery of another objection is no ground for fresh resistance.
-Russian Vyksounsky Iron Works Company, 3 E. C. 790.
Where the contract itself is founded on fraud or oppression,
acquiescence, whilst he is under the same difficulty and embar-
rassment, will not of itself bar his title to relief. To give validity
to a confirmation of a voidable conveyance the party confirming
must not be ignorant of his right, still less can his right be
concealed from him by the other party. He must further know
that the transaction is impeachable; and with such knowledge
and under no influence his execution of the deed must be
sponte suå. Knowing not only the fact of the defect of title,
but also its consequences in law, he must be a free agent, not
under the influence of the previous transaction.
If there is no valid rescission of the contract, and yet one
party without a defence on the ground of fraud, surprise, mis-
take or otherwise objects to complete the sale or purchase, the
other party, if he thinks damages at law an unsatisfactory
remedy, may file a bill in equity praying that the agreement
be specifically performed, that proper directions be given for a

the title from the vendor. Stuart, V.-C., and the Lords Justices,
held that the defendant was not at liberty to show aliunde that
the plaintiff's vendor had no title. On the usual references the
chief clerk certified that the plaintiff could not show a good title;
but, it appearing that the defendant had since the purchase
acquired the means of curing the defect, leave was given to
amend or file a supplemental bill.-Nicholl v. Jowell, 3 E. C. 396,
is another noteworthy case. By the will of A, made in 1838,
real estate was appointed to B, a married woman. By a subse-
quent will of 1858, the whole of A's property, real and personal,
was given to E. The will of 1858 was propounded by E, and
probate was opposed by D, the heir at law of A. In the course
of the trial a compromise was made. The compromise was
signed by C, the husband of B, for himself and wife, and who,
though not a party to that suit, was present in court, and by
D's attorney for D and B, though without any express autho-
rity from B.
In a suit for the specific performance of the compromise, Wood,
V.-C., held that though the married woman and her husband had
taken the full benefit of the arrangement, and only at the last
moment dropped the mask, yet specific performance must be
refused, as the formalities required by the Act for Abolition of
Fines and Recoveries to bind her estate had not been observed.
The minutes of the final decree for specific performance usually
are as follows :—The vendor is supposed to be the plaintiff. The
corresponding changes for a vendee plaintiff are easily made:-
"Declare that the agreement in the plaintiff's bill mentioned,
dated
ought to be specifically performed and carried into
execution, and decree the same accordingly: (1) And let interest

conveyance to be settled by the judge in case the parties differ,
and delivering to the defendant upon oath all deeds or writings
in their custody or power relating to the said estate, the defend-
ant pay to the plaintiffs the balance which shall be certified
to remain due to them in respect of such money and interest
(and costs). Liberty to apply."-Seton on Decrees, 607.
Specific Performance of Agreements of land on the ground
of Part Performance.
While treating of specific performance of agreements relating
to lands it seems more convenient to notice at the same time
certain incidental doctrines which in principle appertain to the
chapter on Frauds. The Statute of Frauds, it may be remem-
bered, required contracts such to be in writing and signed by
the party to be charged. Where though such an agreement
fails to satisfy the requisites of the statute, yet one of the
parties has been induced or allowed by the other on faith in
the agreement to alter his position, as, for instance, by taking
possession, expending money in buildings, or other like acts of
part performance, there equity considers it unconscientious
that the statute should be insisted upon. Part performance
resting on evidence, the application of the doctrine must be
learnt from examples. We may premise that an inchoate
agreement gives no more title to relief at equity than at law,
and that the acts relied on must be referable to the agreement.
—Price v. Salusbury, J. (63), 838.
Entrance into possession is an important circumstance, so is
expenditure of money in repairs or improvements. Payment of
the purchase-money does not entitle to specific performance. In
Millard v. Harvey, J. (64), 1167, where a father-in-law had
promised that his son-in-law should occupy a house during life,
the Master of the Rolls held that the making of repairs did not
take the case out of the statute.-In Nunn v. Fabian, J. (65),
868, Cranworth, L.C., enforced specific performance of a parol
agreement to grant a lease, where the most important if not
the only evidence of part performance was a signed receipt
for a quarter's rent at the increased rate to be paid under the
lease. In accordance with the general doctrine, some of the
judges have felt themselves bound to introduce in some manors

[SECS.
a species of tenant right, that is, a right to a long lease after
permitted expenditure in building. However, a majority of the
judges in the House of Lords have otherwise settled the law.-
In Ramsden v. Dyson and Thornton, H. L., 1 E. & I. 129. It
was held, that if a stranger begins to build on land, supposing
it to be his own, and the real owner, perceiving his mistake,
leaves him to persevere in his error, a court of equity will not
afterwards allow the real owner to assert his title to the land.
But if a stranger builds on land, knowing it to be the property
of another, equity will not afterwards prevent the real owner
from claiming the land, with the benefit of all the expenditure
upon it. So if a tenant builds on his landlord's land, he does not,
in the absence of special circumstances, acquire any right to
prevent the landlord from taking possession of the land and
buildings when the tenancy has determined.
The making of a will, in accordance with a parol promise of
settlement before marriage will not on the ground of part per-
formance take the case out of the statute.-Caton v. Caton,
1 C. A. 137.
Previously to a marriage the intended husband and wife
agreed in writing that the husband should have the wife's pro-
perty for his life, he paying her 80%. a year as pin money, and
that she should have it after his death. They gave instructions
for a settlement upon that footing. The settlement was accord-
ingly prepared, when they agreed that they would have no
settlement, the husband promising, as the wife alleged, that he
would make a will giving her all her property. The marriage
took place, and the husband made a will accordingly. After his
death a subsequent and different will was found. Lord Cran-
worth held, "that marriage being necessary in order to bring a
case within the statute, to hold that it also takes the case out
of the statute would be a palpable absurdity. And further, that
the nature of the alleged agreement was such as hardly to
admit even on the part of the party to be charged of anything like
part performance. As a will is necessarily until the last moment
of life revocable, a contract to make any specified bequest, even
when a will having that effect has been duly prepared and
executed is in truth a contract of a negative nature, a con-
tract not to vary what has been so executed, I do not see how

21
there can be part performance of such a contract." The deci-
sion has been affirmed in the House of Lords.-W. N. (67),
158.
Where a parol variation of a contract has been in part per-
formed, a decree for specific performance may be obtained.
Though there be a written contract, parol evidence is admissible
in equity in all cases of fraud and mistake, and even to prove
the total abandonment of a contract.
Specific relief 5. Specific relief is given-
how given.
(a) by taking possession of certain property and
delivering it to a claimant;
If a broker or auctioneer does nothing more than settle the
price as between vendor and purchaser of goods and takes his
commission, he is not liable for conversion if it should turn out
that the vendor is not entitled to sell; the broker or auctioneer
merely acting as a conduit pipe. But where an auctioneer
receives goods into his custody and on selling them hands them
over to the purchaser with a view to passing the property in
them he is to be treated as having converted the goods and is
liable to an action accordingly his case differing from that of a
packing agent or carrier in that they merely purport to change
the position of goods not the property in them.-Barker v. Fur-
long, Romer, March 23, 1891.
(b) by ordering a party to do the very act which
he is under an obligation to do;
(c) by preventing a party from doing that which
he is under an obligation not to do;

parties otherwise than by an award of compen-
sation; or

The court may restrain by injunction the commission of
criminal acts which affect rights of property which the court
is bound to protect.-Gee v. Pritchard, 3 Swans. 413.
The word "mere" is of considerable force. For infringe-
ments of civil rights though offences against a Penal Law may
be restrained by injunction. Thus an injunction may be obtain-
ed to prevent the publication of libels injurious to trade or
property. Thorley's Cattle Food Co., 6 Ch. D. 582, 14 Ch. D.

15 Ch. D. 514, 9 Ch. D. 356. Further when the cases raised in

not permit the same person at the same time to pursue both
remedies.--Saull v. Browne, L. R. 10 Ch. 64; Mayor of Yorke
Ch.64;
v. Pilkington, 2 Atk. 302.
See note to section 55e.
Slander of goods is similar in all respects to slander of per-
sons: in some cases the slander is privileged. Persons having
an interest in a subject may say what is untrue of that subject
if they do so in good faith, the interest must be special and not
general like that of a trader who wishes to prevent a rival sell-
ing goods in which he deals himself-special that is, in the sense
of expecting a benefit from the subject-matter respecting which
the slander is uttered. In this category are persons who have
a charge upon the subject-matter who are patentees protecting
their own title or supposed rights. Where this interest does
not exist there is no protection and the law must imply malice
from untruth precisely as it does in ordinary actions for slander.
The three ingredients of the action are (1) falsity; (2) malice;
(3) special damage. It was doubted by Lord Bramwell in the
case of Western Counties Manure Company v. Lawes Ohemical

Manure Company, whether malice is necessary: in our opinion
it is. As Lord Justice Lindley remarked very little would
persuade a Jury that a slander which was untrue was uttered
dishonestly.
66
The case of Hair v. Geddes, decided by Mr. Justice Kekewich,
1890. February 9–14, may be taken as a fair example of the
circumstances in which an injunction may be conveniently
granted in a case of libel. The dispute was between rivals in
trade one of whom had had recourse to the extensive circulation
of defamatory pamphlets for the purpose of discrediting the
other. The Judge remarked that they were libels with regard to
which no jury could hesitate to find a verdict and therefore he
ought not to hesitate to exercise the jurisdiction of the court
for the purpose of restraining them." The injunction therefore
went and with it an order for £25 damages. The damages with-
out the injunction would have afforded but poor protection or
consolation to the successful litigant. But while in such a case
and on final judgment an injunction is a legal weapon of the
greatest value and efficacy an interlocutory injunction stands
upon a very different footing. Mr. Justice North, J.J., 1891,
Feb. 16. The evidence is usually incomplete and the damage
not ascertained. See s. 55e.

Where the value is peculiarly within the knowledge of the
plaintiff he must prove its amount. Griffith's Evidence Acts.
But where the defendant is guilty of force or fraud and will
not produce the article the value is presumed to be the highest
value of an article of the kind.-Armory v. Delamirie.
The measure of value of title-deeds is that of the estate which
they represent to be reduced to a nominal value on their being
surrendered.—Loosemore v. Radford, 9 M. & W. 657. The value
of a bill or security is its fare value or its value in the hands
of the plaintiff if it had not been lost.
The defendant being a wrongdoer cannot reduce the damages
by the cost of keeping the articles nor by setting up the title
or interest of a third person. But where the plaintiff relies on
title not on possession it may be disproved.-Gadsden v. Burrow,
9 Em. 514. A bailee is entitled to recover against a stranger
the full value but against the owner only in proportion to his
special interest.-Story on Bail., 352.
When severed goods are detained their value at the time
without deducting the cost of severance or an increase arising
from severance is the measure of damages.-Weld v. Holt,
9 M. & W., 672.
The defendant being in the wrong cannot deduct an increase
in value of the goods arising from an act of his as an act altering
their form.-Reid v. Fairbank, 13 C. B. 692. Nor can he deduct
the value of goods which he has confused with the plaintiffs.
The plaintiff may claim the value at time of demand or at
time of trial.-—Frame v. Gaudet, L. R. 6 Q. B. 204. From the
market value at the principal or only place of sale is to be de-
ducted the cost of conveyance.-Burmah v. M. Mahomet, L. R.

by hand be an incomplete transfer of the property represented
the property in the paper passed.-Barton v. Gainer, 3 H. & N.
387. Though the finder of an article can maintain detinue
against a person wrongfully depriving him of it he is not himself
liable to detinue after losing it.-Armory v. Delamirie, 1 Str. 505,
Com. Digest Detinue D. The rule is different where a defend-
ant is guilty of negligence as when a solicitor loses his client's
deeds not by mere accident.-Reeve v. Palmer, 5 C. B. N. S. 91.
A deposit with a stranger by two or more persons interested
therein does not entitle one alone to bring detinue.-Atwood
v. Ernest, 13 C. B. 881. A specific coin which can be identified
and a bag or chest of money may be recovered in detinue.
Fitzherbert Nat. Brev. 138.
Jenkin's Cent. 207. But where a debtor sends his creditor
half a bank note intending afterwards to send the second half
in satisfaction of his debt the property in the first half so sent
remains in the sender until he remits the second half and the
creditor is bound to restore it to him on demand.-Smith v.
Mundy, 3 E. & E. 22.
The damages in detinue are generally nominal. But the value
of the articles detained should be ascertained and the judgment
will be that the plaintiff except in cases coming within section 11
recover the articles, or in the alternative the article with the
damages and costs found and the costs of increase.
But special
damages for the detention may be claimed in the plaint and
recovered.-Phillips v. Jones, 15 Q. B. 859; Williams v. Archer,
5 C. B. 318. Detinue was brought for stock certificates which
were returned pendente lite. Held, that the jury might confine
themselves to an assessment of damages. In this case the pro.
perty was demanded, the stock was worth £3-5-0 when it was
delivered it had fallen to £1 and the plaintiff was held entitled
to recover the difference.-Williams v. Archer, 5 M. G. & S. 318.
A carrier if he makes no inquiry as to the contents of a box
may have to pay the value of any jewelry contained therein ;
but the carrier would not be liable on loosing a dentist's instru-
ment to pay for the profits and earnings which might have been
made if the loss had not occurred, but he is liable for the natural
consequences of his delay such as deterioration in the worth of
the goods. Damages may be recovered by the owner of a ship

unloading one or more days beyond the time allowed; such
damages are called demurrage but they are governed by express
contract independently of detinue. The defendant may protect
himself by proving leave and license. But such defence is not
supported by showing a delivery by the plaintiff to the defend-
ant in the supposed performance of a contract which never
existed.—Gregson v. Ruck, 4 Q. B. 737. Where a deposit or
pledge is part of an illegal or immoral agreement and both parties
are equally to blame the plaintiff cannot recover.—Taylor v.
Ohester, L. R. 4 Q. B. 309.
Unlike what used to be the rule in the English law the
defendant has no option to pay the damage and retain the
goods. See Griffith's Civil Procedure Code, s. 259.
If a bailee is defending on behalf of a third person and by
his authority he may avail himself of the title of such third
person in an action of detinue by the bailor.-Rogers, Sons & Co.
v. Lambert & Co., C. A. 1891, 1 Q. B. 318.
The injury complained of is not the taking which is a trespass
nor the misuse and appropriation of the goods which is trover
or conversion. See and consider the forms of plaint for these
wrongs in Griffith's Civil Procedure Code, pp.306-7The deten-
tion must be an adverse and wrongful one. The best proof that
it is adverse is evidence that the plaintiff demanded the goods
and that the defendant refused to deliver them.
Explanation I.-A trustee may sue under this sec-
tion for the possession of property to the beneficial
interest in which the person for whom he is trustee
is entitled.
Where the beneficiary is in occupation of chattels under a
trust by leave of the trustee the trustee has an immediate right
of possession sufficient to enable him to bring an action of trover.

S. 411.
Where there is in the plaintiff a right of possession coupled
with a title to the goods though the title may be liable to be
defeated by the claim of a third person, yet if that third person
has not intervened, a wrongdoer cannot set up the right of the
third person as an answer against him by the plaintiff. S. C.

Where an auctioneer receives goods into his custody and sells
them and hands them over to the purchaser with a view of pass-
ing the property in them he has converted the goods. And if
his customer had no title to sell, the auctioneer is liable to the
true owner notwithstanding that he acted in good faith. S. C.
Explanation II.-A special or temporary right to
the present possession of property is sufficient to
support a suit under this section.
Illustrations.
(a.) A bequeaths land to B for his life, with remainder to
C. A dies. B enters on the land, but C, without B's consent,
obtains possession of the title-deeds. B may recover them from C.
(b.) A pledges certain jewels to B to secure a loan. B dis-
poses of them before he is entitled to do so. A, without having
paid or tendered the amount of the loan, sues B for possession
of the jewels. The suit should be dismissed, as A is not entitled
to their possession, whatever right he may have to secure their
safe custody.
(c.) A receives a letter ad dressed to him by B. B gets back
the letter without A's consent. A has such a property therein
as entitles him to recover it from B.
(d.) A deposits books and papers for safe custody with B.
B loses them and C finds them, but refuses to deliver them to
B when demanded. B may recover them from C, subject to
C's right, if any, under section 168 of the Indian Contract Act,
1872.
(e.) A, a warehouse-keeper, is charged with the delivery of
certain goods to Z, which B takes out of A's possession. A may
sue B for the goods.
On the death of a tenant for life the reversioner may recover
the deeds from a person with whom the tenant for life has depos
sited them as a security for a loan.-Easton v. London, 33 L. J.

mortgagor however handed them to a banker as security for a

parting with the estate recover them.

that B is entitled to recover the deeds from C.-Loathes v. Leathes,

of custody is one of convenience and common benefit rather than
of title.—Elton v. Elton, 6 Jur. N. S. 136. But a co-tenant may

having a limited or ulterior interest which is not too contingent

This illustration is a bailment of pledge. A bailment is the
delivery of goods by one person to another for some purpose
upon a contract that they shall, when the purpose is accomplish-
ed, be returned or otherwise disposed of according to the direc-
tions of the person delivering them. Contract Act, 8. 148.-

Either the bailor or bailee may sue for an injury by a third
person to the property bailed and compensation will be appor-
tioned according to their respective interests, ss. 180, 181.
A deposited debentures with B as security for payment of a
bill of exchange indorsed by A and discounted by B on the
agreement that B should have power to sell or otherwise dis-
pose of the debentures if the bill should not be paid at maturity.
Before maturity, B deposited the debentures with C to be kept
by him as security until the repayment of a loan from C to B
larger than the amount of the bill. The bill was dishonored, and
while it still remained unpaid A brought detinue against C for
the debentures. Held, that the repledge by B to C did not put
an end to the contract of pledge between A and B and B's
interest and right of detainer under it, and that A therefore
could not maintain detinue without having paid or tendered

The general rule is that one who has received property from
another as his bailee or agent or servant, must restore or account
for that property to him from whom he received it.-Biddle
v. Bond, 6 B. & S. 225. To allow a depositary of goods or money
who has acknowledged the title of one person to set up the title
of another who makes no claim, would enable the depositary to
keep for himself that which he does not pretend to have any
title in himself whatsoever.-Betteley v. Reid, 4 Q. B. 511. A
bailee may nevertheless though not evicted set up and rely upon
the title of a third person when he defends the possession upon
the right title and authority of the third person.—Thorne v.
Tilbury, 3 H. & N. 534. A bailee may equally with a tenant if
there has been what is equivalent to eviction by title paramount
show that the title of his bailor to the goods has expired since
the bailment.-Shelbury v. Scolsford, S. C. & Yelv. 22.
In an action for wrongful detention of certain copper which
had been bailed by the plaintiffs to the defendants as warehouse-
men to hold to the plaintiffs' order the defendants sought to
administer interrogatories as to whether the plaintiffs had not
since the date of the bailment sold the copper to a firm of M.
K. & Co., and been paid the price and whether they had not in-
dorsed and handed to M. K. & Co., delivery orders in respect of
the copper. It appeared that M. K. & Co. were claiming the
copper from the defendants but it was admitted that the latter
were defending the action in their own interest alone and not
under the authority of M. K. & Co. Held, that the defendants
could not as ageinst the bailors set up the title of third parties
under whose authority they did not claim to defend, and that
consequently the fails to which the interrogatories were directed
not affording any defence to the action the interrogatories must
be disallowed.-Rogers & Co. v. Lambert & Co., 24 Q. B. D. 573,
C. A. 1891, 1 Q. B. 318.
The property of the receiver of letters is only a qualified one
and the sender may restrain their publication.-Gee v. Pritchard,

to preserve the goods and find out the owner, but he may retain
the goods against the owner until he receives such compensation
and where the owner has offered a specifie reward for the return
of goods lost, the finder may sue for such reward and may retain
the goods until he receives it.”—C. A. 168.
The finder is not bound to take charge of the thing, but doing
so incurs the ordinary responsibility of a bailee. Should he
refuse to deliver it up, he keeps it entirely at his own risk how-
ever it may be damaged and becomes liable to pay interest or
compensation for it. Excuses however are not refusals and the
finder is entitled to a reasonable time in which to satisfy himself
of the claimant's title. He has no rigdt to impose unreasonable
conditions, or to be exorbitant to his terms. Story on Bail. 85,
621.—Pillot v. Wilkinson, 10 Jur. N. S. 991. Information lead-
ing through a long series of causes to the arrest of a thief or
finding of an article entitles as a rule to the reward.—Tarner v.
Walker, L. R. 2 Q. B. 301.
Absolute property, special property, possession and the right
of possession may each entitle to an action. A bailor has an
absolute property, a bailee special property. A finder has such
possession. And a failor who is a consignee is an example of
the last cause of action; so also is a person fraudulently de-
prived of an article. Griffith's Civil Procedure Code, Sch. 4,

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS.
[CH. 11,
contrasted with executed contracts. An executory contract is
one which is not intended between the parties to be the final
instrument regulating their relations: an executed contract is
one which is intended to be final.-Selborne O. Wolverhampton
Ry. Co. v. L. & N. W. Ry. Co., L. R. 16 Eq. 439.
Actions for specific performance of executory contracts differ,
remarks Mr. Justice Fry, from actions for the performance of
trusts in that a contract being a legal right and a trust an
equitable one the remedy for breach of the former is in the
alternative specific performance or damages, the remedy for the
latter only the equitable one of specific performance. Fry on
Specific Performance, p. 11. But this difference though inter-
esting on historical grounds is now not very material in prac-
tice. The learned Judge's words are—
"From actions for specific performance we must distinguish
those cases in which by reason of fraud or the breach of some
fiduciary relationship a constructive trust arises. Cases some-
times of a mixed nature have arisen: as for instance, when
by a contract to give up part of an estate if purchased.
A persuaded B not to compete with him as a purchaser. On
A's refusal to abide by his contract, B might have sued him
alleging at once the contract, and the breach of A's duty as
agent." Fry, p. 12.-Chattock v. Muller, 8 Ch. D. 177.
Mr. Justice Fry in his treatise on the specific performance of
contracts, wrote, § 6, "It is certain that the Roman law gave a
title to damages as the sole right resulting from default in per-
formance and did not enforce specific performance directly or in
any other manner than by giving such a right to damages. It
held to the maxim "Nemo proecise cogi ad factum." For this
sweeping and all comprehensive negative, Pothier, the French-
man, Jr. Ides Obl. Pt. Ch. II, Art. 2, § 2, is the only authority cited.
Had other authorities been cited, we should still have held them
insufficient when weighed against the texts of Gaius and Justi-
nian's Institutes and Digest. If we take the three contracts:
Depositum, Commodatum, Pegnus, we find that they possessed a
common quality that the entrusted thing whether it belonged to
the giver or not did not pass into the owership nor indeed with
the exception of the pegnus into the juristic possession of the
debtor and had to be restored in specie differing therein from

35
the mutuum where repayment of a like quantity of the same
kind of article was the remedy enforced. Even in the mutuum
the remedy is more akin to specific performance than to what
the English lawyer technically calls damages. Quasi contracts
also entail a large amount of specific performance and when
Augustus gave validity to trusts he necessarily sanctioned their
specific performance. 3 Justinian's Institutes, 14 Digest, 12
I. G. Gaius 3 G. O.
To all conveyances per æs et libram was added a contractus
fiduciæ, the breach of which was punished with the civil and
political disabilities of infamy.
Under the most ancient forms of Roman procedure, namely,
the legis actiones the judge always gave back the thing itself.
Gaius IV. 16. In the more modern form, namely, in the formu-
lary actions a change was introduced. Gaius IV. 48. We need
not dwell on the symbolical and pantomic acts in the most
ancient actio sacramenti in which the parties physically took
possession of the slave in dispute the turf the twig the brick
the sheep which represented the land the tree the house or the
flock. Of the next action "prejudices postulationem the injured
state of the manuscript of Gaius prevents us being so positive.
It was employed with regard to obligations. It was conducted
either by a judge or an arbitrator with more equitable powers
and the presumption therefore is that the arbiter could grant
specific performance. Five hundred and ten years after the
foundation of Rome the Lex Selia introduced the action of
condictio where the obligation was for giving a definite sum and
ten years afterwards the Lex Calpurnia extended the scope of
the action to all obligations for any certain definite thing. These
legal actions though superseded in a great measure by the Lex
ebritia A. U. C. 573 and afterwards in the time of Augustus
by the Leges julia were long retained in cases where the
centumviri were judges that is in questions of querelian
ownership and succession. In the second epoch of procedure
when actions with definite formulas came into use and any-
thing was sought to be recovered the condemnation in damage
was only in the alternative nisi restituat unless the defendant
restores. The magistratus moulded the formula according to
the circumstances of the case and it is no violent presumption
to suppose that nisi restituat was frequently replaced by nisi

[CH. II,
faciat nisi perficiat. The actiones arbitrariæ. Gaius IV. 47,
were, says Sandars, § 108, "especially adapted to secure the
plaintiff receiving the particular thing which had been the sub-
ject of a contract and not its money value." The language of
the interdicts-as to which see Griffith's Institutes of Equity
is “Vim fieri veto-exhibeas-restituas," "I forbid you to have
recourse to violence. You are to produce-you are to restore.”
In the third that is Justinian's epoch of procedure the con-
demnation was not merely a pecuniary one the execution trans-
ferred to the emptor bonorum the entire persona or legal
existence of the debtor the most complete of all specific per-
formances.
The passage cited from Pothier lays down what was French
law for only one species of contract. Though he asserts that
according to the law of France an obligation to do a thing does
not entitle the creditor or obligee to compel its being done;
yet he continues and says that an obligation not to do may be
directly enforced in such a case as a right of way which is
interrupted by a barrier or a ditch. Either of these obstacles
the owner of the right may compel the delinquent to destroy or
do so himself. Two further remarks may be made. Pothier is
speaking of obligations generally not merely of those by con-
tract. And the maxim "Nemo potest præcisè cogi adfactum"
is not necessarily a maxim of the Roman Civil Law because it
is expressed in Latin. We would not rashly assert that it is not
to be found in any of the numerous books of Justinian. But
the interpretation placed upon it is alien to the fifteenth and
seventy-fifth of the rules of law. Qui actionem habet ad rem
recuporandam ipsam rem habere videtur nemo potest mutare
consilium suum in alterius injuriam. In French law the obli -
gation to give by marriage settlement will and testament or
otherwise is enforced specifically.
In Justinian's system we find touching contracts of sale.
(1) Actio empti whereby the seller could be compelled to
perform his obligations or pay compensation. It was however
a condition precedent that the buyer should have paid the price
or offered it.
(2) Actio redhibitoria whereby the contract could be rescind-
ed in consequence of faults in the thing sold. The seller received

Page 62

37
back the thing sold with its produce and accessories; and the
buyer the price with interest.
(3) Actio estimatoria sen quanti minoris in which the party
sought to reduce the price not to cancel the sale.
(4) Actio venditi whereby the seller could compel the buyer
to observe his duties whether inherent in the contract or added
by special agreement.
Grotius in his Introduction to Dutch Jurisprudence, ch. 31,
8. 9, says while treating of Do ut des Facio ut facias.
But
"He who has already fulfilled anything on his part has a right
to compel the other should he not have fulfilled his part to per-
form what has been stipulated or at least to compensate him
who has fulfilled his part to the extent of his interest.
when the first fulfilment consists in giving then the party who
has fulfilled has his choice either to compel the other to per-
form the stipulation or to reclaim what has been given by him
that is in case the other party has not yet commenced on his part
either to perform or to give and is therefore altogether unin-
jured or at least can easily be indemnified This also takes place
in case the other had on his part delivered anything the domi-
nion of which has been evicted for them the contract must also
be considered on that side as not fulfilled. But if that which
was first given did not belong to the donor then the contract
would be considered as altogether null and whatever is given
can be reclaimed as having been given without legal cause.
Keesel in his commentaries on Grotius's Introduction wrote,
section 512. "It properly follows from a correct interpretation
of the civil law that a person who has promised to do an act
may be condemned and compelled to perform the same and it
appears to have been so held by the supreme court." The
question is not without importance for in many of the English
Colonies Dutch Law is administered. Burges F. & C. L. Ven-
derlinden's Institutes of the Law of Holland by Henry, p. 198.
The German Reichscivilprocessordnung of the present day
contains provisions respecting specific performance in §§ 769,
771, 773-775.

if a piece of land is sold, but the vendor or purchaser dies before

day fixed for completion.-Lewis v. James, 32 Ch. D. 326; Green-
wood v. Turner, W. N. 1891, Feb. 21.
The word performance is applicable only to affirmative agree-
ments, the word appropriate to negative ones is observance.
Lord Coke said, “A negative cannot be performed." Litt. 303b.
Fry, J., said, “I have always understood that non-observance
refers to negative covenants, non-performance to the affirmative
covenants." 10 Ch. D. 757. Brett, L. J., said, “the court were
prepared to hold that a forfeiture only in the event of a lessee
wilfully failing or neglecting to perform any of the covenants
does not apply to the breach of a negative one.” 3 Ex. D. 82.
The disability of a married lady of the Hindu, Mahometan,
Buddhist, Sikh, or Jaina religion to enter into a contract is
neither removed by the Succession Act, s. 4, nor by the present
Act. Being unable to enter into a contract, there can be no con-
tract of hers to be enforced. She is still under the difficulties
which English ladies in England and India until recently labour-
ed under. A concise statement of the English system may
interest the student of comparative jurisprudence and will still
occasionally be useful to the practitioner. Possibly the principles
may prove applicable to the changes even in Hindu, Mahometan,
Buddhist, Sikh, or Jain societies, or to some of the wealthier
members thereof.
Married Women.
Marriage create at Common Law such a legal identity of
husband and wife that her capacity to enter into contracts, except
as his agent, was destroyed; her rights and liabilities on exist-
ing contracts were most of them merged in him, the rights at
least to revive if he do not reduce them into possession and she
survives; the rents and profits of her real estate were trans-
ferred, and her power to dispose of an inheritance seriously
curtailed. In Equity the rules of the common law relating to
her freeholds, leaseholds, choses in action and other personalty
obtain but a subordinate position. The right of dower exists,
subject to the doctrines of jointure and equitable dower. She
may enjoy property of any kind independent of her husband's
control, which is called her separate estate. And she may
claim a settlement out of her own property, and, in suits by cre-
ditors, have her husband's property marshalled in order to save

41
her paraphernalia. In Equity marriage is a sufficient consider-
ation for a contract before the solemnization to settle their
respective properties on themselves and issue. Collateral issue
could not uphold a settlement on themselves against the common
law claims of creditors or purchasers for valuable consideration.
Settlements after marriage, and gifts from the husband to his
wife, also receive the sanction of Equity, but not so far that
they defeat the common law claims of others, unless the wife,
by settling property of her own, has made herself a purchaser.
The legal estate in and management of the wife's property ought
to be vested in trustees.
Dower.
Before the Common Law Procedure Act, 1860, legal pro-
ceedings to obtain dower were commenced by an original writ
under the Great Seal directed to the sheriff, and made return-
able to the Common Pleas. This relic of the Chancery as the
officina justitiæ to a superior Court of Common Law is now
abolished.
Before the Statute of Uses, the use not being acknowledged.
at Common Law, dower did not attach thereto, though it might
to the legal estate, unless prevented by Equity. At the present
day the heir of a person seised as trustee or mortgagee may in
Equity restrain proceedings by the widow to recover dower.
When most of the land was in uses, and there was little per-
sonalty in the country, it became usual to convey an estate to a
woman in joint tenancy, the profits of which she would receive
if she survived her husband, and which was called a jointure.
The Statute of Uses declared that a proper jointure should be
a bar to dower. Had it not been for this enactment, dower,
which being a right could not be barred till it accrued and being
a freehold could not be barred by a collateral satisfaction would
during coverture have irrevocably attached to every use con-
verted into a legal estate. An equitable jointure being founded
on contract barred a legal jointure which depended solely on
statute 3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 105-see Griffith's Institutes, 90-93-
made many amendments in the law of dower and overruling the
practice of conveyancers allowed it to attach to a trust estate.
This Act was extended to India by Act XXIX of 1839, for English
cases.

the wife's right to dower as well as the husband's right as tenant
by curtesy of the wife's land. This Act operates as a settlement
of the wife's property to her separate use without restraint on
anticipation. A Mahometan wife has no lien for deferred dower.
2 Ben. A. C. 306.
Separate Estate.
As uses formerly, like trusts at the present day, fell exclusively
within the protection of Equity, and as a power is another
name for the right to limit a future use or trust, it might be
expected that many of the common law rules of conveyancing
would be ignored in the case of married women. Accordingly
we find that when an estate and a power to operate under the
Statute of Uses are given to a married woman, as she could
without fine or recovery, so now she can divest herself of the
estate without the aid of the Fines and Recoveries Abolition
Act.—Taylor
Act. Taylor v. Meads, J. (65), 166. The rule respecting equit-
able powers, that is, such as are conferred by the husband
on his wife under marriage articles, has only been established
after a conflict of authorities. Her full control over personalty
and its produce was undoubted, but even to Lord Hardwicke it
seemed strange that the woman's heir might be so disinherited-
Churchill v. Dibben, Lord Kenyon, Notes of C. C. 68; such, how-
ever, seems to be the present rule, both on principle and the
balance of authorities. For a piece of masterly reasoning on
the subject, the reader is referred to the Treatise of Powers by
Lord St. Leonards, ch. v., s. 1.
The question touching equitable powers is, however, subordi
nate in importance to the doctrines relative to separate use or
estate, that is, the dominion possessed by a married woman over
property independent of marital control. Since the writ of
subpoena was devised no more sweeping changes have been
introduced into our law than those which relate to the property of
married women. Formerly (1) a wife could not take nor have any
personal property independently of her husband, and though
her heirs might at her death receive her lands, the profits during
marriage went to the husband. Now, however, in Equity, she

January 1, 1883, adopted the principle of the Indian Succession Act.

[сн. It,
writing, of the estate to that purpose. Certain it is that the
superior Courts of Equity do not allow a married woman to be
arrested for a debt. Lord St. Leonards observes: Powers, 8th
ed., p. 173, that there is no case which gives effect to her con-
tracts against the corpus of her separate estate, and the prevail-
ing opinion is, that it is not liable to answer general demands
upon her. In Johnson v. Callagher, J. (61), 273, Turner, L.J.,
differing from Bruce, L.J., was of opinion that the cases were
inconsistent, but that separate estate is liable for general debts.
In Shattock v. Shattock, April 23, 1866, ex. relatione the writer,
Romilly, M.R., differed from the view of Turner, L. J., and
held, that where a married woman had a life interest, with power
to appoint the reversion by deed or will, which she exercised by
will, such reversion was not liable for debts. In Mrs. Matthew-
man's case, in which a married woman sought to have her
name struck off the list of contributories under the winding-up
of the Leeds Banking Company, Kindersley, V.C., stated the
principle generally, that where the circumstances are such as to
lead to the conclusion that a married woman is contracting not
for her husband but for herself in respect of her separate estate,
the separate estate will be liable to satisfy the obligation.
If the income has been paid to the husband, the wife can
only recover a twelvemonth's arrears. She may dispose of the
savings. Undisposed of savings go to the husband as next of
kin.-Fettiplace v. Georges, 1 Ves. J. 48, Thurlow, L.C., Eldon,
L.C., and Loughborough, L.C., however, expressed opinions
that the savings go to him in his marital right. In a recent
case, Wood, V.-C., held that an assignment by an intended wife
of her future property, followed by a covenant of the intended
husband to settle the after-acquired property of the wife, did
not extend to a legacy for her separate use, though without
clause of anticipation.
The Act to amend the law relating to Divorce and Matri-
monial Causes in England, 20 & 21 Vict. c. 85, BB. 21-25,
enacts that married women, deserted and with orders of pro-
tection, or judicially separated, may acquire property as femes
sole, which, should the wife again cohabit with her husband, is
to be held to her separate use, subject however to any agree-
ment in writing made between them while separate.

Equity to a Settlement.
If a married woman's property was not so settled, as by con-
ditional limitation or otherwise to secure the wife a proper pro-
vision in case of the husband's bankruptcy or death, she might
on proper application, have the whole or part of her property
settled upon her.
her. The right is called her equity to a settlement.
The rule is, that it is immaterial whether her title accrued
before marriage or after. The exceptions are (1), that as
against a purchaser for valuable consideration of the husband's
life estate in her inheritance or of his interest in her leaseholds
she has no equity.-Durham v. Crackles, J. (62), 1174, Wood,
V.-O. (2) Certain choses in action which are not assignable.
Legal choses may be reduced into possession and so become
assignable. Equitable are of two kinds-immediate and rever-
sionary; e.g., stock may be standing in the name of a trustee for
A for life, then for B. The latter fund is not assignable till
reduced into possession, even though all parties interested concur.
It is true such parties may afterwards be bound by estoppel.
Still the property being unassignable no equity to a settlement
could be allowed. 20 & 21 Vict. c. 57, however, makes it lawful
for a married woman to dispose of reversionary interests in per-
sonalty given by instrument made after 31st December, 1857,
except when such interest was given by settlement, or an agree-
ment for settlement on marriage. Though in the settlement
the children's welfare is considered, yet the equity being the
wife's she may waive the whole without their consent at any time
before it is made; but her death will not defeat her children's
interest in any settlement already initiated.(1)
The maxim Nemo potest transferre plus juris quam possidet
applies when the entire estate in the property is the wife's.
Assignees of a husband, even for a valuable consideration, are
bound, and the claim is paramount to that of a set-off by an exe-
cutor, but the maxim does not apply to a mere life interest,
the reason being that otherwise family affairs would be too open
to inspection.—Tidd v. Lister, 3 De G., M. & G., Cranworth, L.C.
(3) But a payment previously to bill filed to the husband or his
assignee by a trustee destroys her right, even though the trustee
paying might have insisted on it.-Murray v. Elibank, 10 Ves. 84.

CH. JI,
The amount depends on the circumstances of the party and
the conduct of the parties. Where there is already a marriage
settlement, the order will be made with respect to the wife's
fortune and the existing settlement. Where the husband is
insolvent and his conduct bad, even the income to which he is
entitled for her support will be so settled.-In Barrow v. Barrow,
24 L. J., Ch. 267; 5 D., M. & G. 782. Turner, L.J., said: "The
legal right of the husband to his wife's property is founded on
the legal obligation to maintain her, and therefore, if owing to
his misconduct, his wife is unable to live with him, this is a cir-
cumstance which cannot but affect the equitable consideration
of his right. The misconduct of the wife diminishes her equit-
able right; and it has been held that an adulteress has no equity
to claim a settlement."
If the domicile of the marriage contract is foreign, no equity
to a settlement arises. Lex loci contractus regit actum. An
English woman married a person with a French domicile. He
had previously been naturalized in France. The marriage
ceremony was performed in the chapel of the English ambassa-
dor, marriage articles in the English form having been first
executed. Romilly, M.R., held that the Code Napoléon did not
apply, but that an equity attached to after-acquired property.
When money, stock, shares, or securities not exceeding 2007.
in value, is or are ordered to be paid to a woman who marries,
before payment the accountant-general's office has to draw for
the money or transfer, and deliver the stock, &c., to the wife
and husband on proof of the marriage, and an affidavit by them
of no settlement; or, if there be a settlement, an affidavit by
them identifying it, and one by their solicitor that it does not
affect the property. Cons. Ord. I. rr. 1-3. Supreme Court
Fund Rules 61.
In Wilkinson v. Gibson, 4 E. C. 162; V.-C. Wood decided that
the same consequences as to property must follow the declara-
tion of dissolution by the Divorce Court as if the marriage
contract had been annihilated, and the marriage tie broken on
that date; that those rights of the divorced husband which
depended on the contract ceased at the same date. Accordingly,

sionary interest in a sum of stock which was not settled before

her marriage, and had been the subject of a post-nuptial settle-
ment, and after the decree the fund fell into possession, and the
divorced wife took steps to realize the fund, but before it was
recovered, died; it was held that her executors were entitled.
(a) Contracts which may be specifically enforced.
To an action brought by purchaser against the executors of a
vendor of estate for specific performance the defence raised was
unsoundness of mind and incapability. It was held on the
evidence that the vendor who was eighty years of age suffered
from brain disease and insanity produced thereby as well as and
distinct from insanity evidencing itself in delusions and also
from general enfeeblement of mind. One of such delusions did
to some extent enter into the matter of the contract but in the
opinion of the court not so as to form the foundation of it. The
medical evidence in effect was that the vendor though capable
to some extent of transacting business was not competent to
enter into the contract in question which however was reason-
able and simple. There was strong lay evidence that the vendor
perfectly understood the transaction. The court being of
opinion on the whole evidence notwithstanding the medical
testimony that the vendor was sufficiently sane at the time to
understand and did understand the transaction granted specific
performance.—Birkin v. Wing, 63 L. T. 80.
When once it is shown that a complete contract exists, further
negotiations between the parties cannot without the consent of
both get rid of the contract already arrived at. But further
negotiations in the shape of a demand by one party for an
important.additional term is evidence that he does not consider
that there is a complete existing contract and may exclude him
from specific performance. 45 Ch. D. 481; 44 Ch. D. 616.
A lease of land with an iron furnace and mill and certain
water rights for the purpose of working the same contained a
covenant on the part of the lessees not to assign or under let
without the consent in writing of the lessors "such consent not
to be unreasonably refused or refused to a person of responsi-
bility and respectability." The lessees agreed with a municipal
corporation to assign to them and the corporation agreed with
the lessees not to use the waters for manufacturing iron or steel.
The lessors refused to consent to the assignment on the ground

[CH. II,
that the corporation could not use the premises for the purposes
for which they were intended. Held, that the plaintiffs had not
shown that the lessors unreasonably refused their consent for
the corporation not being capable of being a good tenant or
assignee could not be said to be a person of responsibility.-
Harrison v. Corporation of Barrow in Furness, January 12, 1891,
39, W. R. 250.
A parol agreement to grant a lease was decreed on the testi.

12. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter,
the specific performance of any con-
tract may in the discretion of the
Court be enforced-
Cases in which
specific perform-
ance enforceable.
Contracts are frequently made with a penal or other like sum.
Whereupon the question arises what is the contract ? Is it that
one certain act shall be done with a sum annexed whether by
way of penalty or damages to secure the performance of this
very act ? or is it that one of two things shall be done at the elec-
tion of the party who has to perform the contract; namely, the
performance of the act or the payment of the sum of money ?
If the former the fact of the penal or the other like sum being
annexed will not prevent the court enforcing performance of the
very act and thus carrying into execution the intention of the
parties.—Howard v. Hopkins, 2 Atk. 371 ; French v. Macale,
2 Dr. & War. 269. If the latter the contract is satisfied by the
payment of a sum of money and there is no ground for proceed-
ing against the party having the election to compel the perform-
ance of the other alternative. Fry, Ch. III.
If the sum named is not a penalty but the agreed amount of
liquidated damages the contract is satisfied by its performance
or the payment of the money and the case at first appears to be
within clause (b). Nevertheless the word "standard" though
applicable to market and other lists respecting large classes of
sales is hardly applicable to an individual agreement. In Eng-
land the distinction between penalty and liquidated damages is
so far as respects specific performance unimportant.-Oity of

London v. Pugh, 4 Bro. P. C. 395 and ineffectual to prevent the
court enforcing the contract in specie. The simplest illustra-
tion of this is the ordinary case of a stipulation on the sale of real
estate that if the purchaser fail to comply with the condition he
shall forfeit the deposit and the vendor shall be at liberty to
re-sell and recover as and for liquidated damages the deficiency
on such re-sale and the expenses. Such a condition has never
been held to give the purchaser the option of refusing to perform
the contract if he pays the penalty nor to stand in the way of
specific performance of the contract.
Where the contract to do or not to do the act is distinct from
the obligation to pay the money it seems that either the contract
or obligation may be sued on, but not both of them.-Fox v.
Scard, 33 Bea. 328 of section 29.
Though the contract be alternative in form the court may
clearly see that it is essentially a contract only to do one of the
alleged alternatives. For instance where the penal sum is very
small compared with the value of the property; where the
benefit of the contract would result to one person or flow in one
direction and the benefit of the sum if paid in another as in
marriage settlements.-Chilliner v. Chilliner, 2 Ves. Sen. 528;
where the sum reserved is single and the act stipulated for or
against is recurring as in leases of farms.-French v. Macale, 2 Dr.
and War. 269. On the other hand where the sum or sums made
payable vary in frequency of payment or amount according to
the thing to be done or abstained from the judges have in
many instances found the payment alternative in intention as
well as in form.—Woodward v. Gyles, 2 Vernon 119; Rolfe v.
Peterson, 2 Bro. P. C. 436; Magrane v. Archbold, 1 Dow. 107,
where, however, in addition to an increased rent that was a
stipulation that the act provided against should be a forfeiture
of the covenantors interest the sum was held to be a security
only and not an alternative and the act restrainable.—Barret v.
Blagrave, 5 Ves. 555. A lease giving the lessor the right to
re-enter and avoid the lease on breach of covenant offers no
impediment to the enforcement of the covenant specifically.-
Dyke v. Taylor, 3 De G., F. and J. 467.

purchased with the money of another. He was compelled to
transfer it though but a chattel.-Stanton v. Percival, 5 H.
L. C. 257.
A contract was made for the sale of certain immoveable
property in the event of the vendor obtaining a decree estab-
lishing his title. He obtained a decree but allowed the limit-
ation period to elapse. Held, that the period applicable was
that in respect of specific performance. Act 1877, Art. 113;
and not that in respect of possession of property, Art. 144.-
Muhiuddin v. Majlis, I. L. R. 6 A. S. 231.
Though a delay of three years is an important point to be
considered in exercising the discretion, a court of appeal even
if the point were not taken in the court below should hold that
the discretion had been rightly exercised. Omnia præsumun-
tur rite esse acta.—Mokund v. Ohotay, I. L. R. 10 C. S. 1061.
Where it appears that a third person not a party to the contract
has a distinct interest which it is sought to declare null and
void on an equitable ground the claim cannot be made part of the
suit.—De Houghton v. Money, L. R.2 Ch. Ap. 166 followed. S. C.
In a case under the law before this Act came into operation a
Hindu induced the parents of a boy to give him in adoption by
a promise to settle upon him his (the adopter's) property. Held,
that there was an equity to compel the heir and legal represent-
ative of the adoptive father to perform his promise; and that
the widow thirty years after her husband's death might waive
the period of limitation and execute a valid deed of gift of the
property to the adopted son.-Bhala v. Parbhu, I. L. R. 2 B. S. 67.
A suit for specific performance of a contract to give in mar-
riage cannot be sustained, the remedy is an action for damages.
The ceremony of betrothal does not in Hindu law amount to an
irrevocable contract which the court will decree to be specifi-
cally performed. I. M. Gunput, I. L. R. 1 C. S. 74.
Where one party to a contract has for years been permitted
to enjoy all the beneficial interest without being clothed with
the full legal title as a lessee under an agreement or a share-
holder unregistered the time under the former law would not
be a bar by limitation. Griffith's Institutes, Max. XVI. So

The court ought not to make a decree for the specific perform-

An offer made by A to B was accepted by O purporting to act
on behalf of B but in fact without authority from him. After
acceptance by C, A withdrew the offer and B subsequently to A's
withdrawal ratified C's acceptance. In an action B against A
for specific performance. Held, that the ratification by B
related back to the time of C's acceptance and therefore that A's
withdrawal was inoperative.
The fact that a simple acceptance of an offer contains a state-
ment that the acceptor will instruct his solicitor to prepare the
necessary documents does not make the acceptance conditional.
The fact that a person seeking specific performance had in
letters subsequent to those constituting a complete contract
sought to introduce a new term which was resisted by the other
party does not preclude a specific performance of the original
contract.—Bolton & Partners Limited v. Lambert, C. A. 37, W.

(a) when the act agreed to be done is in the per-
formance, wholly or partly, of a trust;
The illustration clause is repealed by the Indian Trusts Act,
see Griffith's edition, Schedule. Trusts are in some but very few
respects analogous to contracts. The specific relief therefore
in respect of the former is not an appropriate illustration of the
specific performance of the latter kind of obligations. Trust
must be distinguished not only from contracts but also from
conditions and powers.
In England there is no precedent for a suit against trustees
for the specific performance of their trusts in order to obtain
the court's interpretation of these trusts. The application is
either for administration or breach of trust and removal of
trustees.-Equitable Mortgage Co. v. Grenfell, W. N. 1889, 228.
(b) when there exists no standard for ascertaining
the actual damage caused by the non-performance
of the act agreed to be done;
A sale of public stock which is always in the market is within
the clause but not the sale of shares of a particular trading
company limited in number and not always to be had in the
market.-Oheale v. Kenward, 3 De G. & J. 27.
Where a contract is to take several years in execution it is
difficult to calculate the damages, as where 800 tons of iron are
sold on the terms that they shall be delivered and paid for by
instalments covering a number of years where timber trees are
sold in a similar manner and where a lessee of alum works
agrees to leave at the end of the lease a certain quantity of the
alum that the business may continue to be carried on, in all
these and similar cases specific performance will be decreed.-

Lingen v. Simpson, 18. & St. 300. Agreements to form partner-
ships and to execute articles accordingly may also be decreed
to be specifically performed athough they relate exclusively to
chattel interests for damages are not in such cases an adequate

performance may be obtained of a covenant to grant a lease
or to renew a lease; to insure against fire to sell the good-will
of a trade and of a secret connected therewith; to assign an
agreement between the defendant and a stranger for service to be
performed by the plaintiff on payment of a stipulated compen-
sation; so of a contract to keep the banks of a river in repair.―

Where specific performance has been decreed of a contract to
purchase railway shares the court will order the purchaser to
pay the calls that have been made since the purchase and to in-
demnify the seller against all future calls in respect of the shares
and to take proper measures to get himself registered. Wynne
v. Price, 3 De. G. & Sm. 310. A contract being to pay the
plaintiff a certain annual sum for his life and also a certain other
sum by way of royalty on a proportion of a particular article to
be manufactured by the defendant during the life of the plaintiff
is such a one as the court will specifically enforce for damages
could be calculated only by conjecture and to compel the plain-
tiff to take damages would be to compel him to sell the annual
provision during his life for which he had contracted at a con-
jectural price.-Ball v. Coggs, 1 Bro. P. C. 30. And a contract
with the creditors of an insolvent to take over at a certain rate
the debts due to them will be specifically performed if brought

(d) when it is probable that pecuniary compen-
sation cannot be got for the non-performance of the
act agreed to be done.
Illustrations b and c deal with contracts where the alternative
remedy by damages is doubtful in its nature, extent, operation or
adequacy. Illustration (d) respects contracts for the personal
act or abstaining from acting by the defendant and where the
thing contracted for and not damages was the object and pur-
pose of the contract. Thus for instance, a covenant to renew a
lease will be specifically decreed. 1 Madd. Ch. Pr. 309.—Furnival
v. Oarew, 3 Atk. 87. So a covenant to invest money in lands
and settle it in a particular manner. So an agreement to settle
the boundaries between two estates.-Penn v. Baltimore, 1 Ves.
Sen. 444. So an agreement to charge an annuity on land.—
Wellesley v. Wellesley, 4 M. & Cr. 554.
So an agreement to indorse a bill of exchange or promissory
note upon a transfer thereof when it has been omitted by fraud,
accident or mistake.-Watkins v. Maule, 2 Jac. & Walk. 242.
So an assignment of an expectancy if made upon a valuable
consideration.—Meek v. Kettlewell, 1 Phil. Ch. 342. Many
other cases falling within the doctrine might easily be put; as
the case of a covenant not to build upon a contiguous estate to
the injury of an ancient messuage; of a covenant not to cut
down timber trees which are peculiarly ornamental to the man-
sion of the covenantee; of a covenant not to erect any noisome
or injurious manufacture on an estate adjacent to that of the
covenantee; of a covenant not to carry on the same trade within
a prescribed distance, and of a covenant that a house to be
built adjacent to other houses should correspond with them in
its elevation.—Franklin v. Tuton, 5 Mad. 469.
Even implied contracts though no injury may have been
hitherto sustained but is only apprehended from the peculiar
relation between the parties are decreed in some cases to be
specifically performed. Thus a surety may bring an action to
compel the debtor on a bond in which he has joined to pay the
debt when due whether the surety has been actually sued or
not. Milford's Eq. Pleading, 148. And upon a covenant to
save harmless relief may be obtained under similar circum-
stances.-Champion v. Brown, 6 John 398. So where property

is covenanted to be secured for certain purposes and in certain

the courts will interpose to secure the property for its original
purpose.-Flight v. Cook, 2 Ves. 619; Green v. Pigot, 1 Br. Ch.
R. 398. And generally it may be stated that in cases of contracts
express or implied upon equitable principles the courts will
interpose to preserve the funds devoted to particular objects
under such contracts and decree what in effect is specific per-
formance security to be given or the fund to be placed under
the control of the court. Even contracts to execute mortgages
may be specifically enforced and on the principle that injury is
anticipated a receiver will be also appointed.-Shakel v. Duke
of Marlborough, 4 Mad. R. 463.
Explanation.-Unless and until the contrary is
proved, the Court shall presume that the breach of
a contract to transfer immoveable property cannot
be adequately relieved by compensation in money,
and that the breach of a contract to transfer move-
able property can be thus relieved.

A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, a certain number
of railway-shares of a particular description. A refuses to com-
plete the sale. B may compel A specifically to perform this
agreement, for the shares are limited in number and not always
to be had in the market, and their possession carries with it the
status of a shareholder, which cannot otherwise be procured.
A contracts with B to paint a picture for B, who agrees to
pay therefor Rs. 1,000. The picture is painted. B is entitled

valuable consideration, a promissory note to B. A becomes
insolvent, and C is appointed his assignee. B may compel C to

has partially ceas-
ed to exist.
All contracts are irrespective of the remedies subject to the
condition that the subject-matter of the contract should be in
existence when the time for performance comes. Thus a con-
tract to sell agricultural produce grown on specified land is
excused by unavoidable failure of the crop.-Howell v. Coupland,

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS.
[CH. II,
D. 100, Court practice. In Story's Equity, 772-774, we find the
following doctrines: If a plaintiff is in his original state as to
that part of his agreement which he has performed but cannot
perform the whole of his part equity will not decree specific
performance. And where he does not continue in his original
condition specific performance will be decreed notwithstanding
a subsequent accident renders him incapable of performing
the remainder.
Thus upon a marriage settlement A contracted to clear a
manor of incumbrances sell some pensions and settled the manor
when cleared and the sale money on his wife and issue. The wife's
father agreed to settle £3000 a year on A for life and then on
the issue. After the clearance but before the sale the wife died
without issue. The court refused specific performance of the
agreement to settle the £3000 on A seeing that his original
condition had not been materially altered. Rep. temp. Finch,
445, 2 Freeman 35. But to illustrate the second case.
If a
man has contracted to settle lands on his wife and issue free
from incumbrance a portion being to be received with her; and
he sells part of his lands to disencumber the others and is
proceeding to disencumber and settle the rest should the wife
die without issue before the settlement be actually made he still
shall have the portion. For he is not in his original condition
he has sold part of his lands is not in default and therefore ought
not to be prejudiced by the accident of his wife's death.-
Meredith v. Wynn, 1 Eq. Ab. 71.
The Indian Contract Act, s. 56 includes the case of a contract
becoming unlawful to which the present section makes no
allusion. This, however, is immaterial if we take into account the
proviso in section 4a that to give a right to relief the agreement
must be enforceable at law.

(a.) A contracts to sell B a piece of land consisting of 100
bíghás. It turns out that 98 bíghás of the land belong to A,
and the two remaining bíghás to a stranger, who refuses to part
with them. The two bíghás are not necessary for the use or
enjoyment of the 98 bíghás, nor so important for such use or
enjoyment that the loss of them may not be made good in money.
A may be directed at the suit of B to convey to B the 98 bíghás
and to make compensation to him for not conveying the two
remaining bíghás; or B may be directed, at the suit of A, to pay
to A on receiving the conveyance and possession of the land, the
stipulated purchase-money, less a sum awarded as compensation
for the deficiency.
(b.) In a contract for the sale and purchase of a house and
lands for two lákhs of rupees, it is agreed that part of the fur-

are unable to agree as to the valuation of the furniture, and
may either have the furniture valued in the suit and include it

Seller against Buyer.
Should the two bíghás be material as where the form the
wharf frontage to a stream and the purchase is made by a
wharfinger for the purposes of his stream specific performance
would probably be refused.-Pears v. Lambart, 7 Bea. 546.
So where upon the sale of a house and four acres of land the
seller could not make title to a small strip of land between the
house and road so that persons passing could look into the
windows it was held not a case for compensation.—Arnold v.
Arnold, 14 Ch. D. 270.
So a seller cannot force the buyer to complete where there is
a defect in title as where he has sold an underlease instead of a
lease.—Madeley v. Booth, 2 De. G. & S. 718; Camberwell, &c.,
Society v. Holloway, 13 Ch. D. 760; an undivided share of an
estate instead of an entirety; or a remainder expectant on a life
interest instead of an estate in possession.-A. G. v. Day, 1 Ves.
Sen. 218; Collier v. Jenkins, Yon. 295; or an estate subject to
an undisclosed right to dig mines or undisclosed rights of ease-
ment prejudicial to the purpose of the purchaser.—Seaman v.
Vaudrey, 16 Ves. 390; Jones v. Rimmer, 14 Ch. D. 588. Lord
St. Leonards thus writes V. & P. 265.
“Should a buyer who is acquainted with a defect proceed with
the purchase without objecting he is bound to complete and
may forfeit a right to compensation." Sugden V. & P. 252.
And should substantial objections arise in a suit the buyer may
use them.—Baskcomp v. Phillips, 6 Jur. N. S. 363.
The law does not concern itself with trifles but if on a sale
of a certain quantity more or less, a very large variance will be
a good defence to the buyer. Sugden's V. & P. 269-270. And
though parties frequently bind themselves by contract that a
misdescription shall not annul the sale but be the subject of
compensation the contract will be so interpreted by the court that
the buyer shall not be compelled to pay for an estate twice as
large as the one described double the price though he himself
may enforce such contract.-Price v. North, 2 Y. & C., Exc. 620.

The buyer if willing to take what he can get may usually
compel the seller to convey what he can and make compensa-

years instead of the fee simple.-Barker v. Cox, 4 Ch. D. 464 ;

become a shareholder.-Pool v. Middleton, 7 Jur. N. S. 1262, a
husband's share in a fee for the life of another person without
the wife's remainder when he supposed the husband possessed
the entire fee.-Barnes v. Wood, L. R. 8 Eq. 424; a moiety

Horrocks v. Rigby, 9 Ch. D. 180; Hooper v. Smart, L. R. 18 Eq.

portion of the whole, or does not
admit of compensation in money, he is not entitled to
obtain a decree for specific performance. But the
Court may, at the suit of the other party, direct the
party in default to perform specifically so much of
his part of the contract as he can perform, provided
that the plaintiff relinquishes all claim to further
performance, and all right to compensation, either
for the deficiency, or for the loss or damage sus-
tained by him through the default of the defend-

Possession by a purchaser not as a tenant but under the

The mere naming of a date for possession does not render
the time an essential part of the contract if it appear otherwise
from the terms of the agreement that it contemplated a possible
postponement of the completion.-Webb v. Hughes, L.R. 10 Eq.
281. Where a business is sold as a going concern the presump-
tion is that the buyer should on the day named be placed in a
position to enter and carry it on.-Day v. Luhke, L. R. 5 Eq.
336; Cowles v. Gale, L. R. 7 Ch. 12; Tilley v. Thomas, 3 Ch. 61.
As to the measure of damages Mr. Justice Collett concludes
the result of the authorities to be that ordinarily the buyer is
entitled to the rents and profits and the seller to interest on
the purchase-money from the date fixed for the completion
even though the money were lying dead if the seller was not in
default for the delay or the buyer gave no notice that the
money was idle; but if the seller be in default and he has notice
that the money is actually and fully appropriated he cannot
claim interest. If no date is fixed interest is payable from the
time the buyer takes possession or receives the rents and pro-
fits except in the case of a reversion when as the life estate is
wearing out it is always payable from the date fixed for com-
pletion. A buyer taking possession before completion must
pay interest from that date although he makes no profit by
rent or otherwise out of the land meanwhile.-15 Ch. D. 122.
If the interest exceeds the rents and profits and the seller is in
default he must take the latter until a good title is shown and
then interest only is allowed. Of course in the absence of
default the express terms of the contract will govern. Should
loss or deterioration arise during a delay in making out the
buyer is entitled to compensation and if he has paid his
purchase-money to interest on the compensation from the
date of payment. The Transfer of Property Act-Griffith's
Edition.
The underlessee of some property contracted to purchase it

that the purchaser had an option and must elect to pay the

interest on the purchase-money from the day fixed for comple-
tion. There is no rule that a purchaser in possession loses this
option by accepting the title.-Greenwood v. Turner, Kekewick,
J., 39 W. R. 315.
A granted a lease to B of two rooms with a covenant for
quiet enjoyment. Then A let a room above the two to C for
dancing and other entertainments. A brought this action
against B and C for an injunction to restrain such use of the
upper room alleging that the dancing over his head and the
behaviour of visitors on the stairs was a breach of the covenant
and a nuisance. Kekewick, J., held that the words quiet enjoy-
ment did not refer to noise but were restricted to enjoyment
without interference with, without interruption of the posses-
sion; and explained to a like effect.-Shaw v. Stenton, 2 H. &
N. 858; Sanderson v. Mayor of Berwick on Tweed, 13 Q. B. D.
547. He also held that the dancing was a nuisance giving a
cause of action and so entitling to damages.-Jenkins v. Jackson,

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS.
[CH. II,
"One of the most frequent occasions on which courts of equity
are asked to decree a specific performance of contracts is where
the terms for the performance and completion of the contract
have not in point of time been strictly complied with. Time is
not generally deemed in equity to be of the essence unless the
parties have so expressly treated it or it necessarily follows from
the nature or circumstances of the contract. It is true that
courts of equity have regard to time so far as it respects the good
faith and diligence of the parties. But if circumstances of a
reasonable nature have disabled the party from a strict compli-
ance or if he comes promptly in point of fact to ask for a specific
performance the suit is treated with indulgence and generally
with favour by the court. But then in such cases it should be
clear that the remedies are mutual that there has been no
change of circumstances affecting the character or justice of the
contract; that compensation for the delay can be fully and
beneficially given; that he who asks a specific performance is in
a condition to perform his own part of the contract; and that
he has shown himself ready, desirous, prompt and eager to
perform the contract. Even where time is of the essence of the
contract it may be waived by proceeding in the purchase after
the time has elapsed: and if time was not originally made by
the parties of the essence of the contract yet it may become so
by notice if the other party is guilty of improper delays in com-
pleting the purchase." Story 776.
In Seton v. Slade, Lord Chancellor Eldon decreed specific
performance where the abstract though delivered very late and
under a notice that the vendee would insist on his deposit with
interest if the title should not be made out and possession
delivered by the time of payment was received and kept with-
out objection. 7 Vesey 265. See also, Sugden V. & P., Ch. 6.
"Ought not," the words are general and include illegality,
want of equity and failure to satisfy the discretion of the court.
The Indian Contract Act, s. 24, enacts that "if any part of a
single consideration for one or more objects or any one or any
part of any one of several considerations for a single object is
unlawful the whole agreement is void." Such section impliedly
assumes that one part of a contract may be lawful and another
part unlawful and that the parts are separable and the contract
divisible.

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS.
[CH. II,
As illegalities at law so also are iniquities in equity numerous.
Respecting the latter reference may be made to Griffith's Insti-
tutes of Equity.
Defendant agreed to grant a lease to the plaintiff of a plot of
land on condition of his building a house of a particular value
thereon and insuring it in their joint names in a named Insur-
ance Office but on default the defendant might re-enter and the
agreement was to be void. The contract contained also a
stipulation giving the plaintiff the option of purchasing the fee
in two years. Plaintiff's default which resulted in his losing
the lease did not preclude his purchasing the fee.-Green v. Low,
22, Beavan 625. The decree for specific performance of the
good part of a contract is not modified on account of the bad
part. And yet a court has a discretion in putting parties on
terms and in awarding costs. A buyer is entitled to a charge
on the property for the costs if any awarded to him of a suit to
compel specific performance of the contract or to obtain a decree
for the rescission thereof. Griffith's Indian Transfer of Property
Act, s. 55 (6) b.
On the ground of "divisibility." Which however logically
considered is not so good a term as independence a marriage
settlement covenant to settle all future acquired property was
specifically enforced in respect of policies of assurance. The
covenant seemed objectionable because it included all future
property and so might operate in restraint of trade.-C. A. in re

perty, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to
make good the contract out of such interest;
See note to section 14.
The maxims of the common law were “An assignee is clothed
with the rights of his principal." Broom, 434. "The grant of
a future interest is invalid." Broom, 464: but they have been
greatly modified and the latter one superseded by the maxim
of Equity, "That is to be considered as done which is agreed
to be done." Griffith's Institutes, Maxim II. And it is now
universal law that a contract which engages to transfer to a
purchaser or mortgagee property of which the vendor or mort-
gagee is not possessed at the time transfers the interest imme-
diately on the property being acquired by him provided the
contract itself purports to convey the interest in the property
and not merely a license to seize.-Holroyd v. Marshall, 10 H.
L. C. 191; Reeve v. Whitmore, 4 De. G. J. & S. 1; Ascough v.
Johnson, 2 Vern. 66 Rawlin's Case, 4 Coke 52.
When the seller of a leasehold usually renewable acquires an
interest by contract with the lessors at the time he made the
agreement for sale that interest would pass to the purchaser
although the contract was simply to sell the leasehold. If
there was no such contract but the renewal was obtained subse.
quently to the sale but before the assignment to the purchaser
the latter also would clearly have a right to claim the renewed
lease though in this case the purchaser must pay the expenses
of the renewal and in the former case also unless he really
bought the whole interest at the price named including the
benefit of the contract for renewal.-Munro v. Taylor, 8 Hare 51.
An imperfect title having been sold the purchaser after
learning the defect bought the remainder, he was compelled to
complete but allowed to deduct the price of the remainder.-
Murrell v. Goodyear, 6 Jur. N. S. 93; Hume v. Pocock, L. R.

(b) where the concurrence of other persons is
necessary to validate the title, and they are bound
to convey at the vendor's or lessor's request, the
purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure such

“Bound” that is against whom the court would decree specific
performance at the suit of the vendor or lessor.
(c) where the vendor professes to sell unincum-
bered property, but the property is mortgaged for
au amount not exceeding the purchase-money, and
the vendor has in fact only a right to redeem it, the
purchaser may compel him to redeem the mortgage
and to obtain a conveyance from the mortgagee;
A purchaser cannot obtain relief against a vendor for any
incumbrance or defect to which the covenants do not extend
and which has not been concealed by the vendor or his agent.
Sugden's V. & P., Ch. 13, Sec. 2. The maxim caveat emptor
applies.
"Professes." It is only in cases of fraud that a grantee of
land who has sustained damages by reason of the liability of
the land to contribution towards the payment of charges, as
quit rents, can recoup as such damages the difference between
what he obtained for the land and what but for the incum-
brance he might have obtained. In other cases the parties can
only be entitled to the amount payable on the incumbrance or
its amount to be ascertained by calculation to which amount or
valne interest will have to be added in case the purchaser have
not occupied or enjoyed the premises.
When a purchaser has not paid off the incumbrance but has
remained in quiet possession of the land he cannot be relieved
against his contract to pay the purchase-money in whole or in
part on the ground of defect of title.-Greene v. Tallman, 20
N. Y. 191.
(d) where the vendor or lessor sues for specific
performance of the contract, and the suit is dismiss-
ed on the ground of his imperfect title, the defendant
has a right to a return of his deposit (if any) with
interest thereon, to his costs of the suit, and to a
lien for such deposit, interest and costs on the in-
terest of the vendor or lessor in the property agreed
to be sold or let.

purchaser should pay a deposit to be forfeited on his default in

complying with the conditions and that on such default the
vendor might re-sell. The purchaser paid the deposit and
accepted the title but failed to pay the residue of the price.
The vendor then gave notice that the contract was rescinded
and the deposit forfeited. Three years afterwards the property
was again offered for sale and after the contract a defect in the
title was discovered on the face of the abstract delivered to the
first purchaser. The purchaser whose deposit had been forfeited
thereupon brought an action for its recovery on the ground of
mutual mistake and failure of consideration. Held, that having
accepted the title and the forfeiture having taken place solely
on account of his default that he was barred from so doing. 14
App. Cas. 429.
Ordinarily on a breach of contract to sell land arising from
want of title damages for the loss of the bargain are not recover-
able.—Bain v. Fothergill, L. R. 7 E. & I., Ap. 158.
The rule is otherwise in the case of a lease. The lessee in
an action for breach of covenant for quiet enjoyment is entitled
to substantial damages. Should he not have entered he is still
entitled to the value of the lease. Should he have entered and
be evicted to the value of the residue. Sedgwick's Cases, p. 84%;

Explanation.-The circumstance that the contract
has become incapable of specific performance, does
not preclude the Court from exercising the jurisdic-
tion conferred by this section.
In respect of a continuing cause of action damages should be
assessed down to the time of assessment. A right to damages
may be forfeited by plaintiff's laches. 8 Jur. N. S. 873.
The particulars of sale of certain leasehold property described
it as being occupied at an annual rent but omitted to state
that the vendor as landlord paid the rates and taxes on the
property the tenancy being a monthly one. The purchasers
alleged that they were thereby led to infer that the tenancy
was a yearly tenancy and that the tenant paid the rates and
taxes. Accordingly they claimed compensation. The vendor
asserted that the defendant had knowledge at the time of the
sale of the true state of the case and produced evidence to
prove that at the auction a person asked the auctioneer as to
the two points and that he replied that the landlord paid the
rates and taxes and that the tenancy was monthly. Held, that
the evidence was admissible and fined the purchaser with
knowledge and consequently precluded his claim for compensa-
tion. 62 L. T. 445.
Such uncertainty as prevents specific performance will not
necessarily preclude the giving of damages. 38 Ch. D. C. A. 130.
Where after sale but before the conveyance was executed a
malicions injury was committed on the lands sold the court
refused compensation to the purchaser. 25 L. R. Ir. 252.
Griffith's Indian Transfer of Property Act, s. 55 e.
This chapter while authorising specific performance with
compensation does not authorise the court to grant specific
performance with an indemnity. For the former remedy is a
final settlement between the parties, the latter leaves the door
open to future litigation. For example where an estate sold is
comprised with others in an original lease under which the

an indemnity. Sugden's V. & P. 254. Satisfaction depends

place the plaintiff in possession of the land under the patta and

of the second paragraph:-A contracts to sell a hundred
maunds of rice to B. B brings a suit to compel A to perform
the contract or to pay compensation. The Court is of opinion
that A has made a valid contract and has broken it, without
excuse, to the injury of B, but that specific performance is not
the proper remedy. It shall award to B such compensation as
it deems just.
of the third paragraph :—A contracts with B to sell him a
house for Rs. 1,000, the price to be paid and the possession
given on the 1st January 1877. A fails to perform his part of
the contract, and B brings his suit for specific performance and
compensation, which is decided in his favour on the 1st January
1878. The decree may, besides ordering specific performance,
award to B compensation for any loss which he has sustained
by 'A's refusal.

The third illustration needs being qualified. The checks
drawn upon any funds in the hands of a banker must not be

such as the general magnitude and extent of the business of

(b) a contract which runs into such minute or
numerous details, or which is so dependent on the
personal qualifications or volition of the parties, or
otherwise from its nature is such, that the Court
cannot enforce specific performance of its material
terms;
The fourth illustration is taken from Vickers v. Vickers, L. R.
4 Eq. 529. But where a valuer had been named by both parties
and afterwards he was prevented by one of the parties from
acting, it was held that the contract was concluded and that the
said party being in the wrong might be restrained.—Smith v.
Peters, L. R. 20 Eq. 511. Again should the valuation contract
be merely subsidiary as for the valuation of fixtures on a con-
cluded sale of a house, the failure thereof will not prevent
specific performance.-Richardson v. Smith, L. R. 5 Ch. 648;
Dinham v. Bradford, L. R. 5 Ch. 519.

the letting; (2) the contract to cultivate. Mr. Collett thinks
that B can obtain specific performance of (1). If so it would
be only condition of his agreeing to cultivate in a particular
manner. For “he who seeks Equity must do Equity." Griffith's
Institutes. Mr. Collett's opinion is however by no means un-
exceptionable.
7. A contract which to the knowledge of both parties cannot
be enforced until the occurrence of a contingent event-for
example, until the plaintiffs buy land part of which they propose
to sell to the defendant-then admits of specific performance.
Even in England the want of "mutuality of remedy is no
objection to the contract."-Wilson v. Dunn, 34 Ch. D. 569.

(c) a contract the terms of which the Court cannot
find with reasonable certainty;
On the 17th April 1889 the defendant wrote to the plaintiff's
agent offering £800 for a freehold house at C with possession
at Midsummer assuming the title to be satisfactory. The
plaintiff's agent replied on the 18th accepting the offer subject
to the owner's ratification which was subsequently obtained.
Further correspondence ensued in the course of which plain.
tiff's solicitors sent to the defendant's solicitor a draft contract
containing special conditions of title which were objected to by
the one side and insisted upon by the other. On the 20th of
May the defendant's solicitor having discovered that the plaintiff
was not owner of the minerals under the house repudiated the
agreement. The plaintiff offered to purchase the minerals be-
fore the time for completion and to waive the objections to the
special conditions but the defendant took no notice of the offer.
The plaintiff obtained a conveyance of the minerals in Septem-
ber 1889. In an action for specific performance. Held, that
assuming the existence of a concluded contract the defendant
was justified in repudiating before the time for completion on
the ground that the plaintiff was not owner of the minerals.

constitute a contract but other terms as in an executory or even

(b), (g), (h).
Partnership.
The equity doctrines concerning the contract of partnership
may be divided into two classes: I. Those which relate to the
connection existing between the partners. II. Those which
relate to strangers.
I. The simplest form of the contract is where one person
supplies capital, another skill and labour. The division of pro-
fits would be a question of some difficulty. But a division in
proportion to the interest which the one might have made in
the ordinary investments, and to the salary the other might
have gained in the same employment, is perhaps equitable.
Articles of partnership, when drawn by a skilful conveyancer,
are in the form of mutual covenants: as to the name of the firm
and object of the business; as to the partnership property and
the proportions of the capital to be advanced; as to the mode
of conducting the business; the use of the partnership name;
keeping the accounts; division of profits; and as to the dissolu-
tion, &c. Equity sometimes grants specific performance of such
articles in their entirety, or of subsidiary stipulations if clear
and definite.-Sichel v. Mosenthal, J. (62), 275; yet the fact,
that a partnership founded on litigation and distrust is not
likely to be successful, is an objection not without weight. If
accounts are to be taken, the remedy at law in covenant or
assumpsit is, if not futile, very inferior; while in equity not

[CH. II,
only may a breach of the contract, but acts injurious to the
partnership, be restrained by injunction.
The bankruptcy or death of a partner dissolves his partner-
ship. Generally the articles or the acts of the partners regu-
late a dissolution, but in order to prevent mischief a sudden
dissolution in ill faith will be restrained.
Romilly, M. R., thus states the rights as they exist at death.
-Payn v. Hornby, J. (58), 446. "A mortgage continues on
the stock in trade as it continues from time to time. But on
the death of a partner the case is altogether different. There
is, as Lord Eldon very accurately expresses it, a quasi lien;
there is, in point of fact, only a right to the specific property.
The executors of the deceased partner are joint tenants with
the surviving partners, and accordingly they are entitled to
require the surviving partners to do one of two things, either
to wind up the partnership business at once, or to fix the
value of the testator's property and secure the payment of the
amount.
"If the executors do not apply for a receiver, but simply file
a bill for the winding up of the partnership, I apprehend that
the new stock which has been acquired during the time the
business has been carried on by the surviving partners belongs
in the first place to the creditors who have been created by
such subsequent dealings, and not to the creditors of the old
partnership."
A portion of the value of a good will belongs to the deceased
partner.
Real estate belonging to the partnership is, in equity, con-
verted into personalty. And not only so during the lives of
the partners; it descends to their personal representatives.
Our law admits of dissolution more readily than did the
Roman, whence we have derived so many of our rules for con-
tracts. “Our law,” said Turner, L. J., " leaves either partner
at liberty to dissolve where the partnership is not for a definite
period, but in giving effect to the dissolution it deals with the
case according to what is just and equitable between the
parties. It has indeed refused to interfere with the legal rights
of the parties where there has been no fraud... but it has
exercised a wide discretion in these cases, at all events, as to

of a particular item, the case of a dissolution, by death or
otherwise, is an exception; if the old account is carried on the
items are applied in extinguishment of the balance due from
the old firm. Instances of this are to be found in banking more
frequently than in other partnerships.
The dissolution or winding up of joint stock companies is
regulated by the Companies Act VI of 1862, and the Commen-
taries by Griffith. In this work we can but call attention to
Contract Act, s. 239.

A plaintiff having insisted on that to which he had no right,
namely an absolute warranty of title, and having delayed
performing his part of the contract because the warranty was
not given was held disentitled by his conduct to a decree for

The following are cases in which the Court may
properly exercise a discretion not to decree specifio
performance:
I. Where the circumstances under which the
contract is made are such as to give the plaintiff
an unfair advantage over the defendant, though
there may be no fraud or misrepresentation on the
plaintiff's part.
The burden of proving a sufficiently case to justify the court
in interfering rests upon the plaintiff.. Griffith's Evidence Acts,
p. 188.—Davis v. Shepherd, L. R. 1 Ch. Div. 421. In leases of
minerals the same principles respecting divergence from a
definite quantity more or less or thereabouts are acted upon as

Sugden in his Treatise on Vendors and Purchasers has placed

hope of advantages nor to obscure the buyer's judgment of dis-

interest. Before the contract is completed, A receives a mortal
injury, from the effects of which he dies the day after the contract
is executed. If B and C were equally ignorant or equally aware
of the fact, B is entitled to specific performance of the contract.
If B knew the fact, and C did not, specific performance of the
contract should be refused to B.
(b.) A contracts to sell to B the interest of O in certain
stock-in-trade. It is stipulated that the sale shall stand good,
even though it should turn out that C's interest is worth
nothing. In fact the value of C's interest depends on the result
of certain partnership-accounts, on which he is heavily in debt
to his partners. This indebtedness is known to A, but not to
B. Specific performance of the contract should be refused to A.
(c.) A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, certain land.
To protect the land from floods, it is necessary for its owner to
maintain an expensive embankment. B does not know of this
circumstance, and A conceals it from him. Specific performance
of the contract should be refused to A.
(d.) A's property is put up to auction. B requests C, A's
attorney, to bid for him. C does this inadvertently and in good
faith. The persons present seeing the vendor's attorney bidding
think that he is a mere puffer and ceased to compete. The lot
is knocked down to B at a low price. Specific performance of
the contract should be refused to B.
II. Where the performance of the contract
would involve some hardship on the defendant which
he did not foresee, whereas its non-performance
would involve no such hardship on the plaintiff.
Other parts of the Act show that this clause proceeds on the
assumption that the plaintiff is not in fault that the defendant's
hardship arises from unforeseen circumstances. He is bound to
save the plaintiff harmless. He that seeks equity must do equity,

the land to C. Here the enforcement of the contract would
operate so harshly on A that the Court will not compel its
specific performance in favour of C.
(f.) A and B, trustees, join their beneficiary, C, in a contract
to sell the trust-estate to D, and personally agree to exonerate
the estate from heavy incumbrances to which it is subject.
The purchase-money is not nearly enough to discharge those
incumbrances, though, at the date of the contract, the vendors
believed it to be sufficient. Specific performance of the contract
should be refused to D.
(g.) A, the owner of an estate, contracts to sell it to B, and
stipulates that he, A, shall not be obliged to define its boundary.
The estate really comprises a valuable property not known to
either to be part of it. Specific performance of the contract
should be refused to B, unless he waives his claim to the
unknown property.
(h.) A contracts with B to sell him certain land, and to
make a road to it from a certain railway-station. It is found
afterwards that A cannot make the road without exposing him-
self to litigation. Specific performance of the part of the
contract relating to the road should be refused to B, even
though it may be held that he is entitled to specific performance
of the rest with compensation for loss of the road.
(i.) A, a lessee of mines, contracts with B, his lessor, that at
any time during the continuance of the lease B may give notice
of his desire to take the machinery and plant used in and about
the mines, and that he shall have the articles specified in his
notice delivered to him at a valuation on the expiry of the lease.
Such a contract might be most injurious to the lessee's business,
and specific performance of it should be refused to B.
(j.) A contracts to buy certain land from B. The contract
is silent as to access to the land. No right of way to it can be
shown to exist. Specific performance of the contract should be
refused to B.
(k.) A contracts with B to buy from B's manufactory and
not elsewhere all the goods of a certain class used by A in his
trade. The Court cannot compel B to supply the goods, but if
he does not supply them, A may be ruined, unless he is allowed

ance of the contract, unless where his part thereof
has already been performed;
"Representative." By assignment of interest by acts of parties
living or by devolution under a will or intestacy. See Griffith's
Transfer of Property Act, s. 5 and Griffith's Succession Act.
“An agent is a person employed to do any act for another or
to represent another in dealings with third persons. The
person for whom such act is done or is so represented is called
the principal." C. A., s. 182. "No consideration is necessary to
create an agency." C. A., s. 185. " Where acts are done by one
person on behalf of another but without his knowledge or autho-
rity he may elect to ratify or disown such acts."―s. 196. If
the agency is undisclosed specific performance will only be
granted to the principal subject to the rights the other party
would have had against the agent if he had been principal and
subject to the rights and obligations subsisting between the
agent and the other party to the contract. Ss. 231–232.
A mortgagee may enforce a lease made by his mortgagor in
possession.― Municipal Building Society v. Smith, 22 Q. B. D.
70. The lease was made under a statutory power, but the
general proposition seems sound.
(c) where the contract is a settlement on mar-
riage, or a compromise of doubtful rights between
members of the same family, any person beneficially

Members whether legitimate or illegitimate. According to the
law of contracts the true consideration for a compromise is the
abandonment of a claim; not the sacrifice of a right.—Stapilton
v. Stapilton, 2 L. C. in Eq. 836; Trigge v. Lavallee, 9 Jar. N. S.
261. Fraud, error or mistake as to a matter furnishing the
motive of either party but not a mistake as to the subject-
matter compromised may avoid the instrument. Thus should
the genuinenees of a deed or will be assumed and it be a forgery
or revoked the compromise fails. And a compromise of the
amount of a claim the liability on the claim being assumed
fails if there be no liability.—Stockley v. Stockley, 1 V. & B. 31.

As to ignorantia juris, the Judges remarks are somewhat vague
and their decisions inconsistent. Juris WESTBURY, L. C., observed
out to be translated here not law in general but that portion of
law belonging to an individual. See Griffith's Institutes of
Equity, p. 82, and Beauchamp v. Winn, L. R. 6 H. L. 223.
To sustain a family compromise there must have been a full
disclosure of all material circumstances in the knowledge of the
parties.-Gordon v. Gordon, 3 Swans. 400. Legal opinions must
be disclosed and the state of accounts if known stated.—Harvey
v. Coole, 4 Russ. 58. The real amount of the property must be
shown.-Groves v. Parkins, 6 Sim. 576. Compromises where one
party is likely to be influenced by natural or artificial relationship
as that of guardian and ward, parent and child, priest and peni-
tent, are watched by the court with jealous scrutiny. See
Griffith's Institutes of Equity, pp. 186-198. Compromises may
be presumed from the conduct of parties during a course of years
as well as proved by documentary and oral evidence. Griffith's
Evidence Acts, ss. 8, 13 and Williams v. Williams, L. R. 2 Ch.
Div. 294.
A had a child C by a former marriage and married B and
settled property giving C an interest therein. If C's provision
was part of the reciprocal considerations between A and B, it
is part of the marriage contract. If it was part of A's property
left out of the marriage contract which A chose to settle on C.
C's provision is a separate voluntary settlement.-Price v.
Jenkins, 5 Ch. Div. 619; Gale v. Gale, 6 Ch. Div. 144.
(d) where the contract has been entered into by
a tenant for life in due exercise of a power, the
remainderman.
" Due exercise of a power." Powers are Common Law Powers
Equitable powers and in English instruments powers deriving
their efficacy from the statute of uses. On the last class of
powers we need not enlarge here.
A common law power whether of a trustee or person acting
under a power of attorney enables the donse to pass the entire
or modified legal dominion.
An equitable power is that of the beneficiary of trust pro-
perty. See Griffith's Indian Trusts Act.

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS.
[CH. II,
No technical or express words are necessary either in a
deed or in a will to create a power if the intention be clear.
Sugden 102.
Every circumstance required by the instrument creating the
power to accompany the execution of the power should be
strictly observed. But executions of powers which are invalid
at law by reason of their failure to comply with all the
requisites of the power are aided in equity if there be a good
consideration. Marriage is a good consideration. The execu-
tion is not held valid but the court interferes and compels the
person entitled in default of appointment to make good the defect.
The courts hold that there is an excess in the exercise of a
power when there is a transgression either of the law or of the
scope of the power. An excess though it is not a due exercise
does not invalidate the part which is duly exercised. A power
involving the exercise of personal discretion is not to be dele-
gated. Sugden 179. Broom's Maxims.
A power may be adverse to the interest of a remainderman as
where a family settlement gives the husband power to jointure
the wife or charge the estate and gives the remainder to the son.
But powers of sale and exchange and powers of leasing being
for the better management of the estate are not adverse to
the remainderman's interest.
(e) a reversioner in possession, where the agree-
ment is a covenant entered into with his predecessor
in title and the reversioner is entitled to the benefit
of such covenant;
When a covenant extends to an existing thing parcel of the
demise the thing to be done by force of the covenant is annexed
and appurtenant to the thing demised and shall go with the
land and shall bind the assignee though he be not bound by
express words but when the covenant extends to a thing which
is not in being at the time of the demise made it cannot be
appurtenant or annexed thereto. For example a covenant to
build a new wall upon the land demised shall bind the cove-
nantor his executors or administrators but not his assignee.
2. A covenant for oneself and assigns to build a new wall or
do anything else on the land will bind the assign, but a

Covenants to repair to cultivate in a manner mentioned to
use a house only as a private dwelling and not to carry on a
trade thereon to paint; and to pay for injury to surface by
mining touch the demised and run therewith; as also do
implied covenants.
"In remainder.” The words are opposed to "in possession'
in clause (e). Mr. Collett is of opinion that " remainder” is used
to signify and include assignees of the reversioner. This is a
very forced interpretation and unnecessary since such assignees
have already been provided for by clause (b) and the doctrines
of notice. So long as the reversion is not in possession the
reversioner cannot bring an action for damages or injunction
unless the injury threatens the reversion and is material thereto.
For example a landlord cannot sne for a temporary nuisance
which may yet be good ground for an action by the tenant.

Indian Contract Act, s. 236, is as follows: "A person with
whom a contract has been entered into in the character of

he was acting in reality not as agent but on his own account."
A publisher insisted upon having a title page which the author

A cannot enforce specific performance of this contract so as to

(f) For whom Contracts cannot be specifically

Non-enforce.
26. Where a plaintiff seeks specific performance
of a contract in writing, to which the
ment except with defendant sets up a variation, the
plaintiff cannot obtain the perform-
ance sought, except with the variation so set up,
in the following cases (namely) :—
variation.
A definite written contract may be superseded by an oral one
but cannot according to the ordinary rules of evidence be
varied thereby. Griffith's Indian Evidence Acts, Ch. VI. And
yet both writing and oral statements may in some cases form
only one definite contract. When the law requires a writing it
does not thereby declare that every written contract shall bind
in the hands of the plaintiff it therefore does him no injustice
by allowing the defendant to use oral evidence.
The plaintiff instead of specific performance with a variation
may have damages where he has not been guilty of fraud but
the defendant as plaintiff can only have specific performance
with a variation which the other side would like.-Woollam
v. Hearne, 2 L. C. in Eq. 468. As to fraud, mistake and sur-
prise mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) see Griffith's Institutes
of Equity and 1 Story 120n. 251n.
(a) where by fraud or mistake of fact the con-
tract of which performance is sought is in terms
different from that which the defendant supposed it
to be when he entered into it;
Deeds are legal instruments of more solemnity in ceremonial
and of more conclusive effect than written contracts authenti-
cated only by signature and not also by seal of the parties. A
deed is altogether void where it has been procured by fraud and
that regardless of the question whether the person executing

it could read or not. But two points have to be considered how
far the fraud of one party really affected the other party's
knowledge of the contents and how far the other is estopped
by his negligence from taking advantage of it.-Blackwood v.
Gregg Hayes, 277; Foster v. Mackinnon, 17 W. R. 1105, L. R.
4 C. P. 704 ; Mason v. Ditchbourne, 1 Moo. & R. 460; Hunter
v. Walters, L. R. 7 Ch. Div. 75; Favell v. Wright, 35 8. J. 227.
Griffith's Institutes of Equity, p. 82 and Griffith's Indian
Evidence Acts, 229–240.
Summing up the effect of these authorities it seems correct to
say that it is not safe to rely upon any such wide principle as
that a deed is void if by reason of fraud it does not correspond
with the intention of the party executing it. Griffith's Insti-
tutes, p. 82. This may or may not be the case. It may however
be laid down with certainty that where it has been executed
under a misapprehension of its contents due to fraudulent mis-
statement then it is absolutely void. Third persons who
subsequently take conveyances in reliance upon the deed do so
at their own peril unless then can succeed in the difficult task of
proving negligence in which case possibly they may take
advantage of the doctrine of estoppel. Griffith's Indian Evidence
Acts, 229-240. The later of the cases cited tend to exclude
from relief parties whose carelessness in executing a deed has
conspired with fraud on the part of the person preparing the
deed.
(6) where by fraud, mistake of fact, or surprise
the defendant entered into the contract under
a reasonable misapprehension as to its effect as
between himself and the plaintiff ;
Surprise that is arising from the act of the party. Confused
and sudden impression rash and indiscreet conduct in entering
into a contract unless so induced may still bind the contractor.-
Twining v. Morrice, 2 Bro. C. C. 326, Story 120, 251.
Hence where there is no ambiguity either in respect to fact
or law in the terms used there can be no mistake or surprise
which will excuse the performance. A lessor signed an agree-
ment for a lease for 7 or 14 years supposing erroneously that
the law gave him as well as the lessee an option. Held, that
there was no variation.-Powell v. Smith, L. R. 14 Eq. 85.

A contract which is contingent on the permission of the

S. 152.
(c) where the defendant, knowing the terms of
the contract and understanding its effect, as entered
into it relying upon some misrepresentation by the
plaintiff, or upon some stipulation on the plaintiff's
part, which adds to the contract, but which he
refuses to fulfil;
(d) where the object of the parties was to pro-
duce a certain legal result, which the contract as
framed is not calculated to produce;
(e) where the parties have, subsequently to the
execution of the contract, contracted to vary it.
Where a written agreement is varied in part by parol if it
do not amount to a waiver of the contract but a variation by
parol which has not been acted upon and which was made with-
out consideration it cannot be made use of as a defence. Sugden's
V. & P. 134. An agreement which is not a mere variation but
is in substitution for the first is not within the section.—Moore

with the variation thus set up.
(b.) A sues B to compel specific performance of a contract

[CH. II,
A registered purchaser of land who buys with notice of a
prior unregistered contract by his vender to convey to the
plaintiff cannot resist a snit for specific performance on the
plea of registration. See s. 50 of Registration Act, 1877.-
Kadar d. Ismail, I. L. R. 9 M. S. 119.
Plaintiff being in possession of certain land as an incum-
brancer under a registered instrument agreed orally with the
mortgagor in 1885 to purchase it. The mortgagor sold the
land to others who take the conveyance which was registered
with notice of the plaintiff's mortgage and of the oral agreement
with him. Plaintiff now aned for a declaration that the con-
veyance was not binding on him and for specific performance of
the oral agreement. Held (1) that the suit was not bad for
want of a prayer for delivery up and cancellation of the con-
veyance; (2) that the plaintiff's possession under his incum-
brance together with agreement for sale was equivalent to
the delivery of possession within the meaning of Registration
Act, s. 48; (3) that the plaintiff was entitled to have the oral
contract specifically enforced notwithstanding the subsequent
registered sale.-Kannan v. Krishnan, I. L. R. 13 M. S. 324.
(a) either party thereto;
(b) any other person claiming under him by a
title arising subsequently to the contract, except a
transferee for value who has paid his money in
good faith and without notice of the original con-
tract;
Equity looks upon that as done which is agreed to be done
(Griffith's Institutes, Maxima) if it ought to be done. But this
is only in respect of those who have a right to pray that it might
be done. Story, 789-792.
The vendor becomes a trustee for the vendes and the vendee
for the vendor.
(c) any person claiming under a title which,
though prior to the contract and known to the plain-
tiff, might have been displaced by the defendant;
“Defendant” the word seems to be used inadvertently in place
of the other party to the contract,

(d) when a public company has entered into a
contract and subsequently becomes amalgamated
with another public company, the new company
which arises out of the amalgamation;
What is true of two individuals is true of two companies and
two companies do not by amalgamating become jointly liable
for each others engagements nor do the shareholders in one
company become debtors to the creditors of the other company.
A valid agreement to amalgamate binds the two companies
between themselves but will not per se give the creditors of one
company a locus standi against the other. An invalid agreement
vitiates securities given by one company to the debtors of the
other. Lindley, 2, 2, 2.
(e) when the promoters of a public company
have, before its incorporation, entered into a con-
tract, the company: provided that the company has

Contracts made by promoters to pay sums of money to per-
sons who might lawfully oppose the formation of the company
and in consideration thereof agree not to do so but to use their
influence in its favour have been held ultra vires.-Caledonian

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS. [CH. it,
Fifthly.—Relief is granted in the case of catching bargains
with heirs, reversioners or expectants in the life of the father or
other relative. These cases have been generally mixed com-
pounded of all or several species of frand; there being some-
times proof of actual fraud which is always decisive."
A false statement made knowingly, or without belief in its
truth or recklessly is fraudulent. Derry, 14 A. C. 337.
Either the seller or the buyer may use the defence of in-
adequacy of consideration.
See Griffith's “Fraud, MisreprESENTATION AND MISTAKE,” chs."
v. and vii.
(b) if his assent was obtained by the misrepre-
sentation (whether wilful or innocent), conceal-
ment, circumvention, or unfair practices, of any
party to whom performance would become due
under the contract, or by any promise of such party
which has not been substantially fulfilled;
The elements of defence are the same as those mentioned in
s. 26 (a) & (b) but the defence is more extensive being to the
whole contract and not to a part by way of variation.
It is not stated whether the promise is part of the contract,
24 (b) or an addition thereto 26 (c) the word any however
seems to include promises of both kinds if they produce assent.
“
Misrepresentation" being a defence fraud is a fortiori also.
As to misrepresentation, see Indian Contract Act, s. 18 aud
note to s. 26 (c).
"Concealment.”
To make mere silence fraudulent it must
be the duty of the person silent to speak or his silence must be
equivalent to speech. If a man knows that he has committed
a serious trespass on his neighbour's property and wishing to
screen himself from the consequences makes a proposal to buy
it he ought to disclose the trespass to the party selling.-
Phillips v. Homfray, L. R. 6 Ch. Div. 779; Denny 6 Ch. Div. 1;
Baskcomb, 8 Eq. 100.
" Circumvention" is " any act fitted to deceive and includes
undue influence." See Griffith's Institutes of Equity, pp. 188-
200.

Unfair practices" is a more sweeping term and includes
coercion. See Griffith's Institutes, p. 175.
A person who really acts upon his own investigation or
knowledge and not on the statements of the other party is not
deceived thereby.-Small v. Attwood, 6 Cl. & F. 232.
A misrepresentation which is palpably false as a description
that a house is in perfect repair which the purchaser sees has
no roof or windows cannot be said to deceive him. I. C. A., s. 19.
The same section avoids the defence if the plaintiff can prove
that the defendant had the means of discovering the truth with
ordinary diligence. Griffith's Indian Evidence Acts. But where
the plaintiff cannot produce evidence either that the defendant
knew facts to show that a material representation was untrue
or that he said or did anything which showed that he did not
rely on the statement, the untruth is a sufficient ground of
defence or for rescinding the contract.-Redgrave v. Hurd,
20 Ch. Div. 22.
In an action for deceit if it is proved that the plaintiff did not
rely upon the false statement complained of he cannot maintain
the action.
If the name of a person improperly placed on the list of
directors in the prospectus of a company it must depend upon
the circumstances of the case whether it is a material misstate-
ment. See Griffith's Indian Companies Act, 1882, s. 58.
If a statement by which a person says he has been deceived is
ambiguous he must state the meaning which he attached to it.
A statement though untrue to the knowledge of the person
making it may be held by the court too trivial to have influ-
enced the other party, for example a misvaluation of the com.
pany's property to the extent of £3000 out of £301,000; the
omission to state that interest was to be paid on instalments.—
Smith v. Chadwick, C. A. 20 Ch. Div. 27.
"
Any party.” This includes an agent but excludes an unau-
thorised person. Collett, p. 180.
The defence is available against an assignee who is personally
free from blame but not available for an assignee on whom no
deceit has been practised.-Smith v. Clarke, 12 Vesey 477.

See Griffith's "FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION AND MISTAKE,"

(c) if his assent was given under the influence
of mistake of fact, misapprehension or surprise :
Provided that, when the contract provides for com-
pensation in case of mistake, compensation may be
made for a mistake within the scope of such provi-
sion and the contract may be specifically enforced
in other respects if proper to be so enforced.
Under such a provision compensation may be obtained even
after conveyance.-Turner & Skelton, 13 Ch. Div. 130; Bos v.
Helsham, L. R. 2 Ex. 72; Manson Thacker, 7 Ch. Div. 620 to
the contrary is overruled. But where a purchaser is evicted
after a conveyance under a title to which the covenants do not
extend he cannot recover the purchase-money.-Allen v.
Richardson, 13 Ch. Div. 524.
Specific performance is not even partially decreed against
one jointly interested but dealing for the entirety. Ravenscroft,
1895; 1 Q B. 685.
A mistake recklessly or negligently made ought not to be a
defence. There should be something reasonably leading to it.-
Tamplin v. James, 15 Ch. Div. 222.
A condition or proviso that an error in the particulars shall
not annul the sale or be the subject of compensation will be no
bar to compensation for a material deficiency. L. R. 8 Eq. 603.
And no vendor who has been guilty of fraud or misrepresent-
ation can avail himself of such condition.-Brownlie v. Campbell,
5 App. Cas. 937.
The revocation of an agent's authority does not take effect so
far as regards third persons before it is known to them. I. C.

deviation from what is right in rational agents and is opposed

to restrain proceedings being taken out of court in the name of

in a will or codicil to execute a parti-
cular settlement.
At one time the courts in England and Scotland treated
themselves rather as being in the position of courts of appeal
and examined whether or not the conclusion at which an arbi-
trator had arrived was sound both in point of law and of fact.
“I think” said Lord Chancellor Halsbury "the only learned
Judge who ever gave distinct expression to that view was Lord
Thurlow." "Lord Thurlow says that it is no ground for setting
aside an award that the conclusion was wrong otherwise it
would be a ground for setting aside all awards, but his Lordship
goes on to say that where certain facts are submitted to the
arbitrator by the court the arbitrator must be considered to be
somewhat in the position of a master” (that is an officer of the
court) "and that the court when the matter comes back to them
have to consider not only whether the master has acted according
to law but whether he has arrived at a sound conclusion. His
Lordship goes on to distinguish arbitrations in the more popular
sense of the word and shows that where there are real arbitra-
tions and where the parties have selected their judge in such
cases you have to show a great deal more than mere error on the
part of the arbitrator in the conclusion at which he has arrived
before the court can interfere with his award.—(Knox v. Symonds,
1 Ves. Jun. 369.) And in the court of common pleas, forty years
ago, in a case in which the arbitrator had a question of law
submitted to him according to the ordinary forms of pleading
the court having come to the conclusion that the decision of
the arbitrator was in the sense in which they understood the
words erroneous in deciding on a question of law nevertheless
held that the parties having submitted that question to the arbi-
trator it was for the arbitrator to determine it; in their own
language the parties had agreed to accept the arbitrator's

113
decision upon the question of law as well as his decision upon
the facts.”—Adams v. Great North of Scotland Railway Co., H.
L. 1891, A. C. 45.
In the same case which must now be regarded as the leading
case on arbitrations and awards, Lord Watson said:
" The
practice is at an end of reviewing an award upon the merits. It
is a final decision in Scotland. But it may be set aside for want
of jurisdiction. Misconduct in the course of the case whether
in the proceedings which led to the award or in the award
itself is ground for setting it aside. When the arbitrator has
exceeded the limits of the agreement when he has disregarded
any one of the express conditions in the contract of submission
or any one of those important conditions which the law implies
in every submission; when he has violated the principles of
justice and justice cannot be done between the parties without
setting aside the award in any of these cases it may be set aside.”
1891 A. C., pp. 45-47.
An award is considered in equity as amounting to an agree-
ment between the parties on the terms pointed out by him.
In order therefore that it may be specifically performed it must
be certain, it must not go beyond or fall short of the agreement
to refer; such agreement should be free from hardship or
unfairness in its terms or inducing thereto. Russell III, Ch. 4.
-Nickels v. Hancock, 7 D. M. & G. 300. The arbitrator must
decide the questions. A settlement by general arrangement
which he considers fair is not sufficient. Russ. 2, 5, 4.
If one part of an award is bad and the other good, the good
part if separable may be specifically enforced.
Arbitrators are to be considered as a tribunal administering
justice. And the fabrication of evidence to be used before
them is a penal offence.-Q. v. Vreones, 1891, 1 Q. B. 369; I. P.
C. 192. An arbitrator's finding on a point is a res judicata.
Gueret, 62 L. J. Q. B. 633.
"Courts of equity will not enforce the specific performance of
an agreement to refer any matter in controversy between adverse
parties deeming it against public policy to exclude from the
appropriate judicial tribunals of the state any persons who in
the ordinary course of things have a right to sue there. Neither

[CH. II,
will they for the same reason compel arbitrators to make an
award nor will they when they have made an award compel
them to disclose the grounds of their judgment. The latter
doctrine stands upon the same ground as the others that is to
say in the first instance not to compel a resort to these domestic
tribunals and on the other hand not to disturb their decisions
when made except upon very cogent reasons.
"
When an award has actually been made and it is unim-
peached and unimpeachable it constitutes a bar to a suit for
the same subject-matter. And equity will in proper cases
enforce the specific performance of an award which is un-
exceptionable and which has been acquiesced in by the parties
if it is for the performance of any acts by the parties in specie
such as a conveyance of lands, and such performance will be
decreed almost as a matter of contract instead of an award.
The word award does not include a submission to arbitration
which may eventuate in an award. But though the court will
refuse specifically to enforce references to arbitration an
inequitable refusal of a plaintiff to make such a reference may
disentitle him to the aid of the court on the principle that
he who seeks equity must do equity. (Griffith's Institutes,
p. 25.) Thus where a deed was executed which created a lien for
the amount of a solicitor's bill and advances, the amount of which
was to be settled by arbitration and the arbitrator died before
the award was made; in a suit seeking a reconveyance of the
property, Baron Alderson held that the contract between the
parties consisted of two parts; the first, admitting that some
balance was due to the solicitor, and the second, a contract for a
specific mode of ascertaining the balance that the latter part
alone had failed that the former part remained entire and that
the court would not decree a reconveyance without the
plaintiff's consenting to do equity by having the amounts taken
by an officer of the court. Fry, S. P. 661.-Oheslyn v. Dalby,
2 Y. & C. Ex. 170.
ง
There are three grounds for setting aside an award; (1)
mistake; (2) corruption or that they have proceeded contrary to
the principles of natural justice as if without reason they will
not hear a witness or decide without hearing one side; (3)
exceeding the arbitration powers. (1) Mistake must be proved

granted on the ground of a mistake by the attorney of instruc-
tions.-V. & P. 143.
In Daniel v. Arkwright, J. (64), 764. An appointment under
a power to a child, her husband and children, by deed-poll,
was rectified, and the limitation made to the child absolutely
and alone, such being the intention of the appointors, which
had been frustrated by the error of the solicitor.
In Dendy v. Cary, J. (63), 845, Vice-Chancellor Wood held
the grantor of a lease liable even after execution on a parol
promise to allow a right of way, on faith of which the contract
was entered into and alterations made in the house.
When instru-
ment may be recti-
fied.
31. When, through fraud or a mutual mistake
of the parties, a contract or other in-
strument in writing does not truly
express their intention, either party,
or his representative in interest, may institute a suit
to have the instrument rectified; and if the Court
find it clearly proved that there has been fraud or
mistake in framing the instrument, and ascertain
the real intention of the parties in executing the
same, the Court may in its discretion rectify the in-
strument, so as to express that intention, so far as
this can be done without prejudice to rights acquir-
ed by third persons, in good faith and for value.
In the absence of fraud, deceit or mutual mistake an allega-
tion by a mortgagor that a sum in excess of the debt had
been inserted in an instrument will not sustain a suit for
rectification.-Amanat v. Lachman, I. L. R. 14 C. S. 308.
A contract implies a valuable consideration. A voluntary
deed does not. It is included under the phrase other instru-
ment in writing. If imperfect the court will not compel its
completion. But when completed it may be rectified or re-
scinded on the same grounds as instruments for valuable consi-
deration if the settlor wishes it. After the death of a voluntary
settlor the settlement may be rectified in accordance with his
proved intention if the error arose from fraud or mistake.—
Lister v. Hodgson, L. R. 4 Eq. 30; Hall v. Hall, L. R. 8 Ch.
Div. 430; Phillips v. Mullings, L. R. 7 Ch. Div. 244. If a volun.

tary settlement be impeached the onus of supporting does not
necessarily rest on those setting it up. Hervey 18 Ch. Div. 668.
A mistake on one side may be a ground of defence to an action
for specific performance or a ground for resciuding but not for
rectifying an instrument.—Harris v. Pepperell, L. R. 5 Eq. 1;
Bloomer v. Spittle, L. R. 13 Eq. 427.
Where articles of agreement are varied by a settlement before
marringe the settlement is probably if it differs a new agree-
ment; where by a settlement after marriage the presumption is
that they were intended to follow the articles.-Bold v. Hutchin-
son, 5 D. M. & G. 558; Cogan v. Duffield, 2 Ch. Div. 44. Doubt-
ful or ambiguous words in articles may fairly be supposed to be
settled in their meaning by a subsequent instrument.
Where there is a joint loan and the bond to pay is joint only
and not several there is a presumption that it ought to have
been several also but the whole transaction must be scrutinised.
-Druiff v. Parker, L. R. 5 Eq. 131; 1 Story 162-4. For it
is both natural and equitable to suppose that two borrowers
borrowed on a joint and several contract; but the presumption
may be rebutted, see Griffith's Indian Evidence Acts, p. 222.
And where a party to the joint contract is a surety positive evi-
dence is requisite to fix him with a several liability. 2 Mer.
R. 30.
"Real Intention," that is intention existing at the time of
execution.― Wilkinson v. Nelson, 7 Jur. N. S. 480; Walker v.
Armstrong, 8 D. M. & G. 531.
Where a matter has been completely overlooked on both
sides where a team has not been determined on or discussed, or
where the contract intentionally left out some terms rectifica-
tion will not be applied.-Parker v. Taswell, 2 D. & J. 559;
Elwes v. Elwes, 7 Jurist N. S. 302; 3 D. F. & J. 667.
"Clearly proved." This excludes rectification in cases where
the evidence is nicely balanced where it is loose or equivocal or
in its texture open to doubt or to opposing presumption. The
documentary evidence is the first and the better evidence.
Griffith's Indian Evidence Act, p. 166, and to displace evidence
is admissible but should be stronger. Griffith's Indian Evidence
Act, p. 176. Story well explains the reason of the admission of
any evidence to contravene the written act of a party. "The

[CH. III,
danger of setting aside the solemn engagements of parties when
reduced to writing by the introduction of parol evidence substi-
tuting other material terms and stipulations is sufficiently obvious.
But what shall be said where those terms and stipulations are
suppressed or omitted by fraud or imposition ? Shall the guilty
party be allowed to avail himself of such a triumph over inno-
cence and incredulity to accomplish his own base designs? That
would be to allow a rule introduced to suppress fraud to be the
most effectual promotion and encouragement of it. And hence
the rule to admit parol evidence to reform all contracts where
a fraudulent suppression, omission or insertion of a material
stipulation exists. It is upon the same or rather a similar ground
that such evidence is rendered admissible where there has been
an innocent omission or insertion of a material stipulation
contrary to the intention of both parties and under a mutual
mistake. To allow it to prevail in such a case would be to work
a surprise or fraud upon both parties and certainly upon the one
who is the sufferer. "As much injustice would to the full" says
Story somewhat strongly "under such circumstances as would
be done by a positive fraud or inevitable accident." §§ 154, 155.
Specific performance was decreed on the testimony of one
witness and circumstances against a denying plaintiff. Morphett

Clearly proved." Not only may evidence be given of the
existence or non-existence of every fact in issue but also of
relevant facts. Facts which are so connected with facts in
issue as to form part of the same transaction are relevant
whether they occurred at the same time and place or at a differ-
ent time or place. So also are facts which are the occasion,
cause or effect, immediate or otherwise of relevant facts or facts
in issue or which constitute the state of things under which
they happened or which afforded an opportunity for their
occurrence or transaction. So is conduct and any fact which
shows and constitutes a motive or preparation for any fact in
issue or relevant fact. So is any fact necessary to explain or
introduce a fact or which supports or rebuts an inference
suggested by a fact in issue or relevant fact or which establishes
the identity of any thing or person whose identity is relevant

The register of shareholders in a limited liability company
(see Griffith's Indian Companies Act, 88. 58 & 59) is made
upon those grounds amongst others which justify a rescission
not a rectification of an agreement.
The court declined to rectify a settlement by giving the wife
a power of appointment by will or in default an absolute
interest if she survived her husband merely because the father
the principal settlor had been the wife's agent and there had
been no independent legal advice beyond that of the family
solicitor. Held also that the father was the proper and natural
agent for a daughter in preparing a marriage settlement.
Tucker v. Bennett, 38 Ch. Div. 1.

claims the annuity from A. The court, on finding it clearly

The plaintiff was a Chatri by caste and the defendant was his

in the locality where he resided. The gift comprised the whole
of the plaintiff's property and the only reason for its execution
was the plaintiff's desire to secure benefits to his soul in the next
world and his having heard the defendant recite the holy book
called Bhagwat. Almost immediataly after the execution of
the deed the plaintiff repudiated it and sued for its cancellation
on the ground of fraud. Held, that having regard to the
fiduciary relation subsisting between the parties the improvi-
dence of the gift, the absurdity of the reason alleged for it and the
principle recognised by Griffith's Indian Evidence Acts, s. 111,

A contracts in writing to pay his attorney, B, a fixed sum in

and rights of the client, which, if construed strictly, would
exclude B from all rights under it. B is entitled, if the Court
thinks fit, to have it rectified, and to an order for payment of
the sum, as if at the time of its execution it had expressed the
intention of the parties.

tract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so
caused. A party to a contract whose consent was caused by
fraud or misrepresentation may if he thinks fit insist that the
contract shall be performed and that he shall be put in the
position in which he would have been if the representations
made had been true. If such consent was caused by misrepre-
sentation or by silence fraudulent within the meaning of section
17 the contract nevertheless is not voidable if the party whose
consent was so caused had the means of discovering the truth
with ordinary diligence. Where both parties to an agreement
are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agree-
ment the agreement is void.
“Terminable.” A contract is such when it contains a stipu-
lation that in a certain event it may be ended. But conditions
that if the vendor cannot deduce a good title or that the
purchaser does not pay on an appointed day the agreement
shall be terminable does not enable either party to terminate if
he has the power of going on. A condition enabling the vendor
to rescind instead of answering objections is more decisive, and
gives an unrestricted power. Sugden 18, 16, 225. Jackson
and Oakshott, 14 Ch. Div. 854. The right must be promptly exer-
cised. V. & P. 211.
Independently of cases a, b, &c., rescission may take place
in accordance with the contract. Purchasers brought an action
for specific performance of a contract for sale of some real
property which contained a proviso to the effect that the vendor
might rescind on his being unable or unwilling to remove any
objection to title. It appeared that the purchasers conditionally
offered to give time for the removal and that the vendor in
good faith objected to the conditions and was threatened with
litigation in consequence. Held, that the vendor was entitled
to rescind. 15 App. Cas. 42.
Laches or delay may be a good defence to an action for res-
cission, and more especially when accompanied with knowledge
of the facts entitling to relief. A party against whom fraud is
established must if he plead laches and delay prove that the
other party had sufficient knowledge and the time of acquiring
it.-Lindsay P. Co. v. Hurd, L. R. 5 P. C. 241. But see Griffith's
Evidence Acts.

RESCISSION OF CONTRACTS.
125
A plaintiff in pari delicto with defendant cannot obtain a
decree rescinding a contract. The two parties had attempted
to defeat the Government's right of eschent. I. L. R. 3 M. S. 215.
Where a purchase is made from a poor and ignorant man at a
considerable undervalue the vendor having no independent
advice a court of equity will set aside the transaction. This
will be done in case of property in possession still more of that
in reversion. Poverty, ignorance and absence of independent
advice throw upon the purchaser the onus of proving that the
transaction was fair, just and reasonable. 40 Ch. Div. 312.
A contract for sale under the direction of the court will not
be set aside because the purchaser in giving information at the
request of the court has not given all the information he pos-
sessed. The information retained was neither offered nor
requested and respecting it there was no implied representation
positive or negative, direct or indirect in the statement made.—
Coakes v. Boswell, 11 App. Cas. 232.
A partner who had been induced to join the firm by material
though not fraudulent misrepresentations is entitled to rescis-
sion although owing to the material one of the business he is
not able to restore his copartners to their position at the time
of the contract. He is not liable to them for money lent and
goods sold by them to the copartnership. The House of Lords
affirmed the decree generally but refused to decide whether the
copartners ought to indemnify him against the general liabili-
ties of the firm.-Newbiggin v. Adam, 34 Ch. Div. 582; 13 App.
Cas. 308.
Where a company claim the rescission of a contract with a
director on the ground that he did not disclose the fact that he
was selling his own property they must do so in time to place
the vendor in the position he was at the time of sale. The
company having allowed a lease of the mine in question to lapse
to the landlord it was held that they were too late to claim
rescission.—Ludywell Mining Co. v. Brooks, 34 Ch. Div. 398; 35
Ch. Div. 400.

defendant asserting that to be a fact which is not so for his own
benefit though he believe it to be so yet being material it is a
fraud on the other party.—Hart v. Swain, 7 Ch. Div. 46. On the
other hand a party injured must be in a position if he seeks
relief to rescind entirely. He cannot take the benefit of part and
obtain relief from the other part. Griffith's Institutes of Equity,
p. 25, XII.—Urquhart v. Macpherson, 3 App. Cas. 838. Further
the injured party must exercise his option of rescission before
the rights of innocent third parties intervene such as creditors
of a company in winding up. Griffith's Institutes of Equity,
p. 26, XVI.-Olough v. L. & N. W. Rail., L. R. 7 Ex. 35. Burgess's
case, 15 Ch. Div. 511.
Accident and mistake affecting the foundation of a contract
are grounds for rescission. Otherwise they may only require
some amendment, addition, qualification or variation to render
it just and reasonable and so enforceable. 1 Story Equity 694.
A condition of sale which requires that the purchaser shall
assume that the vendor derived a good title under a will does
not preclude the purchaser from showing that upon the true
construction of the will a good title did not pass. 25 L. R.
Ir. 307.
The words "notwithstanding any previous negotiation or
litigation" in a condition of sale stipulating that the vendor may
annul the sale if unable to satisfy any objection insisted on do
not include litigation in which a judicial decision adverse to the
vendor has been given. Held also that they refer to pending
litigation and that after an order of the court that a good
title had not been shown the vendor must pay the purchaser's
costs of investigating the title. C. A. Arbib's Contract, 39 W.
R. 305.
"Voidable." The distinction between stipulations and condi-
tions is important. A breach of the former is only ground for
damages, the non-performance of a condition gives a title to
rescind. In England a warranty is a stipulation, in Scotland a
condition; so of a purchase by sample. But in England and
elsewhere a purchase with warranty or by sample may contain
a further stipulation for return of goods on breach.—Conston v.
Chapman, H. L., L. R. 2 Sc. Ap. 250. In England when goods
are ordered from a manufacturer as such there is an implied

a forged acceptance was not set aside on suit of trustee in

(c) where a decree for specific performance of a
contract of sale, or of a contract to take a lease, has
been made, and the purchaser or lessee makes
default in payment of the purchase-money or other
sums which the Court has ordered him to pay.
When the purchaser or lessee is in possession of
the subject-matter, and the Court finds that such
possession is wrongful, the Court may also order
him to pay to the vendor or lessor the rents and
profits, if any, received by him as such
possessor.
In the same case, the Court may, by order in the
suit in which the decree has been made and not
complied with, rescind the contract either so far as
regards the party in default, or altogether, as the
justice of the case may require.

Story observes that both accident and mistake when reach-
ing the foundation of a contract are grounds for rescission.
The two topics of accident and mistake are thus explained by
Mr. Griffith in his Institutes of Equity.

Where there has been a transfer of property the restitution
of the parties to the former position is by retransfer with an
account of the profits and an allowance for depreciation.-Erlan-
ger v. N. S. P. Co., 3 App. Cas. 1218. Should the right to
restitution be at an end that to damages may still exist.
Mistake.
The term Mistake differs from the logical term misappre-
hension. The latter denotes a failure of the mind in forming a
clear conception of an idea, the former a failure in acquiring a
knowledge of matters of fact. From misapprehension, indeed,
inadvertence or surprise, mistakes frequently arise. But one is
a cause, the other an effect. Some who hold with Lord Coke,
4th Institute, ch. 8, that the subjects of equity jurisdiction are
three-covin, accident, and breach of confidence-make mistake
a species of accident. But a mistake entitles to relief as affect-
ing the inception of a contract, while accident affects the per-
formance of a valid contract.
Ignorantia juris neminem excusat, ignorantia facti excusat.
The law is a science, and it is culpable negligence to draw out
or enter into a contract without learning and weighing the part
of the science which relates to the act or contract.
"But no
person can be presumed to be acquainted with all matters of
fact; neither is it possible, by any degree of diligence, in all
cases to acquire that knowledge."-Story, § 140. Facti inter-
pretatio etiam prudentissimos fallit.-Neratius; Phillimore on
Jurisprudence, 96; and therefore an ignorance of facts does not
import culpable negligence. But still, though the negligence
be not gross, in many cases active diligence is requisite.
Cases are to be found in the law books in which an ignor.
ance of law seems to have been the ground of relief; Lord
Westbury suggested an ingenious interpretation of the maxim
which reconciles apparently conflicting authorities. Jus may
be used in the sense of general law, or of a portion which ap-
pertains to an individual, viz., a private right. -Cooper v. Phibbs,
H. L. 2, L. R. 2, 149.
It is a rule of general jurisprudence, which holds at Com-
mon Law and in Equity, that where there is no consensus ad
idem, no mental acceptance of the proffer, there is no contract:

Non videntur qui errant consentire. Digest, 50, 17, 116, 2.
Thus Lord Chancellor Thurlow in Calverley v. Williams,
1 Ves. J. 210, said, "That if it were proved that one party thought
that he had purchased bond fide what the other thought he had
not sold, it was a ground to set aside the contract:" and Sir
T. Plumer, in Clowes v. Higginson, 1 Ves. & B. 524, speaking of
Lord Chancellor Thurlow's opinion on this point, states also,
the view of Sir W. Grant, that the consequence of such a mis-
take would be, that in reality there was no agreement, but that
the parties misunderstanding each other, the one proposing to
buy one thing, the other to sell another, a contract so framed
in mistake cannot consistently with justice be executed. Under
similar circumstances a contract was ordered to be cancelled
in Price v. Ley, J. (63), 295. But it is to be remembered
that parties may agree to a contract concerning incidents of
which, not going to the root of the consideration, they are
willingly ignorant; they may also contract with respect to
contingencies, the events of which cannot be foreknown, as in
policies of assurance; they may also contract by way of com-
promise, upon supposition of a right or doubtful right. Thus
Lord Chancellor Macclesfield, in Cann v. Cann, 1 P. Wms. 723,
lays down the rule, "That an agreement entered into upon
the supposition of a right, or of a doubtful right, though it
after comes out that the right was on the other side, shall be
binding, and the right shall not prevail against the agreement
of the parties; for the right must always be on the one side or
the other; and, therefore, the compromise of a doubtful right is
a sufficient foundation of an agreement.”
A compromise cannot stand if there is knowledge on the one
side which is withheld from the other.-Brooke v. Mostyn,
L. J., J. (64), 1114.
The rule applies to compromises approved of by the court on
behalf of infants.
In Stainton v. The Carron Iron Company, J. (61), 645, Lord
Justice Turner said:-" Where one of the parties has claims
more or less extended against the other, the usual consider-
ations which apply to cases of compromise, such as whether the
parties understood their rights and questions of that nature,
although perhaps they ought not wholly to be laid out of view,

extent―that the court would ascertain whether the bishop had
acted within the scope of his authority, and had proceeded in a
manner consonant with the principles of justice, and the plain-
tiff might justly say to the contributors: "You cannot now recede
from your engagement, because that is made manifest to you
which from the first you must or ought to have been well
acquainted with."
A most important class of cases involving a compromise are
those of family arrangements or settlements.
Lord Chancellor Hardwicke, in Stapilton v. Stapilton, 1 Atk. 2,
ruled that where an arrangement is for the purpose of saving
the honour of a father and his family, and is a reasonable
agreement, if it is possible for a Court of Equity to decree a
performance of it, it ought to be done. In Williams v. Williams,
2 C. A. 304, the late Lord Justice Turner, a judge distinguished
for his mastery of the practice of conveyancers, said :—“It
has been strongly urged-that is, in argument-that cases
of family arrangements extend no further than to arrangements
for the settlement of doubtful or disputed rights." But this, I
think, is a very short-sighted view of the cases as to family
arrangements. They extend, as I apprehend, much further
than is contended for on the part of the appellant, and apply,
as I conceive, not merely to cases in which arrangements are
made between members of a family for preservation of its peace,
but to cases in which arrangements are made between them for
the preservation of its property. The resettlement of family
estates, upon an arrangement between the father and the eldest
son on his attaining twenty-one, may well be considered as a
branch of these cases, and certainly this court does not in such
cases inquire into the quantum of consideration." But there
ought to be a knowledge of the doubts. Dixon H. L., 4 H.
L. 606.
The plaintiff must be consistent. His alternative reliefs must
be based on the same state of facts giving rise to different con-
clusions of law. It would be inconsistent to ask for specific
performance and in the alternative for relief on the ground of
fraud.-Cawley v. Poole, 1 H. M. 50; Fry 484. But the doctrine
savours too much of scholasticism and technicality and too little
of natural equity. See also Bagot v. Easton, 7 Ch. Div. 1.

Though in commercial contracts where one party says he is
unwilling to fulfil it the other may rescind, yet in a suit to
enforce a purchase of real estate (leasehold) the court would
not give judgment immediately for rescission and forfeiture of
deposit but only a decree for specific performance against a
defendant who admitted that he was unwilling to complete and
did not appear at the trial.-Stone v. Smith, 35 Ch. Div. 188.
Specific performance without a declaration of lien was refused
against a defaulter in Taron's case, W. N. 1887.
Where acting under the terms of the contract defendants
have rescinded, though specific performance may be no longer
obtainable damages can be sued for. Under the circumstances
of rescission the court refused to grant an injunction or receiver
against trustees holding funds for the defendants who had
rescinded.-Burnay v. Ambaca Railway, 7 T. L. R. 545. 1891,

CHAPTER V.
OF THE CANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS.
"Two etymologies of the word Chancellor or Cancellarius
have been offered. The first is that of Sir Edward Coke, who
derives the word from the verb cancello, and makes the chan-

Page 157

CANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS.
[CH. V,
cellor an officer to cancel invalid grants of the king, by drawing
cancelli or lattice like lines upon them. But an officer to draw
the royal grants must exist before they could be cancelled, and
the cancelling would be the exceptional duty of such an officer;
and, again, the analogy of Latin etymology requires the word
cancellator, not cancellarius. The second derives the word
from cancelli, as signifying the open bars of a gate, and makes
the cancellarius to be the officer or usher of such gate or
chancel. From a passage in the works of Ammianus Marcellinus,
f. 330, de advocatis, "Cumque intra cancellorum septa et agi
coeperunt alicujus fortunæ," we may conclude that a portion of
the tribunals was partitioned off with cancelli. In the time of
Theodosius the cancellarius had become a law officer of some
importance. Thus we read in the Codex Theodosianus, I. xii.,
"Nullus judicum ad provinciam sibi commissam secum ducere
audeat cui domestici, vel cancellarii nomen imponat nec pro-
fectum ad se undecunque suscipiat, ne famæ notâ cum bonorum
publicatione plectatur. Periculo enim primatum officii can-
cellarios sub fide gestorum electos judicibus applicari jubemus,
ita ut post depositam administrationem per continuum triennium
nec militam deserant et Provincialibus præsentiam sui ex-
hibeant, quo volentibus sit accusandi eos facultas." From this.
passage we may infer that the cancellarius was the actuary or
registrar, the person who committed to writing and kept the
acta of the court. He may also have been the grapharius, or
the person to reduce to form the pleadings of the litigants.
Constantine, Novella x., et Leges Longobardorum, ii. 40. It is
easy to see how the cancellarius, the courtkeeper of an auto-
cratic emperor, penes quem legum dictandarum et rescriptorum
ad preces supplicum jus erat, would be a high officer of state.-
1 Gibbon, 353; Codex Theodosianus, X. i. viii. Comment.
Marvil.
Thus much is clear that, before Justinian had codified the
Roman Law, there was attached to the then courts of justice
an officer called cancellarius, who acted as a registrar or an
actuary, and made and kept the acts of the court. Since then
we find the universities of learning presided over by chancellors
and bishops, assisted in the administration of their dioceses by
similar officers, and hence the books sometimes speak of the
lord chancellor as the king's chancellor." Griffith's Institutes 2.

up and cancellation may be ordered. On the other hand where
it cannot be so avoided but there is a good legal defence to an
action upon it, a decree for cancellation cannot be made.-Thorn-
ton v. Knight, 16 Sim. 509; Brooking v. Mandslay, 38 Ch. Div.
636. The same principle was applied to an annuity deed.-
Bromley v. Holland, 7 Ves. 3 and by Cottenham, L. C. to avoid
instrument in Simpson v. Howden, 3 My. & Cr. 97. In Cooper
v. Joel, Campell, L. C., reversed the decision of Romilly, M. R.,
who had ordered an instrument to be delivered up though there
was a good legal defence saying that the evidence might be lost
and so the defence prove worthless. 1 D. F. & J. 240. Campbell,
L..C. said that if the rule alleged by the plaintiffs existed hardly
any dispute could arise upon a contract or indeed as to any
other legal right which might not be made a question of equity.
S. C. Lord Selborne in Hoare v. Bremridge, said that the court
has jurisdiction to set aside a contract where there has beeu
concealment and misrepresentation. L. R. 8 Ch. Div. 22.
Where there is danger of the evidence for the defence being
lost the remedy is not an action for cancellation but a suit to
perpetuate testimony.-Brooking v. Mandslay Son & Field, 38
Ch. Div. 636. The law as to such suits is thus laid down. If it
be possible that the matter in question can try the party plaintiff
be made the subject of immediate judicial investigation no such
suit is entertained. But if the plaintiff can by no means bring
the matter into present judicial investigation (which may hap-
pen when his title is in remainder or when he is himself in posses-
sion) equity will entertain such a suit for otherwise the only
testimony which could support the plaintiff's title might be lost
by the deaths of his witnesses. Where he himself is in posses-
sion the adverse party might purposely delay his claim with a
view to that event--Angell v. Angell, 1 S. & S. 83; Earl Spen-
cer v. Peek, L. R. 3 Eq. 415.

ÍCH. VÌ,
The rights of status also vary with consanguinity or blood
relationship and affinity or relationship by marriage. Illegiti
mate kindred are viewed with far much less favour than legiti-
mate both by the law and religious society.
Rights of status in the cases of soldiers, merchants, ambassa-
dors and wives depend more or less upon the permanent resi-
dence of the parties upon their presence or absence.
Absence is either voluntary or compulsory. It may be volun-
tary where the party has another domicile, compulsory where
the party is in prison or insane. It may be praiseworthy, blame-
less or dishonourable.
Class and profession and religion especially in India modify
the general and common rights of all individuals.
Under the Indian Code of Procedure, 1859, s. 15 and the
English Act, 15 & 16 Vict. c. 86, declaratory decrees stood upon
the same footing and were not made unless there was a right
to consequential relief which if asked for might have been
given by the court or unless in certain cases a declaration of
right was required as a step to relief in some other court.-Cox
v. Barker, 3 Ch. Div. 359; K. Natchear v. D. Tever, L. R. 2, Ind.
Ap. 169. A right to come to the court to have a document or Act
(e.g., a claim under a nuncupative will) which obstructed the
title or enjoyment of property caucelled or set aside or for an in-
junction against such obstructions was sufficient to sustain a
declaratory decree.-S. S. Rai v. M. Dakho, 5 Ind. Ap. 87.
In a suit by an adopted son against his father for declaration

another widow of the same husband was entitled to a declaratory
decree. In another suit by a plaintiff entitled under the said
will in remainder after the determination of the life estates of
the said widows for a declaration of the invalidity of a transfer
by the first widow. Held, that the suit was maintainable

The plaintiff must produce evidence not only that they have
some rights in respect of the property in question. They most
give definite proof of the claim alleged. Decree of the High
Court reversed and that of the subordinate Judge affirmed
Privy Council.-Maina v. Brymohun, I. L. R. 12 A. S. 587. See
Griffith's Indian Evidence Acts, ch. vii.
On the same principle proceeded Bills quia timet bills of peace,
bills to perpetuate evidence bills de bene esse. 44 on receivers.
By a bill of peace we are to understand a bill brought by a
person to establish and perpetuate a right which he claims and
which from its nature may be controverted by different persons
at different times and by different actions or where separate
attempts have already been unsucessfully made to overthrow
the same right and justice requires that the party should be
quieted in the right if it should be sufficiently established under
the direction of the court. The obvious design of such a bill is
to procure repose from perpetual litigation and therefore it is
justly called a bill of peace. The obvious ground of the juris-
diction in cases of this sort is to suppress useless litigation and to
prevent multiplicity of suits, by a single action.
Thus where a party has possession and claims a right of
fishery for a considerable distance on a river and the riparian
proprietors set.up several adverse rights he may claim a bill of
peace against all of them to establish his right and quiet his
possession. Akin to bills of peace are actions to settle a con-
fusion of boundaries but these latter require a superinduced
equity. And in cases of mines and collieries courts of equity
will entertain actions in the nature of those quia timet and bills
of peace where there is danger that the mine may be ruined
in the meantime before the right can be established. Story,

CE. VÌ,
Actions may be brought to preserve and perpetuate testimony
when it is in danger of being lost before the matter to which it
relates can be made the subject of judicial investigation. The
jurisdiction is sometimes decried because it leads to a trial on
written depositions which is deemed by some to be much less
favourable to the cause of truth than the vivâ voce examination
of witnesses. But what is still more important inasmuch as
these depositions cannot be used till after the death of the
witnesses and are not indeed published until after their death
it follows that whatever may be the perjury committed in those
depositions it must necessarily go unpunished. This testimony
therefore necessarily has the infirmity that it is not given under
the sanctions of those penalties which the Penal Code imposes
upon persons giving false evidence. For these reasons courts
are reluctant to entertain actions to perpetuate evidence unless
where it is absolutely necessary to prevent a failure of justice.
The courts will not perpetuate testimony in respect of a right
which may be immediately barred by the defendant. But if the
interest be a present vested one not liable to such an objection
it is perfectly immaterial how minute that interest may be or
how distant its coming into actual possession and enjoyment
may be. A present interest the enjoyment of which may depend
upon the most remote and improbable contingency is neverthe-
less a present estate although with reference to chances it may
be worth little. But a mere expectancy as that of au heir pre-
sumptive is not an estate or interest in order to maintain a quia
timet actio to restrain an apprehended injury the plaintiff must
prove imminent danger of a substantial kind or that the
appre-
hended danger if it does come will be irreparable.-Fletcher v.

declaration of their proprietary right to two-thirds of the estate
and to have the deed of gift set aside. The court trying the
suit treated it as one for a mere declaration of right and dis-
missed it on the ground that the plaintiffs had omitted to sue

August 1878, M pledged his ship to C as security for a bond
debt of 1,500 Rs. repayable by two instalments in February and
August 1879. December 1878, S seized the ship and sold it in
French territory. C immediately made a claim on the proceeds.
The French court required him to produce a copy of an English
court's judgment acknowledging and sanctioning C's claim
against M. C sued S to obtain a declaration of his right to
recover the amount due to M on his bond. Held, that whether
or not his lien was destroyed by the sale of the ship in French
territory, C was not entitled to any of the proceeds of the sale
either at the date of the sale or of his claim in the French court
and the denial by S of C's right gave C no cause of action.—

for his ejectment from the property the suit was not maintain-
able. Souachala v. Manika, I. L. R. 8 M. S. 516. Where an actual

APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVERS.
[CH. VII,
perhaps under special circumstances.-Griffith v. Griffith, 2 Ves.
Jr. 400.
As to the powers of certain courts to appoint receivers as to
a receiver's liabilities and the appointment of a collector. See
Griffith's Civil Procedure Code, pp. 170-171, Ch. XXXVI,
88. 503-505.
Section 503 is as follows:
"Whenever it appears to the
court to be necessary for the realization, preservation or better
custody or management of any property moveable or immove-
able the subject of a suit or under attachment the court may by
order (a) appoint a receiver of such property and if need be
remove the person in whose possession or custody the property
may be from the possession or custody thereof (c) commit the
same to the custody or management of such receiver, and (d)
grant to such receiver such commission on the rents and profits
of the property by way of remuneration as the court thinks fit
and all such powers as to bringing and defending suits and for
the realization, management and protection, preservation and
improvement of the property, the collection of the rents and
profits thereof, the application and disposal of such rents and
profits and the execution of instruments in writing as the owner
himself or such of those powers as the court thinks fit.”
66
'Every receiver so appointed shall (e) give such security (if
any) as the court thinks fit duly to account for what he shall
receive in respect of the property; (f) pass his accounts at
such periods in such form as the court directs; (g) pay the
balance due from him thereon as the court directs and (h) be
responsible for any loss occasioned to the property by his wilful
default or gross negligence. Nothing in this section authorises
the court to remove from the possession or custody of property
under attachment any person whom the parties to the suit
or some or one of them have or has not a present right to
remove.”
The Indian cases decided on the sections are collected in Mr.
Griffith's Commentaries, pp. 170-171. The modern English
cases are collected at p. 374 of the same work.
Not only does justice redress wrongs when committed by
damages or specific performance it sometimes by way of precau-
tion prevents anticipated mischiefs. The party seeks the aid

151
of the court because he fears some future probable injury to his
rights or interests. The manner in which this aid is given
depends upon circumstances. The courts sometimes interfere
by the appointment of a receiver to receive rents or other
income, sometimes by an order to pay a pecuniary fund into
court, sometimes by directing security to be given or money to
be paid over and sometimes by the mere issuing of an injune-
tion or other remedial process thus adapting their relief to the
precise nature of the particular case.
In regard to trust property the jurisdiction is equally applic-
able to cases where there is a present right of enjoyment and to
cases where the right of enjoyment is future or contingent.
The object in all such cases is to secure the preservation of the
property to its appropriate uses and ends and wherever there is
danger of its being converted to other purposes or diminished
or lost by gross negligence the interference of a court becomes
indispensable. Thus if property in the hands of a trustee for
certain specific uses or trusts express or implied-See Griffith's
Indian Trusts Acts, p. 103, 231-is in danger of being diverted
or squandered to the injury of any claimant having a present or
future title thereto the administration will be undertaken by
the court.
Executors and administrators are treated as trustees of the
assets of the deceased party. If there is danger of waste of the
estate or collusion between them and the debtors whereby the
assets may be subtracted the court will interfere and secure the
fund and in case of collusion will order the debtors to pay the
amount of their debts into court.
So in property which is not trust but is future contingent or
a remainder in respect of the enjoyment, protection may be
obtained if the party in possession is acting wrongfully.
The purchaser of a coal mine sued to rescind the contract on
the ground of fraud but it was essential to its existence that the
mine should be kept in a going state and the purchaser was in
possession, on the application of the purchaser a receiver and
manager was appointed pending the suit the costs thereof to
abide the result.-Gibbs v. David, L. R. 20 Eq. 373.

family is to be regarded as agent or manager for the others and
he is misapplying and wasting the property, a proper case may
be made out for the appointment of a receiver. In the absence
of fraud or acts of malicious and destructive waste the court
will not generally interfere at the instance of a person alleging
a mere legal title in himself against one in possession.-Talbot v.
Hope Scott, 4 K. & J. 96; Carrow v. Farrior, L. R. 3 Ch. Div. 728.
Two trustees of personal property disagreeing with a third and
acting alone a receiver was appointed at the instance of a bene-
ficiary.—Swale v. Swale, 22 Bea. 584. Misconduct, waste or im-
proper disposition of the trust property by the trustees or apart
and incapacity of the other part to prevent it. Actual danger
from bad character, drunken habits or great poverty but not
mere insolvency are several grounds for appointing a receiver.—
Everett v. Prythergch, 12 Sim. 367; I. R. Johnson, L. R. 1 Ch. Div.
325, 12 Ves. 4, 1 Mad. 46. A plaintiff insured in a society brought
an action on behalf of himself and other insurers charging a
loss of funds through the negligence of the directors and the
dishonesty of the secretary. H obtained the appointment of a
receiver and an injunction against parting with the assets or
collecting them.-Evans v. Coventry, 9 D. M. & G. 511.
An injunction may be obtained against one partner who mis-
conducts himself but a partnership receiver will not be appointed
unless there is an entire dissolution of the partnership or there
be facts which if proved at the hearing would entitle to a decree
for a dissolution. Lindley 1017; Chapman v. Beach, 1 J. & W.
594. Actual dissolution is not necessary. Exclusion of one or
more partners by another or anothers is sufficient.-Wilson v.
Greenwood, 1 Swan. 481; Harding Glover, 18 Ves. 281..
A few words upon the general rights of a receiver and their
incidents may be useful. By the appointment of a receiver of
rents and profits the court becomes virtually the landlord.
Should they belong to an infant the receiver's possession is that
of the infant. But where the rights of different parties to the
action are adverse his possession is that of the party who ulti-
mately prevails. He can take no serious legal step without the
authority of the court. Should a stranger claim an adverse
interest he should apply to the court by motion before commenc-
ing an action. A receiver may be appointed of property subject
to the rightful lien of another person. And if in the nature of

validity of the will and an execution had been issued against
him and there had been a return of "no goods on application of

and creditor of the testator and also a residuary legatee a receiver
of the proceeds of sale of part of the testator's realty and of the
rents of the other part and of the outstanding personal estate

creditor's administration suit the plaintiff should immediately
apply for a receiver to prevent the executor or administrator
paying creditors in full. I. R. Radcliffe, 7 Ch. Div. 733. In an

was appointed receiver without giving security upon his under-

Taylor v. Eckersley, 2 Ch. Div. 802.
In England a receiver may be appointed by order of the court
in all cases in which it shall appear to the court to be just or
convenient that such order should be made; and such order
may be made either unconditionally or upon such terms and
conditions as the court shall think just; and whether the
estates claimed by both or by either of the parties are legal or

A receivership order ascertains at the date when it is made
the rights of the parties obtaining it. Should the property be
in the hands of another party who has a lien upon it execution

An order in an action by judgment-creditors appointing one
of their number, without security, receiver of the stock in trade
does not make them secured creditors against the official assignee
in insolvency. It is not an equitable execution. I. R. Dickinson,

tor £700 for which he was surety with interest. Held, that the
executor had priority as to £115 as he might have retained the
same but could only stand in a creditor's place as to £700 with-
out interest because when that became due the right of retainer
had ceased. I. R. Harrison, 32 Ch. Div. 395, following I. R.
Jones, 31 Ch. Div. 440.

of a receiver is equivalent to a completed execution and delivery

Under the present practice a mortgagee in possession is
entitled to the appointment of a receiver notwithstanding he

hands.-Mason v. Westoby, 32 Ch. Div. 206; cf. Sollory v. Leaver,

Mortgagor in possession held liable to pay an occupation rent
from date of demand by receiver only and not from date of
receiver's appointment.-Yorkshire Banking Co. v. Mullan, 35
Ch. Div. 125.
When the court has appointed a receiver of a partnership
business during an action it is an interference with him for a
partner's son to send circulars soliciting customers of the firm.-
Helmore v. Smith, 35 Ch. Div. 449.
The remuneration of a receiver and manager appointed by

Brazil put into shares and sold in England in the form of
scrip, transferable by delivery. The defendant and another at a
meeting of shareholders had been appointed sole directors and
trustees of the property. The associate had died and disputes
had arisen. It was that an owner of shares purchased in the
market might maintain a bill against the defendant as sole sur-
viving trustee for an account of the receipts and payments of
the debts of the association and the division of the profits.
The defendant left England after the filing of the bill and
pending a motion for a receiver. Held, that the plaintiff bad
an equity to have the property secured by the appointment of a
receiver. Sheppard v. Oxenford, 1 Kay & J. 491.
A person who is prejudiced by the conduct of a receiver ap-
pointed in a suit by way of equitable execution ought not with-
out leave of the court to commence a fresh suit to restrain the
proceedings of the receiver even though the act complained of
was beyond the scope of the receiver's authority but ought to
make an application for such relief as he is entitled to in the
action by which the receiver was appointed.-O. A. Searle v.

A receiver appointed in an action is not in a position to pre-
sent an insolvency petition against the debtor in respect of a

A mortgagee who has once taken possession of the mortgaged
property cannot relinquish possession at his pleasures. As a

A legal mortgagee has no absolute right to a receiver.-Mason
v. Westoby, 32 Ch. Div. 206 considered. I. R. Prythergeh,
42 Ch. Div. 590.
There is no power in one partner in the absence of special
power from his co-partner or evidence of a special course of
dealing to accept shares in a company even though fully paid
up in satisfaction of a debt due to the firm. Nor has the court
jurisdiction in the winding up of the partnership to confer on a
receiver greater powers in this respect than a partner would have
had. L. R. 8 Ch. Div. 831, Weikersheim's case explained.-
Niemann v. Niemann, 43 Ch. Div. 198.
S being entitled to an entire property subject to a mortgage
a judgment-debtor shortly before the death of S applied for a
receiver by way of equitable execution. The motion was ad-
journed and in the meantime S died. Held, that after the death
of S and in the absence of a party to represent his estate a receiver
could not be appointed.-Atkins v. Shephard, 43 Ch. Div. 131.
What is commonly called equitable execution is not in fact
execution but equitable relief granted because there is some
hindrance to the ordinary process of execution. It is therefore
subject to the equitable rule that all parties interested should be
before the court. S. C. & Griffith's Institutes of Equity, p. 222.
As a general rule the liquidator should be appointed receiver
for the debenture holders. But if they have already appointed
a receiver under special powers given them by their security the
court will not displace him by the liquidator. Joshua Stubbs,
Limited, 1891,1 Ch. Div. 187. See Griffith's Indian Companies Act.
The court on the application of the only debenture holder by
consent appointed the managing director receiver and also
manager of the business pending realization, and settled the
terms as to wages, current expenses, accounts and immediate
realization.—Makins v. Perey Ibbotson & Sons, 1891, 1 Ch. Div. 133.
The court will appoint a receiver to protect the debenture
holder's security if it be in jeopardy owing to the company's
insolvency although the principal is not immediately payable
nor the interest in arrears.-McMahon v. North Kent Ironworks,

ENFORCEMENT OF PUBLIC DUTIES.
[CH. VIII,
CHAPTER VIII.
OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF PUBLIO DUTIES.
The right to issue the prerogative writ of mandamus for
which orders under this chapter are substituted was part of the
original civil jurisdiction of the presidency high courts. The
high court of Allahabad and the chief court of the Punjab not
possessing such jurisdiction the chapter does not apply to them.
This chapter in the conditions of the order substituted for
the writ of mandamus expresses "the results of an experience
of centuries gained by superior courts in England working
without statutory limits to their jurisdiction." They shew
very clearly the proper limits of peremptory interference even
when there has been an excess of jurisdiction or a failure to
exercise it by the lower court. "It is very desirable that there
should as far as possible be a complete agreement of principle
between the working of the high court at its original and
appellate sides in giving effect to kindred jurisdictions. The
terms imposed on the one may well serve for guidance to the
other branch of this court unless they contravene some law
which the latter branch has to administer." Where the legis-
lature intends the first stage of a judicial inquiry to be the last
also; where it intends possible errors in such inquiry to be set
right by an appeal, the supersession by the high court of the
designated courts would be a usurpation by whatever motives
it might be induced.-Shiva v. Joma, I. L. R. 7 B. S. 341.

nature, or by any corporation or inferior Court of

whereon is claimed for 10 years before the last day on which a
dividend thereon becomes payable. Section 52 provides for the
entry in a book of the particulars of the ownership and for
the list being open at the usual hours of transfer for inspection.
On argument of a rule for a mandamus to enable the servants
of a company to inspect whose business it was to have inform-
ation ready to give persons who wished to consult them with
a view to making a claim to the stock. Held, that only persons
directly interested in the stock could claim inspection and that
mandamus should not be granted.-Q. v. Bank of England, 1891,
April 9. A rational curiosity, or a desire to obtain information
on a general subject to ascertain facts which may be useful in
an ulterior proceeding is not a ground for an order to inspect
public books. For use of them as evidence in a legal proceed-
ing the order is usually granted. 6 A. & E. 99.
A demand should first be made by the party injured on the
person or body bound to perform, and their refusal should be
proved to the court. This, however, is not a rule of law but
prudent advice.
"In England," a mandamus has never been granted to deprive
of an office.-Q. v. St. John's College, 4 Mod. 233; Shortt 289,
A. D. 1887. But it is open to argument whether the compre-
bensive words of this section do not confer upon the Indian
High Courts such power at least indirectly if not directly. In
England the remedy would be by quo warranto.
"Franchise." Thus may be enforced the election and the
admission (with the performance of all requisite formalities) to
various public offices of persons entitled to admission and the
restoration to such offices or franchises of persons wrongfully
removed therefrom, But a court will not order a restoration
where it will be the duty of a corporation to remove the
applicant again for a preceding neglect of duty.-Q. v. Griffiths,
5 B. & Ald. 736.
(b) that such doing or forbearing is, under any law
for the time being in force, clearly incumbent on such
person or Court in his or its public character, or on
such corporation in its corporate character;

"Oourt." Where the duty is of a judicial character a man-
damus is granted only where there is a refusal to perform it in
any way; not when it is done in one way rather than another.-
Q. v. Lichfield, 7 Mod. 218; Q. v. London, 24 Q. B. D. 213;
Lawson v. Labouchere, 1879, Nov. 27. But a judicial discre-
tion exercised unjustly or arbitrarily is ground for a man-
damus.
The public duty must be an imperious one, that is, one as to
which no liberty of choice as to the performance or non-perform-
ance of it is left with the officer or tribunal that has to dis-
charge it.—R. v. Fowey, 2 B. & C. 591. But in public statutes,
that is acts of a legislature words only directory, permissory or
enabling may have a compulsory force where the thing to be
done is for the benefit or in advancement of public justice."
Cairns, C., L. R. 5 App. Cas. 225. Whether the word may is to
signify must is to be solved from the context the particular pro-
visions or from the general scope and object of the enactment
conferring the power. Id. 235.
Conveyance of goods by a railway company established by the
legislature is a public right. Davis, H. L. 1895, May 10.
(c) that, in the opinion of the High Court, such
doing or forbearing is consonant to right and justice;
Right seems to refer to the individual, justice to the general
system. The Latin word jus includes both the English ideas
while justice includes intention. Griffith's Institutes 82, 2 c.
For instances where the prerogative writ of mandamus has
been granted. See E. P. Lee, Ell. Bl. & Ell. 863; Q. v. South-
ampton. It has been granted to compel the admission or res-
toration of the applicant to an office or franchise of a public
nature, spiritual or temporal, to academical degrees to the use
of a temple, for the production, inspection or delivery of public
books or papers; for the surrender of the property of a cor-
poration, for the affixing of its seal and to compel the holding

Where the applicant is legally entitled to a sum of money

A sexton claimed a mandamus to compel the executrix of the

in a summary way to prevent or stay the commission of an
injury by an order called an injunction. Thus, pending litiga-
tion, the property is taken into the custody; forged bills of ex-
change, and other like documents obtained through fraud, and
instruments which may be used wrongfully, are ordered to be
given up or cancelled. The committing of waste, the destruc-
tion of an easement, as by building opposite to windows, is
restrained. An interim order for an injunction may be obtained,
and that either ex parte or on notice. If the plaintiff seeks it
ex parte, he must bring all material facts to the knowledge of
the court.-Fuller v. Taylor, J. (63), 743, V.-C. Wood.
stronger case of acquiescence is necessary for defence at the
hearing than on an interlocutory motion. Johnson v. Wyatt,
J. (63), 1333, L.J. The interim order is made on the condi
tion of the plaintiff undertaking to abide by an order to be
made as to damages, in case the court should thereafter be of
opinion that the defendant had sustained any damages by the
injunction which the plaintiff ought to pay, and sometimes on
the further condition that plaintiff will accept short notice of
motion to dissolve the injunction.
A
The utility of the remedy by injunction is very apparent in
cases where, though the common law courts will give a remedy,
irreparable damage may be done meanwhile. These cases are
exceptional, for where there is an entire want of privity between
plaintiff and defendant, and the defendant is a mere wrong-doer
at law, the equity courts do not usually interfere.
Thus, where a miller let down water so as to inundate his
neighbour relief was granted. So where a railway company
blocked up the access to the station of the plaintiffs, another
railway company, by a strong barrier or stockade, partly on a
public footpath and partly on lands belonging to the plaintiffs,
and the plaintiffs filed a bill alleging that the injury would be
irreparable and that the defendants had no colour of title, Vice-
Chancellor Wood granted an interim injunction to restrain the
trespass, though by a stranger.-London and North-Western
Railway Company v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Com-
pany, 4 E. C. 174.
A prayer for a writ of injunction may be added whenever
required to the prayers in ordinary bills. One advantage of

justice, that equitable defences and replications are permitted.
-Wakley v. Froggart, C.E., J. (63), 1248. Again, the new
jurisdiction is permissive; it does not abrogate, but is con-
current with, that of the Chancery.-Stewart v. The Great
Western Railway Company, (65), 627, L.C. Westbury.
A defendant who is prosecuted both in Chancery and at Law
for the same matter might, after complying with certain pleading
regulations, obtain an order that the plaintiff elect in which
court he will proceed. Cons. Ord. xlii, r. 5.
Proceedings in the Ecclesiastical, Admiralty, County, and
recently in the Divorce and Matrimonial Cause Court, in a suit
for restitution of conjugal rights, have been restrained. The
case from the Divorce Court was that of Hunt v. Hunt. The
question was the obligatory force of an agreement in a separa-
tion deed not to sue for restitution. Ex relatione the writer,
and J. (62), 85. Whether that eminent equity jurist, Lord
Chancellor Westbury, did not, in deciding that such an agree-
ment was obligatory, somewhat infringe on the policy and inten-
tion of the act establishing the Court of Divorce and Matrimo-
nial Causes, is open to doubt. See and consider Anguez v. An-
guez, 1 P. M. & D. 176; Williams v. Williams, S. K. 178; Row-
ley v. Rowley, 1 H. L., S. & D. 63. Hunt v. Hunt was upheld
in Besant, 12 Ch. Div. 605; Hart, 18 Ch. Div. 670.
(2) While the courts of equity and law declare and enforce
rights, it rests in the wisdom of the legislature to create new
and abrogate old ones. It is difficult to conceive how an appli-
cation to parliament can, in accordance with the theory of the
constitution, he enjoined. There have been cases, however, in
which such application has been in effect enjoined. The use of
funds for obtaining an Act of Parliament to extend the purposes
of a company has been restrained on the ground of breach of
trust.—Heathcote v. North Staffordshire Railway Company, 2 M.
& G. 100; At.-Gen. v. Corporation of Norwich, 16 Sim. 225.
And where the directors of a railway company gave a check
for 10,000%. to their engineer, it being supposed that the money
was to be employed in applications to parliament, he was
ordered to account.-Gray v. Whalley, "The Times," 23rd
Feb. 1864.

491, Lord Romilly held that the principles applicable to private
partnerships were not to be applied too strictly to companies
with public duties and interests, and allowed the directors, though
opposed by oue class of shareholders, to apply to parliament, but
not to use for that purpose the company's funds. In Steele v.
North Metropolitan Railway Company, 2 O. A. 237, Lord Chelms-
ford said that the court had power to restrain an application to
parliament, but it was difficult to conceive a case in which it
would be done. And accordingly, where an agreement as to the
purchase of land had been inserted in a railway bill, and opposi-
tion in parliament was consequently foregone, an application
by the company to parliament to repeal the agreement was not
forbidden.
When the Common Law Courts of England were united with
the Equity Courts (Judicature Act, 1873, s. 25.) Section 8
enacted that “an injunction or mandamus may be granted or a
receiver appointed by an interlocutory order of the court in all
cases in which it shall appear to the court to be just or conve.
nient that such order should be made and any such order may be
made either unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions
as the Court shall think just; and if an injunction is asked either
before at or after the hearing of any cause or matter to prevent
any threatened or apprehended waste or trespass such injunction
may be granted if the court shall think fit whether the person
against whom the injunction is sought is or is not in possession
under any claim of title or otherwise and (if out of possession)
does or does not claim a right to do the act sought to be res-
trained under any colour of title and whether the estates claim-
ed by both or either of the parties are legal or equitable."
The English system further provides for the inspection of
articles and the sale of those which are of a perishable nature.

"Discretion." It is not enough that there is a point to be
decided which the plaintiff is fairly raising for there is a further
question namely whether interim interference on a balance of
convenience or inconvenience to the one party or other is or is
not expedient.
Where the alternative is interference or probable destruction
of the property then the court is very ready to lend its aid
immediately even at considerable risk that it may be encroach-
ing on what may turn out eventually to be the legal rights of
the defendant.— Wilson v. Wilson, 1 H. L. C. 538. Should how-
ever the injury threatened to the plaintiff be limited to his being
retarded or embarrassed by the new contract or deed the court
will more readily listen to suggestions by the defendant that
his rights will be prejudiced by interference.-Shrewsbury Rail.

The cases in which the English Chancery granted an in-

CHAPTER X.
OF PERPETUAL INJUNCTIONS.
The remedy of specific performance relating as it does to
active duties deals in the main only with contracts, while the
remedy of injunction having to deal only with negative duties
deals not only with contracts but also with torts and with many
other subjects; among them, subjects of a purely equitable nature.
Specific performance is a primary remedy when granted without
regard to the question whether damages could be accurately
computed for a breach of the duty in question. It is a primary
remedy in sales, leases and other dispositions of land. Injunction
is the primary remedy in many other classes of cases than those
relating to land.
(1) When an unwarrantable advantage of the process of law
is taken as by levying a judgment after a compromise or upon
property not subject thereto.
(2) Alienation of personalty as where the title to stock is in
dispute under two wills or where the title is controverted between
principal and agent.
(3) Inequitable sales as where a party is abusing a trust or
other authority.
Generally in cases of fraud, accident and mistake equity has
an original and primary jurisdiction. (Griffith's Institutes,
p. 175.) And it follows that an injunction to restrain the
taking of an advantage in such cases might regularly be granted
without inquiring whether damages could not be accurately
computed and made a just equivalent in favor of the plaintiff.

Whenever the parties are resident within a country the courts

Undue and vexations litigation in the home country may be

54. Subject to the other provisions contained
in, or referred to by, this chapter, a
perpetual injunction may be granted
to prevent the breach of an obligation
existing in favour of the applicant, whether ex-
pressly or by implication.
What has been said of the English Judicature Act may
with equal propriety be said of the Specific Relief Act. The
legislature "bas somewhat enlarged the powers of the court
but in the matter of injunctions it has done nothing to alter the
principles which have been laid down as to the exercise of its
powers where principles have been established as just and con-
venient.―Thesiger, L. J., Gaskin v. Balls, 13 Ch. Div. 329.
"Just." Justice in its most comprehensive sense includes
equity. Equity, Justice and Equality are defined or described
by Mr. Griffith in the Institutes of Equity, pp. 20–22.
" Convenient." In doubtful cases arguments drawn from in-
convenience are of great weight. Coke Litt. 66a ; 6 Cl. & Fi. 671;
1 H. Black. 61. And so arguments of inconvenience are some-
times of great force in construing a written instrument as
to the question of intention when equivocal expressions are
used. Yet where the words admit only of one meaning, incon-
venience proves only a want of foresight in the settler and does
not justify the court in departing from the words. The same
is the rule where a proposition of law requires interpretation.-
Pike v. Hoare, 2 Eden. 184%; 3 B. & C. 471. Defects in the
law are to be remedied by the legislature not the judge. The
judge interprets he does not make the law. Vaughan, 37, 38.
However the law will more readily suffer a private mischief
than a public inconvenience. Coke Litt. 97 b. ; Hobart 224.
In construing an act of the legislature the same principle
applies. Where the words have a necessary meaning that must
be adopted whatever be its inconvenience. 1 Cl. & Fi. 546.
"But unless it is very clear that violence would be done to the
language of an act by adopting any other construction any great

In connection with sales and buyings of land injunctions have
been granted by the English courts not against action by
mortgagee for mortgage debt after contract to sell, for deposit

One of several co-sharers in a mahal having begun to erect
certain kachcha buildings upon the common land another co-
sharer 3 or 4 days after the building had commenced brought a
suit for an injunction to restrain the continuance thereof on the
ground that the defendant was ousting the plaintiff as a co-
sharer from a portion of the common land. It was found that
the defendant was building upon land which was in excess of
the share that would come to him on partition and that on
partition the plaintiff could not be adequately compensated.

He consequently obtained a higher price. Standing by whilst
the sub-lessee built houses whose value greatly depended on the

See Griffith's Indian Trusts Act, pp. 83-86, 107.
A trustee who protects by suit or otherwise the title of the
property and deals with it as carefully as a man of ordinary pru-
dence would deal with such property if it were his own is not as
a rule liable for a breach of trust committed by a co-trustee.
But “in the absence of an express declaration to the contrary in
the instrument of trust a trustee is so liable. Where he has
delivered trust property to his co-trustee without seeing to its
proper application. Where he allows his co-trustee to receive
trust property and fails to make due inquiry as to the co-trus-
tee's dealings therewith or allows him to retain it longer than
the circumstances of the case reasonably require. Where he
becomes aware of a breach of trust committed or intended by

his co-trustee and either actively conceals it or does not within
a reasonable time take proper steps to protect the beneficiary's
interest. A co-trustee who joins in signing a receipt for trust
property and proves that he has not received the same is not
answerable by reason of such signature only for loss or misappli-
cation of the property by his co-trustee.”
The doctrine that an injunction will not be granted where a
beneficiary has a personal remedy against the trustee and the
damage is therefore not irreparable is no longer law. A threat-
ened breach of trust will be enjoined.-Wiles v. Gresham, 1 Eq.
R. 348; Balls v. Strutt, 1 Hare 346. Although a trustee having
power to appoint new trustees may after suit commenced do
so, he will be enjoined unless he obtains the sanction of the court.

It is the duty of trustees to restrain a tenant for life from
committing waste.-Pugh v. Vaughan, 12 Bea, 517; Powys v.

Where trustees of a term are made unimpeachable for waste
they must use their implied power of cutting timber in as

to cut timber they will not be enjoined at the instance of a legal
tenant for life also entitled to cut timber.-Kekewick v. Marker,

See Griffith's Indian Trusts Act, s. 15, ch. vi.
Section 15 requires a trustee to deal with the trust property
as carefully as a man of ordinary diligence would deal with his
own, pp. 60–65. He is to be impartial, to prevent waste, to
keep accounts, to make proper investments, &c. Griffith's Chapter
VI, pp. 65-75, defines the beneficiary's rights to rents and pro-
fits to specific execution, to inspect accounts and take copies, to
transfer of beneficial interest to proper trustees, &c.
"The
beneficiary has also a right that the trustee shall be compelled
to perform any particular act of his duty as such and restrained
from committing any contemplated or probable breach of trust
by the remedy of injunction whether retrospective or preven-
tive." Griffith's Trusts, pp. 111-121. An injunction to restrain

The remedy by injunction is cumulative and does not preclude
the injured party obtaining in a proper suit damages consequent
upon the divulging a confidential secret.
The doctrine of acquiescence implies a knowledge by the party
acquiescing of his own rights and of the acts of the person tres-
passing upon them; secondly, that the trespasser has acted under
a mistake, and so acting laid out money or done some act because
he was mistaken.— Willmott v. Barber, 15 Ch. Div. 96; Beau-
champ v. Winn, L. R. 6 H. L. 223. The doctrine does not com-
pletely supersede the periods fixed by the Act of Limitation but
leads the court to refuse particular remedies where the plaintiff
is not free from blame.
What is acquiescence as a matter of evidence must vary with
the business. A person may acquiesce in a breach of covenant
in notice of refusal to perform; both parties may acquiesce in
non-completion.
Where the purchaser of part of an estate seeks to restrain a
purchaser of another part from breaking a covenant intended to
bind all the purchasers for their common benefit he does not
require the vendor's co-operation nor need he prove damages in
order to obtain the injunction.-Collins v. Oastle, 36 Ch. Div. 243.
(j.) (k.) In cases of landlord and tenant a tenant has been enjoin-
ed from converting a house to a different use from that prescribed
by the lease; from violating a covenant by breaking up meadow
land; from taking away crops and manure contrary to the usual
course of husbandry; from removing fixtures; and from any
other breach of a covenant. 6 Vesey 106; 5 Bea. 250.—City of
London v. Pugh, 4 Bro. P. C. 395. But the injunction like the
decree for specific performance is governed by the discretion of
the court.-Doherty v. Allman, 3 App. Cas. 709.
Nice questions frequently arise upon applications to a Judge
to enjoin parties from removing alleged fixtures. There are
few subjects where the opinions of the court have varied more
widely or where it is more difficult to lay down any rule which
shall enable us to solve new cases as they arise. A landlord is
not liable for personal injuries caused to a stranger by the
dilapidated condition of demised premises. Copp. 1895, May 14.

first offer it to the others. An injunction was granted to prevent
his violating the stipulation.-Homfray v. Fothergill, L. R.
1 Eq. 567. A business was carried on in several places, of one
the lease expired, a partner contrary to the wishes of the rest
obtained a renewal of the lease he was prevented from using
the credit or assets of the firm at such place.--Clements v.
Norris, 8 Ch. Div. 134.
Partnership is the relation which subsists between persons
who have agreed to combine their property, labour or skill in
some business and to share the profits thereof between them.
Contract Act, s. 239.
To prevent a partner from acting contrary to the agreement
into which he may have entered with his co-partners or contrary
to the good faith which independently of any agreement is to
be observed by one partner towards his co-partner the Court
appoints a receiver and takes the affairs of the business out of
the hands of all the partners or grants the less drastic remedy
of injunction against one or more of the partners. The English
courts have enjoined actions for the balance of settled accounts
others being unsettled; executions against firm for separate
debt of one partner; advertising dissolution; altering principle
on which profits are dealt with; change of character of
business; opening letters; use of names by continuing partners,
by successors; misapplication of firm's money; misconduct
conducing to dissolution; improperly getting in assets; nego-
tiating bills; carrying on business after sale thereof or
dissolution; divulging trade secrets; publishing accounts;
making slanderous statements; proceedings in insolvency;
illegal acts generally. "And in consequence of the liability
which attaches to a person who holds himself out as a partner
with others and of the danger run by a person who is held
out as a partner with others even although it may not be
with his cousent a court will it seems interfere and restrain
a person from holding out another as partner with him with.
out the authority of that other." Lindley, L. J., 5th ed. 544.
One partner will be enjoined from acts tending to depreciate
the value of the partnership property and injuring the credit of
the firm.-Marshall v. Watson, 25 Bea. 504; and from disposing
of the joint stock to his own private purpose in fraud of his
co-partner.—Hartz v. Schrader, 8 Ves. 317.

the rights which a tenant for life either expressly under a settle-
ment or impliedly by operation of law is entitled to, namely, the
benefit of all fair acts of ownership sometimes spoken of as logal
waste.—Baker v. Sebright, 13 Ch. Div. 179. Such acts of owner-

(n.) A ground landlord may have an injunction to stay waste
against an under lessee who holds by lease from the original
lessee.-Farrant v. Lovel, 3 Atk. 723. So a mortgagor may
obtain an injunction where a mortgagee in possession cuts
timber and does not apply the sale proceeds in keeping down
the principal and interest. S. C. It is now settled that an English
court will not interfere to prevent merely permissive waste.
Viner's Abr. 523. But equity will decree an account where
there is an express covenant to repair.-Marsh v. Wells, 2 S. &
S. 87. In Lewis Bowles's 11 Coke 79, it was decided that the
words "without impeachment of waste" in a deed give the pro-
perty. But where this large power is exercised contrary to
conscience in an unreasonable manner and to the destruction of
the thing the tenant for life will be enjoined.-Aston v. Aston,
1 Ves. s. 265; Vane v. Lord Barnard, 2 Vern. 738; Abrakam v.
Bubb, 2 Freem 54, humoursome and extravagant waste.
The cutting of timber left standing for the ornament of a
mansion house or grounds will be enjoined.-Coffin v. Coffin,
Jac. 71. As to what is ornament the taste of the testator or
settlor must determine not that of the tenant for life.-Downshire
v. Sandys, 6 Ves. 110; Mahon v. Stanhope, 3 Madd. 523n. The
rule has been extended from the ornament of the house to out-
houses and grounds then to plantations, vistas, avenues and to all
the rides about the estate for miles round.-Downshire v. Sandys,
6 Vesey 110. Cessante ratione cessat jus and where a tempest
has made gaps in ornamental timber the rest may be felled.
Even where a mansion house has been pulled down, the orna-
mental has still been protected on the ground that it improved
the value of the estate as one to be developed by building leases.

[ƠH. I,
As a general rule which operates more strongly in the absence
of a written settlement a tenant for life ought to make all ordi-
nary repairs essential to prevent the destruction of the property
but he is not liable to repair extraordinary damages effected by
floods, lightening, &c., and it seems sufficient if he leave the pre-
mises in as good repair as when he received them saving always
reasonable wear and tear.- Woodhouse v. Walker, 5 Q. B. D. 404.
The modern English authorities or rather dicta upon the
question whether an action for permissive waste can be main-
tained against a tenant for life or years upon whom no express
duty to repair is imposed by the instrument which creates the
estate "
appear to be strangely in conflict with the ancient read-
ing of the statutes” which made him or her liable. Lush, J.,
5 Q. B. D. 404.
Griffith's Indian Transfer of Property Act, 1882, p. 168, is as
follows: "A mortgagor in possession of the mortgaged property
is not liable to the mortgagee for allowing the property to deteri-
orate but he must not commit any act which is destructive or
permanently injurious thereto if the security is insufficient or
will be rendered insufficient by such act." A security is insuffi-
cient unless the value of the mortgaged property exceeds by
one-third or consisting of buildings by one-half the amount for
the time being due upon the property.
The same authority, section 76, lays down the law that when
during the continuance of the mortgage the mortgagee takes
possession of the mortgaged property he must, in the absence of
a contract to the contrary, make such necessary repairs of the
property as he can pay for out of the rents and profits thereof
after deducting from such rents and profits charges of a public
nature arrears of rent in default of which the property may be
summarily sold and the interest on the principal money.
Independently of contract a lessee is guilty of waste who
permanently injures house or land. The lessor has a right
to have them kept unaltered and may protect such right by
injunction.-Spike v. Harding, 7 Ch. Div. 871; Doherty v. All-
man, 3 App. Cas. 709,
Waste may be committed of personal property by improperly
changing the investments so as to imperil the capital though

the income of the Hindu widow be thereby increased.-H. Dutt
v. U. Dossee, 6 Moore I. A. 433.
Where the property is in the possession of joint tenants as is
usually the case with an undivided family property that waste
which consists in the legitimate enjoyment of property will not
be interfered with but when such waste is extravagant, destruc-
tive and against reason and conscience it may be restrained by
an injunction.-Job v. Potton, L. R. 20 Eq. 84; Bailey v. Hobson,
L. R. 5 Ch. 180. Partition is not always a satisfactory mode
of remedy.
Where one tenant in common thinks proper by agreement
with the other to hold the common property as occupying
tenant and thereby excludes his co-tenant from all right of
entry upon the land held in common an injunction will be
granted to restrain him from dealing with the land otherwise
than as an ordinary occupying tenant.-Twort v. Twort, 16 Ves.
128.
A railway company obtained a lease of land from five out of
six co-tenants and laid down their railway thereon, the court
refused to enjoin the sixth co-tenant from pulling up the rails.-
Durham Rail v. Wawn, 3 Bea. 119.
Waste is spoil or destruction done or allowed to be done to
houses, woods, lands, or other incorporeal hereditaments by the
tenant thereof during the continuance of his tenancy. Waste is
either voluntary or permissive, the former a matter of commis-
sion as by pulling down a house, the latter of omission only
as by suffering it to fall by want of necessary reparations.
Whatever does a lasting damage to the freehold or inheritance
is waste. Therefore the removing wainscot, floors, or other
thing once fixed to the freehold of a house is generally speaking
waste: though it is held by way of exception to the ordinary
rule that a particular tenant who has made erections for the
purpose of trade or has put up ornamental fixtures may lawfully
remove them. To cut down timber is waste. To convert wood,
meadow or pasture into arable to turn arable meadow or pasture
into woodland or turn arable or woodland into meadow or
pasture is waste. And in general the commission of any act of
this tendency is wrongful on the part of the tenant seised of
any estate less than the inheritance.

[CH. X,
One species of interest which is injured by waste is that of a
person who has a right of common in the place wasted for
example of pasturing cattle where the pasture is destroyed of
taking water where it is allowed to escape of taking wood for
repairs where the owner of the wood destroys the whole. See
Griffith's Indian Easements Act.
(o.) Where the land is extensive and the trespassers nume-
rous a temporary injunction is sometimes obtainable to prevent
a multiplicity of suits. But the court is reluctant to cause
suffering to the persons meanwhile in possession.-Hanson v.
Gardiner, 7 Ves. 309; Tenham v. Herbert, 2 Atk. 483 (p) is an
example of an injunction perpetual to prevent a multiplicity of
suits.
The prevention of a multiplicity of suits is a principle which
equity acts upon in cases of account, of agency, apportionment,
general average, contribution, sureties, confusion of boundaries,
rents and profits, waste and partnership.
A trespass may be under "colour of title" as when adjoining
mines are worked so as to interfere the one with the other.
The question in such cases is not one of abstract title but of the
application of evidence to admitted rights but disputed bound-
aries, &c.-Davenport v. Davenport, 7 Hare 217; (r) see
Griffith's Evidence Acts.
In practice such cases lead to two decrees, the one for a
temporary injunction and ascertainment of rights, the other
for a perpetual injunction and an account of profits and expenses.
(p.) A highway is a public easement over the land of the
adjoining owner. See Griffith's Indian Easements Act VI.
Waterpipes were without the consent of the landowner laid in
the soil of the highway. He having no right to interfere with
the easement and therefore being unable himself to interfere and
remove the pipes was granted an injunction to prevent their
continuance and the further laying.-Goodson v. Richardson,
L. R. 9 Ch. 221.
A defendant entered the close possessed by the plaintiff and
cut down a tree and threatened to cut down others. The police
protected him in so doing but unfortunately for himself he had
previously sued the plaintiff thus admitting his possession. The
court granted a perpetual injunction.-Stanford v. Hurlstone,

joyment of a man or his family in the occupation of his house
is not seriously to be interfered with nor is he to be prevented
carrying on his business with the same degree of convenience
and advantage as before.-Kelk v. Pearson, L. R. 6 Ch. 809;
Aynsley v. Glover, L. R. 10 Ch. 283. It depends upon the cir-
cumstances whether the court will grant a mandatory injunction
or only give damages.-Holland v. Worley, 26 Ch. Div. 578,
but see Greenwood v. Hornsey, 33 Ch. Div. 471. But the com-
pletion of the injury before the suit is no ground for refusing a
remedy.-Smith v. Smith, L. R. 20 Eq. 500.
The plaintiff does not destroy his right by erecting buildings
which interfere with his own light and air.-Cannon v. Villars,
8 Ch. Div. 415; nor because his business does not require more
than a subdued light.-Yates v. Jack, L. R. 1 Ch. 295; nor will
he be compelled necessarily to block up newly opened win-

See Davenport v. Davenport, 7 Hare 217, cited in note to
54 (o). The owner of the garden of a London Square contract-
ed with the tenants of the adjoining house to improve it.
Under colour of the contract a person was allowed by the owner
to enter and remove large quantities of gravel and soil. He
was restrained by injunction obtained by the tenants.-Allen v.
Martin, L. R. 20 Eq. 462. Semble, the injunction was due also
on the ground of waste.
(s.) (t.) Nuisance nocumentum or annoyance signifies any-
thing that worketh hurt, inconvenience or damage. And nui-
sances are of two kinds, public or common, nuisances which
affect the public are an annoyance to all the Queen's subjects for
which reason we must refer them to the class of public wrongs
or crimes and private nuisances which may be defined anything
done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements or
hereditaments of another, and not amounting to a trespass.
First as to corporeal hereditaments. If a man builds his
house so close to mine that his roof overhangs my roof and the
water flows off his roof upon my roof this is a nuisance for
which a suit will lie and an injunction may be obtained. Also
if a person keeps hogs or other noisome animals so near the
house of another previously built and inhabited that the stench
of them incommodes him and makes the air unwholesome this
is a nuisance as it tends to deprive him of the use and benefit
of his house. Aldred's Case, 9 Rep. 58.-R. v. White, 1 Burr
337. A like injury is if one's neighbour sets up and exercises an
offensive trade as a tanner's, a tallow chandler's or the like for
though these are lawful and necessary trades yet they should be
exercised in remote places and the rule is "Sic utere tuo ut alie-
num non lædas"; this therefore is an actionable nuisance.—
Morley v. Pragnel, Cro. Car. 510. But depriving one of a mere
matter of pleasure as of a fine view by building a wall or the
like this as it abridges nothing really convenient or necessary is
no injury to the sufferer and is therefore not a nuisance which
can be restrained by injunction. So far respecting houses. As
to lands it is to be remarked that if one erects a smelting-house
for lead so near the land of another that the vapour and smoke
kills his corn and grass and damages his cattle therein this is
a nuisance. 1 Roll. Abr. 89. And generally if one does any act
in itself lawful which yet being done in that place necessarily

[CH. X,
tends to the damage of another's land it is a nuisance for it is
incumbent on him to find some other place to do that act where
it will be less offensive. So also if my neighbour ought to
scour a ditch and does not whereby my land is overflowed this
may be restrained by injunction. F. N. B. 184. The principle
of the law is the same as to incorporeal hereditaments. For it
is a nuisance to stop or divert water that ought to run to
another's meadow or mill. F. N. B. 184, and if a person has a right
of way annexed to his estate across another's land and the latter
obstructs the use of it, there is a nuisance. F. N. B. 183, which
may be enjoined. The same principle applies to the right of a
ferry and to the right to hold a fair. 2 Roll. Abr. 148, 140. But
it is no nuisance to erect a mill so near to mine as to draw
away the custom unless the miller also intercepts the water.
Neither is it a nuisance to set up any trade or school in neigh-
bourhood or rivalship with another; for by such emulation the
public are like to be garners. And should the new mill or
school occasion a damage to the old one it is damage without
injury. Hale on F. N. B. 184.
That the removal of a nuisance will be very difficult is no
justification but it is ground for suspending the enforcement of
the injunction for a period.-A. G. v. Colney Hatch, L. R.
4 Ch. 146.
A person annoyed by a nuisance should be prompt in giving
notice of his protest and do nothing to encourage it or his
acquiescence will preclude his obtaining a remdy. But acquies-
cence in the erection of injurious buildings or of noxious works
while they produce little damage will not deprive the person so
acquiescing of his right to an injunction if the nuisance is in-
creased and becomes productive of more serious damage.-
Cooper v. Hubbush, 30 Bea. 160; Goldsmid v. Tonbridge Wells, L.
R. 1 Ch. 349; Bankart v. Houghton, 27 Bea. 431; In Tipping
v. St. Helen's Smelting Co., L. R. 1 Ch. 66, one who purchased
the land with knowledge of the nuisance was held not disen-
titled to relief. To obtain an injunction quia timet a strong
probability of a future nuisauce must be shown. A. G. 1893,
2 Ch. Div. 87.

source of pleasure to persons at a distance may be enjoined as

ed.—Gaunt v. Fynney, L. R. 8 Ch. 8. In the cases of nuisances
the operation of the decree is usually postponed so that the
defendant may remove it without doing unnecessary damage.
From the earliest period injunctions have been granted to
restrain the owner of land from so dealing with his property as
to prejudice or destroy the rights of his neighbour thereby
enforcing the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non loodas.
Broom.
The foundation of the jurisdiction is the head of mischief
alluded to by Hardwicke, L.C., that sort of material injury to
the comfort and enjoyment of property which requires the
application of a power to prevent as well as to remedy an evil
for which damages more or less would be given in a suit.-A. G.
v. Nichol, 16 Ves. 342. The plaintiff must be prepared to prove
substantial damages sustained or anticipated. The court will
not interfere to protect a dry strict legal title.-Dent v. Auction
Mart Co., L. R. 2 Eq. 238; Lingwood v. Stowmarket Paper Co.,
L. R. 1 Eq. 77.
(u.) By a patent right we are to understand a privilege
granted by the crown to the first inventor of any new contrivance
in the manufactures that he alone shall be entitled during a
limited period to make articles according to his own invention.
It is so called because the instrument by which it is bestowed is
in England in the form of letters patent under the great seal which
is the established mode of royal grant. To confer on any in-
dividual the exclusive right of carrying on a particular trade or
manufacture is in general beyond the lawful bounds of the royal
prerogative. It amounted at common law to a species of offence
called a monopoly; and it is declared by the statute of mono-
polies, 21 Ja. I c. 3 to be altogether "contrary to the laws of this
realm." But an exception was always made in favour of new
inventors to whom it was held that the crown might lawfully
concede for a reasonable period a privilege of this description
because such grants whilst they tended to encourage useful in-
genuity encroached on no right of which others were already in
possession. In accordance with which principle the statute of
James also excepts from its general declaration against mono-
polies all letters patent for the term of 14 years or under by
which the privilege of sole working or making any new manu-

factories within this realm which others at the time of grant-
ing the letters patent shall not use shall be granted to the true
and first inventor thereof so as they be not contrary to law nor
mischievous to the State nor to the hurt of trade nor generally
inconvenient.
ss.
As to the method by which the inventor of a new manufacture
may after filing a specification obtain the grant of exclusive
privilege to make it (commonly called Letters Patent) see
Act XV of 1859, 88. 1-21. Section 1 of the said Act includes
new patterns and designs in the meaning of the word manu-
facture. Section 37A defines the effect of exclusive right in
the United Kingdom to patterns and designs. Sections 22-35
contain special rules for suits concerning the infringement, annul-
ment and fraudulent obtaining of patents-See also Griffith's
Civil Procedure Code, 1882—1888. The period of limitation
for a suit for compensation for the infringement of a copyright
or other exclusive privilege is three years from the date of the
infringement. Semble, this period extends to suits for an
account of the profits obtained by the infringement. I. L. R.
3 C. S. 17. Suits for compensation are not cognizable by the
Presidency Small Cause Courts.
Act XV of 1882, s. 19n, Griffith's Civil Procedure Code, p. 422.
The effect in India of letters patent obtained in the United
Kingdom is regulated by section 20 of Act XV of 1859.
In Bells v. Neilson, L. R. 5 H. L. 1, it was held that if an
agent does anything which infringes a patent he is liable though
only an agent. If the owner of a ship causes patent pumps to
be inserted in the ship the captain is bailee thereof. The
exclusive right granted is to make use vend and exercise the
invention. Though the captain use other pumps instead he
still seems to use the invention by having patented pumps on
board. At any rate he may be sued apart from the owner.—
O. A. Adavi v. Young, 12 Ch. Div. 13. Where a patent has been
granted in England for a new process for producing more
cheaply a chemical product which was previously known the
importation and sale in England of this article made abroad is an
infringement.-Van-Heyden v. Nenstadt, 14 Ch. Div. 230. The
same principle would apply to Indian patents. The exclusive
right to use the patent does not bind the owner to make
compensation if it uses the process.-Dixon v. London Small

Arms Co., 1 App. Cas. 632; Feather v. Q., 6 B. & S. 257. Yet
though servants or agents of the crown doing its work are not
liable for an infringement of the patent private contractors with
the crown to manufacture a patented article are not protected
by the crown's privilege. S. C.
The form of an English Patent is as follows: "Victoria by
the grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland, Queen Defender of the Faith. To all to whom these
presents shall come greeting." [Here follow recitals that the
grantee has declared himself the true and first inventor that he
has described the nature of the invention, &c.]
"know ye
therefore that We of our especial grace certain knowledge and
mere motion do by these presents for us our heirs and successors
give and grant unto the said patentee our especial license full
power sole privilege and authority that the said patentee by
himself his agents or licensees and no others may at all times
hereafter during the term of years berein mentioned make use
and exercise the said invention and vend the said invention
within our United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and
Isle of Man in such manner as to him or them shall seem meet
and that the said patentee shall have and enjoy the whole profit
and advantage from time to time accruing by reason of the said
invention during the term of fourteen years from the date here-
under written of these presents." [Here follow a prohibition
of infringement and conditions that the invention is new and
the grant legal and that the fees be paid article manufactured
and sold at reasonable price, &c.]
The person who has discovered the main and leading idea
remains the true and first inventor and as such entitled to apply
for a patent notwithstanding that he avails himself of the
assistance and suggestions of workmen and servants in bringing
his invention to a state of perfection.-Allen v. Rawson, 1 C. B.
551; David v. Woodley, 1884, No. 13876, Griff. L'O. C. 26.
Inventions for which letters patent have been upheld may in
respect of the subject-matter be classified as follows:
(1) New contrivances applied to new objects or purposes.
(2) New contrivances applied to old objects or purposes.
(8) New combinations of new or partly of new and partly old

a party shows a decided intention to infringe the perpetual

It is not a breach of the injunction for the person against
whom it has been ordered to publish advertisements asking for
subscriptions towards the expense of an appeal.-Plating Co. v.
Farquharson, 17 Ch. Div. 49. The mere making using or selling
the elements or parts which afterwards enter into a patent in
combination is not enjoined unless the parts as in a knife can
readily be put together.-Townsend v. Haworth, 12 Ch. Div. 831;
United Telephone Co. v. Dale, 25 Ch. Div. 782.
Under the English Patents Act, 1883, an injunction was
granted to restrain the defendant company from threatening
the plaintiffs their customers or any other person or persons
with legal proceedings or liability in respect of certain alleged
infringements of patents claimed to have been assigned to the
defendants.-Kensington Electric Lighting Co. v. The Lane Fox
Electrical Co., 1891, April 24th. The defendants were not
owners of the patent.
Equity usually assumes the validity of a patent.—Halsey v.
Brotherhood, 15 Ch. Div. 514; 19 Ch. Div. 386.
Groundless threats of legal proceedings to restrain an infringe-
ment of a patent may in England be enjoined under the Patents
Designs and Tradesmarks Act, 1883, s. 32. The Indian Patents
Act XV of 1859 does not seem to provide for such a case, but
possibly the court might grant similar relief on the principles
of bills of peace and quia timet. (1) Fenner 1893; 2 Ch. 656;
Mackin, 9 R. P. C. 465.
(v.) Copyright is the exclusive right which the law allows an
author of printing and reprinting his original work. Justinian's
laws according to Sir William Blackstone do not recognize such
right of property though the sale of literary works for the pur-
poses of recital or multiplication is certainly as ancient as the
times of Terence (Prolog. in Eunuch 20) and Martial 167, IV.
72. In Donaldson v. Becket, 2 Bro. P. C. 145, a majority of the
judges declared that at common law an author did possess the
sole right not only of first publishing but of afterwards re-pub-

lishing his own works and that it belonged to him and his
assigns in perpetuity. In the reign of Queen Anne the right of
the author and his assigns to the sole liberty of printing and
reprinting the book was restricted to 14 years in analogy to
patent rights under the statute of monopolies. This period is
greatly extended by 5 & 6 Vict. c. 45 which provides that the
copyright of every book (under which word is included in the
construction of the act "every volume, part or division of a
volume, pamphlet, sheet of letter press, sheet of music, map, chart
or plan separately published") which shall be published in the
lifetime of its author shall endure for his natural life and for
7 years longer or if the 7 years shall expire before the end of
42 years from the first publication shall endure for such period
of 42 years. When the work is posthumous it is to endure for
42 years from the first publication and to belong to the pro-
prietor of the author's manuscript.
Act XX of 1847 after reciting that doubts existed as to the
enforcing the common law right of copyright in India and as
to the extent of the jurisdiction under 5 & 6 Victoria c. 45,
proceeds to define and provide for the enforcement in India of
the right called copyright.
Piracy is an infringement of copyright. Its leading and
distinguishing feature is that it reproduces the pirated work in
such a manner as to interfere with the profit and enjoyment
which the proprietor derives from it. Yet everything that does
this by no means exposes the person so acting to the charge.
An abridgment of a book may diminish the profits, but is not
illegal nor to be enjoined. Quotations and extracts made in
good faith and the use of the same common materials in
another work are not infringements.- Wilkins v. Acken, 17
Ves. 426. But abridgments are not favoured by the law.-
Chatterton v. Cave, L. R. 10 C. P. 572.
Several persons may obtain copies of judgments pronounced

joined.— Weldon v. Dicks, 10 Ch. Div. 241. Semble, the grant by

If a report of a judge's judgment or summing up to a jury
does not in fact give reasonable opportunities to the reader to
form his own judgment as to what conclusion should be drawn
from the evidence given, the publication of such partial and in
that respect inaccurate representations of the evidence may be
the subject of a suit for a libel to which the supposed privilege
in what was said by a judge would be no answer. There is no
presumption one way or the other as to whether a judge's judg-
ment does or does not give such a complete and substantially
accurate account of the matters upon which he is adjudicating
as to bring it within the privilege. If it be so it must be proved
to be so by evidence and certainly not inferred as a presumption
of law. Halsbury, L.C.-Macdougall v. Knight, 14 App. Cas.
194; 5 T. L. R. 90 H. L. E. Respecting presumptions of fact
and law, see Griffith's Indian Evidence Acts.
Upon grounds of irreparable mischief or of the inadequacy of
the remedy by damages or the prevention of multiplicity of
snits injunctions have been granted in a class of cases bearing
a close analogy to that of copyrights, namely unpublished
manuscripts. In cases of literary, scientific and professional
treatises in manuscript it is obvious that the author must be
deemed to possess the original ownership and be entitled to
appropriate them to such uses as he pleases. Nor can he justly
be deemed to intend to part with that ownership by depositing
them in the possession of a third person or by allowing a third
person to take and hold a copy of them. Such acts must be
deemed strictly limited in point of right use and effect to the
very occasions expressed or implied, and ought not to be con-
strued or implied to be a general gift or authority for any
purposes of profit or publication to which the receiver may
choose to devote them. The property then in such manu.
scripts not having been parted with in cases of this sort if any
attempt is made to publish them without the consent of the
author or proprietor it is plain that he ought to be protected
by the courts.-Prince Albert v. Strange, 1 Mac. & Gor. 25.

·Oavid v. Sime, 12 App. Cas. 326.
The plaintiffs entered into a written contract with the defend-
ant in Berlin that he should make copies of a picture of which he
held the unregistered copyright. The defendant made the copies
required but in addition made copies for himself which he sent
to England and undersold the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs then
registered their copyright. Held, that they were entitled to
penalties under the Copyright Act by way of damages for copies
sold after registration. Held also that they were entitled to an
injunction and semble to damages for breach of an implied con-
dition in contract not to reproduce more than the specified num.

(w.) The definition of trade mark given by the Registration
Act of 1875 has been enlarged by the Patent Acts of 1883 and
1888 and is as follows:
(1) For the purposes of this Act a trade mark must consist
of or contain at least one of the following essential particulars:
(a) A name of an individual or firm printed, impressed or
woven in some particular or distinctive manner; or
(b) A written signature or copy of a written signature of the
individual or firm applying for registration thereof as a trade
mark; or
or
(c) A distinctive device mark brand heading label or ticket;
(d) An invented word or invented words; or
(e) A word or words having no reference to the character or
quality of the goods, and not being a geographical name.
(2) There may be added to any one or more of the essential
particulars mentioned in this section any letters, words or figures
or combination of any letters, words or figures or of any of them;

but the applicant for registration of such additional matter must
state in his application the essential particulars of the trade
mark and must disclaim in his application any right to the
exclusive use of the added matter and a copy of the statement
and disclaimer shall be entered on the register.
(3) Provided as follows:
I.
"A person need not under this section disclaim his own
name or the foreign equivalent thereof or his place of business
but no entry of such name shall affect the right of any owner
of the same name to use that name or the foreign equivalent
thereof.
II. Any distinctive word or words, letter, figure or combin-
ation of letters or figures or of letters and figures used as a
trade mark before 13th August 1875, may be registered as a
trade mark." Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, 1888, s. 10.
Application for registration of a trade mark is deemed to be
equivalent to public use of the trade mark, s. 17.
Trade and Property marks are thus defined by the Penal
Code, ss. 478, 479. "A mark used for denoting that goods
have been made are manufactured by a particular person or at a
particular time or place or that they are of a particular quality
is called a trade mark.”
"A mark used for denoting that moveable property belongs
to a particular person is called a property mark." Using a
false trade or property mark and counterfeiting a genuine one
are penal offences, ss. 480–489.
Injunctions will issue where a criminal charge could not be
maintained for on such a charge it is necessary to prove not
only that the mark would produce a false belief but that it was
used with that intention.
Where an existing trade mark is imitated it is not necessary
that the resemblance should be such as would deceive persons
who should see the two marks placed side by side.-Seixo v.
Provezende, L. R. 1 Ch. 196; Wotherspoon v. Currie, L. R.
5 H. L. 508.
Act VIII of 1878, s. 18 g, prohibits the importation of goods
with false trade marks. Suits for compensation for infringe-
ment of trade marks are not cognizable by Presidency Small

Cause Courts, Act XV of 1882, s. 19 n, Griffith's Civil Procedure
Code, p. 422.
The law of trade marks was developed by the equity courts
before any legislation on the matter. Its history is sketched
by Lord Blackburn in Singer Manufacturing Co. v Long, 8 App.
Cas. 29.
The remedy by injunction is not barred by a lapse of time
which would not bar the legal right.-Fullwood v. Fullwood,
9 Ch. Div. 176.
The proprietor of a house or estate may give it the same
name as that used by a neighbour without committing a legal
injury.—Day v. Brounrigg, 10 Ch. Div. 294.
The principle of the law of trade marks extends to the sale
of the goodwill of a shop. The seller will be enjoined from
carrying on his business so as to induce the public to believe
that he is continuing his former one; and from soliciting old
customers or otherwise inducing them to deal with him.-
Crutwell v. Lye, 17 Ves. 335; Leggott v. Barrett, 15 Ch.
Div. 306.
A sale of a good will and business gives the right to exclusively
use an old partnership name.-Levy v. Walker, 10 Ch. Div. 448.
Goodwill means every positive advantage as contrasted with
the negative advantage of the late owner not carrying on the
business himself whether connected with the premises or not
with the name of the late firm or with any other matter carrying
with it the benefit of the business.-Churton v. Douglas Johns,
174; Llewellyn v. Rutherford, L. R. 10 C. P. 456.
Trade marks have been likened to both letters patent and to
copyright "from both of which they differ in many respects.".
Johnstone v. Orr Ewing, 7 App. Cas. 219. The broad difference
between the former and the two latter is that the public are at
liberty to manufacture the article marked, but not the one
patented or protected by the copyright. But though at liberty
to manufacture a person must not while so doing or afterwards
use another's trade mark.-Davenport v. Rylands, L. R. 1 Eq.
302.
• A company may be enjoined from obtaining registration with
the same name as another company or one similar thereto.

In Routh v. Webster, 10 Bea. 561, the promoters of a new

inadvertence. The decision was approved by Cairns, L.C., in
Prudential Assurance Co. v. Knott, L. R. 10 Ch. 142.
Where the owner of a publication claims an injunction to
restrain the issue of another publication with a similar name be
must show not only that the assumption of the name by the
defendant is likely to deceive the public but also that there is a
probability that the plaintiff will be injured by such deception.-
Borthwick v. The Evening Post, C. A. 37, Ch. Div. 449.
(y.) There is no distinction made between private letters
possessing the character of literary compositions and those whose
very nature imports as matter of business or friendship or advice
or family or personal confidence the implied or necessary inten-
tion of privacy and secrecy. For the purposes of public justice
publicly administered according to the established jurisdiction
of the country in the ordinary modes of proceeding private
letters may be required to be produced and published. But it
by no means follows that private persons have the right to make
such publications on other occasions upon their own notion of
taking the administration of justice into their own hands or for
the purpose of vindicating their own conduct or of gratifying
their own enmity or of indulging a gross and diseased public
curiosity by the circulation of private anecdotes or family secrets
or personal concerns. Yet the courts have not enjoined any
publication which purports to be a literary work upon the mere
ground that it is of a libellous character and tends to the
degradation or injury of the reputation or business of the plaintiff
who seeks an injunction against the publication.-Olark v. Free.

Lord Eldon based the injunction not upon the feelings of the

writer and pain caused thereto but upon a mere civil right of pro-
perty. That right of property may be qualified in some respects.
By sending a letter the writer gives for the purpose of reading
it and in some cases of keeping it a property to the person to
whom the letter is addressed; yet the gift is so limited that
beyond the purposes for which the letter is sent the property is
in the sender. Under such circumstances it is immaterial
whether the intended publication is for the purpose of profit or
not. If for profit the party is then selling if not for profit he
is then giving that a portion of which belongs to the writer.-
Gee v. Pritchard, 2 Swanstone 413%; Pope v. Ourl, 2 Atk. 342;
Lord Percival v. Phipps, 2 Ves. & Beam. 19; Thompson v.
Stanhope Ambler 739.
The property in and the right to retain letters remains in the
person to whom they are sent. But the sender has still that
kind of interest if not property in the letters which enables him
to restrain their publication unless it can be clearly shown that
such publication is necessary for vindication of character.-Earl
of Lytton v. Devey, 54 L. J. Ch. 293. The publication was
enjoined.
(z.) In Brampton v. Beddowes, 13 C. B. 538 the defendant had
accepted in the forbidden district while collecting debts orders
for goods. In Rogers v. Drury, W. N. 1887, p. 217. After the
sale of a medical practice the former practitioner was held to
have broken his covenant when some patients residing within
the district called him in and he attended them there. He had
not solicited their custom. In Llewellyn v. Simpson, 1891-4 an
action between two solicitors the defendant had covenanted
with the plaintiff "that the said S shall not at any time or
times hereafter directly or indirectly either in his own name or
in the name or names of or jointly with any other person or
persons and either with or without fee or reward use exercise
practice or carry on the business or profession of a solicitor or
conveyancer of the supreme Court of Judicature at or in the
towns of T or B without the licence or consent of the said L
and his co-partner first had and obtained. The defendant had
set up in business outside the limits of the forbidden district
and the acts which were complained of were the following:
(1) Acting for clients residing within the district; (2) having

[CH. X,
professional interviews with such clients within the district;
(3) attending auctions within the district as solicitor for the
vendors; (4) advertising for the creditors of deceased persons
who had resided within the district; (5) conducting civil and
criminal cases in courts held therein. Romer, J., held that (1)
and (4) did not constitute breaches of the contract that (2), (3)
and (5) did; but that (5) being admitted to be a breach an
injunction should be granted without discussing (2) and (3)
minutely.
The clerk of a solicitor commencing a practice on his own
account will not be enjoined from acting against parties clients
of his late master unless it be shown that when clerk he acquired
special and particular information which it would be a breach
of good faith to carry into the service of the opposite parties.-
Brieheno v. Thorp, Jac. 300. In Hardy v. Veasey, L. R. 3 Ex. 107
an action by a customer against his banker for disclosing the state
of the customer's account without justifiable cause the question
was left to the jury whether under the circumstances it was
reasonable and proper to make the disclosure. Held, that
assuming the existence of a legal duty on the banker not dis-
close the customer's account the direction was right. But the
question of the exact nature of the duty was not settled it being
left open whether special damage was essential to the mainte-
nance of the action.

performance of certain acts which the
Court is capable of enforcing, the
Court may in its discretion grant an injunction to
prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel
performance of the requisite acts.
The court will not compel a lessee to carry on the business

An article had been published by the defendant as proprietor
of a financial newspaper called the "Financial Observer" and
Mining Herald" reflecting in strong terms on the character and
honesty of the plaintiff. The article first appeared on Februa
ary 1, 1891, and was frequently repeated. In an action for libel
thereon and before the trial the plaintiffs obtained an inter-
locutory injunction. The court of appeal unanimously held
that the courts of first instance had jurisdiction to grant such
injunction but Kay, L. J., dissenting that it had been wrongly
exercised in this case; and that it is wiser in all but exceptional
cases to abstain from any interference with the freedom of
publication; and that an interlocutory injunction ought not to
be granted where if the alleged libel be true the publication is
for the public interest and interference with its circulation
would be an infringement with the liberty of the press in that
it might fetter the freedom of speech.-Bonnard v. Perryman,
21st April 1891.
This case may be taken to modify several recent cases which
preceded it and rested the injunction on the ground of damage
to property. See 14 Ch. Div. 784, 864; 3 C. P. D. 339.
A shareholder of a company issued a circular to other share-
holders imputing fraud in getting up the company and proposing

part of the sovereign prerogative recognised by the law of

plaintiff must not sleep on his rights. He has to consider clauses
h & j lest he disentitle himself by acquiescence. And he must be
ready with his evidence. See Griffith's Indian Evidence Acts,
190.
(h) to prevent a continuing breach in which the
applicant has acquiesced;
Payments may be made and possession of land had without
such acts amounting to acquiescence. Fry 479.-Lindsay P. Co.
v. Hurd, L. R. 5 P. C. 239; Erlanger v. New S. P. Co., 3 Ap.
Ca. 1218. As in cases of nuisances so in cases of acquiescence
the court may refuse a temporary injunction without deciding
the right the consideration of which it reserves until the hear-
ing of the application for a perpetual injunction.-Bovil v. Crate,
L. R. 1 Eq. 388; Hogg v. Scott, 18 Eq. 453.
Acquiescence may bar the remedy for a continuing breach
and yet not justify an additional trespass or extension of the
original one. Richards v. Revitt, 7 Ch. Div. 224. Yet acquiescence
by landlord in breach of covenant by one tenant may amount to
a waiver of breaches by other tenants.-Peek v. Matthews, L. R.
3 Eq. 515. Acquiescence is an example of the application of the
maxim “volenti non fit injuria, "“that to which a person assents
is not esteemed in law an injury." For it is a general rule of the
English law that no one can maintain an action for a wrong
where he has consented to the act which has occasioned his loss.
Wootton v. Dawkins, 2 C. B. N. S. 412. And this principle has
been applied under states of facts showing that though the
defendant was in the wrong the plaintiff's negligence had con-
tributed to produce the damage complained of.-Caswell v.
Worth, 5 El. & Bl. 849.
Acquiescence sometimes approaches an actual licence to be
implied from the licensor's conduct to do a particular thing such
licenses may be revoked in a variety of ways. Griffith's Easements
Act, Ch. VI. Such licenses no less than acquiescence involve a
consideration of doubtful pieces of evidence. Griffith's Indian
Evidence Acts, ss. 116, 117.
Acquiescence though sufficiently complete to bar an injunction
does not necessarily preclude compensation for the injury.- Wood
v. Sutcliffe, 2 Sim. N. S. 163. The case was one of pollution of

After service of writ the defendant hurried on with his
buildings in the hope that when once up the court might decline

(a.) A seeks an injunction to restrain his partner, B, from
receiving the partnership debts and effects. It appears that A
had improperly possessed himself of the books of the firm and
refused B access to them. The Court will refuse the injunction.

(b.) A manufactures and sells crncibles, designating them
Ag patent plumbago crucibles," though, in fact, they have
never been patented. B pirates the designation. A cannot
obtain an injunction to restrain the piracy.
(c.) A sells an article called "Mexican Balm,” stating that
it is compounded of divers rare essences, and has sovereign
medicinal qualities. B commences to sell a similar article
to which he gives a name and description such as to lead people
into the belief that they are buying A's Mexican Balm. A sues
B for an injunction to restrain the sale. B shows that A's
Mexican Balm consists of nothing but scented hog's lard. A's
use of his description is not an honest one, and he cannot obtain
an injunction.
Where a trade mark represents that an article is protected
by a patent when it is not protected the owner is disentitled to
relief against a pirate.-Edleston v. Vick, 11 Hare 78. And yet
after the expiration of a patent the designation patent may be
used merely as part of a description of the article well known in
the market without deceiving or intending to deceive anybody.
The word patent may be a mere term of art as Patent leather
boots.—Marshall v. Ross, L. R. 8 Eq. 561. But a represent-
ation of protection where there is none disentitles to relief.

ledge. The agreement contained a stipulation" that the defond-
ant should give the whole of his time to the plaintiffs' business
that be should give due diligence to the performance of his
duties and that he should conform to all the reasonable require.
ments of the board of directors of the company."
"
In the beginning of the year 1891 it came to the knowledge
of the directors that the defendant was about to construct a
new company in the neighbourhood of the plaintiffs' works for
the carrying on of a similar business and that he intended to
become a shareholder and director of the new company. The
court of appeal refused an injunction to restrain the defendant
observing that there was no express negative covenant or stipu-
lation on the part of the defendant that he would not start nor
carry on a similar business during his period of service and
pointing out the distinction between a contract for exclusive
service and a stipulation not to enter into any other service.
Two cases, however, were relied on by the plaintiffs where
under similar circumstances injunctions were granted. One
was the case of Webster v. Dillon, in which Hatherley, L. C.
then Vice-Chancellor Wood granted an injunction to restrain
an nctor who had entered into a contract to perform on certain
nights at a certain theatre from performing on those nights at
another theatre; the other case was Montague v. Flockton, L. R.
16 Eq. 189, in which Malins V. C. granted an injunction under
similar circumstances although there was no express negative
stipulation by the defendant. In what was the leading case of
Lumley v. Wagner, 1 DeG. M. & G. 604, Lord St. Leonards
granted an injunction but there an express negative stipulation'
had been entered into by the defendant who had agreed to sing
at the plaintiff's theatre that she would not sing at any other.
L. T., 1891, April 4. One was granted to prevent a railway
servant leaving Madras. 14 M. S. 18.
The rules of pleading evidence and procedure or practice are
the same for decrees for perpetual injunctions, as for other
decrees see Griffith's Civil Procedure Code, Ch. VIII & XI,
and Griffith's Indian Evidence Acts, Ch. VIII, XI. For tem-
porary injunctions where the mischief of acting prematurely may
be remedied by putting the applicant upon terms relaxations of
the ordinary rules have been introduced by the Code of Proce
dure. See Griffith, Ch. XXXV.

But a mere hypothetical title set out in the plaint which must
be filed. Griffith's Code, Ch. V. is not sufficient.—Duvies v. Leo,
6 Ves. 786. But presumptive evidence of an alleged absolute
is sufficient.-Norway v. Rowe, 19 Ves. 141. Where the con-
struction of a contract leave it doubtful whether a breach has
been committed the case is analogous to a hypothetical title.-
Chill v. Douglas, 5 D. M. & G. 739. A defeudant need not as
a rule plead to an injunction prayed for in the plaint. He may
usually reserve his facts till application is made for the injunc
tion.—Booth v. Taylor, L. R. 1 Ex. 51. As a hypothetical title
does not justify an order for an injunction so an apprehension
of injury not resting on solid grounds of evidence, or on
grounds which show that the apprehension is premature because
the injury cannot possibly occur till after a certain date.-Coates
v. Coates, 6 Mud. 287; Cowley v. Bias, 5 Ch. Div. 944.
A plaintiff seeking an injunction ought correctly to describe
the character in which he sues and as he seeks an extraordinary
remedy ought in his application to state not only the truth but
the whole truth so far as he can. But the rules of pleading are
so far relaxed that persons not technically parties to the suit
may be enjoined, for example a purchaser under a decree who
has not paid his money into court, a tenant in possession acting
for the defendant, a tenant let into possession by a receiver.
Section 588 (24) gives an appeal from orders under this
section and 88. 493, 496, and 497. It is thought that the appeal
court would allow the appellant to adduce fresh evidence. Such
is the practice in England in cases of urgency.
Where an appeal is about to to be made an injunction against
parting with property will be continued though the suit res-
pecting the same has been dismissed, if another course would
render a successful appeal nugatory.-Sturla v. Freccia, 12 Ch.
Div. 438.
The process to enforce obedience leading to penal results the
defendant ought to have clear notice of the intention to apply
for it.-Ellerton v. Thirsk, 1 J. & W. 376.
The dismissal of a suit dissolves an injunction. A motion to
dissolve should be preceded by notice to the plaintiff or his
authorized agent. The applicant may rely on legal objections'
to the plaint. The case is also heard on its merits and the

[CH. X,
plaintiff may adduce additional evidence except where he has
suppressed material facts on his first application. The vague-
ness of the original order and prejudice otherwise likely to
arise therefrom are grounds for dissolution. Dover v. L. C. &
D. Ry., 7 Jur. N. S. 453
Informal notice of an injunction is sufficient. But it is of
course better to give direct notice to the party enjoined. In
urgent cases this can and may be done by the electric telegraph.
E. P. Langley, 13 Ch. Div. 110. An injunction does not affect a
new owner even if he own by purchase. Should he however
continue the wrong he is liable to new proceedings.—A. G. v.
B. T., 17 Ch. Div. 692.
Inasmuch as no action can be brought against an infant on a
covenant to serve.-Gylbert v. Fletcher, Cro. Car. 179, a negative
clause in an apprentice deed not to accept a professional engage-
ment without the consent of her master will not be enforced by
injunction.—De Francesco v. Barnum, 43 Ch. Div. 165. Fatima
