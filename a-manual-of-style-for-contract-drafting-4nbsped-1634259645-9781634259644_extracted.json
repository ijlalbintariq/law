  "Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware  To Fellow Students of the Contractual Arts:  A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting   is an essential resource for anyone   who   works   with   contracts.   Its   author,   Ken   Adams,   has produced   an   impressively   innovative,   intelligent,   and   thorough work. As a judge, I regularly confront transactions where something has gone wrong. Often, it’s because the governing agreement wasn’t as clear as it could have been. Better contract drafting would lead to fewer disputes. Fewer disputes should mean happier clients. As practiced in most organizations, contract drafting remains an unscientific   activity,   conducted   mostly   by   consulting   and   largely duplicating earlier precedents of questionable quality and relevance. I know   that   firsthand.   While   practicing   law   before   joining   the Delaware Court of Chancery, a meaningful part of my time was spent commenting on merger agreements and other contracts that carried a high risk of litigation. By bluntly characterizing the current state of the art, I am not suggesting that contract drafters do not take their jobs seriously, nor implying that they do not give extensive thought to the provisions they draft. They do. But all too often, a question is answered or a debate resolved by sticking with language that seems to have worked in the past, trusting that it will work again. Putting such a precedent-driven activity on a more rational footing is not an easy task. The first step is to establish a comprehensive set of guidelines for the building blocks of contract prose. That’s what the   Manual   offers. I have been a fan of the   Manual   since Ken began his campaign to modernize the preparation of agreements. I’ve found it compelling enough to cite in one of my opinions. See   Airborne Health, Inc. v. Squid Soap, LP , 984 A.2d 126, 140 (Del. Ch. 2009). Now in its fourth",
  "edition, the   Manual   has reached a level of maturity in its scope and approach. Ken takes a firm stand on how best to express many fundamental contract concepts. At the same time, he does not always insist on a particular   outcome.   The   best   reference   works   offer   enough explication to allow the reader to appreciate the guidance yet opt for a different destination. The   Manual   achieves that balance. You don’t have to buy into every position it takes to benefit from consulting it. Ken hasn’t been mindlessly dogmatic either. He constantly probes his work for weaknesses, and he encourages others to do so too. Commendably,   he   has   adjusted   his   views   when   the   weight   of evidence   warrants,   as   you   can   tell   by   comparing   the   different editions of the   Manual . Contract drafters undoubtedly will benefit from adopting Ken’s recommendations. Judges and litigators will benefit from reading it too. Much of the text consists of detailed discussion, on a level unmatched in my experience, about what makes traditional contract language confusing. Ken offers grammatical and historical insights, and he provides helpful explanations about how familiar phrases were   originally   supposed   to   work.   He   frequently   illustrates   his analyses with examples of judicial decisions that likely surprised the original drafters, because the judges seem to have ascribed dispositive meaning to technical contract language using little more than their own wits and a copy of Strunk and White. (Doubtless I have been guilty of that failing at times.) My judicial colleagues would do well to   become   passingly   familiar   with   the   Manual ,   which   offers interpretive guidance free of the biased perspective that necessarily permeates an advocate’s brief. And litigators could improve their arguments by applying Ken’s interpretive recommendations. This is not to say that if you cite the   Manual   to me or to an another   judge,   your   client   will   win.   In   some   cases,   the   Manual  recommends   departing   from   existing   practice   and   adopting   a different   approach.   There,   Ken’s   analysis   offers   less   guidance   for existing agreements that hew to older approaches. But even then, the  Manual   provides   insight   by   illustrating   an   alternative   means   of addressing a topic.",
  "I hope you find this book useful, as I have, and consult it often. If you do, I suspect you will be less likely to appear in my court (or any other). And if a dispute nevertheless arises, you will be more likely to occupy the linguistic high ground. Happy drafting!",
  "WHAT HAS CHANGED  Welcome to the fourth edition of   A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting.  As with the second and third editions, this edition represents a substantial upgrade. But you won’t find changes to the design, or extensive surgery to what came before. I’ve expanded my treatment of a few topics; I’ve moved some sections from one chapter to another; and I’ve done some tweaking throughout. Otherwise, the third edition has held up well. Instead, the biggest change is that I’ve added discussion of many new topics, the result of a further four years of work on the words and   phrases   used   to   construct   contract   provisions.   That   includes consulting for a broad range of clients, more than a thousand blog posts, around 20 articles, dozens of public and in-house “Drafting Clearer Contracts” seminars around the world, and three semesters of teaching at law school. Here’s an overview of the changes:  Introduction . Revised and expanded. This is where you will now find discussion of the notion of “tested” contract language, which was previously in chapter 1.  Chapter 1 (The Characteristics of Optimal Contract Language) . Slightly revised.  Chapter 2 (The Front of the Contract) . Contains expanded discussion of the traditional recital of consideration and addresses several new topics.  Chapter 3 (Categories of Contract Language) . Revised to include many new topics, including “throat-clearing” (3.25–.28) and consolidating deal points (3.29). It also contains many new",
  "examples of dysfunctional verb structures. The discussion of  represents and warrants   has been expanded. And just as Pluto is no longer a planet, language of belief is no longer a category of contract language; instead, chapter 13 now contains a section on belief.  Chapter 4 (Layout) . Now includes a second   MSCD   enumeration scheme, the hanging-indent scheme.  Chapter 5 (The Back of the Contract) . Largely unchanged.  Chapter 6 (Defined Terms) . Revised to include several new topics, including abbreviations as defined terms (6.9–.12) and circular definitions (6.17–.23).  Chapter 7 (Sources of Uncertainty in Contract Language) . Significantly revised, rearranged, and expanded.  Chapter 8 ( Reasonable Efforts   and Its Variants) . The part dealing with the function of   efforts   standards, variants of   efforts   standards, and what   efforts   standards mean has been entirely rewritten.  Chapter 9   (Material   and   Material Adverse Change). Revised to propose use of   nontrivial   to avoid ambiguity in use of   material  (9.21–.23). Added a discussion of which noun   material   should modify (9.38–.39). And in this chapter and elsewhere, all instances of   representation   have been changed to   statement of fact , consistent with the recommendations in chapter 3. Otherwise, largely unchanged.  Chapter 10 (References to Time) . Covers several new topics.  Chapter 11 (Ambiguity of the Part Versus the Whole) . Includes a new section on whether singular means plural (11.3–.14) and a new section on using   and   instead of   or , and vice versa (11.97–.100). Also discusses recent caselaw on use of   all   (11.105–.111). Otherwise largely unchanged.  Chapter 12 (Syntactic Ambiguity) . Includes an expanded discussion of the serial comma (12.57–.76) and how to avoid syntactic ambiguity by restructuring (12.77–.81). Otherwise largely unchanged.",
  "Chapter 13 (Selected Usages) . Covers many new topics.  Chapter 14 (Numbers and Formulas) . Expanded discussion of using words or digits to express numbers. Otherwise largely unchanged.  Chapter 15 (Internal Rules of Interpretation) . Renamed and rearranged; otherwise largely unchanged.  Chapter 16 (Typography) . Largely unchanged.  Chapter 17 (Drafting as Writing) . Largely unchanged.  Chapter 18 (Amendments) . Largely unchanged.  Chapter 19 (Letter Agreements) . Slightly revised. The   third   edition   contained   a   chapter   20   (Drafting   Corporate Resolutions). It has been deleted: with the new materials added to this edition, it became more obvious that that topic was out of place in this manual. The third edition also contained an appendix 2 (Statement of Style for Contract Drafting). It too has been deleted; its place will be taken by a new, shorter style guide (see p. xli). What was appendix 1 in the third edition is now the sole appendix to this edition, except that instead of containing three versions, as in the third edition, it now consists of two versions, the annotated “before” version and the redrafted “after” version. Because I thought few readers would find it useful, I omitted the unannotated “before” version. For   a   more   detailed   list   of   changes,   go   to http://www.adamsdrafting.com/writing/mscd/mscd4changes. I’ve   changed   only   two   recommendations   made   in   previous editions.   The   first   is   that   previous   editions   of   this   manual recommended using   significant   and   material   as defined terms. This manual now recommends that instead of   significant   you use the word  nontrivial , without defining it (see 9.21), and defining   material   is treated as optional (see 9.30). The second is that this manual now recommends not indenting the first line of unenumerated text (see 16.55). Given the scope and ambition of this manual, those changes are modest.",
  "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  I remain in the debt of those I acknowledged in previous editions. Furthermore, just as friends, clients, seminar participants, and readers helped   me   with   previous   editions,   many   have   helped   with   this edition. Some did so indirectly over the years, by telling me about interesting developments, asking thoughtful questions, and pointing out my mistakes. Others did so directly, by volunteering to read the manuscript. I thank them all, but I can’t resist singling out a stalwart few: Mark Anderson, Michael Fleming, Gregory M. Harris, Vance R. Koven, Chris Lemens, and Steven H. Sholk. I continue to be fortunate that Rodney Huddleston, coauthor of  The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language , was willing to devote time to saving me from embarrassing myself. And I thank my family for good-naturedly supporting me in my quixotic bid to build a reputation, and a livelihood, on how to write contracts clearly. In particular, I thank my father-in-law Stephen Kourepinos, who died last year. He was an ebullient man, and a workhorse. He was also thoughtful and generous, although he would deny it if accused. After living in Switzerland for three years, in 1998 my wife Joanne and I returned to the United States with our infant daughter, Sydney. We needed time to figure out what would come next, so we moved in with Steve and Toni—his wife and Joanne’s mother. It was a situation no one thought ideal. Early in our time with Steve and Toni, I parked myself at their dining room table and announced that I was writing a book about contract drafting. (It turned into my first book, a precursor to this manual.)   They   would   have   been   entitled   to   think   I   was   fooling myself. More to the point, we didn’t have a home, and I had yet to find a new job. I will forever be grateful to Steve for not informing me, in the salty manner of a Boston-raised son of Greek immigrants, that he expected me to provide for my family before indulging in fantasies. Instead, he and Toni cheerfully supported me in my first step in what has been a 20-year adventure. I’m glad Steve saw my efforts bear fruit.",
  "ABOUT THIS MANUAL The Purpose of This Manual  This manual offers guidelines for clear and concise contract language. If   you’re   making   decisions   regarding   contract   language   without consulting   it,   it’s   overwhelmingly   likely   that   you’re   copy-and- pasting, relying on flimsy conventional wisdom, or improvising. If you draft contracts and follow the recommendations in this manual, your contracts will be clearer and shorter and will express the   transaction   more   accurately.   That   will   allow   you   and   your organization to save time and money, reduce risk, and compete more effectively. If you review or negotiate contracts, this manual will help you determine whether deal points are articulated sensibly and will help you spot and address potential sources of uncertain meaning. If you interpret contracts—for example, if you’re involved in dispute resolution—this   manual   will   help   you   ascertain   meaning   and determine what’s causing any confusion. This   manual   should   be   useful   for   readers   in   every   contract ecosystem—a   solo   or   small-firm   general   practitioner   handling   a broad range of contracts, from leases to separation agreements; a contract   manager   responsible   for   negotiating   contracts   with customers; a “BigLaw” associate preparing mergers-and-acquisitions contracts; an in-house lawyer overhauling their company’s template sales contracts; a paralegal reviewing confidentiality agreements their company is being asked to sign; a judge considering how to interpret a contested contract provision. No   other   work   addresses   in   comparable   detail   the   words   and phrases   that   make   up   contract   provisions.   And   other   works— including some by prominent commentators—offer analysis that too often doesn’t withstand scrutiny. This manual isn’t squeamish about",
  "citing examples: the marketplace of ideas requires that you not only develop your own ideas but also challenge those offered by others.  Why a Manual of Style?  A   manual   of   style   can   be   used   as   a   resource   by   any   person   or organization seeking to write more clearly and consistently. For three reasons, a manual of style would be especially useful to those who draft, review, negotiate, or interpret contracts. First, compared to other kinds of writing (expository, narrative, and persuasive), contract prose is limited and stylized—except for recitals   (see   2.129),   it   only   regulates   conduct,   states   facts,   and allocates   risk.   That’s   why   this   manual   can   attempt   to   be comprehensive in scope. Second, it’s best to be precise in contracts—the stakes are often high enough to justify disputes over nuances (see 1.33). Using this manual would help you be precise. And third, contracts benefit from consistency of usages, because differences in wording can unexpectedly affect meaning (see 1.63). Using this manual would help you be consistent.  What This Manual Covers  One way to think of this manual is that it doesn’t cover what you say in a contract, it covers how to say it. But that’s an oversimplification, because meaning doesn’t arise in a vacuum, independent of usages. Instead, how you say something can affect meaning in unexpected ways. So this manual inevitably includes plenty of the what-to-say with the how-to-say-it. Like any book about how to write clearly, this manual covers a broad range of topics. But it doesn’t cover all of them exhaustively. For example, it can offer only some examples of redundancy (see 1.37)—it’s   not   a   legal   dictionary.   It   also   doesn’t   discuss   entire provisions,   although   it   does   consider   terminology   used   in,   for example, indemnification provisions. This   manual   doesn’t   deal   with   consumer   contracts—contracts between businesses and individual consumers—although much of what it says could be applied to such contracts. Instead, it’s intended",
  "for those who draft, review, negotiate, or interpret business contracts —contracts   between   businesses   that   either   are   experienced   in handling transactions or are represented by legal counsel. This   manual   doesn’t   limit   itself   to   standard   contract   usages. Instead, it recommends the clearest and most concise usages over those   with   nothing   but   tradition   going   for   them.   If   a recommendation departs markedly from what is traditional, that’s noted. To keep this manual practical, it dispenses with footnotes, it cites authorities sparingly, and it limits some explication. It does without a bibliography, because it attempts to offer the most authoritative treatment, from the perspective of the contract drafter, of the topics it covers. The appendix contains two versions of a contract: the “Before” version,   annotated   with   footnotes   to   explain   its   drafting shortcomings; and the “After” version, redrafted to comply with the recommendations   in   this   manual.   The   difference   between   the “Before” version and the “After” version shows the cumulative effect of a rigorous approach to drafting usages, big and small. Readers might find that the footnotes in the annotated “Before” version allow them to locate quickly those parts of this manual that discuss a given topic. To illustrate the analysis, this manual contains many examples of contract   language.   Except   as   indicated,   they’re   not   presented   as models. Indented examples of contract language are in a sans serif typeface; indented quotations from caselaw or commentary use the same typeface as the rest of the text.  Using this Manual Internationally  English is used in contracts around the world, not just contracts between   companies   from   English-speaking   countries.   English   has become   the   lingua   franca   of   international   business.   A   Swedish company   and   a   Japanese   company   might   opt   to   have   contracts between them be in English, rather than Swedish or Japanese. And a German company in an international group might require that its contracts with other German companies be in English.",
  "But for anyone working with English-language contracts who isn’t a native English speaker, there’s no such thing as a beginner’s level in English-language   contracting.   A   contract   must   address   what’s required for the transaction; no one would accept as a valid excuse that the English of a drafter, reviewer, or negotiator was limited. And the stakes are high. On the other hand, because contracts prose is limited and stylized, it’s likely to be less encumbered with peculiarities of English than are other kinds of writing. Those who aren’t native English speakers should   find   it   easier   to   gain   command   of   contracts   prose.   This manual will help. Anyone drafting contracts in English can safely use this manual. In the prose used, contracts drafted in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada share the same features. Differences in   terminology   exist,   but   are   trivial.   For   example,   whereas Commonwealth drafters use   completion , U.S. drafters prefer   closing . This manual recommends eliminating some of those differences in terminology by dispensing with the Commonwealth usages   amongst  and   whilst   (see 13.23),   clause   (see 4.9),   endeavours   (see 8.91),   forthwith  (see 10.126), and   procure   (see 3.145). Differences   in   spelling   are   likewise   trivial.   For   example,   in American English,   license   is both a noun and a verb, whereas in other varieties of English,   licence   is the noun and   license   is the verb.  The Significance of Caselaw  This manual cites caselaw as part of its analysis of different usages— mostly opinions by federal and state courts in the United States, but also opinions by English, Canadian, and Australian courts, along with, it so happens, one opinion from each of Ireland, Singapore, and South Africa. Court opinions tell us which usages risk causing disputes and how judges misinterpret contract language. Because the prose of English- language contracts is so similar the world over, the lessons from caselaw are universal. An Illinois case involving syntactic ambiguity is as relevant to drafters in Australia as it is to those in the United States.",
  "This manual doesn’t cite caselaw to support attributing a specific meaning to a particular usage. For one thing, courts tend to be overly confident of their understanding of how English works. But more to the point, a contract should speak directly to the reader, in standard English (see 1.28), without relying on caselaw to breathe meaning into   it.   (See   p.   xxxvii   regarding   the   notion   of   “tested”   contract language.) Readers have asked how the recommendations in this manual have   fared   in   the   courts.   That’s   like   assessing   how   law-abiding someone   is   by   how   often   juries   acquit   them.   Contracts   drafted consistent with this manual shouldn’t end up in court because of a fight over confusing contract language. But sometimes contract parties pick fights for no good reason. And sometimes judges make bad decisions to achieve a desired outcome, or   they   make   mistakes.   A   court   might   give   a   usage   a   meaning different from what this manual says you can expect, or it might attribute significance to a usage this manual says is pointless. For example, see 3.73 (regarding caselaw holding that   shall   can mean  should ) and 2.176–.178 (regarding caselaw attributing significance to a backstop recital of consideration). Both the law and the English language are intricate, sprawling things, so you can expect this sort of caselaw glitch occasionally. An errant court opinion is no reason for this manual to retreat from any of its recommendations.  TRADITIONAL CONTRACT LANGUAGE IS DYSFUNCTIONAL The Scale of the Dysfunction  The notion that the prose of contracts can and should be clear and modern is catching on. One sign is that this manual is now in its fourth   edition.   And   people   evidently   do   consult   this   manual.   A modest example: ten years ago the concluding clause this manual recommends (see 5.4) started appearing in contracts filed on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR system, where public companies file their “material” contracts. But have no illusions. Contracts drafted without the benefit of rigorous guidelines—most contracts—remain awash in dysfunction.",
  "The details differ, but the effect is consistent: readers must wade through a slurry of archaisms, redundancy, chaotic verb structures, overlong sentences, and confusing terminology. In short, traditional contract language. It’s not as if the dysfunction of traditional contract language is a problem for only nonlawyers. Everyone is in the same fog, although some are in denial. It doesn’t matter how exalted the law firm, company, or trade group—they mostly churn out dysfunction. The poor quality of their contracts is at odds with the aura of proficiency and dependability that such organizations seek to foster.  The Primary Cause of Dysfunction  A   defining   characteristic   of   contract   drafting   is   that   each   new transaction inevitably resembles previous transactions. It makes sense to copy contracts used in those other transactions, adjusting them as needed to reflect the new transaction. That should be a source of efficiency, but if you’re using word processing,   the   result   is   a   pathology   this   manual   calls   “passive drafting”: You don’t have the time or perhaps the expertise to reassess precedent contracts and templates, so you copy them, on faith, assuming that they worked before and so will work again. Because you’re copying, you don’t need guidelines. Because you’re copying, no one needs to be trained. The alternative to passive drafting is “active drafting”: You follow a comprehensive set of guidelines for modern contract language. You’re trained in how to draft and review contracts consistent with those guidelines. You copy from only templates and precedent contracts that comply with those guidelines.",
  "RESISTANCE TO CHANGING TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE Claiming That Traditional Language “Works”  Those who want to improve contract language face obstacles. For one thing, you encounter the claim that traditional contract language “works.” See, e.g., Kenneth A. Adams,   Where Are the Data Showing that Traditional Contract Language Is Dysfunctional? , Adams on Contract Drafting (20 Feb. 2017), http://www.adamsdrafting.com/where-are- the-data/. That notion assumes a binary world in which contracts work or don’t work. In fact, contracts are clear or less clear, working with them is less time-consuming or more time-consuming, and they present less risk of dispute over confusing prose or more risk. And caselaw is full of instances of confusing traditional usages causing a dispute.  Claiming That Traditional Language Has Been “Tested”  A   more   nuanced   argument   against   changing   traditional   contract language   is   that   doing   so   would   be   risky—traditional   contract language has been litigated, or “tested,” so it has an established, or “settled,” meaning. Here’s how one commentator expressed it: “[C]areful writing can even be counterproductive if the result is to re-draft language that has been previously interpreted by a court as having a particular meaning. Ironically, in such a case, changing the words—even for the better—can only increase uncertainty.” Robert C. Illig,   A Business Lawyer’s Bibliography: Books Every Dealmaker Should Read , Journal of Legal Education 585, 625 (May 2012). This   argument   suffers   from   three   weaknesses,   each   fatal.   First, because   courts   have   scrutinized   some   traditional   contract terminology but not the full range of contract usages, the notion of “tested” contract language applies only narrowly. Second, the notion of “tested” contract language suggests that all courts ascribe the same set meaning to individual usages. That’s not so. How courts interpret usages depends on the circumstances of each case and the semantic acuity of the judge, and can vary over time and among jurisdictions.",
  "And third, if parties to a contract had to ask a court to determine the meaning of a particular provision, that’s because the contract failed to state clearly the intent of the parties. Why rely on wording that   created   confusion?   Instead,   express   meaning   clearly,   so   you needn’t gamble on a court attributing the desired meaning to a contract. Courts have to clean up whatever messes they’re presented with, but this manual is free to recommend ways to avoid confusion. The Delaware Chancery Court has acknowledged as much, noting “the difference between the roles served by courts and judges, on the one hand, and commentators like Adams, on the other.”   GRT, Inc. v. Marathon   GTF   Technology,   Ltd. ,   No.   CIV.A.   5571-CS,   2011   WL 2682898, at *14 n.79 (Del. Ch. 11 July 2011). So although some lawyers will continue to claim that “tested” contract language is safer than expressing meaning clearly, it’s a lazy platitude.  The Dead Hand of Inertia  The arguments that traditional language “works” and that it has been “tested” are advanced by those who seem disinclined to do the hard work   of   considering,   usage   by   usage,   what   is   clearest   and   most concise. Instead, it seems likely that what motivates these objections is a basic urge: inertia. People are wary of creative thinking, preferring instead to tackle a task by using what they already know, even if the result is inferior. This instinct is universal: you can find examples in medicine, in sports,   and   in   cooking.   Because   contract   drafting   is   inherently precedent-driven, it’s particularly prone to inertia. (For more on the role of inertia in contract drafting, see the “Inertia” category of the Adams   on   Contract   Drafting   blog, http://www.adamsdrafting.com/category/inertia/.) Even in debate over individual usages, one can attribute to inertia the way some commentators invoke obscurantist rationalizations to explain confusing terminology. Inertia can operate through several mechanisms. One is “learned helplessness”—if you copy-and-paste traditional contract language for long enough, you might find it difficult to accept that there’s an",
  "alternative.   Another   is   “cognitive   dissonance”—if   you   have   no alternative   to   copy-and-pasting,   that   could   lead   you   to   idealize traditional contract language. A third is peer pressure—you see the merit   of   a   modern   alternative   to   a   traditional   usage,   but   you’re reluctant to draw attention to yourself by making the change. And a fourth could be described as the no-smoke-without-fire school of contract interpretation—the notion that if enough people who work with contracts ascribe to a particular view, that view must have merit.  Underestimating Complexity  Another   factor   impeding   change   is   that   many   lawyers   aren’t equipped to assess the quality of contract drafting. The delusion that one drafts well is easy to catch and hard to shake, particularly in the absence   of   proper   training,   rigorous   guidelines,   and   a   critical readership. If more attention has been paid to litigation writing than to writing contracts clearly, it’s likely because litigators write for an outside audience—judges. Unless a problem arises, a contract’s only readers are likely to be the lawyers who drafted and negotiated it and, to a greater or lesser extent, their clients. Usually that’s not a critical readership. Even those inclined to improve contracts underestimate what’s involved. For example, law firms often assign the task of preparing templates to those who are perhaps least qualified for the task— junior lawyers with time on their hands. And some company lawyers newly converted to the cause of “plain English” contracts assume that all that’s required is common sense and a copy of   Plain English for Lawyers   from law school. Lawyers are also prone to assuming that they can figure out the implications of individual usages based on their own understanding —usually   limited—of   English   and   what   sounds   right.   But   in contracts, where the stakes are often high and prose can be subjected to extraordinary scrutiny, things are not always as they seem. To get a sense of that, you only have to skim chapter 11 (Ambiguity of the Part Versus the Whole).",
  "Judges share this overconfidence: you will find in this manual many examples of judges considering the implications of a contract usage   and   reaching   a   conclusion   that   make   no   sense.   Although courts mostly don’t accept expert testimony on ambiguity, except as to technical terms, courts would benefit from admitting testimony of experts in contract language.  Legalistic Hairsplitting  And it doesn’t help to bring to contract drafting and interpretation a hairsplitting legalistic mindset. If you read into contract usages a meaning that isn’t established or that’s at odds with how the English language works, you confuse matters and risk straying into nonsense. Three   prime   examples   of   that   are   legalistic   interpretations   of  represents and warrants   (see 3.374),   efforts   standards (see 8.15), and  indemnify and hold harmless   (see 13.419).  CHANGE AT THE LEVEL OF THE INDIVIDUAL The Other Side’s Draft  Using a manual of style when considering a draft contract involves selling change. What that requires depends on which side prepared the draft. If   you’re   reviewing   the   other   side’s   draft,   a   certain   etiquette applies. Your task isn’t to turn their draft into a thing of beauty. You look only for whatever doesn’t reflect the deal as you understand it and   whatever   could   create   confusion.   You   give   a   pass   to   those features of traditional contract language that don’t make sense but aren’t confusing. Examples include use of a traditional recital of consideration (see 2.166), benign overuse of   shall   (see 3.85), and archaisms in the front and back of the contract. Asking the other side to change such things risks needlessly antagonizing them. Features that are worth flagging include anything that should be a condition   that’s   instead   expressed   as   an   obligation   (see   3.359), inherently   confusing   usages   (for   example,   indemnify   and   hold harmless ; see 13.419), and instances of ambiguity. If they’ve caused disputes,   it’s   worth   flagging   even   seemingly   minor   glitches,   for",
  "example throat-clearing verb structures (see 3.25) and use of   may   in restrictive relative clauses (see 3.459). If whoever prepared the other side’s draft is a traditionalist, you might have to explain to them what prompted you to request a change.   Citing   this   manual   might   facilitate   that   discussion   by demonstrating   that   your   proposed   change   is   based   on   an internationally recognized set of guidelines.  Your Draft  If you’re drafting, the first bit of selling you might have to do is to someone   senior   to   you   at   your   organization.   Assess   their expectations. Are they a traditionalist? If so, are they open-minded? You might mention this manual to them and see whether that starts a conversation. If they’re not receptive to modern drafting, then give them what they expect, making strategic concessions on usages that don’t   affect   meaning   but   being   gently   persistent   if   something matters. Then there’s the task of selling a clear and modern draft to those on the other side of the transaction. It shouldn’t be an ordeal. With only a few exceptions, contract language that complies with the recommendations in this manual doesn’t draw attention to itself. It simply   eliminates   the   stumbling   blocks,   the   repetition,   the redundancy,   the   obscure   legalisms,   the   archaisms,   and   the inconsistencies. What’s left is the deal, which is what readers will focus on. That means you might not get a pat on the back for your drafting prowess, but readers will get to the substance with less delay and   confusion,   so   your   job   will   be   easier.   That   should   be sufficient reward. But contract drafting is a precedent-driven part of a notoriously conservative   profession,   so   you   shouldn’t   be   surprised   if   you encounter resistance. People are prone to attacking what they don’t understand, so to limit pushback consider explaining to the other side in advance what’s behind the usages in your draft. That could be accomplished by this email cover note: The language used in the attached draft complies with the recommendations in Kenneth A. Adams,   A Manual of Style",
  "for Contract Drafting   (ABA 4th ed. 2017). That book recommends replacing many traditional drafting usages with clearer alternatives, so some usages you see routinely might be absent from this draft. Please don’t ask that traditional usages be added to this draft unless that would make the contract clearer or would better reflect what the parties have agreed on. And please check what   A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting   has to say about any usage you’re inclined to add to this draft. It might be problematic in ways you hadn’t considered. It’s in the interests of both sides not to spend time making, or even discussing, changes that are unrelated to the deal and changes that risk creating confusion or making the contract harder to read. Any   pushback   is   likely   to   be   in   proportion   to   the   bargaining leverage the other side feels it has. Your resistance to the pushback would presumably depend on the circumstances. If it’s a one-off deal, you might be willing to indulge the other side by making changes that pointlessly add traditional usages. You   might   react   differently   if   the   draft   is   one   of   your   core commercial templates, as the whole point of templates is to limit the changes you make from deal to deal. Consider taking a firm stance even when it comes to, say, your use of a lowercase   a   in   this agreement  (see 2.125). Although it’s a usage that has no deal significance and tends to befuddle traditionalists, little is gained by throwing it to the wolves. Anyone who is so dogmatic as to get worked up about   this agreement   is likely to have a problem with other modern usages, so you’re likely to find yourself discussing those usages too. Using   this agreement   could actually work to your advantage, as it offers a convenient way to set ground rules for negotiations over contract   wording.   It   appears   early   in   the   contract,   and   the explanation for it is simple. Getting the other side to accept   this agreement   might well pave the way for their accepting other novel usages. If someone nevertheless insists on your using a capital   A ,",
  "you’ll know that you’re dealing with a reactionary who is willing to ignore the convention that you don’t meddle with the other side’s draft without good reason. It’s best to know that early on, so you can adjust. More generally, be realistic about the extent to which you as an individual can follow the recommendations in this manual. If you’re working   with   an   organization’s   traditional   templates   or   standard industry contracts, you might have little opportunity. Even if you have   control   over   your   drafting,   retooling   traditional   contract language   takes   time.   It   might   be   best   to   take   an   incremental approach, starting first with those provisions you get the most use out of, so you get a quicker return on the time invested.  CHANGE AT THE LEVEL OF THE ORGANIZATION A Style Guide as Foundation  If you want your organization’s contracts to be clear and consistent, your first step should be to adopt a style guide. Even if all contracts personnel at an organization are informed consumers of modern contract language, that doesn’t make for an efficient contract process, as too much would be at the whim of individuals with different experience, aptitudes, and training. What’s needed is centralized initiatives. The foundation for an efficient contract process is a style guide for contract usages. It’s unlikely that the drafters in an organization would independently choose the same usages, so the only way to achieve consistency would be to impose consistency through a style guide. The idea of using a style guide is catching on. A good example is how in 2015, Adobe Systems Incorporated disseminated publicly the 30-page   Adobe Legal Department Style Guide . For   an   organization   to   prepare   a   suitably   comprehensive   style guide from scratch would be challenging, considering the expertise and   time   required.   Even   30   pages   wouldn’t   cover   the   territory adequately. This manual might seem like a style guide, but it’s too lengthy and too   detailed   to   be   used   by   all   contracts   personnel   in   your",
  "organization. Instead, this manual would likely be appropriate for those who work extensively with contract language. But it’s suitable as a foundation for a style guide. That’s why the author of this manual expects to publish with the American Bar Association   a   shorter   work   entitled   Drafting   Clearer   Contracts:   A Concise Style Guide for Organizations . It makes sense for one style guide to become the accepted standard, in the manner of   The Chicago Manual of Style , which is widely used in the United States for general publishing. Time will tell if   Drafting   Clearer   Contracts   serves   that function for contract drafting.  Training and Templates  Once you have a style guide, the next step is to train your contracts personnel to draft and review contracts consistent with the style guide. But that isn’t enough. People draft contracts by copying, so if you want clear and modern contracts, you need clear and modern templates. That sounds like a lot of work, but it isn’t if you go about it sensibly. Enlist suitable contract-language expertise and, if required, subject-matter   expertise.   And   don’t   indulge   in   “drafting   by committee,” with those involved angling to include in templates their pet contract usages, usually based on whatever conventional wisdom they’ve picked up.  Surrendering Autonomy  Besides inertia, an obstacle to acceptance of this manual or use of a style guide within an organization is that lawyers generally resist efforts to standardize their work. Individual autonomy has long been an integral part of being a lawyer. In particular, it’s commonplace to hear lawyers refer to their own or   someone   else’s   drafting   “style.”   The   implication   is   that   each drafter draws on a palette of alternative yet equally valid usages. But that’s inconsistent with what’s required for optimal contract language.   (The   word   “style”   in   the   title   of   this   manual   isn’t   an endorsement of the notion of drafting styles. Instead, the title was loosely intended to invoke the ambition of   The Chicago Manual of",
  "Style .) The only criterion for judging contract prose is how clear it is. When a drafter has several alternative usages available to accomplish a drafting goal, one will generally be clearer than the others. It would make sense for all drafters to employ only the clearest usages. Even if those alternative usages are equally clear, having all the members of an organization employ the same usage would eliminate confusion   and   make   it   easier   to   move   blocks   of   text   from   one contract to another. Lawyers   should   be   willing   to   surrender   autonomy   over   the building blocks of contract language. The freedom to recycle a grab- bag   of   usages   based   on   some   combination   of   limited   research, uncertain conventional wisdom, and expediency isn’t freedom worth preserving. Just as use of standardized, high-quality brick, stone, and steel doesn’t prevent architects and builders from being creative, use of standardized contract usages doesn’t stifle creativity in articulating a transaction. Instead, it enhances creativity, because it leaves you more time to focus on substance and makes you more confident that you’re being clear and concise.  Specialization  But an efficient contract process can involve more than individual lawyers surrendering autonomy. As the heft of this manual suggests, acquiring a command of the full range of issues lurking in contract language takes time. That investment pays off, but perhaps not for everyone. In larger organizations, greater complexity generally leads to   greater   specialization—it   doesn’t   make   economic   sense   for everyone in the organization to be a specialist, and not everyone will have the aptitude. The realities of the contract-drafting process suggest that for a substantial   organization   to   achieve   high   quality   and   maximum efficiency,   what’s   required   is   not   only   standardization   but   also specialization.   For   an   organization   with   a   sufficient   volume   of contracts   requiring   customization,   specialization   can   readily   be achieved   through   automated   contract   drafting.   Information technology allows you to create contracts not by copy-and-pasting from precedent contracts but by completing an annotated online",
  "questionnaire and selecting from among the options offered. A few specialists prepare the text used in an automated system. Aside from whether an organization can achieve economies of scale   to   justify   implementing   an   automated   system   for   creating contracts, the obstacles to specialization are cultural. They’re the same as those that impede standardization, except that specialization involves   not   just   surrendering   autonomy   but   also,   for   some, relinquishing any role in contract drafting. For those organizations that can overcome those obstacles, the potential rewards are clear.  CHANGE AT THE LEVEL OF THE INDUSTRY  Just   as   within   an   organization   it   doesn’t   make   sense   to   leave individuals to draft contracts entirely as they see fit, it also doesn’t make   sense   to   have   each   company   create   its   own   templates   for standard commercial contracts. Information technology now offers alternative   ways   to   compile   contract   language,   but   each   has shortcomings. Utopians   see   potential   in   crowdsourcing,   with   individuals collaborating to create contracts that reflect collective wisdom. But nothing useful has been created using that approach. Given how complicated contracts are, and given what’s at stake, you need strong editorial   control,   but   that’s   antithetical   to   the   notion   of crowdsourcing. And it’s hard to imagine someone with appropriate expertise   volunteering   to   spearhead   a   crowdsourcing   initiative without being paid. Free online repositories of contracts have come and gone, offering little or no quality control, consistency, customization, guidance, or credibility.   And   there’s   always   the   U.S.   Securities   and   Exchange Commission’s EDGAR system. It’s free, and you get what you pay for. Some services use information technology to parse EDGAR and other repositories of contracts, displaying the different ways that contracts address particular issues. You get to see exactly what’s in the contracts, but that’s unrelated to whether a provision is drafted clearly, accurately reflects the deal or the law, or is even relevant to the user’s needs.",
  "Some vendors offer curated templates. At the bottom end of the market, they offer rubbish for free or for a nominal amount. The top end of the market offers you traditional BigLaw drafting, with all its shortcomings. Real progress would require automated templates that comply with a   style   guide   and   are   created   with   strong   editorial   control   and suitable subject-matter expertise. An example of what that might look like is a highly customized confidentiality-agreement template created by the author of this manual, using the software Contract Express.

  "THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OPTIMAL CONTRACT LANGUAGE  1.1   Form follows function. The limited function of contracts— regulating   conduct,   stating   facts,   and   allocating   risk—has implications for the nature of contract language. Treating contracts as just another form of legal writing can lead you astray.  1.2   This chapter considers the general characteristics of clear and concise contract language. It identifies principles this manual invokes in analyzing individual usages. You might find it worthwhile to revisit this chapter occasionally, just to remind yourself of the underlying principles. You can apply these principles   when   considering   usages   not   examined   in this manual.  CONTRACT LANGUAGE SHOULD BE CLEAR  1.3   Obviously, contracts should be clear, but traditional contract language is unclear in different ways.  Omit Archaisms  1.4   Traditional contract drafting is full of archaic usages. This manual   considers   many—for   example,   use   of   whereas   in recitals (see 2.143).  1.5   Inertia might explain how archaisms survive, but it’s also likely that many drafters think, at least subconsciously, that archaisms add gravitas, making it more likely that clients and",
  "others will take contracts seriously. (Occasionally some are bold enough to say so publicly.) It’s preposterous to think that despite the time and cost involved in entering into a transaction, and despite the importance to the parties of whatever goals they seek to accomplish, parties need contract archaisms to put them in an appropriate frame of mind.  1.6   Instead, archaisms create distance between the text and the reader—they tell the reader that they’re entering into an occult, counterintuitive world. If readers expect archaisms, it’s only because they’re unaware that there’s an alternative. It’s hard to imagine that once presented with a contract free of archaisms, any rational reader would miss them.  Omit Problematic Terms of Art  1.7   Contract language includes legal terms of art—words and phrases that have a specialized doctrinal meaning. They serve as shorthand for legal concepts, allowing those concepts to be articulated with a minimum of fuss.  1.8   Legal terms of art add complexity, but that can be difficult to avoid.   Contracts   are   as   complex   as   the   transactions   they embody,   and   many   transactions   are   highly   technical. Expressing   that   complexity   usually   requires   specialized terminology. Purging contracts of all that terminology can result   in   contracts   that   fail   to   articulate   the   intended meaning clearly and efficiently.  1.9   For example, it would be awkward not to use the term of art  security interest   in drafting a contract in which a party grants a security interest. Similarly, it likely would be awkward to draft a security agreement without using the noun   perfection  or the verb   perfect , both of which are terms of art relating to security interests.  1.10   But a feature of traditional contract drafting is reliance on three kinds of flawed legal terms of art, namely those that are unnecessary, those that are improvised, and those that are",
  "unduly complex. (More generally, this manual uses the word  jargon   as shorthand for unhelpful terms of art.)  UNNECESSARY   TERMS   OF   ART  1.11   Lawyers are prone to using doctrinal terms of art in contracts even   though   simpler   terminology   is   available,   rendering those terms of art unnecessary.  1.12   For example, in a security agreement, why use   hypothecate  regarding   a   security   interest?   Why   not   simply   use   grant ?  Hypothecate   means to pledge without delivery of title and possession. That meaning goes beyond the function required of the verb in language granting a security interest. And that meaning isn’t otherwise necessary, as the security agreement itself will specify what the terms of the security interest are.  Hypothecate   might have value as shorthand for court opinions or   scholarly   texts,   but   that’s   very   different   from   what’s required for a contract. Using   grant   in granting language in a security agreement wouldn’t prevent that grant from being a hypothecation, if the remainder of the granting language is consistent with that meaning. If it isn’t, using   hypothecate  instead wouldn’t fix that.  1.13   What   characterizes   an   unnecessary   term   of   art   is   a discrepancy between the meaning conveyed by the term of art and the semantic function required of it in a contract—an unnecessary term of art is a dollar word or phrase doing a nickel’s worth of work. That might lead some to assume that no other terminology could convey the same meaning. And some might assume that use of the term is by itself sufficient to   ensure   that   the   underlying   concept   applies   to   the provision   in   question,   regardless   of   what   the   provision otherwise says.  1.14   An example of the second problem is how some contend that   a   statement   of   fact   can’t   support   an   action   for misrepresentation   unless   it’s   introduced   by   the   word  represents . And that a statement of fact that uses the word",
  "represents   can’t support an action for breach of warranty. (See 3.380–.397.)  1.15   Other examples of unnecessary terms of art are   allonge   (see 13.14),   attorn   (see   13.93),   novation   (see   13.615),   and  subrogation   (see 13.752).  IMPROVISED   TERMS   OF   ART  1.16   Unnecessary terms of art arise when doctrinal terminology is shoehorned into contracts. By contrast, improvised terms of art arise when lawyers and judges seek to graft doctrinal implications onto terminology otherwise free of them.  1.17   Drafters   have   long   added   the   phrase   hold   harmless   after  indemnify , presumably for the rhetorical flourish it offers. But many lawyers and some judges haven’t been able to resist the urge to claim that   hold harmless   conveys a distinct meaning (see 13.420). Similarly, in everyday English the phrase   best efforts   serves a specific rhetorical function, but many lawyers and   some   judges   ignore   that   and   instead   invent   baseless distinctions in the various flavors of   efforts   standards (see chapter 8).  1.18   The urge to improvise terms of art arises from the rule of interpretation that every word in a provision should be given effect.   Applied   zealously,   that   rule   requires   attributing significance to every stray word or phrase in a contract and to every variation in terminology, even if they can be explained as a rhetorical device.  UNDULY   COMPLEX   TERMS   OF   ART  1.19   A third category of problematic terms of art consists of those with a meaning that’s fairly well established but that’s also sufficiently   complex   that   drafters   are   quick   to   use   them without fully appreciating the implications. Three examples are   consequential damages   (see 13.161),   coupled with an interest  (see 13.199), and   time is of the essence   (see 13.829). The result of using an unduly complex term of art might be that the",
  "provision   in   question   is   held   unenforceable   or   has unanticipated consequences.  REPLACING   TERMS   OF   ART  1.20   Contracts would be clearer if instead of using terms of art that fall into the three categories described above, drafters were to use straightforward alternatives.  1.21   But replacing a particular term of art might not be feasible— doing so might prompt too much fruitless debate. The notion of replacing a term of art can seem shockingly novel—for example, using   states   instead of   represents and warrants   (see 3.416). You must weigh the risks of confusion against the transaction costs of change.  1.22   One way to facilitate change would be to not only use the term of art but also explain what it means. For examples of such   explanations,   see   13.208–.209   regarding   the   phrase  coupled   with   an   interest   and   13.616   regarding   the   term  novation .  1.23   Another way to facilitate change would be to use the term of art in a section heading and use the clearer alternative in the section text. For examples, see 13.95, 13.890. That approach could conceivably violate an internal rule of interpretation stating that headings are for convenience only, but that rule of interpretation is of little use (see 15.17).  1.24   But replacing some terms of art would likely pass unnoticed. See, for example, 13.887–.888 regarding an alternative to the verb   warrant .  1.25   Replacing terms of art not only makes life easier for the reader, it can also help the drafter realize that although terms of art might suggest professionalism, problematic terms of art distract from articulating the deal effectively.  1.26   If you’re contemplating replacing a term of art, first check whether courts attribute significance to use of that term in a contract, as opposed to alternative ways of expressing the",
  "same meaning. Sensibly, U.S. courts tend not to insist on specific wording.  TERMS   OF   ART   IN   LANGUAGES   OTHER   THAN   ENGLISH  1.27   If an English-language contract is governed by the law of a jurisdiction   where   court   proceedings   are   conducted   in   a language other than English, and if that contract contains terms   of   art,   translating   those   terms   of   art   can   have unpredictable   consequences.   If   someone   translates,   say,   a Dutch term of art into English when drafting the contract, what might happen during dispute-resolution proceedings is that   the   court   translates   the   English   version   back   into something other than the original Dutch term of art. To avoid that sort of mishap, it would be prudent to include the non-English original after the English translation, in italics and in parentheses. An example: “This agreement constitutes an assignment agreement ( overeenkomst van opdracht ) under the Dutch Civil Code.”  Use Standard English  1.28   Eliminating   archaisms   and   terms   of   art   goes   a   long   way toward turning traditional contract prose into a specialized version of standard English—the English used by educated native English speakers. That’s what you should aim for.  1.29   This   manual   doesn’t   use   the   terms   plain English   or   plain language . Because those terms first came to public attention in connection with simplifying consumer documents, they can be understood, or misunderstood, as applying only to the simplified language required of consumer contracts. Here’s an example of that from Charles M. Fox,   Working with Contracts: What Law School Doesn’t Teach You   73 (2d ed. 2008):  The audience for commercial contracts is sophisticated business people and their lawyers. The notion that complex commercial contracts should be written in plain English, so as to be understood by people who would never be expected to read",
  "them is an unreasonable extension of the plain English movement.  1.30   That misses the point. No commentator favors “dumbing down”   business   contracts   to   make   them   as   accessible   as documents   intended   to   be   read   by   consumers—a misconceived   notion,   because   a   contract   is   necessarily   as complex as the transaction it embodies. Instead, the idea is that by using standard English, a drafter can articulate a transaction   without   recourse   to   usages   that   interfere gratuitously with the ability of the reader to understand the contract. Whether they’re aware of it or not, lawyers, clients, and anyone else who must read a business contract would benefit if it were written in standard English.  1.31   And you can dismiss the notion that you must stick with traditional contract language because it “works” or has been “tested.” See p. xxxvii  1.32   Furthermore, don’t assume that the meaning given a word or phrase for logic rules will apply to contracts. Instead, you can expect the standard English interpretation to prevail. Two examples are   or   (see 11.56) and   if and only if   (see 1.59).  CONTRACT LANGUAGE SHOULD BE PRECISE  1.33   Traditionalists maintain that traditional contract legalese is precise. It isn’t, as this manual amply demonstrates.  1.34   Real precision makes it harder for a disgruntled contract party to claim, or for a judge to find, a meaning that the drafter hadn’t intended. For example, real precision allows drafters to distinguish between conditions and obligations (see 3.356–.362)   and   to   eliminate   potentially   mischievous alternative   meanings   associated   with   and   and   or   (see 11.21–.85). The enemy of precision is uncertain meaning. Chapter 7 discusses the sources of uncertain meaning.  1.35   It’s easy to denigrate precision. “Wordsmithing” is a term that’s popular among red-meat-eating deal makers. It refers to",
  "minions   figuring   out,   away   from   negotiations,   how   to express a deal point. It’s also used dismissively of someone whose supposed pedanticism is hindering the deal. Either way,   the   term   “wordsmithing”   suggests   that   once   parties agree on a deal point, expressing it is a formality.  1.36   Instead,   it’s   routine   for   nuances   in   wording   to   cause disputes. That’s because the deal is what the contract says it is, not some abstraction—how the drafter articulates a deal provision determines its meaning. Precise contract language should be a priority, not an afterthought.  CONTRACT LANGUAGE SHOULD OMIT REDUNDANCY  1.37   Redundancy is a hallmark of traditional contract legalese, but it’s pernicious—it adds unnecessary words and can create confusion. It comes in different forms.  Limit the Use of Strings  1.38   Lawyers have long strung together words, and rare is the contract that doesn’t include strings of two, three, or more synonyms or near-synonyms. (Pairs of words are “couplets” and groups of three are “triplets.”)  1.39   Some   strings,   for   example   goods   and   chattels,   presumably reflect that in medieval England the primary language of legal expression gradually shifted from Latin to French to English. Rather than rely on just one language to express a concept, scribes were in the habit of using words from two or three languages.  1.40   But because of its rhythmical appeal, lexical doubling has been with us since the dawn of English. And it has been too long   entrenched   in   legal   language   to   be   explained   by   a narrow historical circumstance. Contract drafters continually improvise new strings, such as the requirement in a share purchase agreement that Smith   sell, convey, assign, transfer, and deliver   the shares to Jones.",
  "1.41   Presumably one attraction of strings is that they add pomp to contract prose. Strings also appeal to risk-averse lawyers, allowing them to finesse the often-tricky task of selecting the best word.  1.42   But strings are problematic in three respects. First, if one of the words expresses the intended meaning, the others are extraneous—at best, they simply clog up the works.  1.43   Second,   courts   routinely   invoke   the   principle   that   in interpreting legal documents, every word should be given meaning and nothing should be treated as superfluous. That explains litigation over the meaning of, for example, the phrase   indemnify and hold harmless   (see 13.422–.425). Don’t be surprised if a court attributes unanticipated meaning to an element in a string.  1.44   And third, a drafter might use a string more than once in a contract, with minor but potentially mischievous variants. For   example,   if   one   provision   refers   to   losses,   liabilities, damages,   and   claims   and   another   to   losses,   liabilities,   and damages,   a party to a dispute might try to convince a court that omission of   claims   from the second string is significant.  1.45   You can safely prune many traditional synonym strings, as the extra words are surplusage. This manual considers several such strings, including   books and records   (see 13.119) and   costs and expenses   (see 13.196).  1.46   Don’t rely on strings incorporating overly subtle distinctions if you can express the intended meaning more clearly using a different approach. For example, see 13.37 regarding devising clearer alternatives to   arising out of or relating to .  1.47   As for improvised strings, consider the example mentioned in 1.40—a requirement in a share purchase agreement that Smith   sell, convey, assign, transfer, and deliver   the shares to Jones.   Just   as   purchase   would   be   adequate   to   reflect   the transaction from the perspective of Jones, Smith can simply sell the shares.   Convey, assign,   and   transfer   reflect concepts",
  "implicit in a sale. Address in a section on closing procedures whatever   deliver   covers.  1.48   Similarly, instead of saying that Acme   grants, assigns, conveys, mortgages,   pledges,   hypothecates,   and   transfers   a   security interest, saying just   grants   should be sufficient. But instead of picking one word in a string, consider whether an alternative approach would allow you to convey the intended meaning more   clearly.   Compare   the   string   in   italics   in   the   first example below with the language in italics in the second example. The intended scope of the first might be broader than that expressed in the second, but it would be clearer to express any broader meaning by referring explicitly in the second to any relevant contexts instead of stringing together legal functions.  ... except that the Employee may transfer the Employee’s rights under this agreement to the Employee’s   personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees.  ... except that the Employee’s rights under this agreement may be transferred   by will or intestate succession.  1.49   Strings can arise in autonomous definitions, as risk-averse drafters are prone to adding every conceivable example of the thing being defined:  “ Permit ” means any consent, authorization, registration, filing, lodgment, permit, franchise, agreement, notarization, certificate, permission, license, approval, direction, declaration, authority, or exemption ... .  1.50   In such contexts, consider using instead the phrase   however referred to , to make it clear that the definition refers to a concept—in this case, anything that could be described as a permit, regardless of the word used to describe it:  “ Permit ” means a permit, however referred to, ... .  1.51   But   strings   are   sometimes   necessary   to   ensure   that   a provision covers the universe of possibilities. For example, a",
  "seller might state in a share purchase agreement that the shares are free of any   lien, community property interest, equitable interest, option, pledge, security interest, or right of first refusal . This string might include redundancy, but don’t eliminate every element except, say,   lien   unless you’re confident that  lien   covers the other terms.  1.52   So   consider   every   component   of   a   synonym   string   to determine whether it conveys a meaning that is distinct, and helpfully so, from the meaning of each other component. If you use a string more than once, use identical wording each time or replace it with a defined term (see 6.2).  Reject Needless Elaboration  1.53   Contract provisions often refer not only to a general term but also to its constituent components, even though the scope   of   the   general   term   is   clear.   This   manual   uses   the phrase   needless elaboration   to describe this phenomenon. It’s equivalent to saying, “I don’t eat fish, whether freshwater or saltwater,” instead of just saying, “I don’t eat fish,” which conveys the same meaning.  1.54   A contract example of needless elaboration is stating that a party is releasing   all claims whether at law or in equity . Saying instead   all claims   would be just as comprehensive and would use fewer words. (Besides, for U.S. contracts, such references have a musty air to them, as most states have abolished the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity.)  1.55   Needless elaboration sometimes occurs when a provision lists elements of the general term before the general term, as in   all taxes imposed by any federal ,   state, or local governmental body . Referring simply to any   governmental body   would be not only more   concise   but   also   more   comprehensive,   in   that   a jurisdiction   might   have   a   level   of   government   better described by a term other than   federal ,   state , or   local .",
  "1.56   Needless elaboration also occurs when drafters use a general term and list examples of items that obviously fall within that   general   term,   with   the   list   either   coming   after   the general term (and usually introduced by   including ) or coming before the general term. For a discussion of the confusion that can cause, see 13.354–.386.  CONTRACT LANGUAGE SHOULDN’T SEEK TO EXPLAIN, TELL A STORY, OR PERSUADE  1.57   Because contracts serve only to regulate conduct, state facts, and allocate risk, drafters should be cautious about using words   associated   primarily   with   expository,   narrative,   or persuasive   prose—words   such   as   therefore ,   because   (see 13.110), and   furthermore .  1.58   Don’t   add   rhetorical   emphasis   to   provisions   that   already express the desired meaning. Rhetorical emphasis consists of words and phrases that serve only to say, “and we really mean it!” It adds unnecessary words, doesn’t affect meaning, and quickly becomes grating.  1.59   The fix for rhetorical emphasis is deleting it or replacing it with something else. Below is a list of words and phrases used for rhetorical emphasis, and after each is an example using that word or phrase. In three examples ( at no time ,   if and only if , and   under no circumstances )   a   suggested   replacement   is noted in brackets; in the other examples, you would simply delete the rhetorical emphasis.  absolutely : The Lessee must   absolutely   refrain from performing actions involving cooking and/or frying in the Leased Property ... .  at no time : The Escrow Agent shall   at no time   [read not] acquire any ownership interest in the Offering Proceeds.  completely : ... the Executive shall keep the terms of this agreement   completely   confidential ... .  fully : The Consultant is wholly and   fully   responsible for any taxes",
  "owed to any governmental authority ... .  if and only if : This agreement will become effective   if and only if  [read   only if ] Acme issues the Shares before the Termination Date.  in all respects : This agreement is   in all respects   governed by Minnesota law.  in any manner : No benefit payable under the Plan is subject   in any manner   whatsoever to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, or encumbrance of any kind.  in any way : ... none of the Buyer Indemnitees will be liable   in any way   for any injury, loss, or damage arising out of any such entry that occurs to Seller or any of Seller’s representatives under this agreement.  it is emphasized that :   It is emphasized that   the designer of the unit is not entitled to design or change anything outside the bounds of the unit.  of any kind : No benefit payable under the Plan is subject in any manner whatsoever to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, or encumbrance   of any kind .  strictly : The Company guarantees payment of the Guaranteed Obligations   strictly   in accordance with the terms of this agreement and the Notes.  under no circumstances : The Depositary will   under no circumstances   [read   not ] be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential, or punitive damages.  whatsoever : No Lender has any right of action   whatsoever  against the Administrative Agent.  wholly : The Consultant is   wholly   and fully responsible for any taxes owed to any governmental authority ... .  1.60   Some of these words and phrases can be combined, as in  wholly and fully   and   in any manner whatsoever . A word or phrase can constitute rhetorical emphasis in one context and",
  "serve a different function—legitimate or not so legitimate—in a different context.  1.61   Don’t use typography for rhetorical emphasis (see 16.36).  CONTRACT LANGUAGE SHOULD OMIT REPETITION  1.62   A   drafter   should   never   say   the   same   thing   twice   in   a contract, whether it’s a party’s address (see 2.72), a number (see 14.1–.19), or anything else. Repetition not only adds unnecessary words, it also invites dispute. Redundancy (see 1.37) differs from repetition, in that redundancy involves surplusage   in   saying   something   as   opposed   to   saying something twice.  CONTRACT LANGUAGE SHOULD EMPLOY USAGES CONSISTENTLY  1.63   Usages should be consistent, to avoid having unintended meaning attributed to inconsistent usages.  1.64   Within a contract, don’t use the same word or phrase to convey   different   meanings—that   might   create   confusion about which meaning you intend in any one context. In traditional drafting, the word most abused in that regard is  shall   (see 3.80). And don’t use two or more different words or phrases to convey the same meaning: readers (and judges) might assume that differences in wording are intended to convey differences in meaning.  1.65   Any organization would benefit if all its contracts were to draw from the same set of usages—ideally, the consistency in language and layout of a company’s or a law firm’s contracts would make it impossible to determine which individual had drafted what.  1.66   See   the   introduction   for   advice   on   how   to   overcome obstacles to consistency and how to use this manual (or a style guide based on it) to achieve consistency.",
  "THE FRONT OF THE CONTRACT  2.1   It’s standard for a contract to consist of the front of the contract,   the   body   of   the   contract—what   the   parties   are agreeing to—and the back of the contract. The front consists of the title, the introductory clause, any recitals, and the lead-in. In longer contracts, it might include one or more of a cover sheet, a table of contents, and an index of definitions. (Regarding “frontloading”—the practice of pulling selected provisions out of the body of a commercial contract and placing them at the top of the contract—see 4.91.)  THE TITLE  2.2   The title of a contract is generally placed at the top center of the first page, in all capital letters (see sample 1). (If design considerations are important, you could use instead, or in addition, another form of emphasis or a different typeface or point size; see 16.55.) The title should simply state, without a definite or indefinite article, the kind of agreement involved, as in   EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT   and   OPTION AGREEMENT .  SAMPLE 1   TITLE AND INTRODUCTORY CLAUSE",
  "2.3   Be concise. Don’t use a title that looks at a transaction from different   perspectives.   For   example,   don’t   use   as   a   title  AGREEMENT   OF   PURCHASE   AND   SALE —every   purchase entails a sale, so say either   PURCHASE AGREEMENT   or   SALE AGREEMENT   (omitting the unnecessary   of   in the process). Which you choose would presumably be a function of which side you represent.  2.4   And resist the urge to cram several elements of a transaction into   the   title:   LICENSE,   SUPPLY,   MARKETING,   AND DISTRIBUTION   AGREEMENT .   Consider   using   instead   a broader,   conceptual   title,   perhaps   one   that   reflects   the business goal.  2.5   Don’t be too concise. Giving a contract the title   PURCHASE AGREEMENT   leaves the reader wondering what’s being sold. Consider   using   a   more   informative   title,   such   as   ASSET PURCHASE   AGREEMENT   or   SECURITIES   PURCHASE AGREEMENT . Don’t use just   AGREEMENT   unless you really can’t come up with a more informative title, perhaps because the contract is unusual or because the deal consists of a grab bag of different elements.  2.6   Don’t include party names in the title. The reader will figure out quickly enough that Acme is a party without your calling the contract   ACME SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT .  2.7   Don’t use jargon in the title. As the title for an agreement between   shareholders,   BUY-SELL   AGREEMENT   is   not   only repetitive   in   the   manner   described   in   2.3   but   also uninformative. Use instead   SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT   or some variant. (Regarding the title to use for an agreement between shareholders, see 13.726.)  2.8   If you can give a contract a standard title, do so—contract drafting doesn’t prize variety for its own sake.  2.9   Don’t feel you must track the terminology of state statutes. For example, statutes in Delaware, Nevada, New York, and some   other   states   use   the   term   plan   of   merger ,   meaning",
  "essentially a document that states the terms of a merger. So it’s commonplace for drafters to give merger agreements a title that includes the phrase   plan of merger . But if you were to file in Delaware a certificate of merger that is accompanied by, or refers to, a merger agreement bearing the title   MERGER AGREEMENT   rather than the more cumbersome   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER,   the office of the Delaware secretary of state wouldn’t reject the certificate of merger for using improper terminology—they’re sensibly of the view that if a merger agreement contains the information that the statute requires of a plan of merger, the title is irrelevant. The same applies to articles of merger filed in Nevada and a certificate of merger filed in New York, and it’s likely that other states are equally sensible.  2.10   Similarly, don’t let use of the term “plan of exchange” in state statutes governing share exchanges dissuade you from using the title   SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT   rather than  SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF EXCHANGE  or a variant.  2.11   Most contracts use the word   agreement   in the title rather than  contract , perhaps because   agreement   sounds more genteel than  contract ,   with   its   two   /k/   sounds.   But   contract   is unobjectionable. The word   agreement   has a broader meaning than does the word   contract , in that   agreement   can refer to an informal arrangement, but it’s clear that’s not the intended meaning when   agreement   is used in the title of a contract.  2.12   Some   contracts   use   something   other   than   agreement   or  contract   in the title. A lease is a contract. So is an insurance policy.   And   by   tradition,   contracts   stating   the   terms   of bonds, debentures, or trusts often use the term   indenture   (see 13.442).  2.13   If a company routinely enters into a kind of contract, it might want to supplement the title, for example by adding additional information in parentheses immediately below the title. For example, it might be helpful to specify beneath the",
  "title   TRADEMARK LICENSE AGREEMENT   which mark is being licensed,   and   in   which   territory.   (Alternatively,   such information could be frontloaded; see 4.91.)  2.14   Regarding the title to give amendments or amended and restated contracts, see 18.5.  THE INTRODUCTORY CLAUSE  2.15   After the title comes the introductory clause, which states the   type   of   agreement   involved,   perhaps   the   date   of   the agreement (depending on the circumstances), and the parties to the agreement (see sample 1).  Know All Men by These Presents  2.16   Occasionally the introductory clause is itself introduced by the egregiously archaic   know all men by these presents , usually in   all   capitals.   It’s   a   stodgy   translation   of   the   Latinism  noverint universi , meaning “know all persons.” It means, in effect, “take notice,” and as such it serves no purpose other than to mark the drafter as someone in thrall to the archaic.  Format  2.17   The introductory clause in sample 1 is formatted as a single paragraph; that’s the general practice in the United States.  2.18   The elements of the introductory clause could instead be broken   up,   or   “tabulated,”   so   that   each   stands   by   itself. (Regarding tabulation of enumerated clauses, see 4.41.) In England and other Commonwealth nations, the preference is for tabulating the introductory clause, with some drafters also giving headings, such as   DATE   and   PARTIES ,   to   the different components. (That’s consistent with the approach to   document   design   for   contracts   in   those   countries;   see 4.73.)   This   manual   doesn’t   recommend   tabulating   the introductory clause, as doing so results in the introductory clause taking up more space without making it appreciably",
  "easier to read. But it can make sense to tabulate if the number of   parties   and   the   information   to   be   included   would otherwise make the introductory clause bulky.  Reference to the Type of Agreement  2.19   Begin the introductory clause with   This , then repeat the type of   agreement   stated   in   the   title.   Thereafter,   use   just   this agreement   (see 2.124). Using instead just   agreement   in   the introductory   clause   would   be   unobjectionable,   but   this manual recommends using the full reference, so it appears once   in   the   text   of   the   contract.   And   beginning   the introductory   clause   with   This   helps   make   it   a   complete sentence, so it’s easier to read than would otherwise be the case.  2.20   Use   all   lowercase   letters   for   the   introductory   clause’s reference to the type of agreement. It would be distracting to emphasize it with all capital letters, as the title is in all capital letters (see 2.2). Don’t use initial capitals in this reference or any other reference to a particular contract: a reference to a contract shouldn’t be treated like the title of a book or movie. The   words   merger   agreement   in   a   reference   to   the   merger agreement dated 22 October 2016 between Acme and Dynaco   are no more deserving of initial capitals than is the word   book   in  Here’s the book Aunt Mildred gave me .  2.21   Using initial capitals in a reference to an agreement would be appropriate if it were a defined term—if, for example,   the merger   agreement   dated   22   October   2016   between   Acme   and Dynaco   were given the defined term   the Merger Agreement . But the introductory-clause reference to the type of agreement involved   isn’t   a   defined   term.   And   it   shouldn’t   be   the definition of a defined term either (see 2.124).  What Verb to Use  2.22   To be a sentence, the introductory clause needs a verb. Use   is dated,   because it’s simpler and clearer than   is made   and   is",
  "entered   into   and   the   couplet   is   made   and   entered   into.  (Regarding couplets, see 1.38.)  Date  WHETHER   TO   INCLUDE  2.23   Date a contract by stating the date in the introductory clause or by providing for those signing the contract to date their signatures. If signatures are to be dated, have the contract state that it will be effective when the last party signs (see 5.5–.7).  2.24   Stating the date in the introductory clause is the more usual way of dating a contract, but dating the signatures makes sense in three contexts.  2.25   First, although it’s commonplace for one or more parties to sign a contract on a date other than the date stated in the introductory clause (see 2.33), that could be confusing if the discrepancy were more than a few days (see 2.36).  2.26   Second, for compliance purposes a company might use dated signatures in some or all of its contracts to preclude use of an introductory-clause date that is other than the date the last party signed. For example, a company or its outside auditors might require that all the company’s sales contracts include dated signatures, the aim being to ensure that revenue is recognized in the appropriate quarter. Someone signing a contract   could   intentionally   use   an   incorrect   date   when stating the date of their signature, but that would likely be riskier than disingenuously relying on a misleading date in the introductory clause.  2.27   And third, if your contracts are signed electronically (see 5.68), each signature would automatically be dated.  2.28   Don’t include a date in the introductory clause   and   date the signatures:   using   two   ways   to   date   a   contract   would   be confusing. If you date the signatures but appreciate the ease of having a date to refer to on the first page of the contract,",
  "consider stamping at the top of the contract the date of the agreement. An alternative would be to place the signature blocks on the first page (see 4.96).  2.29   If you provide for dated signatures, you could conceivably allude to that in the introductory clause. But doing so in a way that articulates clearly the significance of signature dates would clog up the introductory clause. Instead, address in the boilerplate the implications of signature dates (see 5.6).  FUNCTION  2.30   The date stated in the introductory clause is presumed to be the date that the parties signed it, and by extension it’s the date that the contract is effective, unless evidence ultimately indicates otherwise. Nothing is gained by defining the date in the introductory clause as   the Effective Date —it’s simpler to refer throughout the contract to   the date of this agreement . (See also 2.41.)  FORMAT  2.31   To state dates, this manual uses the format   1 January 2018 . Consider using that format yourself (see 10.8–.11).  2.32   Don’t use the format   this 24th day of October, 2017,   which is archaic and long-winded. Don’t use two digits to state the day component of a date, as in   01   November 2017 . And don’t use purely numerical dates, as in   10/9/17 , because they’re not appropriate in formal writing and can cause confusion, given the different international conventions for expressing dates numerically.  DIFFERENT   FROM   DATE   OF   SIGNING   DUE   TO   SIGNING   LOGISTICS  2.33   The introductory-clause date is notionally the date that the contract was signed by the parties, but often one or more parties sign the contract before or after that date.  2.34   This   timing   discrepancy   is   often   due   to   logistics.   For example, if the closing date for a transaction slips by a day or",
  "two from the scheduled date, the parties might agree that it’s not worth changing the date in each of the deal documents, or that it wouldn’t be feasible to do so. And a party to a contract might not get around to signing it until a day or two after the date in the introductory clause, or might find it more convenient to sign it a day or two before the date in the introductory clause.  2.35   A conventional way of reflecting that one or more parties signed a contract on a date other than the date stated in the introductory clause is to make the introductory-clause date an   as   of   date.   But   this   manual   doesn’t   recommend   that practice, because it’s simply a loose professional courtesy. Drafters observe it haphazardly, in that some always use   as of  dates, regardless of when the contract is being signed, and others never use them. If the date a contract was actually signed were to become an issue, it’s unlikely that using or failing to use an   as of   date would be dispositive. Because using   as   of   serves   no   useful   purpose,   omitting   it   would remove   unnecessary   words   and   a   potential   source   of confusion.  2.36   If it might take more than a few days for all the parties to sign a contract, don’t include a date in the introductory clause. Instead, have the parties date their signatures (see 5.5–.7). Using as the date in the introductory clause the date the contract was distributed or the date the first party signed it would be misleading, because a contract isn’t effective until all parties have signed it. You could conceivably use a blank date in the introductory clause, intending to add a date once all the parties had signed, but that would invite confusion.  DIFFERENT   FROM   DATE   OF   SIGNING   DUE   TO   TIMING   OF   PERFORMANCE  2.37   The   traditional   conventions   for   addressing   a   discrepancy between the date of signing and the timing of performance are problematic.",
  "2.38   Drafters sometimes use in the introductory clause a date other than the date of signing if the contract provides for an arrangement that won’t come into effect until after the date of signing. For example, Acme and Jones might sign Jones’s employment agreement on 1 March even though Jones won’t start working for Acme until two months later, on 1 May. A drafter might address this by using Jones’s start date as the date in the introductory clause, in addition to or instead of the date of signing. To signal that it’s not the date of signing, a drafter might describe that date as an   as of   date (see 2.35) or as   the effective date   (see 2.30) or might use the phrase   dated for reference   or   dated   for   reference   purposes   only   (primarily Canadian usages) .  2.39   To capture past performance, drafters sometimes use in the introductory clause a date earlier than the date of signing, in addition to or instead of the date of signing. For example, in commercial   contexts   it’s   commonplace   for   the   parties   to reach   an   informal   oral   or   written   understanding   on   the terms, then start the process of reflecting those terms in a contract. Due to deal complexity or need for approvals, that process can be protracted, leading the parties to agree that one or both sides will start performing before the contract has been signed. Once it has been signed, the parties might use in the introductory clause the date performance started or some earlier date, to tidy up history. To indicate that the date used in the introductory clause isn’t the date of signing, a drafter might use one of the signals noted in 2.38.  2.40   But it would be misleading to use in the introductory clause a date in the future to reflect delayed performance (see 2.38) or a date in the past to encompass precontract performance (see 2.39) or other circumstances, because the contract would come into existence once the parties had signed it (see 2.30). Such   dating   also   obscures   the   actual   time   frame   of   the transaction.  2.41   In such situations, it would be clearer to use instead in the introductory clause the date of signing and to address other",
  "timing considerations wherever makes most sense.  2.42   For example, on 15 February Acme and Widgetco propose entering   into   a   contract   that   provides   for   Acme   to   pay royalties   to   Widgetco   based   on   annual   sales,   and   the arrangement is that Acme will pay royalties for that year based on sales for the entire year, not just from 15 February. The drafter might be tempted to use 1 January of that year as the   date   in   the   introductory   clause,   using   the   signals described in 2.38 to convey that it’s not the date of signing. It would be clearer instead to use in the introductory clause the date of signing and state in the provisions governing royalties that the first year’s royalties are based on sales for the entire year.  2.43   Regarding precontract performance, note it in the recitals, address in the payment provisions any payment required for precontract performance, and state somewhere in the body of the contract that precontract performance is governed by the contract.   The   date   the   parties   reached   an   informal understanding on the terms might be important, but that’s different from the date the parties entered into a contract. If stating clearly what actually happened presents a problem, something is amiss.  2.44   It’s clearer not to use the term   effective date   for the start date of performance, because a contract is effective when it has been signed by all the parties. Consider using instead a term such as   start date .  2.45   Administrative convenience isn’t sufficient reason to impose a phony timeline on a contract. If for recordkeeping purposes the date a contract was entered into is less significant than some   other   date,   you   could   make   that   other   date   more conspicuous by stamping it at the top of the signed contract.  BROADER   IMPLICATIONS  2.46   The date given a contract can have legal implications beyond performance under that contract. For example, it can affect a",
  "company’s tax exposure or someone’s rights under another contract.   Playing   games   with   the   date   of   a   contract— including by means of the date you use in the introductory clause—can give rise to civil or criminal liability.  2.47   Furthermore,   attempting   to   give   retroactive   effect   to   a contract, including by using in the introductory clause a date earlier than the date of signing, can create problems if the contract is part of a series of transactions. Consider these circumstances:   Bank   makes   a   loan   to   Acme,   then   Bank transfers the loan to Investor A. Three months later, Bank transfers the same loan to Investor B. Six months after that, Investor   A   transfers   the   loan   back   to   Bank,   effective retroactively to a date before Bank’s transfer to Investor B. If Investor B sues Acme for payment of the loan, Acme might argue that Investor B never acquired an interest in the loan, and the court might accept that argument. See   FH Partners, LLC v. Complete Home Concepts, Inc. , No. WD 74653, 2012 WL 4074530 (Mo. Ct. App. Sept. 18, 2012).  Between   Versus   Among  2.48   In   all   cases,   use   between   as   the   preposition   in   the introductory clause rather than   among   or a silly couplet (see 1.38) such as   by and between .  2.49   It’s commonly held that whereas one speaks of a contract  between   two parties, the correct preposition to use with a contract   involving   more   than   two   parties   is   among .   But according   to   The   Oxford   English   Dictionary,   it’s   not   only permissible but preferable to use   between   rather than   among  with more than two parties .   That the pointless distinction between   between   and   among   is generally accepted is a good indication of the state of traditional contract language.  2.50   But   whether   you   use   between   or   among   does   not   affect meaning or readability, so it would be unhelpful to make an issue of it. Use   between   in your drafts. If a traditionalist insists on   among   because there are more than two parties, agreeing",
  "to make that change would be a painless concession. If the other side presents you with a draft that uses   among , asking that it be changed to   between   might well antagonize them.  Identifying the Parties  2.51   In the introductory clause, identify each individual who is a party by their full name, and identify each legal-entity party by   the   full   name   under   which   it   was   registered   in   its jurisdiction of organization. Include the designation of the form of entity ( Inc., LLC, B.V.,   GmbH,   or other). If it would help to avoid confusion, refer also to any other name by which a party is known or was previously known.  2.52   Stating party names in all capitals helps them stand out. All capitals are harder to read (see 16.19), but that’s not an issue when it’s used for only a few words. Using all capitals would mask use of medial capitals—that is, use of one or more inner capital letters not preceded by a space, with the first letter either a capital (as in   HarperCollins ) or lowercase (as in   iPod ). Branding is low on the list of functions served by a contract, but if showing medial capitals in the introductory clause is important to you or a client, don’t use all capitals for party names in the introductory clause.  2.53   Don’t enumerate the parties—it serves no purpose.  2.54   When describing a party in the introductory clause, don’t tack on   including its affiliates and direct and indirect subsidiaries  or comparable language. Because affiliates and subsidiaries aren’t party to the contract and so wouldn’t be bound by any of its provisions, including them in the introductory clause would create confusion. (See 2.57 regarding having a parent company enter into a contract on behalf of an affiliate.)  2.55   For a template contract that’s used repeatedly with little or no   customization,   you   could   replace   one   or   more   party names by referring in the introductory clause to   the other",
  "party   [or   the parties ]   named in the signature blocks below . But such economy comes at the expense of readability.  The Order of the Parties  2.56   In at least some kinds of contracts in which the parties play traditional,   clearly   defined   roles,   one   can   identify   loose conventions for the order in which you place the parties in the   introductory   clause.   For   example,   in   most   one-way confidentiality agreements the disclosing party comes before the recipient; in credit agreements, the debtor almost always comes before the one or more lenders; and in mergers-and- acquisitions contracts, the seller usually comes before the buyer.   Because   such   conventions   give   rise   to   reader expectations, it’s best to abide by them.  Having a Parent Company Enter into a Contract on Behalf of an Affiliate  2.57   It’s commonplace that a member of a group of affiliated business organizations wants to contract with a supplier or licensor   on   behalf   of   itself   and   other   members   of   the corporate   group.   Such   an   arrangement   would   facilitate standardization   throughout   the   group   and   enhance   the group’s buying power while limiting transaction costs.  2.58   But such an arrangement might create problems, in that the other members of the corporate group might be third-party beneficiaries   but   would   have   no   obligations   under   the contract, because they wouldn’t be party to it.  2.59   Under Delaware law, if a contract is signed by the parent of a corporate group and is explicitly for the benefit of members of that corporate group, that might be enough for members of that corporate group to be liable under the contract, even though   they’re   not   party   to   the   contract.   See  Medicalgorithmics S.A. v. AMI Monitoring, Inc. , C.A. No. 10948- CB (Del. Ch. 18 Aug. 2016).",
  "2.60   But that’s not necessarily the case in other jurisdictions. So it would be preferable to structure a transaction so the members of a corporate group have the benefit of a contract and the supplier   or   licensor   are   explicitly   protected.   Which arrangement would work best would depend on the context. Various alternatives present themselves: The supplier or licensor could enter into a contract with each member of the corporate group. The member of the corporate group could act as guarantor of the other members. The member of the corporate group could act as agent for the other members. The member of the corporate group could act as sublicensor to the other members. The member of the corporate group and the supplier or licensor could enter into a master agreement, with other members submitting individual statements of work under the master agreement (see 4.98). The supplier or licensor could permit the member of the corporate group to extend the benefit of its contract with the supplier or licensor to another member if the supplier or licensor receives a written undertaking from the other member that names the supplier or licensor as a third-party beneficiary and states that the other member will comply with the contract with the supplier or licensor as if it were party to it.  Parties with a Limited Role  2.61   One can be party to a contract with respect to only certain provisions. For example, in an acquisition, the buyer’s parent might   be   party   to   the   acquisition   agreement   solely   to guarantee the buyer’s obligations or solely to undertake to pay a termination fee. It’s helpful to reflect a party’s limited role by stating in the introductory clause before the party’s",
  "name,   between   offsetting   commas,   with   respect   to   only  [ specified provisions ]. It makes sense to put a party with a limited role last in the introductory clause.  2.62   Neglecting to highlight that a party has a limited role might have   no   repercussions,   because   that   party’s   role   will   be whatever the contract says it is. But doing so makes the arrangement clear to the parties without their having to read the entire contract. Furthermore, a party with a limited role might unexpectedly become ensnared in a provision that wasn’t intended to apply to that party but arguably does anyway, because it refers generically to   a party   or   the parties . Flagging   a   party’s   limited   role   could   help   avoid   such confusion.  2.63   A party with a limited role would likely also be subject to one or more boilerplate provisions addressing governing law, notices, and related matters, whether or not they’re included in the provisions specified as constituting that party’s limited role.  2.64   If you highlight in the introductory clause a party’s limited role, do so as well in that party’s signature block (see 5.47).  Referring to Lists of Parties  2.65   The parties to a contract might be sufficiently numerous that it   would   be   impractical   to   list   them   in   the   introductory clause.   That’s   often   the   case   with   loan   agreements   and securities purchase agreements.  2.66   In a loan agreement, one alternative would be to refer to the lenders as follows in the introductory clause:   the financial institutions   listed   as   Lenders   on   the   signature   pages   of   this agreement . That would distinguish the lenders from the other parties whose names appear on the signature pages.  2.67   Another alternative would be to refer to the lenders as   the financial   institutions   listed   in   schedule   A .   That   would   be preferable if in addition to identifying the lenders you want",
  "to provide information about the lenders that would be out of place on the signature pages, such as addresses and other contact information. Because the list in question would be on a   schedule,   you   wouldn’t   need   to   refer   to   the   parties   in question as being   listed as Lenders .  Describing the Parties  CORE   INFORMATION  2.68   In the introductory clause, after the name of each legal- entity party, state its jurisdiction of organization and what kind of entity it is. Be concise: use, for example,   a Delaware corporation   rather   than   a   corporation   organized   and   existing under the laws of the state of Delaware .  2.69   Distinguish a U.S. legal-entity party from any other entity bearing   the   same   name   by   including   its   jurisdiction   of organization in the introductory clause. Stating its address too would serve only to clutter up the introductory clause. If the parties must know each other’s addresses for sending notices, the notices provision would be the place to state them.  2.70   In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a legal entity is given a registration number at formation. If having that number would make it easier to determine the history and status of an entity, include the number in the introductory clause. By contrast, the address of a party’s registered office would, like any other entity address, be superfluous in the introductory clause.  2.71   After the name of each party that’s an individual, state that he or she is an individual— John Doe, an individual . (The term of art   natural person   is too quaintly legalistic to be a plausible alternative.) Even without that notation, readers would likely figure out that the party is an individual, but it’s simpler not to require them to make that deduction for themselves. It’s",
  "also simpler to be consistent by stating after each party name in the introductory clause what kind of legal person they are.  2.72   In contrast to legal-entity parties, in many jurisdictions the simplest way to distinguish a party that’s an individual from any other individual bearing the same name would be to state that party’s address in the introductory clause. (In doing so, write out in full the name of any U.S. state rather than using a U.S. Postal Service abbreviation, but include the ZIP code.) But if the contract contains a notices provision, omit that party’s address from the introductory clause and instead state   it   in   the   notices   provision,   with   the   other   party addresses. It’s convenient to put all the addresses in one place, and stating a party’s address twice in a contract adds unnecessary words and invites inconsistency (see 1.62).  2.73   In some jurisdictions information other than addresses is used to distinguish individuals—for example, an individual’s passport number or national identification number.  2.74   In some jurisdictions outside the United States it might be mandatory to include additional information. For example, under   the   Czech   Civil   Code   registered   companies   must include the following information in contracts governed by Czech law: company name, registered office, company ID number, and registration in the Commercial Register.  2.75   If   a   party   is   serving   an   administrative   function   or   is otherwise acting on behalf of one or more individuals or entities, indicate that in the introductory clause:  ACME BANK, N.A., as collateral agent for the Secured Parties (in that capacity, the “ Collateral Agent ”) JOHN DOE, as Shareholders’ Representative  2.76   Any party that’s wearing two hats in a transaction should be mentioned twice in the introductory clause, once in each capacity:  ACME CAPITAL CORPORATION (in its individual capacity and not",
  "as Administrative Agent, “ Acme Capital ”) ACME CAPITAL CORPORATION, as administrative agent for the Lenders (in that capacity, the “ Administrative Agent ”)  2.77   It’s redundant to use the word   solely   to emphasize that a party is acting only in a specified capacity.  A   TRUST   AS   A   PARTY   TO   A   CONTRACT  2.78   Generally, a trust is not a legal person, so a trust cannot be party to a contract or sign a contract. The trustee is the proper   signer.   A   trustee   should   sign   in   their   fiduciary capacity, not as an individual. You accomplish that by saying in the introductory clause and in the trustee’s signature block (see 5.33) that that’s what they’re doing:   not in her individual capacity but as trustee . A trustee is not personally liable on a contract   made   in   a   fiduciary   capacity   unless   the   trustee exceeds their authority.  2.79   But naming a trust as a party to a contract even though it isn’t a legal person doesn’t necessarily render the contract invalid. See, e.g., the South African case   Standard Bank v. Swanepoel NO   (20062/2014) [2015] ZASCA 71 (22 May 2015).  2.80   Some trusts—notably Delaware statutory trusts—are by law recognized as separate legal entities and so can enter into contracts.  PERFORMANCE   BY   A   DIVISION  2.81   If a company’s performance under a contract will be handled by a division of that company, make that clear. You could do so in the recitals, or you could do so in the introductory clause by supplementing the core information for that party:  ACME CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation acting through its Widgets   division   (“Acme”) .   Because   the   defined-term parenthetical comes just after the reference to the division, a reader might assume that the defined term relates only to the division, not the company. But that would be an unlikely reading in this context. Using the name of the company, not",
  "the division, in the signature block for that party would eliminate any possibility of confusion (see 5.29).  2.82   Don’t   make   the   division   itself   party   to   the   contract—a division lacks the capacity to enter into a legally enforceable contract, so the company might claim that the contract isn’t enforceable. And don’t say that the company   is represented by  the division, because that phrase is generally used to refer to an individual or entity acting on someone’s behalf.  INCIDENTAL   INFORMATION  2.83   Consider this introductory clause:  This merger agreement is dated 18 January 2017 and is between DARIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a California corporation (“ Parent ”), SWORDFISH ACQUISITION, INC., a California corporation   and a wholly owned subsidiary of parent   (“ Sub ”), TROMBONE SOFTWARE, INC., a Delaware corporation (“ Target ”),  and the stockholders of Target, namely   ALAN ALPHA, an individual (“ Alpha ”), BRUCE BRAVO, an individual (“ Bravo ”), and CLARENCE CHARLIE, an individual (“ Charlie ”; together with Alpha and Bravo, the “ Stockholders ”).  2.84   The strikethrough text constitutes incidental information. Don’t   include   in   the   introductory   clause   incidental information,   such   as   information   regarding   relationships among   the   parties   and   what   role   a   party   has   in   the transaction, because doing so clutters up the introductory clause. All such information belongs in the recitals, where it would be more accessible to the reader.  2.85   As in the example in 2.83, using common nouns as defined terms for party names (see 2.104) and using defined terms to refer to parties collectively (see 2.110) can convey the essence of   what   otherwise   might   have   been   included   in   the introductory clause as incidental information.  EXTRANEOUS   INFORMATION",
  "2.86   Each of the following assertions is extraneous and shouldn’t be included in the introductory clause:  that a party is represented by a duly authorized representative address this instead in a statement of fact (but see 5.34) that a party is duly organized and validly existing address this instead in a statement of fact that the agreement states the binding agreement of the parties omit—the lead-in states that the parties are agreeing to what’s in the contract (see 2.160)  2.87   Generally,   no   purpose   is   served   by   stating,   in   the introductory clause or elsewhere, that the parties intend to be legally bound. The approach under U.S. law is summarized by section 21 of the   Restatement (Second) of Contracts , which says, “Neither real nor apparent intention that a promise be legally binding is essential to the formation of a contract.” Instead, formation of a contract requires an intentional act manifesting   assent.   But   see   2.186   regarding   the   function under Pennsylvania law of a statement of intent to be legally bound.  2.88   By contrast, in England and in most civil-law countries, the existence of a contract depends, at least in theory, on the parties’   intent   to   be   bound.   But   under   English   law,   a presumption applies that if a commercial agreement satisfies the other elements of a contract, the parties intended to be legally bound. See, e.g.,   Edwards v. Skyways   [1964] 1 All ER 494.  2.89   As a practical matter, disputes regarding whether a party intended   to   be   legally   bound   are   comparable   to   disputes regarding whether under U.S. law the parties had actually entered into a contract. In both kinds of dispute, informal communications feature prominently. It would be ludicrous to   argue   that   someone   who   entered   into   a   contract articulating the complete terms of a commercial relationship might not have known that the contract was legally binding.",
  "So unless a quirk of governing law makes it necessary or advantageous   to   do   so,   don’t   include   in   a   contract   a statement that the parties intend to be legally bound by the contract.  Defined Terms for Party Names  2.90   Defined   terms   are   discussed   in   chapter   6,   but   guidelines regarding their use in the introductory clause are discussed in 2.91–.123.  CREATING   AND   USING   A   DEFINED   TERM   FOR   A   PARTY   NAME  2.91   Use   throughout   a   contract   a   short   name   for   each   party instead of repeating its full name. Make that short name a defined term and define it in the introductory clause, even if not defining it would present no risk of confusion.  2.92   In rare instances, the short name is defined elsewhere in the contract.   For   example,   in   contracts   that   have   as   a   party someone   acting   as   a   shareholders’   representative,   some drafters use the defined term   Shareholders’ Representative   in the introductory clause (see the second example in 2.75) and define it elsewhere. That’s not particularly problematic, but it can be avoided.  2.93   To create a defined term for a party name, use an integrated definition, with the defined term stated in parentheses after the party name (see 6.61). The defined term, excluding   the,   if it’s used (see 2.106), should be in quotation marks and in bold for emphasis; don’t bold the quotation marks .   (This manual   follows   that   convention   in   the   samples   and   the indented   examples   of   contract   text,   but   in   examples incorporated in regular paragraphs any terms being defined aren’t stated in bold, to avoid distracting the reader.) Don’t include   introductory   text   in   the   parentheses,   such   as  hereinafter   referred   to   as —it’s   unnecessary.   (Regarding conventions for defining terms, see chapter 6.)",
  "2.94   When creating a defined term for the name of an entity, place   the   defined-term   parentheses   after   the   jurisdiction reference   (see   2.68):   Excelsior   Corporation,   a   Delaware corporation (“Excelsior”) . In an integrated definition, the term being defined should follow the definition (see 6.62). That suggests that the parenthetical should come after   Excelsior Corporation,   but it seems appropriate to place the defined- term parenthetical after   a Delaware corporation .   That’s because  Excelsior Corporation   and   a Delaware corporation   are both noun phrases referring to the same thing. And placing it there presents an advantage: if when creating the defined term for a party name you take the opportunity to create additional defined terms within the same set of parentheses (if, in other words, you “stack” two or more definitions; see 6.81), placing the   parentheses   after   the   party   name   would   make   the jurisdiction reference seem like an awkward afterthought (see sample 1).  2.95   Just as it would be a mistake to tack on   including its affiliates and direct and indirect subsidiaries   or similar language when describing   a   party,   because   the   affiliates   and   subsidiaries aren’t party to the contract (see 2.54), it would be a mistake to add such language to the defined-term parenthetical—  (including its affiliates and subsidiaries, “Acme”) .  2.96   Don’t state in a defined-term parenthetical that the defined term includes that party’s successors. (One often sees this with   parties   acting   on   someone’s   behalf;   see   2.75.)   The contract provisions governing succession should make it clear that   any   successor   would   step   into   the   shoes   of   the predecessor.  2.97   Don’t use all capitals or some other form of emphasis for party-name   defined   terms   throughout   a   contract—it’s pointless and distracting.  THE   TWO   KINDS   OF   DEFINED   TERM   FOR   A   PARTY   NAME",
  "2.98   When selecting the defined term for a party name, you have a   choice   between   basing   it   on   the   party’s   name   (see 2.100–.103) or using a common noun such as   the Company   or  the   Shareholder   (see   2.104–.109).   Generally,   defined   terms based   on   party   names   make   a   contract   slightly   more accessible to the reader. But common nouns work well in the following situations: if the parties play traditional, clearly defined roles, such as lender and borrower, or landlord and tenant if the contract focuses on a single entity, as is the case with a limited-liability-company operating agreement or a shareholders agreement if the identity of the signers is not yet known  2.99   Sometimes   it   makes   sense   to   use   a   mix   of   the   two approaches.   For   example,   if   a   company   uses   a   template software license agreement repeatedly, it would make sense, in terms of readability and corporate identity, to use in the template as the defined term for the company a defined term based on the company’s name. But the party on the other side of the transaction would change with each transaction, so it would be efficient to use as the defined term for the other party a common noun such as   the Licensee .  USING   DEFINED   TERMS   BASED   ON   PARTY   NAMES  2.100   If a party is an individual, you could use a defined term based on that individual’s last name or, if the contract refers to two or more individuals with the same last name, that individual’s first name. Add an appropriate honorific ( Mr., Ms.,   Dr. ) if the last name on its own is too stark, or as a sign of   respect.   Also,   an   honorific   might   help   the   reader distinguish   legal-entity   parties   from   parties   who   are individuals.  2.101   For companies, select a word or two from the name or use an initialism. Sargasso Realty Holdings, Inc. could be referred to",
  "as   Sargasso Realty   or simply   Sargasso,   or you could use the initialism   SRH .  2.102   In the interest of readability, use whenever possible a defined term consisting of one or more words from an entity’s name rather than an initialism. But using an initialism for a party name might nevertheless be the best option in the following situations: if other parties to the contract include affiliates with similar names if the party’s name includes that initialism if the party is commonly known by that initialism if the nature of the party’s name precludes something more imaginative—it would, for example, be challenging to find a noninitialism alternative to   BNJ   as a name-based defined term for Bank of New Jersey  2.103   Be careful about using as the defined term for a party name an initialism with a meaning or connotations unrelated to that   party.   One   can   imagine   a   contract   party   not   being thrilled at being lumbered with the initialism   DOG   or   SAD .  USING   A   COMMON   NOUN   AS   THE   DEFINED   TERM   FOR   A   PARTY   NAME  2.104   If you wish to use a common noun as the defined term for a party name, you have a choice between a noun that refers to its status as a legal entity ( Company ) and one that indicates the   role   that   the   party   plays   in   the   transaction   ( Seller, Employer,   Lender ).  2.105   To   avoid   confusion,   don’t   use   paired   defined   terms   that differ only in their final syllable, including these:  Acquiror – Acquiree Appellant – Appellee Assignor – Assignee Bailor – Bailee",
  "Covenantor – Covenantee Donor – Donee Employer – Employee Endorser – Endorsee Farmor – Farmee Grantor – Grantee Guarantor – Guarantee Indemnitor – Indemnitee Lessor – Lessee Licensor – Licensee Mortgagor – Mortgagee Obligor – Obligee Offeror – Offeree Optionor – Optionee Payor – Payee Transferor – Transferee Vendor – Vendee Warrantor – Warrantee  2.106   If the defined term for a party name consists of a common noun, using the definite article— the Purchaser   rather than  Purchaser —results in prose that’s less stilted, and that’s worth more than the marginal economy afforded by eliminating every instance of   the   from the defined term. Some drafters prefer to omit the definite article to avoid problems with careless   search-and-replace   (with   the   Buyer   becoming   the Acme ) if someone replaces the common-noun defined term with a name-based defined term. But paying some attention is all that’s required to avoid that problem. In any event, be consistent throughout a contract in using or not using the",
  "definite article with a particular defined term—failure to do so suggests carelessness.  2.107   Don’t   offer   alternative   defined   terms   for   a   party,   as   in  “Widgetco” or the “Company”   or as in   “Widgetco,” sometimes referred   to   herein   as   the   “Company” .   Doing   so   serves   no purpose and makes the reader responsible for remembering that   Widgetco   and   the Company   are the same.  2.108   Regarding the defined terms   Vendor ,   Seller , and   Supplier , it would be appropriate to use   Vendor   for a party that’s in the business of selling whatever is being sold; to use   Seller   for a party that isn’t; and to use   Supplier   for a party that not only is in the business of selling whatever is being sold but also is contracting to supply it over time. These distinctions are consistent   with   everyday   usage   in   business,   although everyday   usage   isn’t   entirely   consistent.   For   example,   in Commonwealth   countries   it’s   standard   to   use   vendor   for someone selling their house.   Vendor   is perhaps slightly old- fashioned, but it’s informative and widely used.  2.109   Consider using   the Employee   as the default defined term for an   employee   in   a   contract   with   the   employer.   For   more senior employees, the defined term   the Executive   is often used instead, but it seems unnecessary and perhaps old-fashioned to trumpet the employee’s status with a defined term—it will be   clear   enough   from   the   terms   of   the   contract.   An alternative would be to use the employee’s last name with an honorific (see 2.100). In the United States,   executive employee  is   a   term   with   legal   implications,   in   that   the   Fair   Labor Standards Act provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay for employees employed as bona fide executive,   administrative,   professional,   and   outside   sales employees. But what defined term you use for an employee won’t affect whether that employee qualifies as an executive employee under the statute.  DEFINED   TERMS   USED   TO   REFER   TO   PARTIES   COLLECTIVELY",
  "2.110   Often it’s helpful to use a collective defined term such as   the Shareholders ; sample 1 contains the collective defined term  the   Hastings   Parties .   Define   such   collective   defined   terms either in the singular or the plural, but not both (see 6.4).  2.111   But don’t use   the Parties   as a collective defined term for the parties to a contract .   It ostensibly spares the drafter from having to refer throughout a contract to   the parties to this agreement   (or   the parties hereto ) ,   but one can simply refer to   the parties,   because no reasonable reader could understand such a reference to mean anything other than the parties to that contract.  2.112   A more nuanced argument for using the defined term   the Parties   relates to contract provisions stating that only the parties   may   enforce   the   contract.   To   preclude   nonparties from enforcing a contract—something that would be an issue only   if   the   contract   contemplates   intended   third-party beneficiaries—make   it   clear   in   such   provisions   that   they apply only to the named parties to the contract. If you refer simply to   the   parties,   a court might hold that it includes persons other than the named parties, in particular intended third-party beneficiaries.  2.113   You could address this issue by creating the defined term   the Parties   and defining it to mean only the named parties. But a better solution would be to give the name of each party in the provision that states that only the parties may enforce the contract. Another would be to refer in that provision to  the signatories —that would be more concise than listing all the parties, especially if there are more than two. The word  signatory   is ambiguous (see 13.731), but in this context that ambiguity wouldn’t create a problem.  2.114   Creating   the   defined   term   the   Parties   instead   would accomplish the same goal as naming the parties or referring to   the signatories,   but in the process would force the drafter to use throughout the contract the defined term   the Parties,  even   though   outside   that   one   context   the   defined   term",
  "would serve no purpose. Given the toll that defined terms take on readability (see 6.115), in this case the cost of using the defined term   the Parties   outweighs the limited benefit, particularly given the alternatives that are available.  PARTY   OF   THE   FIRST   PART   AND   PARTY   OF   THE   SECOND   PART  2.115   Parties   to   a   contract   were   once   divided   into   classes,   or “parts,” with one party identified in the introductory clause as   party of the first part   and the other as   party of the second part . (Anyone other than a party to the contract was a   third party;  see   13.820.)   The   parties   were   referred   to   by   those   labels throught   the   contract.   This   practice   had   nothing   to recommend it—not only was it cumbersome, it also invited confusion   and   litigation,   given   how   easy   it   was   to inadvertently transpose the labels.  2.116   In the United States this usage survives, but barely—you see it mostly in the occasional real-estate contract. Somewhat more common is use of   party of the first part   and   party of the second part   in the introductory clause but nowhere else—the parties   are   also   given   conventional   defined   terms   in   the introductory   clause,   and   those   defined   terms   are   used throughout   the   contract.   This   usage   seems   particularly pointless,   but   it   lives   on;   it   appears   to   be   slightly   more prevalent in Commonwealth countries than in the United States.  2.117   If one or both sides to a transaction consist of more than one party, using   party of the first part   and   party of the second part   in the introductory clause would arguably be an efficient way to group the parties according to which side of the transaction they’re on. But information regarding party relationships is best   placed   in   the   recitals   (see   2.84).   Furthermore,   using common nouns as defined terms for party names and using defined terms to refer to parties collectively can efficiently convey the essence of party relationships (see 2.85).  WHEN   EITHER   PARTY   MIGHT   PLAY   A   GIVEN   ROLE",
  "2.118   A contract might provide for a mechanism in which either party plays a given role, with the other party playing another role. For example, either of two shareholders might have an option to buy the other out. In referring to each party when describing that mechanism, you must use a generic label instead of a party-name defined term.  2.119   The simplest way to do that would be to use   that party   and  the   other   party .   But   that   works   for   only   the   most   basic provisions: if you use   that party   again after having used   the other party , the reader might think that the second   that party  refers to   the other party .  2.120   The 2002 International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)   master   agreement   gets   around   that   problem   by creating the defined terms   X   and   Y   for   that party   and   the other party , respectively:  If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party (“X”) will:— (1) promptly notify the other party (“Y”) of such requirement;  2.121   But   X   and   Y   are   devoid   of   context,   so   the   reader   must remember what roles   X   and   Y   play. The same applies to using instead, say,   Party A   and   Party B .  2.122   Less susceptible to confusion are labels that refer to the role being played. For example,   the withdrawing member   and   the remaining member . If such labels are used often enough, it makes   sense   to   use   them   as   defined   terms,   hence   the Indemnifying Party   and   the Indemnified Party .  2.123   Your   choice   of   labels   could   have   unanticipated consequences. In   Powertech Technology, Inc. v. Tessera, Inc. , No. C 11-6121 CW, 2014 WL 171830, at *5 (N.D. Cal. 15 Jan. 2014), the court held that because a termination provision used   the   label   “non-breaching   party,”   a   party   seeking   to terminate   for   the   other   party’s   purported   breach   had   to substantially   comply   with   its   own   obligations   first.   One suspects that was not what the drafter had intended. Using",
  "instead   the party claiming breach   as a label would presumably have prevented the court from so holding.  The Defined Term   This Agreement  2.124   It’s common practice to create in the introductory clause the defined   term   this   Agreement .   (Analogous   defined   terms include   this Amendment —see 18.6—and   this Assignment .) But this defined term is unnecessary: the definite article   this   in  this   agreement   makes   it   clear   which   agreement   is   being referred to. The title (see 2.2) and introductory clause (see 2.15) of a contract might describe that contract as a particular kind   of   agreement,   such   as   an   agency   agreement   or   a franchise agreement, but that wouldn’t be an impediment to referring thereafter to   this agreement   without having made it a defined term.  2.125   And because it’s best to use lowercase letters in any reference to an agreement (see 2.20), it’s preferable not to use a capital  A   in   this agreement .  2.126   Used in a provision, the term   this agreement   could in theory be   interpreted   as   referring   to   some   part   of   a   contract—a section, a subsection, a sentence, an enumerated clause— rather than the entire contract. But as a practical matter, that doesn’t happen. The likelihood of a party arguing that   this agreement   refers to a part of the whole, and the likelihood of a court accepting this argument, is remote.  2.127   Sometimes   the   defined   term   this Agreement   is   defined   to include the attachments to the contract. That doesn’t render the defined term any more useful—if a contract provision mentions an attachment, that brings the attachment within the   scope   of   the   contract,   without   the   need   to   say   so explicitly. (For a more general discussion of this issue, see 5.106–.109.)  2.128   Some   drafters   use   for   a   contract’s   references   to   itself   an initialism created from the title—for example   this CRADA",
  "(standing for   cooperative research and development agreement ) and   this   NDA   (standing   for   nondisclosure   agreement ).   But readers don’t need to be reminded at every turn what kind of contract they’re reading. And although an initialism might be shorter than   agreement , that economy is more than offset by the alphabet-soup quality of initialisms, not to mention all the capital letters, which in quantity become distracting.  RECITALS  2.129   Most contracts of any length or complexity contain, after the title and before the lead-in, one or more paragraphs referred to collectively as “recitals.” The recitals in sample 2, which accompany   the   introductory   clause   in   sample   1,   use   the format this manual recommends for recitals.  Function  2.130   The recitals to a contract state any background information that the parties regard as relevant. One can distinguish three kinds of recitals:  2.131   Context recitals.   These describe the circumstances leading up to the parties’ entering into the contract. Typical context recitals include recitals describing any relationships between the   parties   (see   the   first   recital   in   sample   2),   businesses operated by one or more parties (see the first recital in sample 2), and transactions entered into previously by one or more parties (see the second, fourth, and fifth recitals in sample 2).  SAMPLE 2   RECITALS",
  "2.132   Purpose recitals.   These indicate succinctly and in broad terms what the parties wish to accomplish (see the third recital in sample 2). They shouldn’t be used to shoehorn deal terms into the recitals.  2.133   Simultaneous-transaction   recitals.   If   a   contract   is   part   of   a broader transaction, these describe the other components of the transaction taking place concurrently with signing the contract (see the sixth recital in sample 2).  2.134   A complex agreement might have a dozen or more recitals. If a transaction is straightforward and lacks any back story, dispense with recitals. It’s unnecessary to provide recitals that simply state, for example, that Doe wants to sell something to Holdings and that Holdings wants to purchase it from Doe, as readers could get that information from the contract title and the initial provisions of the body of the contract.  2.135   Because courts typically look to recitals just for indications of the intent of the parties on entering into the transaction,",
  "don’t address in the recitals in any detail deal terms or facts. It’s routine for mergers-and-acquisitions contracts to cram into the recitals information that’s better placed in the body of the contract.  Giving the Recitals a Heading  2.136   Many drafters give recitals a heading, but that’s unnecessary.  2.137   A   traditional   choice   of   heading   is   WITNESSETH .   It’s ludicrously   archaic   and   is   premised   on   the   mistaken assumption that the word is a command in the imperative mood   meaning   roughly,   one   assumes,   “Now   hear   this!” Instead, it’s the remnant of   This agreement witnesseth that   ... , with   witnesseth   presumably meaning “is evidence.”  2.138   Use of an emphasized   witnesseth   in English contracts goes back to at least the early 16th century. The other standard all- capitals   archaisms   that   clutter   the   front   and   back   of   the contract   (see   2.143,   2.167,   5.26)   have   similar   roots. Presumably it was thought that in documents consisting of unbroken   lines   of   handwritten   text,   the   reader   would appreciate a graphic signal indicating a shift in topic. But what made sense hundreds of years ago makes no sense now. That the all-capitals archaisms persist is a function of the dead hand of passive drafting (see p. xxxvi).  2.139   Other   possible   headings   for   recitals   are   RECITALS   or  BACKGROUND .   These   represent   an   improvement   over  WITNESSETH,   but recitals don’t need a heading. Recitals can readily   be   identified   based   on   their   content   and   their position—after the introductory clause and before the lead- in. Also, the legal effect of recitals depends on their content rather than on how they are introduced. (For an anomalous Australian   exception,   see   5.59.)   And   if   one   is   giving   the recitals   a   heading,   consistency   would   require   giving   a heading to the body of the contract (a problematic notion; see   2.213),   the   introductory   clause,   and   the   concluding",
  "clause. For these reasons, the recitals in sample 2 don’t have a heading.  2.140   But   if   it   would   make   those   using   a   contract   feel   more comfortable, give the recitals an appropriate heading.  Enumeration  2.141   There’s no need to number or letter each recital. Doing so would serve a purpose only if elsewhere in the contract you wish to cross-refer to a particular recital, and that shouldn’t be necessary. (See 6.103–.114 regarding cross-referencing to definitions of defined terms.)  Use Simple Narrative Prose  2.142   The recitals serve a storytelling function. They’re the one part of a contract that calls for simple narrative prose.  2.143   So don’t begin recitals with   WHEREAS,   as this meaning of  whereas —“in view of the fact that; seeing that”—is archaic (see 2.138).  2.144   Use   a   conventional   paragraph   structure   for   recitals,   with complete sentences rather than clauses ending in semicolons. Don’t feel you have to limit yourself to the traditional one sentence per recital.  What Verb to Use in Purpose Recitals  2.145   Different verbs can be used to state in a purpose recital what the parties intend to accomplish.  2.146   If   what   follows   the   verb   is   another   verb,   here   are   your choices, of varying suitability (with   transfer   playing the role of the second verb):  wants to   [ transfer ] (not a standard option, but the most straightforward)  desires to   [ transfer ] (a standard option, but oddly steamy)",
  "wishes to   [ transfer ] (a standard option, but a little genteel)  intends to   [ transfer ] (inappropriate, as it suggests a plan outside of the contract)  seeks to   [ transfer ] (in standard English,   seek to   plus infinitive means to try; that’s not the meaning intended here)  would like to   [ transfer ] (too genteel)  is desirous of   [ transferring ] (archaic)  is agreeable to   [ transferring ] (awkward)  2.147   Because   wants to   is consistent with everyday English, this manual   recommends   wants   to .   (See   the   third   recital   in sample 2.) It would likely strike many drafters as being too blunt, but anyone offended by   wants to   is perhaps bringing to contract language a sensibility that’s overly delicate.  2.148   Here are the alternatives if what follows the verb is noun- plus-verb:  The Company   wants   the Executive to serve the Company as its chief executive officer. The Company   desires   that the Executive serve the Company as its chief executive officer. The Company   wishes   for the Executive to serve the Company as its chief executive officer. The Company   intends   that the Executive serve the Company as its chief executive officer. It is the   desire   of the Company that the Executive serve the Company as its chief executive officer. It is the   wish   of the Company that the Executive serve the Company as its chief executive officer.  2.149   Again,   wants   is the simplest choice.  Premature Recital References to the Agreement",
  "2.150   A purpose recital might state that the parties propose to engage in certain activities   in accordance with this agreement   or  subject to the terms of this agreement . But if you make a purpose recital subject to the terms of the agreement, it’s no longer a general statement of intent. In effect, you’re simply saying in the recital, redundantly, that the parties want to do what the contract   provides.   For   the   same   reason,   don’t   say   in   the recitals   this agreement contemplates .  2.151   And a context recital might say that a party   has agreed   to do something or other   subject to the terms of this agreement . That suggests,   incongruously,   two   stages   of   agreement—first, agreement to enter into the contract, followed by entry into the contract.  2.152   It makes more sense to express in a purpose recital a general intent that isn’t tied to the terms of the contract. Doing so poses no risk, as no rational court could say that a general expression of intent takes priority over the specific terms that it introduces. But obviously, a purpose recital shouldn’t state a purpose that’s broader than what the contract seeks to accomplish   (not   counting   any   conditions,   termination provisions, and other restrictions).  2.153   So   don’t   use   in   a   purpose   recital   in   accordance   with   this agreement   or anything comparable, such as   upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement .  Incorporation by Reference  2.154   Contracts sometimes state, either in the lead-in (as part of a traditional recital of consideration; see 2.166) or in a separate section in the body of the contract, that the recitals are  incorporated by reference   into the contract. Such statements are in response to caselaw holding that recitals aren’t part of the contract,   or   rather   don’t   form   part   of   the   substantive provisions. See, e.g.,   Jones Apparel Group, Inc. v. Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. , 791 N.Y.S.2d 409, 410 (App. Div. 2005).",
  "2.155   The   notion   of   incorporating   recitals   by   reference   is presumably intended to bring within the scope of the body of the contract any substantive provisions in the recitals. But recitals shouldn’t contain substantive provisions. If a set of recitals contains substantive provisions, it would be rash to rely on incorporation by reference to clear up any resulting uncertainties. A much better fix would be to remove the substantive provisions from the recitals and place them in the   body   of   the   contract.   (Regarding   incorporation   by reference generally, see 13.388.)  True and Correct  2.156   Provisions that seek to incorporate recitals by reference (see 2.154) routinely include a statement that the recitals are   true and correct . Drafters who use this archaic couplet presumably seek to make actionable any facts stated in the recitals, so a party might have a remedy if any of those facts turn out to have been inaccurate.  2.157   But   generally,   recitals   are   used   to   convey   background information that shouldn’t be at issue. If a party is uncertain whether facts stated in the recitals are accurate, it would do well to include in the body of the contract, as well as or instead   of   in   the   recitals,   statements   of   fact   as   to   those matters   by   the   appropriate   party.   That   would   provide   a clearer foundation for a claim than would a statement that the recitals are   true and correct .  Defined Terms in the Recitals  2.158   Defining terms in the recitals is unobjectionable, but don’t clutter   with   definitions   what   should   be   a   succinct introduction to the contract.  2.159   And   don’t   use   in   the   recitals   defined   terms   that   aren’t defined until later in the contract, because that’s inconsistent with   using   the   recitals   to   introduce   the   reader   to   the transaction. If you use in the recitals a defined term that",
  "doesn’t have an obvious meaning—such as   the Business,   the Merger, or the Services —and don’t define it until later in the contract, you make the recitals harder to read by forcing the reader to search for and read the definition of that defined term.  THE LEAD-IN Wording  2.160   The lead-in comes immediately after the recitals and before the body of the contract and introduces the body of the contract. If a contract doesn’t contain recitals, the lead-in should say   The parties agree as follows . If the contract does contain recitals, the lead-in should say   The parties therefore agree as follows   (see sample 2). (One could conceivably say instead   So the parties agree as follows , but that sounds too casual.)  2.161   Don’t clutter up the lead-in with extraneous verbs, as in  covenant and agree .  2.162   Don’t   use   hereby   in   the   lead-in.   Hereby   is   a   feature   of language of performance (see 3.35); the lead-in is language of agreement (see 3.30), not language of performance.  2.163   Don’t say instead   The parties hereby enter into this agreement . In language of performance,   hereby   means, in effect,   by means of this agreement , so   hereby enter into this agreement   means   enter into this agreement by means of this agreement , which doesn’t make sense.  2.164   Don’t refer to the parties by name in the lead-in, as doing so would serve no purpose and would just make the lead-in longer, particularly in a contract with more than two parties. (Regarding this issue in the context of the concluding clause, see 5.4.)  2.165   Sometimes when the body of the contract would otherwise consist of a single one-sentence provision, that provision is",
  "wrapped   into   the   lead-in,   with   the   concluding   clause following. Straightforward amendments can be handled in this manner (see 18.7).  Consideration  2.166   In the United States, a standard feature of business contracts is a recital of consideration placed immediately before the body of the contract. Here’s an example:  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:  2.167   Just as you should dispense with   WITNESSETH   (see 2.137) and   WHEREAS   (see 2.143), you should also not begin a lead- in with the archaic   NOW, THEREFORE . (You sometimes see  NOW, WHEREFORE , with   wherefore   meaning   as a result of which .   If   anything,   it   seems   even   more   archaic.)   And   in consideration   of   the   premises   is   an   obscure   way   of   saying “therefore.”  2.168   But a bigger issue is that drafters generally shouldn’t use this or   any   other   kind   of   recital   of   consideration—they’re unnecessary. To understand why, start by considering the ostensible function of recitals of consideration.  2.169   The phrase   in consideration of   can be used as a way to express, from   the   perspective   of   one   side   to   a   transaction,   the exchange taking place. (The phrase   as consideration   can serve this function too. See 13.61.) Here’s an example:  In consideration of $1,000, Alpha hereby sells the Equipment to Bravo.  2.170   Such a recital of consideration might seek to express what the parties have actually bargained for. If instead what is being offered wasn’t bargained for as part of an exchange, it’s a pretense. In that case, the recital is said to provide for",
  "“nominal” consideration, usually a small amount of money. And if the parties never intended for the amount stated— whether bargained for or not—to be paid, that too involves pretense,   and   the   recital   is   said   to   provide   for   “sham” consideration.  BACKSTOP   RECITALS  2.171   That’s the taxonomy of consideration you find in caselaw and commentary, but it’s not complete. It doesn’t explain the   kind   of   recital   of   consideration   routinely   placed   just before the body of the contract, like the one in 2.166.  2.172   Such recitals of consideration don’t specify consideration but merely assert that it exists. (Deal specifics might sometimes be   excluded   from   recitals   of   consideration   to   keep   that information private, but that doesn’t apply to this kind of recital of consideration.) In contracts in which such recitals occur, an exchange constituting the actual consideration is usually specified explicitly elsewhere in the contract, albeit without labeling it as consideration.  2.173   The only possible function of such recitals of consideration would   be   to   establish   that   the   contract   is   supported   by consideration even if the contract otherwise doesn’t state consideration   or   states   something   that   isn’t   valid consideration. That’s why this manual calls them “backstop” recitals of consideration. (A backstop is a person or thing placed   at   the   rear   of   or   behind   something   as   a   barrier, support,   or   reinforcement.)   Like   nominal   and   sham consideration, backstop recitals of consideration are a form of pretense.  2.174   But   no   one   pays   attention   to   backstop   recitals   of consideration. They’re simply a standard feature of copy-and- paste drafting and as such are blithely recycled.  PRETENSE   CONSIDERATION",
  "2.175   But   could   a   backstop   recital   of   consideration   alone   be enough   to   establish   that   a   contract   is   supported   by consideration? According to commentary, the answer is no: because   both   nominal   and   sham   consideration   are   a pretense, they don’t generally constitute consideration. See 2- 5   Corbin on Contracts   § 5.17. By extension, that applies to backstop consideration too. (Option contracts and guarantees are discussed in 2.191–.201.) Instead, courts generally give a recital   of   consideration   some   weight   but   permit   contrary evidence to be introduced. See 3   Williston on Contracts   § 7:23; 17A   Am. Jur. 2d   Contracts § 110 (2017). That makes sense—if a backstop recital of consideration were all that it takes to establish consideration, that would nullify the requirement of consideration. Every contract would include a backstop recital of consideration and the requirement of consideration would be illusory.  2.176   But   in   recent   years,   some   courts   have   indicated   that   a backstop   recital   of   consideration   supports   a   contract.   For example, in   Network Protection Sciences, LLC v. Fortinet, Inc. , No. C 12-01106 WHA, 2013 WL 4479336, at *6 (N.D. Cal. 20 Aug. 2013), the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, applying Texas law, held that a recital stating that   the   patents   at   issue   were   assigned   “[f]or   good   and valuable   consideration,   the   receipt   of   which   is   hereby acknowledged,”   was   “conclusive”   on   the   issue   of consideration.  2.177   And in   Urban Sites of Chicago, LLC v. Crown Castle USA , 979 N.E.2d 480, 493 (Ill. App. Ct. 2012), the contract at issue stated that the parties had entered into it “[f]or good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged.” The Appellate Court of Illinois pointed to that in stating, in dictum, that “the evidence contained in the record establishes that there was adequate consideration as a matter of law.”  2.178   One   could   argue   that   based   on   these   cases,   it   would   be prudent always to include a backstop recital of consideration",
  "in a contract in case a dispute comes before a court that is misinformed regarding the law of consideration or is willing to rely on pretense consideration to achieve a given outcome. But that’s too depressingly speculative a prospect to justify cluttering   every   contract   with   a   backstop   recital   of consideration.  REBUTTABLE   PRESUMPTION  2.179   There’s caselaw to the effect that a recital of consideration establishes   a   rebuttable   presumption   that   consideration exists. See 3   Williston on Contracts   § 7:22. That has led one commentator to recommend including a backstop recital of consideration in contracts governed by the law of a state that recognizes   the   rebuttable   presumption.   See   Tina   L.   Stark,  Drafting Contracts: How and Why Lawyers Do What They Do   86 (2d ed. 2014).  2.180   But   that   accomplishes   little.   In   the   case   of   sham consideration or a backstop recital of consideration, rebutting that presumption would simply require showing lack of any payment   or   other   exchange   that   could   constitute consideration. Moreover, the rebuttable presumption doesn’t make   sense   when   applied   to   backstop   recitals   of consideration: they state no specific consideration, so anyone looking   to   rebut   the   presumption   would   have   nothing specific to rebut.  2.181   More   fundamentally,   if   you’re   invoking   the   rebuttable presumption, you’re already in a fight. A characteristic of passive drafting (see p. xxxvi) is a focus on prevailing in disputes. It makes more sense to engage in active drafting, with the aim of avoiding disputes by stating the deal clearly. Those who draft or review contracts (as opposed to those who   litigate   contract   disputes)   have   simple   and   effective alternatives to invoking in a dispute a recital of consideration that’s   a   pretense—whether   it’s   nominal   or   sham consideration or a backstop recital of consideration.",
  "STRUCTURING   CONSIDERATION  2.182   First, state any actual consideration clearly. (But don’t state it as a recital of consideration; see 2.202–.206.)  2.183   Second, if a transaction lacks consideration, fix that. For example, if a party to an existing contract wants the other party to agree to a disadvantageous change in the terms, that change might be enforceable only if the party agreeing to the change   has   received   consideration   for   doing   so.   If   that consideration is lacking, then arrange for it—what constitutes consideration might depend on the jurisdiction—and state it clearly in the contract.  2.184   Third, the performing party could waive consideration and acknowledge that the other party will be relying on that waiver. Most U.S. courts would probably view reliance as an independent basis for enforcing a promise, so reliance might make   a   promise   enforceable   even   in   the   absence   of consideration.   See   3   Williston   on   Contracts   §   7:2.   Before choosing that approach, research how this issue is handled under the governing law of the contract.  2.185   And fourth, you can take advantage of formalities offered by law as a way to establish consideration, although they’re annoyingly   legalistic.   If   the   governing   law   requires   no consideration for contracts under seal, you could make the contract one under seal (see 5.48–.59).  2.186   Under the Uniform Written Obligations Act, enacted only in Pennsylvania,   a   written   release   or   promise   will   not   be unenforceable for lack of consideration if the signer states they intend to be legally bound. Unless you’re dealing with a contract governed by Pennsylvania law that might not be supported by consideration, so stating in a contract would serve no purpose (see 2.87). And in Pennsylvania, courts have limited   the   effect   of   such   a   statement.   See   Socko   v.   Mid- Atlantic   Systems   of   CPA,   Inc. ,   126   A.3d   1266   (Pa.   2015) (holding   that   an   employment   agreement   containing   a noncompetition provision may be challenged for a lack of",
  "consideration   even   though   the   agreement   states   that   the parties “intend to be legally bound”).  2.187   Eliminating any function for pretense consideration would allow you to eliminate recitals of consideration, including backstop recitals of consideration, and all associated clutter.  2.188   One   item   of   clutter   is   the   phrase   good   and   valuable consideration .   The   distinction   between   good   consideration and valuable consideration is evidently still relevant for some real-estate   deeds,   because   it’s   enshrined   in,   for   example, Georgia statutes (Ga. Code Ann. § 13-3-41). But it’s irrelevant for regular contracts. And more to the point, what matters is whether consideration exists, not what doctrinal label you can attach to it.  2.189   As   regards   receipt   and   sufficiency ,   acknowledging   receipt accomplishes nothing if there was no consideration. And consideration either exists or it does not exist—it makes no sense to say that it’s insufficient or sufficient. See 1-3   Murray On Contracts   § 60[A].  2.190   Dispense with any remaining archaisms and you’re left with a simple lead-in to the body of the contract (see 2.160).  OPTION   CONTRACTS  2.191   Option   contracts   and   guarantees   must   be   considered separately.  2.192   Section 87(1) of the   Restatement (Second) of Contracts   suggests that in option contracts, a recital of nominal consideration supports   a   promise.   Under   the   Restatement ’s   approach,   it would be irrelevant whether the nominal consideration is paid.  2.193   Some courts have endorsed the   Restatement ’s approach—for one, the Supreme Court of Texas. See   1464-Eight v. Joppich , 154 S.W.3d 101, 110 (Tex. 2004). So one might conclude that although in most contexts nominal or sham consideration or a   backstop   recital   of   consideration   wouldn’t   establish",
  "consideration   where   none   exists,   it   would   be   prudent   to retain such recitals in option contracts.  2.194   But   the   Restatement ’s   approach   remains   the   minority position.   In   jurisdictions   that   haven’t   adopted   the  Restatement ’s approach, the prudent thing to do would be to set a plausible option price, recite it in the contract, and make sure it’s paid.  2.195   Consider doing that even in jurisdictions that have adopted the   Restatement ’s   approach.   It   would   allow   you   to   avoid relying   on   something   that   doesn’t   make   sense—a   sham endorsed by law.  2.196   If you wish to rely on the   Restatement ’s approach, consider using nominal consideration instead of a backstop recital of consideration—even if a court might otherwise be inclined to accept pretense consideration, it’s not clear how courts would react to backstop recitals of consideration. That’s because the caselaw on option contracts mostly involves a recital of a consideration for a stated amount of money, as opposed to a statement   that   unspecified   consideration   exists,   and   the illustrations   in   the   Restatement   involve   purported consideration in the form of stated amounts of money.  2.197   Thankfully, you can safely dispense with consideration for option contracts governed by the law of a state that has by statute specified that option contracts need not be supported by consideration. New York is one such state (see section 5 of the New York General Obligations Law). And section 2-205 of the Uniform Commercial Code says that a firm offer to buy or sell goods is not revocable for lack of consideration.  GUARANTEES  2.198   In terms of what constitutes consideration, guarantees are analogous to option contracts.  2.199   If   Alpha   guarantees   Bravo’s   debt   to   Charlie   when   Bravo incurs   that   debt,   Charlie’s   willingness   to   lend   money   to Bravo   is   valid   consideration   for   Alpha’s   promise   to   pay",
  "Bravo’s   debt.   Generally,   that’s   not   the   case   if   Alpha guarantees Bravo’s debt after Bravo incurs it.  2.200   But section 88 of the   Restatement (Second) of Contracts   and section 9 of the   Restatement (Third) of Suretyship   suggest that for guarantees, a false recital of consideration would support a promise. The caselaw endorsing that approach is negligible, so it would be rash to assume that a court would endorse it for   a   given   contract.   Alpha   must   have   a   reason   for guaranteeing   Bravo’s   existing   debt.   Because   that   reason constitutes Alpha’s consideration, Charlie the creditor would be better protected by having that reason stated in Alpha’s guarantee instead of relying on pretense consideration.  2.201   As with option contracts, even in jurisdictions that accept a false recital of consideration for guarantees, consider stating actual consideration instead of relying on a sham. And again, as   with   option   contracts,   if   you   wish   to   rely   on   the  Restatements ’   approach,   consider   using   nominal consideration instead of a backstop recital of consideration.  ELIMINATING   OTHER   REFERENCES  2.202   As noted in 2.169, the phrases   in consideration of   and   as consideration   can   be   used   to   express   part   of   the   actual exchange taking place in a transaction, as contrasted with use of either phrase in a recital of sham or nominal consideration or in a backstop recital of consideration.  2.203   But those phrases can fail to make it clear what is happening. Consider again the example offered in 2.169:  In consideration of $10,000, Able hereby sells the Equipment to Baker.  2.204   In this example, is the $10,000 being paid at signing? In that case, it would be clearer to say the following:  Able hereby purchases the Equipment from Baker for $10,000, which Baker acknowledges having received from Able concurrently with the parties’ signing this agreement.",
  "2.205   Or is the $10,000 being paid later? In that case, it would be better to express payment by Able as an obligation:  Able hereby purchases the Equipment from Baker for $10,000, which Able shall pay Baker no later than 30 days after the date of this agreement.  2.206   So besides dispensing with backstop recitals of consideration (along with nominal and sham consideration), you should be able   to   dispense   entirely   with   the   word   consideration   to express   any   part   of   a   bargained-for   exchange.   Have   no qualms about that—referring to consideration does not affect whether a transaction is supported by consideration. See 17A  Am. Jur. 2d   Contracts § 109 (2017).  OTHER   JURISDICTIONS  2.207   It’s   standard   to   find   U.S.-style   backstop   recitals   of consideration in the lead-in of Canadian contracts. They also appear in international contracts that have some connection with the United States. Whatever the context, the analysis offered in this manual applies.  2.208   In contracts drafted in England and Australia, it’s rare to encounter U.S.-style backstop recitals of consideration in the lead-in. But that shouldn’t be cause for complacency, because one can find English and Australian contracts that include elsewhere in the contract provisions that reflect the same misconceptions.   For   example,   The   parties   acknowledge   the receipt and sufficiency of the consideration to this agreement.  2.209   Unlike   the   law   in   U.S.   jurisdictions   (with   the   limited exception discussed in 2.192), under English law nominal consideration is enough to support a contract. English courts give legal effect to what is a pretense.  2.210   The doctrine of consideration isn’t recognized under civil law, but don’t be surprised if due to copy-and-paste cross- contamination   from   Anglo-American   contracts   you   see   a recital of consideration in a contract governed by the law of a",
  "civil-law jurisdiction. If that happens, delete the recital of consideration.  Giving a Heading to the Body of the Contract  2.211   Some drafters insert after the lead-in and before the body of the   contract   a   heading   that   introduces   the   body   of   the contract.   Such   headings   are   favored   by   drafters   from Commonwealth countries, who are partial to naming the parts of a contract (see 2.18).  2.212   One option is   AGREEMENT , but it’s misleading, because the word   agreement   is best understood as referring to the entire contract (see 2.126). A less problematic alternative would be, for example,   OPERATIVE PROVISIONS . Simpler still would be  THE BODY OF THE CONTRACT .  2.213   But   it   serves   no   purpose   to   introduce   the   body   of   the contract twice, with the lead-in   and   a heading. Don’t use such a heading.  COVER SHEET, TABLE OF CONTENTS, AND INDEX OF DEFINED TERMS  2.214   If a contract is more than 20 pages long, consider providing from the first draft onwards a table of contents that lists page numbers for articles and sections and lists all attachments. Word-processing software makes it easy to create a table of contents and keep it up to date.  2.215   Place a table of contents before the contract proper, and use a cover sheet so the first page of the table of contents isn’t the   first   thing   the   reader   sees.   The   cover   sheet   generally contains   an   edited-down   and   spread-out   version   of   the introductory   clause,   but   you   could   include   other information,   notably   the   name,   logo,   and   contact information of the law firm primarily responsible for drafting the contract and the name and contact information of the",
  "lawyer handling the transaction. (Regarding the implications of including a logo, see 4.123.)  2.216   One also sees cover sheets that include a warning about confidentiality,   a   warning   about   trading   in   shares   with knowledge of the document, or a statement that preliminary drafts of the document are not binding. The more clutter you add to a cover sheet, the less value it has as a place to put important ancillary information.  2.217   If the contract contains an index of definitions (see 6.105), place it immediately after the table of contents.",
  "CATEGORIES OF CONTRACT LANGUAGE  3.1   Between the recitals (see 2.129) and the concluding clause (see 5.2) is the body of the contract, which contains the provisions that the parties are agreeing to—the “deal.”  3.2   A clause or sentence in the body of the contract can serve one   of   several   functions.   Each   function   requires   its   own category of language, each with its own issues of usage. The categories   are   language   of   agreement,   performance, obligation,   discretion,   prohibition,   policy,   declaration, intention, and recommendation. This chapter considers these categories of language, as well as how to express conditions by means of certain of these categories.  3.3   One category of contract language isn’t somehow stronger or weaker than another. The phrases   mere condition   and   mere covenant   (and the latter phrase’s more modern equivalent,  mere obligation ) occur in court opinions, as well as in the literature on contract law. Using the word   mere   (or   merely ) in such   comparisons   unhelpfully   suggests   that   one   category trumps   another.   Instead   they   serve   different   functions: Failure of a contract party to satisfy a condition will preclude whatever result depends on satisfaction of that condition. Failure of a contract party to comply with an obligation will entitle the other party to claim damages, and it might relieve the other party of obligations of its own. Because conditions and   obligations   serve   different   functions,   it   doesn’t   make sense to describe one category as prevailing over the other.  3.4   It makes life easier for the reader if to the extent possible you use a different verb structure for each category of contract",
  "language, consistent with the principle that you shouldn’t use a word or phrase to convey more than one meaning and shouldn’t use two or more words or phrases to convey the same meaning (see 1.64). This approach also helps the drafter figure out how to frame each provision (see 3.104). But the recommendations   in   this   chapter   don’t   invoke   notional “rules” of grammar. Instead, they reflect standard English, with such adjustments as are justified to ensure clarity and reduce the risk of dispute.  3.5   This chapter begins with figure 1, a “quick reference” chart showing   each   category   of   contract   language   and   the recommended   verb   structures,   to   make   this   topic   more accessible.

  "3.6   This   chapter   includes   tables   containing   one   or   more examples of a category of language, with each example being followed by variations on that example. Each initial example is identified by two numbers in a set of brackets, the first designating   the   number   of   the   table   and   the   second designating the number of the example within that table. For example, [3-3] denotes the third example in table 3. Each variation is given the same designation as the related initial example but is distinguished by adding a lowercase letter. For example, [3-3b] denotes the second variation on [3-3].  3.7   In   addition,   each   example   and   each   of   its   variations   is annotated   with   the   following   symbols   to   indicate   how acceptable it is:  means this usage is recommended  means that this usage, although acceptable, can be improved; that you should use it with caution; or that how acceptable it is depends on the context in which it is used  means this usage isn’t recommended  means avoid this usage  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Use the Third Person  3.8   In business contracts use the third person, as in   Acme shall purchase the Shares from Doe . That’s standard practice.  3.9   Some contracts are in the first and second person, using   we ,  us , and   our   for one party and   you   and   your   for the other. Using both the first and second person in a contract raises the issue of how one refers to both parties collectively if   we ,  us , and   our   are being used for one of the parties; your only recourse   would   be   the   rather   awkward   and   potentially confusing   both of us . Also, it’s easy to imagine a reader losing track of who   we   and   you   are.",
  "3.10   One could get around both those problems by dropping first- person pronouns in favor of a party name, but the bigger issue is whether the first and second person are suited to business contracts. The first and second person are primarily used in consumer contracts, such as insurance policies. It’s safe to assume that sophisticated business people and their attorneys can do without the intimacy that use of the first and second person seeks to foster—it quickly palls, and it has a whiff of condescension about it. Furthermore, it wouldn’t work in a contract with more than two parties.  Use the Active Voice Unless the Passive Voice Is Appropriate  3.11   For general writing, it’s standard advice that you should be wary   of   using   the   passive   voice.   That   applies   equally   to contracts.  3.12   In a sentence in the active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action— Marie ate the peach . When you use a verb in the passive voice, the subject is acted on— The peach was eaten by Marie —and what in the active voice would have been the subject is instead the passive agent. (This manual uses the term   by -agent to refer to the passive agent—in the example in the previous sentence,   Marie .) When using the passive voice, you can intentionally or inadvertently omit the  by -agent— The peach was eaten .  3.13   There are three drawbacks to using the passive voice. First, using   the   passive   voice   and   including   a   by -agent   adds unnecessary words. Second, the passive voice disrupts the normal subject–verb–object order of a sentence. And third, using the passive voice and omitting the   by -agent obscures who the actor is. Those drawbacks apply to any form of writing,   but   in   contract   prose,   the   stakes   are   high—the consequences of obscuring the actor’s identity can be drastic. So in contract prose, use the active voice unless it’s clear that there’s a benefit to using the passive voice. In particular, use the active voice to express action by a party.",
  "AN   EXAMPLE  3.14   For an example of what can happen if you use the passive voice and drop the   by -agent, see   East Texas Copy Systems, Inc. v. Player , No. 06-16-00035-CV, 2016 WL 6638865, at *1 (Tex. App. 10 Nov. 2016).  3.15   One   Jason   Player   sold   his   business   to   East   Texas   Copy Systems, Inc. As part of the sale, Player was hired by Copy Systems, starting 1 July 2013. Effective 30 June 2015, Player resigned his position with Copy Systems and immediately started competing with them.  3.16   The   asset   purchase   agreement   prohibited   Player   from competing   for   two   years.   A   separate   noncompetition agreement prohibited him from competing for two years or one   year   after   termination   of   his   employment.   The noncompetition   agreement   also   contained   the   following provision:  If Jason Player’s employment with Buyer is terminated prior to two years from the date of this Agreement for any reason other than a for cause termination, this Non-Compete Agreement will no longer be binding.  3.17   The asset purchase agreement said the same thing.  3.18   After Player quit, Copy Systems demanded that he comply with the one-year restriction. Litigation followed. The trial court granted Player’s motion for summary judgment and awarded his attorney fees and court costs.  3.19   On appeal, Copy Systems argued that the quoted language should be interpreted to only be effective if Copy Systems terminated   Player’s   employment.   The   court   disagreed, holding as follows: [T]he emphasis of the Disputed Clause is on the termination of Player’s employment, not which party initiates the termination. Under the parties’ agreement, either party could terminate the employment",
  "relationship. Therefore, we presume that the parties, by not limiting which party initiates the termination, intended that either party could initiate the termination.  3.20   The culprit in this story is use of the passive voice. In both contracts, the language at issue begins with “If Jason Player’s employment with Buyer is terminated.” It uses the passive voice, with no   by -agent, so strictly speaking, these provisions would be triggered if either party were to terminate Player’s employment. That can’t be what Copy Systems intended, because it rendered the noncompetition provisions toothless.  3.21   From the perspective of the drafter, whether the appeals court   was   right   in   interpreting   the   contracts   strictly   is irrelevant.   Instead,   what   matters   is   that   this   case demonstrates   that   if   you   use   the   passive   voice,   you   can inadvertently drop the   by -agent and find that you don’t have the deal you expected. If you use the active voice, you’re forced to include the actor, which forces you to figure out what you want to have happen.  APPROPRIATE   USE   OF   THE   PASSIVE   VOICE  3.22   In general writing, sometimes you’re justified in using the passive voice—among other considerations, the actor might be unimportant or unknown, or you might want to focus on the thing being acted on. That’s the case with contract prose too.  3.23   Consider   this   example   of   use   of   the   passive   voice:   if   a Necessary Project Approval is revoked . One could use the active voice instead— if a Person revokes a Necessary Project Approval — but that would add nothing. What matters is whether an approval has been revoked, and it would be beside the point to shift the focus to who’s doing the revoking, whether it be a government agency, a company, or an individual.  3.24   Here’s   another   example:   No   party   will   be   bound   by   this amendment until the Parent, the Borrowers, and the Required",
  "Lenders have signed a counterpart.   It would serve no purpose to use instead the active voice, thereby shifting the focus from the parties to the amendment— This amendment will bind no party   ... .  Throat-Clearing  3.25   A   distinctive   feature   of   traditional   contract   language   is extraneous verb structures tacked on to the front of what would otherwise be separate sentences. This manual refers to this practice as “throat-clearing.” Here’s a sample of such verb structures:  1.   Acme agrees that [Acme shall ...] . 2.   It is agreed that ... . 3.   Acme covenants that ... . 4.   Acme represents that ... . 5.   Acme represents, warrants, covenants, and agrees that ... . 6.   Acme acknowledges that ... . 7.   Acme warrants that ... . 8.   Acme warrants and agrees that ... . 9.   Acme guarantees that ... . 10. Acme promises that ... . 11. Acme intends that ... .  3.26   The first of the above examples is followed by language of obligation (see 3.70),   but   throat-clearing   can   precede   any category of contract language.  3.27   A   throat-clearing   verb   structure   can   be   mistaken   for   the principal verb structure of a sentence. Of the above examples, example 1 and 2 look like language of agreement (see 3.30), example 3 looks like old-fashioned language of obligation (see 3.113),   examples   4   and   6   appear   to   be   language   of declaration (see 3.371), and example 7 appears to express a",
  "warranty (see 13.884). (Examples 5 and 8 use multiple verb structures.) But throat-clearing verb structures are neutralized by the verb structure that follows, so all that throat-clearing accomplishes is to suggest a general assent to the rest of the sentence. That assent is redundant, because the essence of a contract is that the parties assent to everything in the body of the contract. That’s the function of the lead-in (see 2.160).  3.28   Throat-clearing adds useless clutter to a contract, so drafters should be alert to it. So too should anyone who reviews contracts.   If   making   a   contract   shorter   and   clearer   isn’t enough to justify asking the other side to remove throat- clearing from their draft, you could also point out that it can create confusion. In   UBS Securities LLC v. Highland Capital Management, L.P. , 906 N.Y.S.2d 784 (Sup. Ct. 2009),   rev’d , 893 N.Y.S.2d   869   (App.   Div.   2010),   the   court   attributed substantive   significance   to   “UBS   Securities   and   [Highland Capital] agree that ... .” It was in fact meaningless throat- clearing.  Consolidating Deal Points  3.29   Drafters are prone to addressing each deal point in a separate sentence.   Consolidating   deal   points   by   using   one   verb structure for multiple deal points allows you to address those deal   points   more   clearly   and   concisely   than   you   would otherwise. Here are two examples.  Separate   Consolidated  The Licensee shall make all regulatory filings. The Licensee shall decide in which countries to file for regulatory approval. The Licensee shall make all regulatory filings in those countries in which it decides to seek Regulatory Approval for a Product. Acme shall pay each invoice no later than 30 days after it receives that invoice. Acme shall pay each invoice by bank transfer no later than 30 days after it receives that invoice.",
  "For Acme’s payment of an invoice to be valid, Acme must pay that invoice by bank transfer.  LANGUAGE OF AGREEMENT  3.30   In “language of agreement,” one or more parties state that they   agree   with   specified   contract   language.   Language   of agreement should appear only once in a contract—in the lead-in, which states that the parties   agree as follows   (see 2.160).  3.31   Language   of   agreement   is   distinct   from   language   of performance   (see   3.33)   and   language   of   declaration   (see 3.371) because it expresses a state of mind rather than a party taking an action or stating a fact. That’s why it wouldn’t make sense to use   hereby   in language of agreement—it’s a feature of language of performance.  3.32   For an example of throat-clearing masquerading as language of agreement, see 3.25–.27.  LANGUAGE OF PERFORMANCE  3.33   In standard English, one can accomplish with a speech act, such as   I quit! , an action involving a change in status. Speech acts also occur in contracts. One example is   Acme hereby grants the License to Smith ; for another example, see [1-1]. This manual calls such speech acts “language of performance.” They   use   the   present   tense,   and   they   express   actions accomplished by signing the contract.  3.34   The   term   “language   of   performance”   is   unrelated   to   the concept of performance under a contract. Instead, it echoes the linguistics term for such a speech act—a   performative .",

[1-4c]   Acme hereby licenses to Widgetco the right to use the Marks in ... . [1-4d]   Acme hereby grants to Widgetco a license to use the Marks in ... .  Use of   Hereby   in Language of Performance  3.35   One helpful element of language of performance is   hereby,  which signals that the act described is being accomplished by the speech act itself. You could omit   hereby , as in [1-1a], but this use of   hereby   is consistent with standard English. If you omit   hereby   from   Doe hereby purchases the Shares , it would be clear from the context that the intended meaning isn’t that Doe is in the habit of purchasing certain shares. But in purely grammatical   terms,   one   couldn’t   exclude   that   meaning without using   hereby .   The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language , at 860 n.3, confirms as much: Clauses like   I promise to return the key   and   I order you to leave   are ambiguous, having also less salient interpretations in which they are statements about my habitual behaviour (“I habitually promise to return the key / order you to leave”): in this interpretation they are not performatives since they do not themselves constitute a promise or order.  3.36   This alternative meaning is unlikely to create confusion, but it could distract readers. Eliminate the alternative meaning by using   hereby .  3.37   In language of performance, don’t replace   hereby   with   by this agreement : the   here - in   hereby   is best considered as relating to",
  "that language of performance rather than the agreement as a whole. It would be appropriate to replace   hereby   when it’s used other than in language of performance (see 13.350).  Problematic Usages  3.38   To make it clear who the actor is (see 3.11), always use the active voice in language of performance instead of using the passive voice (as in [1-1b]).  3.39   Don’t   use   the   present   continuous   in   language   of performance, as in [1-1c]. The present continuous is used to express an event that’s unfolding—that’s not appropriate for language   of   performance.   Instead,   the   action   occurs instantaneously.  3.40   Don’t use   do   as an auxiliary in language of performance, as in [1-1d]; it’s an archaism. And don’t use   agrees to , as in [1- 1e],   because   that   could   lead   to   a   fight   over   whether   it’s language   of   performance   or   language   of   obligation   (see 3.109).   Combining   both   usages,   as   in   [1-1f],   adds   to   the confusion.  3.41   Don’t attempt to turn language of obligation (see 3.70), such as   Acme shall grant the License to Smith ,   into   language   of performance by adding   on the date of this agreement , as in [1- 1g]. Doing so would impose on Acme the obligation to grant the license sometime on the date of the agreement, but that would be a confusing alternative to having the grant take place simultaneously with signing the agreement.  3.42   Don’t use   is pleased to   to express language of performance, as in [1-1h]. Here’s an example of that usage:   The Bank is pleased to provide its commitment for the entire amount of the Facility . Here’s another:   Acme Trust is pleased to retain Doe Compliance Consulting, LLC . The deferential tone that   is pleased to   affords might seem appropriate in a particular context, but   is pleased to   doesn’t make it clear that the action in question is being accomplished by that speech act.",
  "3.43   Be careful about using   irrevocably   (meaning “unalterably”) in language of performance, as in [1-1i]. Usually   irrevocably   is redundant—when   a   contract   party   takes   an   action,   it’s implicit that absent anything in the contract to the contrary, the action can’t be undone. Thus, in   irrevocably purchases ,  irrevocably waives ,   irrevocably releases , and   irrevocably consents , the word   irrevocably   is redundant. See, e.g.,   Reyes v. Lincoln Automotive   Financial   Services ,   No.   16-2104-CV,   2017   WL 2675363   (2d   Cir.   22   June   2017)   (under   common   law,   a consent granted in a contract is irrevocable). For the same reason, don’t use words like   unconditionally ,   absolutely , and  forever   in language of performance.  3.44   But it’s appropriate to use   irrevocably   with   appoint . That’s because the power to appoint a person to a position might also include the power to remove that person. If you don’t want that to be the case, say so;   irrevocably   accomplishes that.  3.45   Similarly, if a party consents to ongoing conduct by another party, as opposed to a one-time action, it would be prudent to use   irrevocably , to avoid any suggestion that the consenting party would at some point be permitted to change its mind.  Actions That Don’t Work in Language of Performance  3.46   If an action relates to something other than a change of status   of   a   person   or   thing,   don’t   use   language   of performance. For example, it doesn’t make sense to say   The Buyer hereby pays the Seller : you can’t pay someone just by saying so.  Indicating Absence of Performance  3.47   It’s occasionally helpful to state that one or more parties are not taking a specified action on signing the contract. But in doing   so,   don’t   use   language   of   performance   retooled   to express   the   negative,   as   in   [1-2]   and   [1-2a]—language   of performance accomplishes actions, and what you’re seeking",
  "to express is the absence of action. Instead, use language of policy (see 3.305), as in [1-2b].  Future Performance  3.48   If you’re looking to state the consequences of entry into a contract or issuance of a document in the future, you could conceivably   use   language   of   performance,   but   with   will  instead of the present tense and   thereby   instead of   hereby , as in [1-3]. But that’s not how language of performance works in standard English—it’s not for accomplishing actions in the future with a speech act now. Use instead   will be deemed , as in [1-3a]. (Regarding   deem , see 13.216.)  In Buying and Selling  3.49   For a transaction that occurs when the contract is signed,  Acme hereby purchases the Assets from Doe   and   Doe hereby sells the Assets to Acme   are equivalent. Each verb refers not to a unilateral action but instead to transfer of whatever is being sold—if Acme is purchasing assets from Doe, it follows that Doe is selling them, and vice versa. The verb you choose simply   determines   which   party’s   perspective   you   adopt— perhaps that of your client. It has no substantive significance.  3.50   So it’s unnecessary to use both   purchase   and   sell , as in   Acme hereby purchases the Assets from Doe and Doe hereby sells the Assets to Acme . But in the United States, that formulation is perhaps the one used most often. That might be due to the influence of language of obligation, where reciprocity makes sense: if you omit one of   Acme shall purchase the Assets from Doe   and   Doe shall sell the Assets to Acme , one party wouldn’t be committed to the transaction.  3.51   Furthermore, drafters might feel more comfortable having the language explicitly reflect the reciprocal nature of the transaction, even at the cost of redundancy. So if you use either   purchase   or   sell , be prepared to have someone ask you",
  "to use both. (Regarding use of   purchase   instead of   buy , see 13.124.)  For Performance of Services  3.52   Language of obligation (see 3.70) is the default category of contract language for expressing performance of services. But if the services to be performed are such that they are used to define   the   parties   performing   them,   using   labels   such   as  agent ,   employee ,   and   attorney-in-fact ,   it   can   sound   more natural   to   use   language   of   performance   with   the   verbs  appoints ,   employs , and   retains . The more prevalent the label, the more likely it is that language of performance is the better choice.  3.53   Here’s   an   example   expressed   first   using   language   of performance, then language of obligation:  The Fund hereby appoints the Agent as its “Investor Servicing Agent” in accordance with this agreement. The Agent shall act as the Fund’s “Investor Servicing Agent” in accordance with this agreement.  3.54   In   that   example,   language   of   performance   is   the   more natural choice, but it seems unnecessary in the following example, because the services in question aren’t susceptible to applying a label to those who perform them:  Acme hereby appoints ABC to perform in accordance with this agreement the administrative, bookkeeping, and pricing services stated in appendix A. ABC shall perform for Acme in accordance with this agreement the administrative, bookkeeping, and pricing services stated in appendix A.  Advantages of Granting Language  3.55   Language of performance using the verb   grants , as in   Acme hereby   grants   Smith   the   License ,   offers   advantages   over",
  "alternative ways of conveying the same meaning.  INSTEAD   OF   LANGUAGE   OF   DISCRETION  3.56   Granting language is analogous to language of discretion. Consider [1-4], [1-4a], and [1-4b]. They all convey the same meaning, but granting language using the noun   license , as in [1-4], offers two advantages.  3.57   First, license-granting language makes it clear that discretion is   being   accorded   regarding   something   that   the   licensor controls.  3.58   And second, using the concept of a license allows you also to use, as necessary, the concept of a sublicense. Articulating the notion of   A to B to C   using language of discretion would be trickier and wordier.  3.59   So it makes sense to use granting language in contexts where the advantages over language of discretion are relevant. It also makes sense to use granting language in the kinds of transactions where use of granting language is entrenched. In both   cases,   that   means   contracts   dealing   with   rights   to software and intellectual property.  3.60   Resist   the   urge   to   use   granting   language   more   generally. Below is an example using language of performance; below it is a version using language of discretion. The version using language of discretion is shorter and clearer.  The Customer hereby grants Acme a perpetual, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to use data on performance and output of the Covered Equipment ... . During the term of this agreement and thereafter, Acme may use data on performance and output of the Covered Equipment ... .  INSTEAD   OF   THE   VERB   LICENSE  3.61   Instead of the granting language in [1-4] you could use the verb   license ,   as   in   [1-4c],   to   grant   discretion.   But   using granting language plus the noun   license   allows the drafter to",
  "add adjectives as necessary:   nonexclusive ,   irrevocable ,   perpetual , and so on. That’s simpler than using adverbs to modify the verb   license .  3.62   Another drawback to the verb   license   is that   Acme hereby licenses   on its own could mean that Acme is the licensee or that it’s the licensor.  3.63   Use of the verb   lease   in language of performance raises the same   issues,   but   evidently   drafters   have   decided   that   the advantages of using the noun   license   don’t apply to use of the verb   lease —it would be unorthodox to say   Jones hereby grants Smith a lease   instead of   Jones hereby leases to Smith .  USE   GRANT   INSTEAD   OF   GRANT   TO  3.64   The only difference between [1-4] and [1-4d] is that in [1-4d],  hereby   grants   is   followed   by   to .   You   see   both   usages   in contracts, but the better choice is to omit the   to . Consider the following sentences:  I gave John a book. I gave a book to John. *I gave to John a book.  3.65   The   first   sentence   matches   the   structure   of   [1-4].   It’s   a ditransitive   clause,   with   a   direct   and   indirect   object.   The second sentence is a monotransitive clause—it has just one object—plus   a   prepositional   phrase   using   to .   See   The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language , at 248.  3.66   When you use a monotransitive structure, the prepositional phrase conventionally comes at the end. If you have a simple direct object, it sounds odd to put the prepositional phrase before the direct object, as in the third sentence. (That’s why the third sentence is marked with an asterisk.)  3.67   But if the direct object is lengthy, that can preclude putting the prepositional phrase after the direct object. That would be the case with a direct object beginning   a license to   ... .",
  "Your only choice would be to put the prepositional phrase before the direct object, as in [1-4d]. But not only is the   to  oddly positioned, it’s also superfluous, because without it you would have a conventional ditransitive structure, as in [1-4]. That’s why the ditransitive structure is your best alternative.  3.68   Little is riding on this distinction, but it’s best to have a reasoned basis for selecting among alternative usages.  3.69   This distinction applies to other verbs, including   pay , and applies to other categories of contract language in addition to language of performance.  LANGUAGE OF OBLIGATION  3.70   “Language of obligation” is used to state any duty that a contract   imposes   on   one   or   more   parties.   In   terms   of structure, language of obligation falls into two categories, depending   on   whether   the   obligation   is   imposed   on   the subject of the sentence (see 3.72) or on someone other than the subject (see 3.131).  3.71   Language of obligation also serves as one way to express contract conditions (see 3.356).  Language of Obligation Imposed on the Subject of a Sentence  USING   SHALL   TO   MEAN   ONLY   HAS   A   DUTY   TO  3.72   In   the   example   in   table   2,   Acme   is   the   subject   of   the sentence. To state that Acme has a duty to purchase the Shares   from   Doe,   use   shall ,   as   in   [2-1].   This   manual recommends not using   shall   in contract drafting to express any other meaning.  TABLE 2   LANGUAGE OF OBLIGATION IMPOSED ON SUBJECT OF SENTENCE  [2-1]   Acme shall purchase the Shares from Doe.",
  "[2-1a]   Acme must purchase ... . [2-1b]   Acme will purchase ... . [2-1c]   Acme agrees to purchase ... . [2-1d]   Acme promises to purchase ... . [2-1e]   Acme undertakes to purchase ... . [2-1f]   Acme is bound to purchase ... . [2-1g]   Acme covenants to purchase ... . [2-1h]   Acme commits to purchasing ... . [2-1i]   Acme has a duty to purchase ... . [2-1j]   Acme shall be obligated to purchase ... . [2-1k]   Acme is obligated to purchase ... . [2-1l]   Acme is responsible for purchasing ... . [2-1m]   Acme will be expected to purchase ... .  3.73   Courts   have   long   recognized   use   of   shall   to   express obligations. For business contracts, as opposed to statutes, it’s unlikely that anyone could successfully argue that instead of expressing an obligation, a particular   shall   is “discretionary” and means   may   or   should .   In   PacifiCorp   v.   Sempra   Energy Trading Corp. , No. CIV-04-0701 (E.D. Cal. 2 July 2004), the court held in a contract dispute that   shall   can mean   should . But the one case it cites involved statutory interpretation,",
  "and otherwise it cites only the second edition of   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage   (see 3.83, 3.86). It’s an outlier.  3.74   As an initial diagnostic test for use of   shall   in a provision, check whether the provision would still make sense if you were to replace   shall   with   has   [or   have ]   a duty to . (This manual refers to this test as the “ has a duty   test,” using the word   duty  in this context simply because it’s less of a mouthful than  obligation ; see 3.171.) But just because a   shall   passes the   has a duty   test doesn’t mean that the provision makes sense as an obligation. It might be better phrased as a condition (see 3.356–.362).  3.75   Use of   shall   in contracts is a contentious subject, so the basis for the use of   shall   recommended in 3.72 is explained in 3.76–.108.  THE   MEANING   OF   SHALL   AND   WILL  3.76   Shall   is a modal auxiliary verb. Unlike the other auxiliaries ( be ,   do ,   have ), the modal auxiliaries ( shall ,   will ,   must ,   can ,   may ,  should ,   would ,   could ,   might )   supply   information   about   the mood of the main verb that follows.   Shall   was originally a full verb   (like   eat ,   walk ,   and   play )   conveying   obligation   or compulsion, but now it’s used only as an auxiliary, as is the modal   will , which originally carried the sense of volition.  3.77   Because obligations and intentions concern future conduct, and because there’s no true future tense in English similar to the present tense ( works ) and past tense   (worked), shall   and  will   also came to be used with future time .  3.78   The result is that   shall   and   will   have each been used to express modal meanings and to mark future time. A rule arose, at least in theory, and perhaps only in England, to distinguish these two uses: to express future time, use   shall  with the first person and   will   with the second or third person, and   do   the   reverse   to   convey   modal   meanings.   This cumbersome rule developed many exceptions.",
  "3.79   The rule and its exceptions have largely been abandoned in much of the world—in common usage, use of   shall   is now largely limited to stock phrases such as   We shall overcome   and questions in the first person that seek direction or suggest politely —Shall we go now?   But in the stylized context of the language of business contracts, which generally use only the third person (see 3.8),   shall   continues to serve as the principal means of expressing obligations.  THE   PROBLEM   OF   OVERUSE  3.80   Contract   drafters   use   shall   to   do   more   than   express obligations.   They   use   it   to   express   future   time,   even   in contexts where in everyday English one would use the simple present tense instead of   will . (See, for example, [8-2b] and [16-1a].)   As   a   result,   business   contracts   exhibit   rampant overuse of the word, making   shall   a glaring violator of the principle that in drafting, you shouldn’t use a word or phrase to convey more than one meaning (see 1.64). It’s as if many drafters fear that a contract provision without a   shall   would be unenforceable.  3.81   This   overuse   of   shall   plays   a   leading   role   in   distancing contract   prose   from   standard   English,   thereby   making contracts   harder   to   read.   It   also   helps   render   drafters oblivious to nuances in determining how to express in a contract   who   is   doing   what,   to   whom,   and   why.   This obliviousness can result in disputes, particularly over whether a provision is a condition or an obligation (see 3.357–.361).  THE   MODEST   BENEFITS   OF   ELIMINATING   SHALL  3.82   One way to address overuse of   shall   is to be more disciplined in how you use the word—hence the recommendation in 3.72.  3.83   But   some   commentators   on   legal   writing—notably   Bryan Garner—advocate   doing   away   with   shall   because   it’s   too prone to misuse and is inconsistent with general English",
  "usage. As noted in   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage,   at 953, “few lawyers have the semantic acuity to identify correct and incorrect   shall s   even after a few hours of study. That being so, there can hardly be much hope of the profession’s using   shall  consistently.”   For   the   anti- shall   view   from   an   Australian perspective, see Michèle M. Asprey,   Plain Language for Lawyers  205–16 (4th ed. 2010).  3.84   It might be a good idea to eliminate   shall   from court rules, statutes, and consumer contracts, but it doesn’t automatically follow that the same approach should be applied to business contracts—they   serve   a   different   function   and   address   a different   audience.   Instead,   banning   shall   from   business contracts offers only modest benefits, and they’re outweighed by the drawbacks.  3.85   Eliminating   shall   would prevent drafters from using   shall  instead of   will   to express future time, as in   This agreement shall terminate when the Acme Contract terminates .   But that’s unlikely to result in confusion as to meaning, even though it’s not ideal (see 3.308). The same applies to use of   shall   to express future time when the simple present tense would be more appropriate (see 3.307), as in   This agreement shall be governed by New York law .   Furthermore, depriving drafters of  shall   would be unlikely to make them more restrained in electing to express future time—the most likely result would be overuse of   will.  3.86   More generally, the risks posed by   shall   can be overstated .  For example, to indicate those risks,   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage,   at 953, points to the “more than 120 pages” devoted to   shall   in West’s multivolume   Words and Phrases . But of the cases cited, most involve the language of statutes, not contracts. At least in part, that’s due to courts having recognized the discretionary   shall   (see 3.73) for interpreting statutes but not for interpreting contracts.  3.87   The only issue relating to overuse of   shall   that routinely results in contract disputes is uncertainty regarding whether a",
  "provision using   shall   is an obligation or a condition (see 3.357–.361).   Replacing   shall   with   must   or   any   other   verb wouldn’t resolve that problem. Instead, you would have to supplement   the   provision   to   make   it   clear   that   you’re expressing a condition (see 3.361).  USING   MUST   INSTEAD   OF   SHALL  3.88   Anyone   contemplating   eliminating   shall   from   contracts should consider not only the modest benefits of doing so but also the drawbacks of the alternatives available to impose an obligation on the subject of the sentence.  3.89   One alternative to using   shall   to serve this function is   must  (see [2-1a]). Asprey favors this approach.  3.90   But replacing   shall   with   must   would result in   must   being used to   express   any   obligation,   whether   it’s   imposed   on   the subject   of   a   sentence —The   Company   must   reimburse   the Consultant   for   all   authorized   expenses   (see   3.72)—or   on someone else— The Closing must take place at Acme’s offices  (see 3.133). Furthermore,   must   also features in one way to express conditions (see 3.359). So using   must   for stating an obligation imposed on the subject of a sentence would result in   must   being used to convey different meanings. Muddying the distinction between obligations and conditions by using  must   for both is particularly pernicious.  USING   WILL   INSTEAD   OF   MUST  3.91   Another obstacle to using   must   as an alternative to   shall   for imposing obligations on the subject of a sentence is that many drafters consider   must   overbearing .  3.92   Asprey dismisses that objection as being “based on taste, not logic.” But it’s unrealistic to expect drafters to ignore issues of tone when deciding how to express obligations.  3.93   That’s why in   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage,   at 953–54, Garner endorses use of   will   (as in [2-1b]) instead of   must:",
  "In private drafting—contracts as opposed to statutes, rules, and regulations—some drafters consider   must  inappropriately bossy. The word may strike the wrong tone particularly when both parties to a contract are known quantities, such as two well-known corporations. It seems unlikely that, for example, an American car manufacturer and a Japanese car manufacturer engaging in a joint venture would want the word   must   to set forth their various responsibilities. Indeed, it seems odd to draft one’s own contractual responsibilities with   must : a lawyer for Ford Motor Company is unlikely to write   Ford must ... Ford must ... Ford must ... .   The word   will   is probably the best solution here.  3.94   This   assessment   is   puzzling   in   three   respects.   First,   why should the word you use to express obligations depend on how   well-known   the   parties   are?   Second,   it   suggests   the possibility of varying the word used to express an obligation depending   on   whether   the   obligation   is   imposed   on   the drafter’s   client   or   another   party—distinction   for   which there’s   no   basis   in   linguistics   or   the   law.   And   third,   the suggestion that   will   is “probably the best solution” is oddly wishy-washy.  3.95   And Garner’s assessment doesn’t address the two drawbacks of   using   will   to   impose   obligations.   The   first   is   that   in standard English   will   primarily expresses future time rather than obligations.   Will   is also used to express compulsion — You   will   eat   your   spinach! —but   that   use   isn’t   directly analogous to expressing contract obligations. The second is that if you use   will   to impose an obligation on the subject of a sentence, you would also use it to impose an obligation on someone other than the subject of the sentence, as well as to express future time. Such multiple meanings are exactly what currently afflict use of   shall .  EVERYDAY   USE   OF   SHALL",
  "3.96   Another   objection   to   shall   is   that   it   makes   no   sense   to perpetuate it in contracts, given that   use of   shall   in general usage has greatly diminished (see 3.79). But because standard English isn’t suited to expressing contract obligations and because of the benefit of using different verb structures for different categories of contract language,   shall   serves a real need.   It   shouldn’t   be   disconcerting   to   have   shall   serve   a broader role in contracts than it does in everyday English, given the limited and stylized nature of contract language (see p. xxxiii).  FLIGHT   FROM   SHALL ?  3.97   At any one time, individual lawyers, or groups of lawyers, or conceivably entire organizations, might decline to use   shall . But   there’s   no   sign   of   headlong   flight   from   shall .   Bryan Garner acknowledges as much, as   Garner’s   Modern   English Usage , at 825, says that “ shall   seems likely to persist” in legal documents. In most jurisdictions,   shall   remains overused in contracts.  3.98   Australian   drafters   appear   more   willing   than   others   to dispense with   shall , but review of an unscientific sample of contracts drafted by Australian law firms suggests that even in Australia, many contracts use   shall .  MISSING   THE   BIGGER   PROBLEM  3.99   The focus on   shall   has drawn attention away from the bigger problem—the   chaotic   verb   structures   on   display   in mainstream contract drafting.  3.100   Banishing   shall   addresses the most obvious symptom of the ailment, not the ailment itself. To varying degrees, contracts that don’t use   shall   invariably exhibit undisciplined use of verb structures. See, e.g., Kenneth A. Adams,   Google’s Services Agreement? Lots of Room for Improvement , Adams on Contract Drafting   (4   Mar.   2014),",
  "http://www.adamsdrafting.com/googles-services-agreement- lots-of-room-for-improvement/.  3.101   Using   shall   to mean only “has a duty to” (see 3.74) is a big step toward curing the ailment. It’s well suited to the task, and the   has a duty   test provides a simple way to ensure that  shall   isn’t used for any other purpose.  3.102   It’s too pessimistic to say disciplined use of   shall   is beyond the reach of most lawyers (see 3.83). The test for disciplined use of   shall— use   it   to   mean   only   “has   a   duty   to”—does require a modest amount of semantic acuity on the part of drafters, but no more than what’s required for competent drafting.  3.103   Besides, it’s too early to write most drafters off as incapable of disciplined use of   shall— the notion that clear drafting requires complying with objective standards is still relatively novel. The key to rigorous verb use is training and reliable reference materials. That might sound unrealistic, but it’s more plausible than the notion that drafters will purge their contracts of   shall   despite the uncertain benefits of doing so and the manifest shortcomings of the alternatives.  APPLYING   THE   HAS   A   DUTY   TEST — AN   EXAMPLE  3.104   To   get   a   sense   of   the   value   of   the   has   a   duty   test   as   a diagnostic   tool,   consider   the   standard   arbitration   clause recommended by the American Arbitration Association.  3.105   It’s   a   piece   of   traditional   contract   drafting,   with   all   the shortcomings   that   implies.   In   particular,   it   includes   the following: “Any controversy or claim ... shall be settled by arbitration   administered   by   the   American   Arbitration Association.” That   shall   fails the   has a duty   test, and it isn’t amenable to a quick fix. It uses the passive voice, with the parties as the missing   by -agent (see 3.12).  3.106   You could instead use the active voice—“The parties shall settle”—but it doesn’t make sense to impose on the parties an",
  "obligation to arbitrate all disputes. Some disputes are more serious than others, and presumably a contract party would seek arbitration for only the most serious, as opposed to seeking   mediation   or   informal   negotiations   or   simply shrugging off the grievance.  3.107   The best way to reflect that nuance would be to use language of discretion, to allow a party to demand arbitration, while also making it clear that arbitration is the only means of dispute   resolution   permitted:   “As   the   exclusive   means   of initiating adversarial proceedings to resolve any dispute ... a party may demand that the dispute be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association.”  3.108   For   a   complete   analysis   of   the   American   Arbitration Association’s   standard   arbitration   clause,   see   Kenneth   A. Adams,   The   AAA   Standard   Arbitration   Clause:   Room   for Improvement,   New York Law Journal, 9 Mar. 2010.  OTHER   PROBLEMATIC   USAGES  3.109   Some   drafters   rely   on   other   verb   structures   to   express obligations imposed on the subject of a sentence. One is  agrees to , as in [2-1c]. Its only advantage is that it can’t be used to express future time. Most drafters who use   agrees to  use it to impose an obligation, but some might use it as language of performance (see 3.33), with the idea that   Acme agrees to assign its rights   means the same thing as   Acme hereby assigns its rights . In one dispute, a litigant attributed that meaning to   agrees to . See   IpVenture, Inc. v. Prostar Computer, Inc. , 503 F.3d 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2007). And it’s easy to imagine those partial to   agrees to   also using it, unhelpfully, instead of  must   to express conditions (see 3.356).  3.110   Furthermore,   agrees to   is awkward when used to express an obligation that would apply only in the future, as in   If X, then Acme   agrees   to   Y .   That   could   be   cured   by   reversing   the phrases, as in   Acme agrees to X, if Y , but that won’t always be",
  "feasible. And besides,   agrees to   is too clumsy to use with any frequency.  3.111   Because of these shortcomings, don’t use   agrees to   to express obligations.  3.112   Promises   to   (see   [2-1d])   occurs   most   often   in   the   phrase  promises to pay , which is standard in promissory notes and other negotiable instruments. But 4 Hawkland UCC Series § 3-102:10 (2016) notes that “the word ‘promise’ need not appear” in negotiable instruments, although “the language used must be promissory in nature.” A different deal context doesn’t justify using a different verb structure to express an obligation; consistency favors saying instead   shall pay .  3.113   Undertakes   to   (see   [2-1e]),   is   bound   to   (see   [2-1f]),   and  covenants to   (see [2-1g]) also have the virtue that they can’t be used to express future time, but they’re too awkward to be plausible alternatives to   shall . (Regarding the noun   covenant , see 3.165.) Couplets such as   covenants and agrees to   merely add redundancy to the shortcomings of each component. As for   commits to   plus gerund (see [2-1h]), it’s too colloquial. And   is committed to   serves to express a general position—it’s appropriate for press releases, not contracts.  3.114   Drafters   also   use   shall   be   obligated   to   (see   [2-1j]).   It’s inconsistent with disciplined use of   shall , in that applying the   has   a   duty   test   (see   3.74)   yields   “has   a   duty   to   be obligated,” which doesn’t make sense. Using   is obligated to  (see [2-1k]) represents little improvement—it’s long-winded and could be understood to mean that the obligation arises not   from   that   language   but   from   some   other   source. (Regarding the British preference for   obliged   over   obligated , see 3.269.)  3.115   The same goes for   has a duty to   (see [2-1i]), notwithstanding the role of that phrase in helping drafters use   shall   to express only a duty imposed on the subject of a sentence (see 3.74).",
  "3.116   And   will be expected to   (see [2-1m]) is oddly circumspect, as if it would be too vulgar simply to impose an obligation. It’s not clear what the consequences would be if the expectations aren’t met. This formula appears in employment agreements.  USE   THE   INDICATIVE   MOOD  3.117   The   Construction   Specifications   Institute’s   Project   Delivery Practice   Guide ,   a   widely   used   resource   on   preparing architectural   specifications,   recommends   that   you   use   the imperative   mood   to   express   obligations   in   architectural specifications.   This   manual   doesn’t   endorse   that recommendation.  3.118   Architectural   specifications   are   attached   to   construction contracts   and   define   the   requirements   for   products, materials, and workmanship and for project administration and   performance.   They’re   a   specialized   form   of   contract language.   Project Delivery Practice Guide   is the only resource that   recommends   using   the   imperative   mood   to   express contract obligations.  3.119   English   has   three   moods—the   indicative   mood,   the imperative   mood,   and   the   subjunctive   mood.   (For   our purposes,   we   can   ignore   the   subjunctive.)   The   indicative mood is the most common and is used to express facts and opinions and to pose questions. The imperative mood is used to instruct or request that someone do or not do something:  Feed the dog. Don’t eat the pizza. Stop!  3.120   Here’s what   Project Delivery Practice Guide   says about mood: 11.3.5.2   Sentence Structure Two basic grammatical sentence moods can be used to clearly convey specification requirements:  Imperative Mood.   The imperative mood is the recommended method for instructions covering the installation of products and equipment. The verb that clearly defines the action becomes the first word in",
  "the sentence, such as: spread adhesive with notched trowel. The imperative sentence is concise and readily understandable.  Indicative Mood.   The indicative mood, passive voice requires the use of shall in nearly every statement. This sentence structure can cause unnecessary wordiness and monotony, such as: adhesive shall be spread with notched trowel.  3.121   But the imperative mood isn’t up to expressing the full range of obligations. A set of instructions in the imperative mood can be directed at only one person—the contractor—whereas architectural specifications can also impose obligations on the owner or on the architect. If you use the imperative mood for contractor obligations, you would have to switch to the indicative mood for owner or architect obligations. That would make for an odd mix.  3.122   Even   if   you   assume   that   all   obligations   in   a   set   of specifications   are   imposed   on   the   contractor,   you   would likely need to do more than bark instructions. Specifications can also feature language of discretion ( The Contractor may ... ), language of policy ( The Architect will be responsible for ... ), and conditions ( It is a condition to acceptance of the Work that ... ), all of them using the indicative mood. Switching back and forth from the imperative mood to the indicative mood would be awkward.  3.123   And what   Project Delivery Practice Guide   has to say about use of the indicative mood doesn’t put it in proper perspective. If you want to avoid “unnecessary wordiness,” you shouldn’t limit   yourself   to   the   passive   voice—it’s   conducive   to wordiness (see 3.13). It would be a simple matter to preface a set   of   contractor   obligations   with   something   like   The Contractor shall do the following , using the active voice, and state the obligations as tabulated enumerated clauses. Each such enumerated clause would be in the indicative mood and",
  "would be identical to obligations stated in the imperative ( spread adhesive with a notched trowel ).  3.124   But   there’s   no   sign   of   anyone   outside   of   construction specifications emulating this aspect of   Project Delivery Practice Guide ,   so   use   of   the   imperative   mood   in   architectural specifications   isn’t   a   matter   of   broader   concern.   (A   rare instance of use of the imperative mood in contracts is the phrase   Read before signing ; see 5.42.)  DON ’ T   USE   THE   SIMPLE   PRESENT   TENSE  3.125   A model construction contract,   The New Engineering Contract , recommends that you use the simple present tense to express obligations.   This   manual   doesn’t   endorse   that recommendation.  3.126   The New Engineering Contract , created by the Institution of Civil Engineers, a UK organization, is a guide to drafting documents for civil-engineering and construction projects. It’s used in the United Kingdom and internationally. Here are two examples of how it uses the simple present tense to express obligations (emphasis added):  ... the Contractor   keeps   accounts of his payments of actual cost ... . A Partner may ask another Partner to provide information that it needs to carry out work in its own contract and the other party  provides   it.  3.127   But in standard English, expressing obligations is not one of the functions of the present tense used with the third person. It’s   standard   to   use   the   present   tense   in   checklists,   for example   the   World   Health   Organization’s   surgical   safety checklist   (“Nurse   Verbally   Confirms   ...).   But   checklists remind users how best to carry out procedures—they don’t impose obligations.  IS   RESPONSIBLE   FOR",
  "3.128   Don’t use   is responsible for   plus present participle (see [2-1l]) to express duties owed to another party. It’s long-winded. It’s also potentially confusing, because it’s not clear whether a provision   using   is   responsible   for   itself   creates   a   duty   or acknowledges the existence of a duty that derives from some other source.  3.129   Using   is responsible for   would, however, allow you to convey that although a party is free to handle as it wishes a particular obligation it owes to a nonparty, that party would have to bear any resulting liabilities. For example, if a transaction between Acme and Widgetco risks creating a tax liability for Acme,   Widgetco’s   concern,   strictly   speaking,   shouldn’t   be that Acme pay the tax, but that Acme not look to Widgetco to pay the tax, that Acme pay the tax if any tax authority requires Widgetco to pay the tax, and that Acme reimburse Widgetco if Widgetco ends up paying the tax. So it would make sense for the Acme–Widgetco contract to provide that Acme   is   responsible   for   paying   any   taxes.   This   use   of   is responsible for   is language of policy.  3.130   Although in that context   is responsible for   would make more sense semantically, imposing an obligation on Acme to pay any   taxes   would   have   the   same   effect,   because   Widgetco would have a cause of action against Acme only if Widgetco were harmed by Acme’s having failed to pay any taxes.  Language of Obligation Imposed on Someone Other Than the Subject of a Sentence  3.131   When a sentence expresses an obligation, the obligation can be   imposed   on   someone   other   than   the   subject   of   that sentence. There are five contexts in which this occurs.  3.132   First, it occurs when a sentence that would, in the active voice, have one or more parties to the contract as the subject is instead phrased in the passive voice (2.17), causing the active object to become the passive subject and either turning the active subject into a   by -agent, as in [3-1], or omitting it",
  "entirely,   as   in   [3-2].   (For   more   on   the   passive   voice,   see 3.11–.24.)  3.133   Second, it occurs when, as in [3-3], the subject of a sentence isn’t a legal person and so cannot assume a duty.  3.134   Third, it occurs when, in a sentence in the active voice (see [3-4] and [3-6]) or passive voice (see [3-6c]), the active subject or   by -agent (whether present or not), although an individual or entity, isn’t a party and so cannot be required to assume a duty.  3.135   Fourth, it occurs when, in a sentence in the active voice in which the subject is a party, the duty is, by means of the verb  receive , as in [3-7] (see 3.151), in effect imposed on someone other   than   the   subject,   and   the   subject   denotes   the beneficiary of performance of that duty.  3.136   And fifth, it occurs when a main clause using   is entitled to , meaning “has a right to,” is used with a noun, as in [3-8], or with a passive complement clause, as in [3-1c] and [3-2d]. In such constructions it’s implicit that another must provide what the subject is entitled to (see 3.152). (When   is entitled to  is used with a complement clause in the active voice, it’s language of discretion; see 3.264. An exception is when it’s used with   receive ; see [3-7c].)

USING   MUST   INSTEAD   OF   SHALL   OR   WILL  3.137   The   first   four   contexts   described   above   (see   3.132–.135) require a modal auxiliary, whether   shall ,   must , or   will . The",
  "traditional   choice—not   recommended   by   this   manual— would be to use   shall   in this context, in addition to using it to   convey   an   obligation   imposed   on   the   subject   of   a sentence.  3.138   But using   shall   when the duty is imposed on someone other than the subject would preclude using   shall   to mean only “has a duty to.” As discussed in 3.101, the   has a duty   test offers a straightforward way to ensure disciplined use of   shall  and coherent use of verbs generally to express the categories of contract language. Also, giving   shall   a broader role would increase   the   disconnect   between   contract   language   and standard English (see 3.79).  3.139   Must , meaning “is required to,” is the best alternative to   shall  for   imposing   an   obligation   on   someone   other   than   the subject of a sentence. Using   must   in this context offers two advantages, and they mirror the disadvantages of using   shall . First, this use of   must   is more in keeping with general English usage. Second, it enhances clarity by allowing   shall   to be reserved for imposing a duty on the subject of a sentence. But take care to distinguish this use of   must   from use of   must   to state a condition (see 3.356).  3.140   Will   is an inferior alternative. In duties imposed on someone other than the subject of a sentence, the weaknesses of   will  are the same as those apparent in duties imposed on the subject   of   a   sentence   (see   3.95):   in   general   usage,   will  expresses future time rather than obligations, and using   will  to express obligations as well as futurity would likely result in the sort of confusion that those who advocate abandoning  shall   are hoping to avoid.  AVOIDING   THE   NEED   FOR   MUST  3.141   Usually   a   better   alternative   to   replacing   shall   with   must  would be not to impose a duty on someone other than the subject of the sentence. That can be accomplished in two ways.",
  "3.142   One way is to use the active voice rather than the passive voice. Not only does that result in clearer and more concise prose (see 3.13), it also reduces the need for   must . So of [3-1] and [3-2] and their variants, the preferred approach is that shown in [3-1e] and [3-2f].  3.143   A second way is to make explicit, in any sentence in which the active subject or   by -agent is incapable of assuming a duty, exactly who does owe the duty. One does this by stating that the party owing the duty   shall cause   something to happen or someone else to take a specified action.  3.144   Depending on the context, this approach can be applied to a sentence with a subject that isn’t a legal person; compare [3- 3] to [3-3c]. But if the subject is a legal person that isn’t a party, this approach is appropriate only if the subject is an instrumentality of one or more parties. For example, it makes sense to restructure [3-4] as [3-4c]—because Sub is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, Parent controls Sub.  3.145   Some drafters use unhelpful variants of   shall cause .   One is  shall procure   (see [3-4d]),   which is used in Commonwealth countries; it’s too legalistic. Another is   shall ensure   (see [3- 4e]); it’s overly genteel. And a third,   shall require   (see [3-4f]), could be understood as meaning that the party in question has a duty to impose a duty on the nonparty.  3.146   It’s best not to use   shall cause   if the subject of the original sentence is a nonparty that isn’t an instrumentality of a party.   A   party   can’t   be   said   to   control   individuals   (for example, an employee or an arbitrator), because individuals might do as they see fit. That’s the problem with [3-5c] and [3-6f].   And   a   party   can’t   be   said   to   control   unaffiliated entities, for example contractors.  3.147   At least one court has held that a contract party breached a  shall cause   obligation by failing to control an individual. See  World of Boxing LLC v. King , 56 F. Supp. 3d 507, 513 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). But that isn’t an argument for using   shall cause   with nonparty   individuals   and   other   nonparties   that   a   party",
  "doesn’t   control.   Whenever   you   impose   an   obligation   on someone   to   control   something   they   can’t   really   control, you’re spoiling for a fight, and winning a fight is a distant second-best to avoiding the fight.  3.148   Depending on the context, you might be able to restructure a provision that has as the subject a nonparty that isn’t an instrumentality   of   one   of   the   parties   so   that   instead   the provision   imposes   an   obligation   on   a   party.   Such restructuring might raise issues that had been glossed over; see for example [3-5d]. Alternatively, or in addition, state explicitly who bears the risk for conduct by a nonparty that isn’t an instrumentality of a party. In particular, if the issue is conduct by a nonparty that a party doesn’t control, consider imposing an obligation that reflects the limited control and incorporating   a   risk-allocation   mechanism   that   addresses what happens if an outcome that the provision seeks to avoid nevertheless happens.  3.149   If such restructuring isn’t possible,   must   would be your best bet (see [3-6]). It might be best to specify the implications if the   nonparty   fails   to   act   as   anticipated—because   the provision doesn’t apply to a party, it might not be evident what the remedies would be.  3.150   By   selecting   your   verbs   judiciously,   you   might   avoid altogether any need for   shall cause   (see [3-3d]).  DON ’ T   USE   RECEIVE   IN   LANGUAGE   OF   OBLIGATION  3.151   It’s unhelpful to use   receive   to impose a duty on someone other   than   the   subject   of   the   sentence,   as   in   [3-7].   The drawbacks are the same as those relating to use of the passive voice (see 3.13). In particular, note that [3-7] doesn’t specify who is to pay Jones’s annual salary. Instead, use   shall   to impose the duty directly on the relevant actor, as in [3-7d].  DON ’ T   USE   IS   ENTITLED   TO   IN   LANGUAGE   OF   OBLIGATION",
  "3.152   Use of   is entitled to   with a noun or a passive complement clause is analogous to provisions in the passive voice. The   by - agent   is   often   unexpressed,   as   in   [3-2d]   ([3-8]   cannot accommodate a   by -agent), and even when the   by -agent is stated, as in [3-1c], the result is wordy. Furthermore, focusing on the entitled party could create problems for the entitled party:   in   response   to   a   claim   for   breach   brought   by   the entitled party, the party owing the obligation could claim it didn’t have to perform until the entitled party had notified it that the entitled party sought performance. So don’t use   is entitled to   in language of obligation and instead focus on the party owing the duty, as in [3-1e], [3-2f], and [3-8b].  3.153   A secondary issue is that   is entitled to   used with a noun or a passive complement clause doesn’t require a modal auxiliary. More often than not, though, drafters provide, as in [3-1d], [3-2e], and [3-8a], that a party   shall be entitled to   rather than   is entitled to . This use of   shall   is inconsistent with the limited use recommended in this manual (see 3.72). It also occurs in language of policy (see 3.308).  3.154   Regarding use of   is entitled to   in language of discretion, see 3.264.  Imposing Impossible Obligations  3.155   Before considering how to express a particular obligation, determine whether it makes sense to address the issue with an obligation.  3.156   What if the party that would be responsible for complying with the obligation doesn’t have sufficient control to ensure compliance? What if compliance isn’t feasible? Imposing the obligation   regardless   wouldn’t   make   sense,   could   confuse readers, and could cause a court to hold that the obligation is unenforceable.  3.157   For example, if Acme wants Widgetco to obtain a landlord consent   that’s   required   for   closing,   it   could   impose   on",
  "Widgetco an obligation to obtain that consent. But under its contract   with   Widgetco,   the   landlord   may   withhold   its consent. It would make more sense for Acme to (1) impose on Widgetco an obligation to use reasonable efforts to obtain the consent (see 8.3), (2) make it a condition to closing that the   landlord   has   provided   the   consent,   and   (3)   consider imposing   on   Widgetco   an   obligation   to   pay   Acme   a termination fee, or indemnify Acme (see 13.404), if lack of the landlord’s consent results in the deal not closing.  3.158   A   similar   approach   might   be   a   sensible   alternative   to imposing on a party receiving confidential information an obligation   to   destroy   all   electronic   versions   of   that information, regardless of whether that’s possible to do.  Imposing Obligations to Stop Something from Happening  3.159   To address in a contract something undesirable that might happen   and   that   isn’t   completely   in   the   control   of   the performing   party,   imposing   an   obligation   wouldn’t   be enough.  3.160   A contract between Acme and Widgetco says   Acme shall not permit employees to remove Equipment from the Premises . Acme doesn’t adopt a policy regarding removing equipment from the   premises,   so   it   hasn’t   given   employees   permission   to remove   equipment.   An   employee   takes   equipment   home, and it gets stolen. Because   permit   can also mean allowing something   to   happen,   one   can   imagine   a   dispute   over whether under the contract Acme was required to take steps to   prevent   employees   from   taking   equipment   home.   The same applies to use of   shall not allow .  3.161   Imagine instead that the contract says   Acme shall prohibit employees from removing Equipment from the Premises.   Acme puts   up   a   sign   to   that   effect   but   doesn’t   otherwise   do anything. Was Acme required to do more under the contract? It’s not clear.",
  "3.162   And if the contract says   shall prevent , does that make Acme liable if an employee takes equipment home, whatever the measures Acme took to prevent that?  3.163   The   problem   with   these   formulations   is   that   all   such scenarios   raise   two   separate   issues,   so   addressing   them comprehensively requires two separate provisions. In the case of   Acme   and   Widgetco,   first,   it   would   make   sense   for Widgetco   to   require   that   Acme   take   appropriate   steps   to prevent employees from taking equipment home; the best way to accomplish that would be with a   reasonable efforts  obligation (see 8.3). And second, Widgetco should include in the contract a risk-allocation provision making Acme liable for   any   Widgetco   losses   that   result   if   an   employee nevertheless takes equipment home.  Obligations—Some Related Terminology  3.164   Contracts use a range of terms relating to obligations, some more helpful than others.  USE   OBLIGATION ,   NOT   COVENANT  3.165   Why   not   use   covenant   instead   of   obligation ?   Black’s   Law Dictionary   defines   obligation   as “A formal, binding agreement or acknowledgment of a liability to pay a certain amount or to do a certain thing for a particular person or set of persons; esp., a duty arising by contract.” And it defines   covenant   as “A formal agreement or promise, usu. in a contract or deed, to do or not do a particular act; a compact or stipulation.”  3.166   As   such,   covenant   is   a   synonym   of   obligation ,   and   many drafters use the two words interchangeably. But   covenant   has a quaint Old Testament (or   Raiders of the Lost Ark ) quality to it. (David Mellinkoff,   Mellinkoff’s Dictionary of American Legal Usage   135 (1992), says that   covenant   is “An old synonym for contract and agreement.”) When given a choice between the archaic and the more modern, choose the more modern.",
  "3.167   Don’t   revert   to   covenant   when   referring   to   grouped obligations   that   address   how   a   party   is   to   conduct   itself between the signing and closing of a transaction, while a debt remains outstanding, or in some other context. If you switch from one word to the other depending on where you find   yourself   in   a   contract   or   depending   on   the   kind   of obligation involved, you’re using two words to convey the same meaning (see 1.64). It would be clearer to stick with  obligation   throughout.  3.168   Covenant   occurs in the term of art   covenant not to compete .  Noncompetition provision   would be less fusty.  3.169   Don’t   use   the   phrases   affirmative   covenant   and   negative covenant , meaning an obligation to do something and an obligation   not   to   do   something.   Aside   from   the   archaic quality that   covenant   adds to those phrases, generally when referring in a contract to obligations imposed by that or any other   contract,   no   purpose   is   served   by   distinguishing between an obligation to do something and an obligation not to do something. See also 3.170.  OBLIGATION   AND   PROHIBITION  3.170   Given that a category of contract language is language of prohibition   (see   3.278),   one   could   conceivably   refer   to  obligations   and   prohibitions   in   contracts.   But   that’s unnecessary, and would in fact be confusing, because it’s standard   to   use   obligation   with   respect   to   both   doing something and not doing something. See also 3.169.  OBLIGATION   VERSUS   DUTY  3.171   The   Black’s Law Dictionary   definition of   obligation   (see 3.165) suggests   that   it   means   the   same   thing   as   duty .   And   the  Restatement   (Second)   of   Contracts   uses   duty   and   obligation  interchangeably—it uses   duty   in section 1 and uses   obligation  in section 1, comments a and b, and in section 2, comment",
  "b.   But   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 624, distinguishes between   obligation   and   duty :  obligation; duty.   Broadly speaking, the words are synonymous in referring to what a person is required to do or refrain from doing—or for the performance or nonperformance of which the person is responsible. But there are connotative nuances. An   obligation   is normally an immediate requirement with a specific reference <his child-support obligations> <Burundi’s obligations under the treaty>... . A   duty   may involve legal compulsion and immediacy, but the word carries an overlay of a moral or ethical imperative <parental duties> <fiduciary duties>. More specifically,   duty   = (1) that which one is required to do or refrain from doing, esp. as occupant of some position, role, or office; or (2) any one of a complex of rights and standards of care imposed by a legal relationship. Sense 2 appears primarily in tort law, in which writers use   duty  only to mean that there could be liability.  3.172   This   manual   concurs,   which   is   why   it   refers   to   contract obligations yet refers to the implied duty of good faith (see 3.225). But whether you use   obligation   or   duty   in a contract to refer to what a party is required to do under that contract would   have   no   implications   for   that   transaction.   Just   be consistent in the terminology you use.  USING   ADJECTIVES   WITH   OBLIGATION  3.173   In   contracts,   obligations   are   sometimes   modified   by  irrevocable ,   absolute , or   unconditional . It doesn’t make sense to refer   to   an   obligation   as   being   irrevocable —you   revoke something   that   benefits   the   other   party,   not   something imposed   on   you.   And   it’s   not   clear   what   absolute   and  unconditional   are intended to accomplish in this context.  USE   COMPLY   WITH ,   NOT   PERFORM",
  "3.174   It’s standard to say that one   performs   an obligation and to refer to   performance   of an obligation. But an obligation could consist of a duty not to do something (see 3.170), in which case   perform   would have to encompass sitting on your hands. That   seems   counterintuitive.   Possible   alternatives   such   as  discharge   and   fulfill   are no improvement.  3.175   So use instead   comply with   and the noun form   compliance with —they would cover both action and inaction.  USING   BREACH   AS   A   COUNT   NOUN   OR   A   MASS   NOUN  3.176   The word   breach   is used both as a noun and as a verb. It’s more sober than   violation   (and   violate ) and more direct than  nonperformance   and   noncompliance ( and   fail to perform   and   fail to comply with) .  3.177   But   breach   involves subtleties. Let’s consider first its use as a noun:  Any such disclosure will constitute [ a breach ] [ breach ] of the Recipient’s obligations under this section 5.2.  3.178   Both of the bracketed alternatives reflect accepted usage. The first alternative features   breach   used as a count noun, in that it can be quantified by a number. Just as one can say   Joe ate five cookies , you can say   Acme committed multiple breaches of its obligations under the Widgetco contract .  3.179   By   contrast,   in   the   second   alternative,   breach   is   used   to express   an   abstract   idea.   It’s   used   as   a   mass   noun,   like  destruction . This kind of mass noun cannot be used in the plural and doesn’t take an indefinite article—you don’t say  five destructions   or   a destruction . That’s why   breach   also works without the indefinite article   a . Because doing without the indefinite article is slightly more economical, use   breach   as a mass noun, not a count noun.  USING   BREACH   AS   A   COUNT   NOUN   OR   A   VERB  3.180   Consider this example:",
  "... its entry into this agreement and its performance of its obligations under this agreement do not ... conflict with, [ result in a breach of ] [ breach ], or constitute a default under ... .  3.181   The first alternative uses   breach   as a count noun; the second uses it as a verb. Using the verb is more concise.  USING   BREACH   AS   A   MASS   NOUN   OR   A   VERB  3.182   Let’s now compare using   breach   as a mass noun and using it as a verb:  Mass Noun  Any such disclosure will constitute breach of the Recipient’s obligations under this section 5.2.  Verb  Any such disclosure will breach the Recipient’s obligations under this section 5.2.  3.183   Here too the verb is the more economical option.  3.184   And consider this example:  Any purported assignment or delegation [ in breach of ] [ that breaches ] this section 20.4 will be void.  3.185   The first alternative consists of the mass noun   breach   used in the phrase   in breach of ; the second alternative uses the verb  breach . Here, too, the verb is the simpler alternative.  3.186   Furthermore, using   breach   as a mass noun can result in the actor being dropped (see 17.8). Using the verb prevents that:  Mass Noun  In the event of breach of this section 6.7 ... .  Verb  If Acme breaches this section 6.7 ... .  LANGUAGE OF DISCRETION",
  "3.187   “Language of discretion” is language stating that a party has the discretion to take or not take a specified action.  Using   May   to Convey Discretion  3.188   Discretion is primarily conveyed by means of   may,   which expresses permission or sanction. When used in an active construction, as in [4-1],   may   means “has discretion to,” “is permitted   to,”   or   “is   authorized   to.”   (It   would   be unnecessarily   wordy   to   use   these   formulations   instead   of  may ,   as   in   [4-1a].)   May   can   also   be   used   in   a   passive construction, in which case the one or more parties that have permission are represented by a   by -agent, as in [4-2], or are absent, as in [4-2a]. For the reasons stated in 3.13, don’t use the   passive;   [4-2b]   represents   an   improvement   over   [4-2]. ( May   can also express the possibility of something occurring; see 3.206.)  TABLE 4   LANGUAGE OF DISCRETION:   MAY  [4-1]   Acme may appoint one or more subcontractors. [4-1a]   Acme is authorized to ... . [4-1b]   Acme is entitled to ... . [4-1c]   Acme shall have the right to ... . [4-1d]   Acme reserves the right to ... . [4-1e]   Acme is permitted to ... . [4-1f]   Acme is allowed to ... . [4-1g]   Acme is free to ... .",
  "[4-1h]   Acme is hereby empowered by the Customer to ... . [4-1i]   Acme may but is not required to ... . [4-1j]   Acme may freely ... . [4-1k]   Acme can ... .

[4-2a]   The Option may be exercised any time before 1 January 2018. [4-2b]   Smith may exercise the Option any time before 1 January 2018.  3.189   As with language of obligation, there are other, more long- winded alternatives to   may . See, for example, [4-1c] through [4-1h]. In [4-1i],   but is not required to   is redundant, given that  may   expresses   discretion.   Similarly,   in   [4-1j],   freely   is redundant. And in [4-1k],   can   is inappropriate, as it expresses physical or mental ability, not discretion.  Be Explicit as to Whether Discretion Is Limited  3.190   A grant of discretion to do one thing doesn’t necessarily equal a prohibition against doing other things. If a mother tells her son he may play video games, it wouldn’t necessarily follow   that   she’s   forbidding   him   from   engaging   in   any alternative activity.  3.191   But the presumption that a grant of discretion doesn’t also entail prohibition comes up against what this manual calls",
  "“the expectation of relevance.” (Relevance is a principle of linguistics.   According   to   The   Cambridge   Grammar   of   the English Language , at 38, “A central principle in pragmatics ... is that the addressee of an utterance will expect it to be relevant, and will normally interpret it on that basis.”) The more specific a grant of discretion is, the more likely it is that the reader would conclude that the discretion is limited— otherwise there would be no point in being so specific. And the more likely a court would be to invoke the arbitrary rule of   interpretation   expressio   unius   est   exclusio   alterius —the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of others.  3.192   Consider the sentence   Acme may sell the Shares to Doe . Maybe the parties had in mind that Acme could sell the shares to anyone—they addressed sale to Doe explicitly simply because otherwise it would have been uncertain whether Acme could sell   the   shares   to   Doe.   But   the   expectation   of   relevance suggests   that   if   the   parties   mentioned   only   Doe   when authorizing Acme to sell the shares, it’s because Acme was precluded from selling the shares to anyone else.  3.193   To   avoid   any   uncertainty   regarding   the   expectation   of relevance, be explicit as to whether discretion is limited. If Acme has unlimited discretion to sell the shares, it would be preferable to say   Acme may sell the Shares to any Person . If its discretion is limited, it would be preferable to say   The only Person to whom Acme may sell the Shares is Doe . Or you could use language of prohibition— Acme shall not sell the Shares to anyone other than Doe .  3.194   See   3.201–.205   for   a   source   of   ambiguity   in   expressing limited discretion.  A   CASE   STUDY  3.195   Uncertainty   over   whether   discretion   is   limited   can   cause disputes that lead to litigation. For example, at issue in   Arkel International, L.L.C. v. Parsons Global Services , No. 07-474-FJP- DLD, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1624 (M.D. La. 8 Jan. 2008), was",
  "the   following   forum-selection   clause:   “[E]ither   party   may institute suit in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, or, if mutually agreed to by the   parties,   the   dispute   shall   be   settled   by   arbitration   in Pasadena, California.”  3.196   The   parties   disagreed   over   whether   the   forum-selection clause provided for mandatory or permissive jurisdiction—in other words, whether a party could sue only in the specified court. The court considering this dispute held that the forum- selection clause provided for permissive jurisdiction.  3.197   If the forum-selection clause had simply stated that either party may sue in the specified California court, it would have been   reasonable   to   conclude   that   it   was   permissive—the countervailing   expectation   of   relevance   would   have   been weak. But instead, the provision said that either party may sue in California or the parties may agree to arbitrate. The second   alternative—arbitration—provides   greater   specificity and so gives greater force to the expectation of relevance— the contrast between the two alternatives specified would lose   significance   if   unlimited   other   options   were   also available.  3.198   Imagine that you say to Frank, “You may go to the movies.” That   could   mean   “You   may   engage   in   any   number   of activities, one of which is going to the movies.” It could also mean “The only activity that you’re permitted to engage in is going to the movies.” But if you say to Frank, “You may go to the movies or you may go to the library,” it’s more likely that you’re telling Frank those are his only two choices.  3.199   Whoever   drafted   the   forum-selection   clause   likely   had mandatory jurisdiction in mind but didn’t feel the need to make it explicit, perhaps because they were swayed by the increased expectation of relevance afforded by the reference to   arbitration.   Whatever   they   intended,   they   would   have done better to make it explicit.",
  "3.200   An English case involving language of discretion and the expectation   of   relevance   is   Ener-G   Holdings   plc   v.   Hormell  [2012] EWCA Civ. 1059 (31 July 2012). The question was whether the two means of serving notice specified in the provision at issue were the only two means authorized under the contract, or whether that provision simply specified two means of service from among those permitted.  The Ambiguity Inherent in   May   ...   Only  3.201   Drafters often use   may   ...   only   to convey limited discretion. The   result   is   alternative   meanings   that   can   give   rise   to ambiguity. Consider the following sentence:  Acme may close one or more Contract Stores for any reason, and in doing so it may consider only its own interests.  3.202   This   sentence   is   ambiguous.   The   drafter   presumably intended it to mean that Acme may consider only its own interests but would be free to consider the interests of others. But it could also mean that the only interests Acme may consider are its own. The latter meaning seems unlikely.  3.203   Now consider this sentence:  Widgetco may sell only the 1965 Ford Mustang.  3.204   It could convey a meaning analogous to the first possible meaning   of   the   previous   example—in   other   words,   that Widgetco may elect to sell only that car but would also be free to sell other cars instead of or in addition to the Ford Mustang, or not sell any cars. But it could also mean that the only vehicle that Widgetco may sell is the vehicle specified. In this case, the latter meaning seems the more likely.  3.205   The ambiguity engendered by   may ...   only   can’t be avoided by repositioning   only   (see 13.617). Instead, you must come up   with   alternative   language   to   express   the   intended meaning.   Here’s   how   one   could   reword   the   two   above examples to express the intended meaning:",
  "Acme may close one or more Contract Stores for any reason, and in doing so it may elect to consider only its own interests. Widgetco shall sell no vehicle other than the 1965 Ford Mustang.  Using   May   to Convey Possibility  3.206   Besides conveying discretion,   may   can also be used to express the   possibility   of   something   occurring.   The   result   is ambiguity, but this manual doesn’t consider that sufficient reason to stop using   may .  3.207   Consider   this   sentence:   The   Investigator   may   provide   the Sponsor with confidential information.   It could mean that the Investigator   is   authorized   to   provide   the   Sponsor   with confidential information, but it could also mean that it’s possible that the Investigator will do so.  3.208   Although one can usually discern from the context which meaning is intended, it would nevertheless be best to avoid this   sort   of   confusion.   If   the   intention   were   to   convey possibility, you could restructure the provision in question to omit   may.   For   example,   the   above   example   could   be rephrased   as   If   the   Investigator   provides   the   sponsor   with confidential information, then   ... .  3.209   Alternatively,   to   convey   the   possibility   of   something occurring you could instead of   may   use either   might   (if it’s uncertain whether the event will come to pass) or   expects to  (if it’s likely that the event will come to pass and a party is the subject).  3.210   The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language , at 200, says that   might   “suggests a slightly lower degree of possibility” than   may , but that’s no obstacle to use of   might —the parties to   a   contract   would   be   less   interested   in   parsing   the likelihood   of   an   event   happening   than   in   specifying   the consequences if it does happen. Furthermore, the distinction is a relative one, so there’s no way to assign an absolute degree of possibility to a given instance of   may   or   might . The",
  "best you can say is that it’s possible that whatever it is will come to pass.  3.211   But even if you use something other than   may   to express the possibility   of   something   occurring,   some   readers   might wonder whether a given   may   in fact means   might . Online discussion   suggests   that   some   drafters   are   sufficiently concerned about that possibility that they’ve dropped   may  from their drafting in favor of   is permitted to   (see [4-1d]) or some other alternative.  3.212   But before jettisoning a word because it conveys alternative meanings, it’s appropriate to examine the risks posed by the alternative   meanings   and   the   burden   that   change   would impose.  3.213   The possibility of   may   being understood as meaning   might  doesn’t create meaningful risk. Consider again the sample sentence   used   in   3.206:   The   Investigator   may   provide   the Sponsor with confidential information.   Party A claims that in that sentence,   may   expresses   discretion;   Party   B   claims   it means   might . It’s hard to see what benefit Party B could derive from so claiming—if you accept that the Investigator might provide confidential information, it’s hard to see how you could use that to argue that the Investigator isn’t allowed to provide confidential information.  3.214   As regards the burden that change would impose, asking those who work with contracts to drop   may —a basic verb structure   in   everyday   English—in   favor   of   a   more cumbersome structure that offers no, or negligible, benefits seems counterproductive. So   may   remains the best means of expressing discretion.  May Require  3.215   The phrase   may require   is often used to frame as Party X’s discretion what is best thought of as Party Y’s obligation. Instead, use language of obligation:",
  "The Company may require a Participant to retain   [read   At the Company’s written request, a Participant shall retain ] the shares purchased on that Participant’s behalf in the Participant’s ESPP Broker Account until sale of those shares.  The Bank may require each Borrower to establish   [read   At the Bank’s written request, each Borrower shall establish ] a lockbox under the control of the Bank to which all applicable Account Debtors shall forward payments on the Accounts.  3.216   Sometimes   may require   is used to indicate possibility rather than discretion:  The issuer of these securities   may require   an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the issuer to the effect that any proposed transfer or resale is in compliance with the Act and any applicable state securities laws.  3.217   In such cases, use   might   rather than   may   (see 3.208).  3.218   The phrase   may require   is also used to convey possibility in a restrictive relative clause modifying a noun phrase. In that context   may   is   superfluous;   use   the   simple   present   tense instead (see 3.456):  The Borrowers shall complete and sign such applications and supplemental agreements and provide such other documentation as the Bank   may require   [read   requires ] regarding issuance and administration of the Letters of Credit.  May Request  3.219   Related to   may require   is the phrase   may request .  3.220   When   may   request   is   the   main   verb,   its   function   might simply be to express that a party may ask for something—for example,   assistance.   But   may   request   might   result   in   an obligation being imposed on another party:  Pending the preparation of Definitive Notes, the Issuer   may request   and the Trustee, upon receiving an Issuer Order, shall authenticate and deliver temporary Notes of that Series.",
  "3.221   In this context,   may request   expresses an instruction, not a request.   It   would   be   simpler   to   omit   X   may   request   and instead say   at the request of X, Y shall . In the example above, if an Issuer Order reflects the Issuer’s request, that’s already provided for—you could just omit   the Issuer may request and .  3.222   But in some contracts, the follow-on obligation is omitted. Here’s an example:  ... the Trustee   may request   that the Company deliver an officers’ certificate stating the names or titles of officers then authorized to take specified actions under this indenture ... .  3.223   Presumably in the above example, the Trustee’s request isn’t a   casual   one   that   the   Company   could   blithely   ignore.   It would be best to make that clear by revising this example to incorporate the structure   at the request of X, Y shall .  Don’t Use   At Its Sole Discretion   with   May  3.224   It’s commonplace for drafters to use   at its   [or   his, her,   or   their ]  sole discretion   in language of discretion, as in   Acme may at its sole discretion terminate this agreement , and as in [4-1l]. As explained   in   this   section,   if   at   its   discretion   is   rhetorical emphasis, delete it. If it attempts to address a real issue, consider addressing that issue directly.  IMPLIED   DUTY   OF   GOOD   FAITH  3.225   Use of   at its sole discretion   in language of discretion suggests (1) that the language of discretion in question doesn’t grant complete   discretion   and   (2)   that   tacking   on   at   its   sole discretion   remedies that. The first element of this proposition is correct—the discretion granted under a contract is limited, in that generally any party to a contract would be under a duty to exercise that discretion in good faith, at least in those jurisdictions that recognize the implied duty of good faith. That includes the United States (it has been adopted by most states and the Uniform Commercial Code) and many other countries, but excludes England.",
  "3.226   Section 205 of the   Restatement (Second) of Contracts   states that “Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.” And section   1-304   of   the   Uniform   Commercial   Code   (UCC) provides   that   “Every   contract   or   duty   within   [the   UCC] imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement.” Cases invoking the duty of good faith “are legion.”   Murray on Contracts   § 90[A].  3.227   Regarding language of discretion specifically, “where a party has contractual discretion to promote its own interest, the good   faith   requirement   precludes   action   that   would contravene the reasonable expectations of the other party.” 1-5   Murray   on   Contracts   §   91[A];   see   also   23   Williston   on Contracts   § 63:22 (stating that “even where a defendant is given absolute discretion, it must exercise that discretion in good faith”). For a case that stands for this proposition, see  Gilson v. Rainin Instrument, LLC , No. 04-C-852-S, 2005 WL 1899471 (W.D. Wis. 9 Aug. 2005) (stating that the implied covenant of good faith requires each party to an agreement “to exercise any discretion afforded it by the agreement in a manner consistent with the reasonable expectations of the other party”).  WORDING  3.228   Acme may at its sole discretion   incorporates redundancy—in effect it means   Acme has the discretion, at its sole discretion, to   ... . And it’s not necessarily clear that   sole   adds anything— a grant of discretion to a party is necessarily to that party only.  3.229   Some drafters use   absolute   instead of, or in addition to,   sole , but that wouldn’t seem to offer any advantage over using   sole  on its own. Neither would using   uncontrolled .  3.230   It wouldn’t make sense to refer to   good-faith discretion —if you’re willing to have your discretion be subject to the duty of good faith, it would be unnecessary to modify language of discretion to say so.",
  "3.231   As   for   reasonable   discretion ,   that   might   curtail   a   party’s discretion—a reasonableness standard could be interpreted as being more stringent than a good-faith standard (see 13.681).  3.232   And   just   at   its   discretion   simply   echoes   the   language   of discretion— Acme may at its discretion   means   Acme has the discretion, at its discretion, to   ... .  ATTEMPTING   TO   CIRCUMVENT   THE   DUTY   OF   GOOD   FAITH  3.233   It might not be clear what prompted use of an instance of   at its sole discretion . Perhaps it simply reflects the redundancy inherent in traditional contract language, in which case it should be deleted. On the other hand, adding   at   its   sole discretion   to   language   of   discretion   might   represent   an attempt to nullify the duty to exercise discretion in good faith. The intent would be that   at its sole discretion   allows a party to exercise discretion without having its reasonableness challenged.  3.234   Some drafters use an internal rule of interpretation (see 15.2) to make it explicit that they intend to circumvent the duty of good faith. Here’s an example:  The terms “sole discretion” and “absolute discretion” regarding any determination to be made a party under this agreement mean the sole and absolute discretion of that party, without regard to any standard of reasonableness or other standard by which the determination of that party might be challenged.  3.235   Drafters also attempt to circumvent the duty of good faith by using   for   any   reason   or   no   reason .   Regarding   that   phrase generally, see 13.293.  CASELAW  3.236   Some courts have held enforceable provisions that in effect state that a party may act unreasonably.  3.237   For   example,   in   Cussler   v.   Crusader   Entertainment,   LLC , No. B208738, 2010 WL 718007 (Cal. Ct. App. 3 Mar. 2010),",
  "the California Court of Appeal rejected Crusader’s argument that   in   failing   to   approve   Crusader’s   many   proposed screenplays for the film   Sahara , the author Clive Cussler had breached   the   implied   duty   of   good   faith   that   under California   law   is   read   into   every   contract.   The   contract provided that Crusader would “not ... change the Approved Screenplay ... without Cussler’s written approval exercisable in   his   sole   and   absolute   discretion.”   (For   more   on   this opinion and the problematic reasoning underlying it, see Kenneth A. Adams,   Whittling Away at Duty of Good Faith , Recorder, 28 June 2011.)  3.238   And in   Automatic Sprinkler Corp. of America v. Anderson , 257 S.E.2d 283 (Ga. 1979), the court considered “whether good faith is a prerequisite in the exercise of an absolute discretion to withhold incentive compensation.” The contract at issue stated that whether to pay a terminated employee incentive compensation “will rest completely in the absolute and final discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.” The court held that the presence or absence of good faith was irrelevant.  3.239   But cases in other jurisdictions hold otherwise. For example, in   A.W. Fiur Co. v. Ataka & Co. , 422 N.Y.S.2d 419, 422 (App. Div. 1979), the court said, “Although the contract conferred upon   [a   wholly   owned   subsidiary   of   the   defendant]   the ‘absolute and exclusive right to reject any orders for any reason whatsoever’, such a contract does not import the right arbitrarily to refuse to accept orders.”  3.240   In the same vein, according to section 1-302 of the UCC, “The obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care   prescribed   by   [the   UCC]   may   not   be   disclaimed   by agreement.”   That’s   what   at   its   sole   discretion   attempts   to accomplish.  3.241   The policy arguments go both ways. Having a party waive the benefit of the implied duty for a particular provision would, in states that recognize such waivers, spare the other",
  "party the risk of having its exercise of discretion challenged as lacking good faith. But that certainty comes at a cost, in that a party could use the other party’s waiver of the implied duty as license to sabotage the transaction.  AN   ALTERNATIVE   APPROACH  3.242   Given   the   mixed   caselaw,   drafters   might   be   tempted   to adjust, depending on the governing law of the contract, how they approach the implied duty of good faith, thinking that it would be appropriate to include   at its sole discretion , or some   variant,   if   the   contract   is   governed   by   the   law   of California or another jurisdiction that recognizes waivers of the implied duty of good faith.  3.243   Or drafters might be inclined to include   at its sole discretion  in   all   contracts—they   know   that   courts   in   a   particular jurisdiction would disregard that phrase, but they decide that retaining it is harmless, and it might work to their advantage if the other side is unaware of the law on the issue.  3.244   But it would be preferable to eliminate from your contracts any language that could be construed as effecting a waiver of the implied duty of good faith, even if it favors your client— doing so would reduce the likelihood of confusion or dispute.  3.245   Even in jurisdictions that construe   at its sole discretion   as effecting an enforceable waiver of the implied duty of good faith, any benefit of such a waiver is more than offset by the potential mischief of an apparent endorsement of a party’s acting in bad faith (see 3.241). And the language used to articulate a waiver of the implied duty is sufficiently unclear that   it   could   cause   a   dispute.   Furthermore,   the   confused caselaw (at least in California) might make it difficult to predict whether a court would hold that a particular waiver is enforceable.  3.246   Instead, address directly whatever concern you might have been tempted to address with a waiver of the implied duty—",
  "it’s unlikely that the party in question simply wants to ensure that it’s free to act in bad faith.  3.247   For example, imagine that Acme wants to purchase from Widgetco several stores that sell widgets. The parties have in mind that as part of the purchase price, Acme would pay commissions   based   on   future   net   sales   of   the   stores.   But Acme wants to close stores if it sees fit. Simply saying “Acme may at any time close any one or more Contract Stores” might allow Widgetco to claim that Acme was acting in bad faith if it ultimately were to close Contract Stores. And it would   be   reckless   to   assume   that   adding   “at   its   sole discretion” would preclude that possibility without risk of dispute.  3.248   You could make this language of discretion more specific by making Acme’s exercise of its discretion subject to conditions —for example, it may close a store only if that store fails to meet specified targets. But if Acme would prefer to avoid any meddling   in   its   business   decisions,   a   more   promising approach would be to add specificity by having Widgetco acknowledge that certain potential adverse consequences will be irrelevant to Acme’s exercise of its discretion. That could be accomplished by the following:  Acme may close one or more Contract Stores for any reason, and in doing so it may elect to consider only its own interests and will not be required to consider the effect of any such closure on Widgetco, including any reduction in commissions that Acme pays Widgetco under this agreement.  3.249   This   approach   should   be   palatable   to   the   other   party   if circumstances suggest that the party with discretion would to some extent be constrained from acting in bad faith. In the above example, closing stores presumably involves some cost to Acme.  3.250   Furthermore, a court would be less likely to view an explicit provision of that sort as an impermissible attempt to waive the duty of good faith. For example, the above scenario is",
  "based on the facts in   VTR, Inc. v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. , 303 F. Supp. 773 (S.D.N.Y. 1969). In that case, the court held that “the parties may, by express provisions of the contract, grant the right to engage in the very acts and conduct which otherwise   would   have   been   forbidden   by   an   implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.”  3.251   And   section   1-302   of   the   UCC   states   that   although   the obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care may   not   be   disclaimed   by   agreement,   “The   parties,   by agreement,   may   determine   the   standards   by   which   the performance of those obligations is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly unreasonable.”  3.252   If you’re unable or unwilling to craft explicit language of this sort, you could use   at its discretion   and warn the client that   at its discretion   may be ineffective to ensure it has unfettered discretion. Or you could simply omit   at its discretion   because it would be best to omit such an unstable phrase from your contracts, even if doing so precludes the possibility, however uncertain, of unfettered discretion. The latter approach seems more prudent.  3.253   Furthermore, in some contexts the approaches described in 3.246–.251 are unlikely to work. Consider the circumstances of   Cussler , mentioned in 3.237: Assessing a screenplay is a highly subjective task, so it’s unlikely that either party would have   agreed   to   make   Cussler’s   approval   right   subject   to objective conditions. And Cussler’s rejection of Crusader’s screenplay didn’t cause him to incur any direct costs, so he had little to stop him from rejecting screenplays for any reason, however justified or unjustified.  3.254   In such contexts, the prudent course to take would be to eliminate the problematic language of discretion. Regarding  Cussler , dispute would have been avoided had the screenplay initially approved by the parties been the final screenplay, or had one or other party been given unilateral control over revisions to the screenplay.",
  "USE   OUTSIDE   OF   LANGUAGE   OF   DISCRETION  3.255   The phrase   at its sole discretion   is not only used in language of discretion. It also occurs in conditional clauses ( If Acme at its sole discretion buys more widgets ) and in restrictive relative clauses ( at a price acceptable to Widgetco in its sole discretion ).  3.256   Use of the phrase in these contexts has nothing to do with discretion granted by the contract, but it nevertheless relates to   conduct   that   falls   within   the   scope   of   the   contract. Because   in   these   contexts   nothing   constrains   the   party’s action, that action could conceivably fall under the implied duty of good faith.  3.257   It would be best to treat this use of   at its sole discretion   the same way as this manual recommends treating its use in language of discretion (see 3.224): if the phrase is used in an attempt to address a deal issue, address that issue directly. If it’s used out of legalistic habit, delete it.  Hereby Grants   ...   the Right To  3.258   One sometimes sees the formula   Party X hereby grants Party Y the right to   [verb], as in [4-1m]. It’s language of discretion disguised as language of performance.   Widgetco hereby grants Acme the right to sell the Assets   means the same thing as   Acme may sell the Assets , but uses ten words rather than five.  3.259   So instead of the formula   Party X hereby grants Party Y the right to   [verb], you’re always better off using   Party Y may  [verb], as in this example:  The Borrower hereby grants to the Holder the right to   [read   The Holder may ] set off against this note upon occurrence of an Event of Default ... .  When Exercising Discretion Requires Cooperation  3.260   Consider   this   language   of   discretion:   One   or   more   Acme representatives may inspect Widgetco’s financial records during",
  "business hours at Widgetco’s principal office . It doesn’t simply grant discretion—it also imposes on Widgetco an unstated obligation   to   cooperate   with   Acme’s   representatives.   That obligation is hinted at if instead of   may   you say   will be given the   opportunity   to —a   structure   that’s   sometimes   used   in contracts.  3.261   It’s clearer to make explicit any such implicit obligations:  Widgetco shall permit one or more Acme representatives to inspect Widgetco’s financial records during business hours at Widgetco’s principal office .  Using   Hereby Waives the Right To   to Express Discretion  3.262   Sometimes the phrase   hereby waives the right to   is used when what you’re really saying is that the other party doesn’t have to do something. So say that instead:  Acme hereby waives any right to   [read   Photoco is not required to permit Acme to ] inspect or approve of any finished photographs.  The Employee hereby waives his right to receive   [read   The Company will not be required to pay the Employee ] any severance other than under this agreement.  The Borrower hereby waives its right to elect to make   [read   The Lender is not required to accept ] payments under this agreement in a currency other than U.S. dollars.  3.263   Regarding use of   hereby waives the right to   as a suboptimal way to express prohibition, see 3.285.  Is Entitled To  3.264   A second vehicle of discretion is   is entitled to   used with a complement clause in the active voice (unless it’s used with  receive ; see 3.136). It conveys a specific meaning, but there’s a clearer alternative.  3.265   Although more often than not   is entitled to   used   with   a complement   clause   in   the   active   voice   is,   as   in   [4-1b],   a",
  "wordier   and   therefore   inferior   alternative   to   may ,   in   this context it can be distinguished from   may .  3.266   As discussed in 3.136 and 3.152, when   is entitled to   is used with a noun or a complement clause in the passive voice, it’s implicit that another party is obligated to provide what the subject of the sentence is entitled to. Similarly,   is entitled to  with an active complement clause is best used when one party’s discretion depends on performance by another party. For   example,   in   [5-1],   Jones’s   purchase   of   Shares   would require that Acme do whatever is required of it as the seller, and in [5-2] Smith could serve on Investco’s board only if appointed.   Is entitled to   captures this nuance;   may   (as in [5- 1b] and [5-2a]) does not. (The active-voice alternative,   will entitle , is awkward; see [5-1a].)  TABLE 5   LANGUAGE OF DISCRETION:   IS ENTITLED TO  [5-1]   No later than five days after Jones exercises the Option, Jones will be entitled to purchase a number of Shares equal to ... . [5-1a]   Exercise of the Option will entitle Jones to purchase within five days a number of Shares equal to ... . [5-1b]   No later than five days after Jones exercises the Option, Jones may purchase a number of Shares equal to ... . [5-1c]   No later than five days after Jones exercises the Option, Acme shall sell to Jones, at Jones’s election, a number of shares equal to ... . [5-2]   Smith is entitled to serve on Investco’s board of directors. [5-2a]   Smith may serve on Investco’s board of directors. [5-2b]   Investco shall at Smith’s option appoint Smith a member of its board of directors.",
  "3.267   But it would be much clearer to ignore this subtle distinction and instead focus on the other party’s obligation, as in [5-1c] and [5-2b].   This   approach   is   feasible   in   contract   drafting because of the limited number of actors; in statutory drafting, it would likely be very awkward to express   a person is entitled to vote   as language of obligation.  Is Not Required To  3.268   Use   is   not   required   to   plus   verb   to   convey   absence   of obligation (see [6-1]). (Strictly speaking, absence of obligation doesn’t equal discretion, but the two are comparable, so it makes more sense to place this discussion with language of discretion instead of language of obligation.) Don’t use the wordier   in no event is Acme required to , with its rhetorical emphasis (see 1.58), or   nothing in this agreement requires Acme to . Except to avoid confusion, don’t use the wordier   this agreement does not require Acme to   or   nothing in this agreement requires Acme to : the implication with all verb structures used to establish the categories of contract language is that they reflect agreement of the parties, not some broader reality.  3.269   Using instead   is not obligated to   might seem an appropriate choice to express absence of obligation. By contrast,   is not required to   might seem like “elegant variation”—unnecessary use of a synonym. But British drafters prefer   is not obliged to  (see [6-1a]), which sounds too conversational to American ears. To avoid these dueling usages, use   is not required to .   Is not bound to   (see [6-1b]) is an unnecessary variant.   May not,  meaning in this context “is authorized not to,” isn’t suitable, because that meaning is just one of three possible meanings conveyed by   may not   (see 3.279).  3.270   The verb following   is not required to   can be used in the active voice (see [6-1] and [6-3a]) and the passive voice (see [6-3]). Use the active voice (see 3.13).",

  "[6-3b]   Amounts collected from Participants shall not be required to be held in a segregated account.  3.271   Don’t use, as in [6-1c] and [6-3b],   shall not be required to , as that use of   shall   is inconsistent with using it to mean only “has a duty to” (see 3.74). And unless you’re addressing the consequences of a contingent future event (see 3.307), it’s better not to use   will not be required to , as in [6-1d]: even though the obligation will continue into the future, it applies when the agreement becomes effective, so the present tense is preferable (see 3.307).  3.272   Don’t confuse not imposing an obligation on Party A with imposing that obligation on Party B (see [6-1e]). The latter doesn’t necessarily follow from the former.  3.273   Similarly, it doesn’t make sense to impose limits on Party A if Party B’s concern is simply that it not be responsible if Party A exceeds those limits. More specifically, [6-2a] prevents the consultant from incurring more than a stated amount of expenses; that’s too restrictive, since Acme simply wants to limit the consultant expenses that it’s required to reimburse. The latter meaning is expressed by [6-2], but it’s expressed even more clearly by an obligation with a cap (see [6-2b]). For expressing performance with limits, it’s better to state what has to be done rather than what doesn’t have to be done.  3.274   Example   [6-1f],   using   is   not   entitled   to   and   a   passive complement clause, is equivalent to [6-1] viewed from the perspective of Widgetco. Provisions using   is not entitled to   and a   passive   complement   clause   are,   like   provisions   using   is entitled   to   and   a   passive   complement   clause   (see   3.152), analogous to provisions in the passive voice and so exhibit the shortcomings associated with the passive voice, namely wordiness and often, as in [6-1f], an absent   by -agent. Instead of using   is not entitled to , focus on the party not subject to the obligation. Similarly, it’s best not to use   is not entitled to   plus",
  "a noun: instead of   Acme is not entitled to advance notice , say  Roe is not required to give Acme advance notice .  3.275   Don’t   use   need   not ,   as   in   [6-1g],   to   convey   absence   of obligation. Colloquially,   need   is used to indicate not only the lack of something ( I need a haircut ) but also an obligation ( You need to come to my office immediately ). But it would be unhelpful   to   use   need   to   in   a   contract   to   express   an obligation, because that function is already served by   shall   for imposing an obligation on the subject of the sentence (see 3.72). By extension, it would be unhelpful to use   need not   to preclude   an   obligation.   Further   muddying   the   waters   is colloquial use of   need not   to mean “should not” ( Foreigners need not apply )   and   “has   no   reason   to”   ( Fred   need   not   be afraid ). The slightly old-fashioned   need not   is simply not as clear as   is not required to .  3.276   Don’t use   may refuse to   (see [6-1h]) to convey absence of obligation; the discretion to refuse to do something differs from having no obligation to do it. And don’t say that one party   does not expect   the other party to do something or other (see [6-1i]). Like   will   be   expected   to   (see   3.114),   it’s   oddly circumspect.  Is Not Prohibited From  3.277   Use   is not prohibited from   to express absence of prohibition. (Strictly   speaking,   absence   of   prohibition   doesn’t   equal discretion, but the two are comparable, so it makes more sense to place this discussion with language of discretion instead   of   language   of   prohibition.)   Except   to   avoid confusion,   don’t   use   the   wordier   this   agreement   does   not prohibit Acme from   or   nothing in this agreement prohibits Acme from   (see 3.268). You could instead use   may , but if in the absence of a contract Acme would be able to do whatever it is, it would be to Acme’s advantage to avoid suggesting that its ability to so conduct itself is a function of the contract.",
  "LANGUAGE OF PROHIBITION  Shall Not  3.278   “Language of prohibition” specifies what a contract prohibits the parties from doing. Prohibition is principally conveyed by   shall not ,   meaning   “has   a   duty   not   to,”   or   must   not , meaning “is required not to.” Use   shall not   (see [7-1]) and  must not   to convey prohibition where you would use   shall  and   must ,   respectively,   to   convey   obligation.   As   with language   of   obligation,   the   most   direct   way   to   express prohibition is by imposing the prohibition on the subject of the sentence, using   shall not   (see [7-1]), but as with use of  shall , that wouldn’t make sense if the subject of the sentence is a nonparty (see 3.138).  TABLE 7   LANGUAGE OF PROHIBITION  [7-1]   The Customer shall not modify the Equipment without Acme’s prior written consent. [7-1a]   The Customer may not modify the Equipment ... . [7-1b]   The Customer is not entitled to modify the Equipment ... . [7-1c]   The Customer shall refrain from modifying the Equipment ... . [7-1d]   The Customer hereby waives the right to modify the Equipment ... . [7-1e]   The Customer shall never modify the Equipment ... . [7-1f]   The Customer shall in no way modify the Equipment ... . [7-1g]   The Customer cannot modify the Equipment ... . [7-1h]   The Customer agrees not to modify the Equipment ... .",
  "[7-1i]   Nothing in this agreement gives the Customer the right to modify the Equipment ... . [7-2]   Neither party shall assign any of its rights ... . [7-2a]   Neither party may assign any of its rights ... . [7-2b]   The parties shall not assign any of their rights ... . [7-2c]   Each party shall not assign any of its rights ... .  Don’t Use   May Not  3.279   May not , meaning “is not permitted to” (see [7-1a]), is not the   best   choice   for   language   of   prohibition.   It   seems   to achieve the same effect as   shall not   and   must not , in that depriving a party of authority to take an action would be equivalent to requiring that party not to take that action. But it suffers from ambiguity that goes beyond that afflicting   may  (see 3.206):   Acme may not transfer the Shares   can mean that Acme (1) might not transfer the Shares, (2) is authorized not to transfer the Shares, or (3) isn’t authorized to transfer the Shares. Readers likely would nevertheless derive the intended meaning,   but   presenting   them   with   alternative   meanings gives them more work to do.  Is Not Entitled To  3.280   Just as   is entitled to   with an active complement clause is best used when action by one party depends on performance by another party (see 3.266),   is not entitled to   with an active complement clause is appropriate when prohibition is based on another party’s not being subject to an obligation, as in  Smith is not entitled to serve on Widgetco’s board of directors — Smith could serve on Widgetco’s board only if appointed .",
  "Similarly,   Acme is not entitled to convert the Shares except as provided in section 3.2   captures that nuance better than   Acme shall not convert its Shares   ... . Outside of that context—see for example   [7-1b]—there’s   no   need   for   is   not   entitled   to   in language of prohibition.  3.281   Although in both examples in 3.280 you could use   has no obligation   or   has no right   instead of   is not entitled to,   this manual recommends that you not do so. Using   obligation,   an abstract   noun   (see   17.7),   makes   has   no   obligation   rather ponderous .   As for   has no right,   the noun   right   (one definition of which is “an interest or expectation guaranteed by law”) doesn’t otherwise feature in language recommended in this chapter; it would be anomalous to introduce it solely in this context.  3.282   Although this manual recommends in 3.267 that one use language of obligation rather than   is entitled to   with an active complement clause, no particular benefit would be gained from   an   analogous   fix   in   language   of   prohibition,   for example rephrasing the first example in 3.280 as   Widgetco is not required to appoint Smith to its board of directors .  Don’t Use   Shall Refrain  3.283   When someone asks you to refrain from doing something, they’re being polite. The implication is that they’re relying on   your   self-control.   It’s   used   in   social   contexts— Please refrain   from   picking   a   fight   with   your   Uncle   Roger .   The consequences of failing to refrain presumably depend on the context and might be limited to mild disappointment. You also see   refrain   used when businesses deal with the public, as when a public announcement at an airport asks that you please refrain from smoking. In such contexts it’s clearer a prohibition is being expressed.  3.284   For contracts, one would likely have a hard time claiming that   refrain   expresses   something   less   than   outright prohibition.   But   there   is   no   reason   to   risk   having   that",
  "discussion— shall not   expresses the intended meaning more clearly than does   shall refrain from . Furthermore, contracts are for articulating rules and not for persuading (1.57), so they’re not the place for deference exemplified by   shall refrain from .  Don’t Use   Hereby Waives the Right To   to Express Prohibition  3.285   The phrase   hereby waives the right to   and its variants (for example,   hereby waives any right to ) constitute language of performance. There’s always an alternative that shows more clearly and concisely what’s actually going on.  3.286   For one thing,   Acme hereby waives the right to sell the Shares  means that Acme is prohibited from doing so. It would be simpler and more concise to say   Acme shall not sell the Shares  —it confuses matters to use different verb structures to say the same thing. (See [7-1d] for another example.)  3.287   You generally see   hereby waives the right to   used in a more limited context, namely in provisions relating to how a party conducts itself in adversarial proceedings. An example:   The Purchaser hereby waives its right to pursue any other remedy .  3.288   But there’s no reason to distinguish, say, the right to sell shares   from   the   right   to   assert   an   argument   in   a   legal proceeding. If in the former it makes sense to use language of prohibition to express surrender of a right, then it makes sense in the latter too.  3.289   The most common example of this use of   hereby waives the right to   is for waiving the right to trial by jury. Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a party may secure   a   jury   trial   by   filing   a   jury   trial   demand   and completing   proper   service   on   opposing   parties,   so   to   use language of prohibition, you could say   Each party shall not demand a trial by jury . But the waiver language is universal, so you might find it expedient to stick with it.  3.290   Regarding   using   language   of   discretion   instead   of   hereby waives the right to , see 3.262.",
  "Other Suboptimal Usages  3.291   Don’t use   shall never   (see [7-1e]): the notion of perpetuity inherent in   never   is overkill in this context, because   shall not  is   equally   comprehensive.   If   you   want   an   obligation—for example, an obligation to keep information confidential—to continue   perpetually,   even   after   termination   of   the agreement,   say   so   explicitly.   Don’t   rely   on   shall never   to convey that meaning, because   never   could just as well be understood to mean only until termination of the agreement.  3.292   Using   shall in no way   (see [7-1f]) is to indulge in rhetorical emphasis, adding needless words (see 1.58). It means the same thing as   shall not , but adds a pointless flourish.  3.293   Just as using   can   in language of discretion is inappropriate (see 3.189), so is using   cannot   in language of prohibition, as in [7-1g]. And just as using   agrees to   isn’t a clear way of expressing an obligation (see 3.109),   agrees not to , as in [7-1h], isn’t a clear way of expressing prohibition.  3.294   Saying   that   a   contract   doesn’t   authorize   a   party   to   do something, as in [7-1i], is equivalent to prohibition; it would be simpler to express it as such. If you intend a different meaning, find a clearer way to express it.  Collective Nouns  3.295   When the subject of a sentence is a collective noun such as  party   or   shareholder ,   whether   singular   or   plural,   you   can convey prohibition by rendering negative either the subject or the verb.  3.296   You   render   the   subject   negative   by   using   neither ,   if   the subject consists of two parties ( Neither party   ...), or   no , if the subject consists of more than two parties ( No Shareholder   ...). When you render the subject negative, you have the choice of using as the verb   shall   (see [7-2]) or   may   (see [7-2a]). The drawback to using a negative subject with   shall   is that if you apply the   has a duty   test (see 3.74), it would appear to express",
  "the absence of duty rather than expressing prohibition. The drawback to using   may   is that it would be inconsistent to use  may   to   express   prohibition   in   this   context   and   shall   not  elsewhere   (see   3.278).   Of   the   two,   using   may   is   the better option.  3.297   The alternative would be to render the verb negative. You could do so using a plural noun, as in [7-2b]. As is the case whenever a plural noun is the subject of the sentence, the question is whether the prohibition applies to the members of   the   group   collectively   as   opposed   to   individually   (see 11.16), but it’s unlikely that would cause confusion. More problematic is a plural subject accompanied by the pronoun  their , as in [7-2b]—it could be understood to mean that the object is owned collectively. Using instead a singular noun, as in [7-2c], would allow you to avoid both issues, at the cost of an extra word.  Nor Shall  3.298   Don’t use   nor shall   to express negation.  3.299   Nor   plus verb is used to express negation that follows an express negative or an idea that is negative in sense. Usually it begins a sentence, but   nor shall , preceded by a comma, usually continues a sentence, as in this example:  The Receiving Party shall not use Confidential Information other than as authorized by the Disclosing Party under the SOW,   nor shall   the Receiving Party disclose any Confidential Information to nonparties without the Disclosing Party’s written consent.  3.300   But it’s awkward to echo prohibition expressed earlier in the sentence by using a structure that places the auxiliary ( shall ) before the subject and the main verb. Instead, use language of   prohibition.   That   would   have   the   added   benefit   of avoiding using   shall   in a way that fails the   has a duty   test (see 3.74). And   nor shall   is conducive to run-on sentences.  3.301   So here’s a revised version of the above example:",
  "The Receiving Party shall not use Confidential Information other than as authorized by the Disclosing Party under the SOW. The Receiving Party shall not disclose any Confidential Information to nonparties without the Disclosing Party’s written consent.  Prohibition by Way of an Exception to Language of Discretion or Obligation  3.302   You can express prohibition with an exception to language of discretion, but there are clear and slightly less clear ways of doing so.  3.303   Consider the following:   Widgetco may sell one or more of the Vehicles   except the 1965 Ford Mustang.   As a matter of logic, it could be argued that the exception excludes that vehicle from   Widgetco’s   discretion   but   does   no   more—in   other words,   the   provision   is   otherwise   silent   regarding   that vehicle, so Widgetco could sell it without being in breach of this provision. That’s a weak argument, as the expectation of relevance (see 3.192) strongly suggests that the intention was to   have   the   exception   be   equivalent   to   language   of prohibition; had the intention been to allow Widgetco to sell the Ford Mustang, it would have made sense to omit the exception.   But   to   avoid   any   chance   of   a   dispute   over meaning, say instead   Widgetco may sell one or more of the Vehicles, except that it shall not sell the 1965 Ford Mustang . Or more concisely,   Widgetco may sell one or more of the Vehicles but not the 1965 Ford Mustang .  3.304   You can express prohibition with an exception to language of obligation, but you have to be more explicit than with an exception to language of discretion. If the example in 3.303 were instead to read   Widgetco shall sell all Vehicles except the 1965 Ford Mustang , as a matter of logic it could be argued that the   exception   excludes   that   vehicle   from   Widgetco’s obligation but does no more, so Widgetco could sell the Ford Mustang without breaching the obligation. But more to the point, in this case the expectation of relevance is unrelated to",
  "whether Widgetco may sell the Ford Mustang—it suggests only that the obligation doesn’t apply to the Ford Mustang. To avoid any chance of a dispute over meaning, say instead  Widgetco shall sell one or more of the Vehicles, except that it shall not sell the 1965 Ford Mustang . It wouldn’t be enough to negate the obligation.  LANGUAGE OF POLICY  3.305   Besides stating what the parties are required to do, permitted to   do,   or   prohibited   from   doing,   a   contract   will   usually contain “policies,” which is the term this manual uses for rules that the parties must observe but that don’t, at least expressly, require or permit action or inaction.  3.306   There are two kinds of policy. First, those that state rules governing a thing, event, or circumstance (see [8-1], [8-7], and   [8-8]).   And   second,   those   that   address   the   scope, meaning, or duration of a contract or part of a contract (see [8-2] through [8-6]).  Verbs in Language of Policy  3.307   Use   the   present   tense   for   those   policies   that   apply   on effectiveness of the contract (such as [8-2], [8-3], and [8-4]), even though the policy will continue to apply in the future. Use the present tense also for those policies (such as [8-5]) that state a time of effectiveness or lapsing of effectiveness— in general usage it’s standard to use the present tense in this manner for situations that are to occur at a stated time in the future. But if the policy relates to future events that might not take place, as in [8-1] and [8-6], or the timing of which is uncertain, use   will .  TABLE 8   LANGUAGE OF POLICY",

[8-8b]   Smith may exercise the Option ... .  3.308   Don’t use   shall   in language of policy: as language of policy doesn’t impose obligations.  Buried-Actor Policies  3.309   Some policies focus on what is acted on, when it would be clearer to focus on the actor. This manual calls such policies “buried-actor   policies.”   One   kind   of   buried-actor   policy features   the   adjectives   exercisable ,   payable ,   and   recoverable . Such buried-actor policies have two shortcomings. First, as with   passive   verb   phrases   (see   3.12),   the   agent   can   be expressed by a   by- agent, but in contracts the agent is often omitted   (see   [8-7]   and   [8-8]),   leaving   unstated   the   party responsible for performing the action. Second, if a contract states that   the fee is payable by 20 April 2018 , that could, depending on the context, mean that the party in question is obligated to pay the fee by that date, or has discretion to pay the fee, or that timely payment of the fee is a condition. Such buried-actor   policies   should   be   rephrased   as   language   of",
  "obligation (see [8-7b]), as language of discretion (see [8-8b]), or as conditional clauses.  3.310   A comparable source of buried-actor policies is the phrase   is due , as in   The First Installment is due by 1 March 2018 . It would be better expressed as language of obligation:   The Purchaser shall pay the First Installment by 1 March 2018 .  3.311   Another   feature   of   buried-actor   policies   is   the   phrase   is subject to , as in   The Employee’s position and assignments are subject to change . Instead of saying   is subject to   plus abstract noun, with an inanimate object as the subject, use   may   plus a verb, with a party as the subject:   The Company may change the Employee’s position and assignments . Yet another example is the phrase   is eligible for , as in   The Employee will be eligible for a bonus if   ... . It would be clearer to say instead   The Company shall pay the Employee a bonus if   ... .  Use of the Passive Voice  3.312   Use   of   the   passive   voice   in   language   of   policy   is unremarkable   (see   the   example   in   3.24).   But   in   some instances in which the   by -agent (see 3.12) is missing, the missing   by -agent   is   the   world   at   large,   not   one   or   more parties. That’s the case with   the Exercise Price will be adjusted . One   way   to   prevent   any   implication   that   action   by   the parties   or   anyone   else   is   involved   would   be   to   use  automatically   (see 13.102). Another way would be to switch, if possible,   from   the   passive   voice   ( the   Option   Price   will   be increased ) to the active voice ( the Option Price will increase ), leaving the subject unchanged. That wouldn’t make sense with, for example,   will be deemed   (see 13.217–.218)—leave it as is.  EXPRESSING CONDITIONS  3.313   This section addresses not a category of contract language but instead how to express conditions in conjunction with",
  "categories   of   contract   language.   For   these   purposes, “condition”   means   a   future   and   uncertain   event   or circumstance on which the existence of some particular legal relation depends.  3.314   This manual is concerned only with how to convey meaning in a contract, so terms of art ostensibly relating to conditions and   applied   in   resolving   disputes—for   example,   the distinction   under   English   law   between   “promissory conditions”   and   “contingent   conditions,”   and   the   three pages devoted to   condition   and its variants in   Black’s Law Dictionary —are irrelevant for our purposes.  3.315   In a contract, use the term   condition   rather than   condition precedent ,   which   conveys   the   same   meaning   but   adds   an unnecessarily legalistic flavor. You should never need to use  condition subsequent , meaning something that, if it occurs, would bring something else to an end—it’s safe to assume that its meaning is unclear to clients and many lawyers. Without using the label   condition subsequent , simply state that if X happens, then Y will cease.  Conditional Clauses  3.316   Conditional clauses don’t fall within one of the categories of contract   language.   Instead,   they   modify   language   of obligation, discretion, prohibition, and policy.  STRUCTURE   AND   FUNCTION  3.317   A sentence containing a conditional clause consists of the conditional clause, including a subordinator, and the matrix clause. In the sentence “ If Acme has not exercised the Option by 31 December 2017 , Smith may transfer the Shares to another Person,” the italicized portion is the conditional clause, with  If   as the subordinator; the remainder of the sentence is the matrix clause.  3.318   The   truth   of   the   proposition   in   the   matrix   clause   is   a consequence   of   fulfillment   of   the   condition   in   the",
  "conditional   clause.   In   general   usage,   the   most   common subordinator is   if,   with the negative subordinator   unless   the next   most   common.   Other   subordinators   include   where ,  when ,   as long as ,   so long as , and   on condition that .  3.319   When using   if   as the subordinator, it’s unnecessary to use  then   to   begin   a   matrix   clause   that   follows.   And   if   the conditional   clause   is   relatively   short,   adding   then   to   the matrix clause just adds dead weight to the sentence. But if the conditional clause is complex and either it’s not lengthy enough   to   justify   putting   it   after   the   matrix   clause   or   it doesn’t make sense to put it there (see 3.326), beginning the matrix clause with   then   might help reduce reader miscues.  3.320   For example, in the following sentence, omitting   then   from the beginning of the matrix clause might cause the reader to think for a moment that   for as long as that compulsory license is in effect   refers to how long Acme may sell a Product under the license as opposed to how long the terms of the license apply:  If a Government Body grants to Acme a compulsory license to sell a Product in a country on terms more favorable than those in this article 8, then for as long as that compulsory license is in effect the terms of that compulsory license will control.  VERBS   IN   THE   CONDITIONAL   CLAUSE  3.321   The present tense is acceptable in all conditional clauses; see [9-1] and [9-2]. In the interest of consistency, use only the present   tense,   even   though   the   present   perfect   is   also acceptable if, as in [9-2a], satisfying the condition is a part of the transaction as opposed to a response to a contingency.  3.322   Don’t use   shall   in conditional clauses. Many drafters do; see [9-1b],   [9-1c],   [9-2b],   [9-2c],   and   [9-3a].   Because   in   this context   shall   cannot convey obligation, drafters presumably use   it   to   express   futurity.   Perhaps   they   think   that   if   a conditional clause uses the present tense, then the matrix clause would operate only on conditions that are met at the",
  "moment the contract becomes effective. When a conditional clause uses a dynamic verb (as in   If Roe transfers the Shares ), this fear is unwarranted. When, as in [9-3], a conditional clause uses a stative verb (that is, a verb that expresses a continuing state, such as   is ), you can alleviate this fear by adding   at any time , as in [9-3c]. Even better, you can often sidestep the issue by switching from a stative to a dynamic verb, as in [9-3d].  TABLE 9   CONDITIONAL CLAUSES  [9-1]   If Investco receives a Violation Notice, it shall promptly notify Widgetco. [9-1a]   If Investco has received a Violation Notice, ... . [9-1b]   If Investco shall receive a Violation Notice, ... . [9-1c]   If Investco shall have received a Violation Notice, ... . [9-1d]   If Investco should receive a Violation Notice, ... . [9-2]   If Acme receives a Notice of Consent, it may transfer the Shares. [9-2a]   If Acme has received a Notice of Consent, ... . [9-2b]   If Acme shall receive a Notice of Consent, ... . [9-2c]   If Acme shall have received a Notice of Consent, ... . [9-3]   If the Borrower is in default, the Lender may accelerate the Loan. [9-3a]   If the Borrower shall be in default, ... . [9-3b]   If the Borrower be in default, ... .",
  "[9-3c]   If the Borrower is at any time in default, ... . [9-3d]   If the Borrower defaults, ... .  3.323   Using   should   in conditional clauses, as in [9-1d], conveys an unhelpful   tentativeness.   You   could   place   should   at   the beginning   of   the   conditional   clause   ( Should   Investco receive   ...), but that wouldn’t represent an improvement. No purpose is served by using the subjunctive, as in [9-3b].  VERBS   IN   THE   MATRIX   CLAUSE  3.324   If the verb in a matrix clause would, absent the conditional clause, be in the present tense, use   will , as in [10-1] and [10- 2], and not the present tense, as in [10-1b] and [10-2b], and not   shall , as in [10-1a] and [10-2a], as no duty is involved.  TABLE 10   CONDITIONAL CLAUSES: THE MATRIX CLAUSE  [10-1]   If Jones ceases to be employed by the Company, the Option will terminate. [10-1a]   If ... , the Option shall terminate. [10-1b]   If ... , the Option terminates. [10-2]   If a Stockholder transfers all its Shares to a Person that is not a Stockholder, that transfer will be valid only if the Person acquiring those Shares agrees to be bound by this agreement. [10-2a]   If ... , that transfer shall be valid only ... . [10-2b]   If ... , that transfer is valid only ... .",
  "3.325   The auxiliary verbs   shall ,   may , and   must   are unaffected by the presence of a conditional clause.  POSITION   OF   THE   CONDITIONAL   CLAUSE  3.326   The   traditional   place   for   a   conditional   clause   is   at   the beginning of a sentence, but you should place it elsewhere if doing so would make the provision easier to read. The longer the conditional clause, the more likely it is that the provision would be more readable with the matrix clause rather than the conditional clause at the front of the sentence. If both the conditional clause and matrix clause contain more than one element, you would likely be better off expressing them as two sentences.  CHOOSING   BETWEEN   POSITIVE   AND   NEGATIVE   IN   THE   MATRIX   CLAUSE  3.327   Consider these alternatives:  1.   Acme may sell the Shares only if Widgetco consents. 2.   Acme shall not sell the Shares unless Widgetco consents.  3.328   The   first   uses   language   of   discretion   and   includes   a conditional clause, with   if   as the subordinator. The second uses   language   of   prohibition,   and   it   too   includes   a conditional   clause,   with   unless   as   the   subordinator.   Both appear to convey the same meaning. How does one choose which to use?  3.329   A practical approach would be to select the example that better reflects what the client expects will happen or would prefer to happen. Regarding the above examples, if the client thinks it’s more likely that Acme will sell the shares, or if the client prefers that Acme do so, choose the first example. If the opposite is the case, choose the second example.  3.330   But it’s also relevant to consider what happens if in each of the above examples the condition isn’t satisfied. In the first",
  "example, what category of contract language would apply if Widgetco doesn’t consent? The expectation of relevance (see 3.191) suggests that if Widgetco doesn’t consent, discretion would be removed and Acme wouldn’t be permitted to sell the shares. But it’s conceivable that Acme might instead be obligated to sell the shares if Widgetco doesn’t consent.  3.331   And in the second example, the expectation of relevance suggests that if Widgetco consents, the prohibition would be lifted and Acme could sell if it wishes. But it’s conceivable that Acme might instead be obligated to sell the shares if Widgetco consents.  3.332   If you would prefer to be specific instead of relying on the expectation of relevance to fill in the gap in each example, you would have to say the following:  Acme shall not sell the Shares, except that it may sell the Shares if Widgetco consents.  3.333   A comparable choice can occur in language of policy that includes a conditional clause, as in these alternatives:  1.   An amendment to this agreement will be effective only if it is in writing and signed by both parties. 2.   An amendment to this agreement will not be effective unless it is in writing and signed by both parties. 3.   No amendment to this agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by both parties.  3.334   The first is expressed in positive terms and uses   if   as the subordinator; the second and third are expressed in negative terms (with negation achieved with the verb and with the subject, respectively) and use   unless   as the subordinator. The third   is   one   word   shorter   than   the   second   and   so   is marginally more concise.  3.335   One encounters mixed views as to whether it’s preferable to express   this   in   positive   or   negative   terms.   But   because instances of parties amending a contract effectively greatly",
  "outnumber instances of ineffective amendment, this manual suggests   that   it’s   preferable   to   express   this   provision   in positive terms, using the first alternative.  3.336   To see what other categories of contract language could be used to express this meaning, see 3.467.  USING   UNLESS   WITH   LANGUAGE   OF   OBLIGATION   DENOTING   ACTIVITY  3.337   The opinion of the District Court for the Northern District of California in   Total Recall Technologies v. Luckey , No. C 15- 02281   WHA,   2016   WL   199796   (N.D.   Cal.   16   Jan.   2016), reveals the potential for dispute when language of obligation denoting   activity   (as   opposed   to   momentary   action)   is coupled   with   a   conditional   clause   using   unless   as   the subordinator.  3.338   In that dispute, the defendant Luckey argued that he had not breached the terms of the confidentiality agreement at issue, in   that   the   nondisclosure   and   exclusivity   provisions   had never taken effect. Here’s the relevant part of the contract (emphasis added by the court):  The Receiving party shall keep all details including drawings and part suppliers of the Head Mounted Display confidential and shall not aid any other person or entity in the design of a Head Mounted Display other than the disclosing party.   Unless within a twelve month period from 1st July 2011 the receiving party has not received a minimum payment in royalties of 10,000 US dollars by the disclosing party.   The exclusivity shall remain in place for a period of 10 years providing a minimum of 10,000 US dollars is paid from the disclosing party to the receiving party per annum.  3.339   The second sentence is ungrammatical; the court assumed that should have been a conditional clause modifying the first sentence. Here’s what the court said about the second sentence: Luckey’s argument that the nondisclosure and exclusivity provisions of the agreement never took effect",
  "turns on the interpretation of the italicized sentence fragment above. Luckey contends that the ten thousand dollar payment contemplated therein was a contingent event that had to occur before the exclusivity and nondisclosure obligations could take effect. Seidl’s (and Total Recall’s) failure to make such a payment, Luckey argues, is fatal to Total Recall’s claim that Luckey breached the contract. Total Recall responds that its payment obligation was excused by Luckey’s alleged breach. The use of the word “unless” tends to support Luckey’s construction of the agreement; however, the grammatical defect in the provision renders it ambiguous at the Rule 12 stage. One possibility is that the fragment was a condition subsequent, meaning the duty to maintain confidentiality evaporated after one year (if the payment was not made). Another is that it was a condition precedent, meaning the duty never arose in the first place (since no payment was made). And, while it seems clear that zero payment was ever made, the idea that Luckey frustrated such payment and thus excused it is plausible (if barely so) at the Rule 12 stage.  3.340   But Luckey’s reading of the language at issue is unreasonable. Here’s why:  3.341   Obligations are expressed using two kinds of verb—those denoting   momentary   action   and   those   denoting   activity. Below are two versions of an obligation using a verb denoting momentary action plus a conditional clause, one using the subordinator   if   (with a positive conditional clause) and the other the subordinator   unless   (with a negative conditional clause):  On 1 January 2018, A shall pay B $100 if C is then living in the United States. On 1 January 2018, A shall pay B $100 unless C is then not living",
  "in the United States.  3.342   Both versions express the same meaning.  3.343   And here are two versions of another obligation, this one using a verb denoting activity plus a conditional clause, again with   one   conditional   clause   using   if   (with   a   positive conditional   clause)   and   the   other   the   subordinator   unless  (with a negative conditional clause):  A shall keep the information confidential if by 1 July 2012 B has paid A $10,000. A shall keep the information confidential unless by 1 July 2012 B has not paid A $10,000.  3.344   The version with   if   is clear—the obligation applies only after the condition has been satisfied. The version with   unless —it’s a simplified version of the language at issue in   Total Recall Technologies —expresses a different meaning. There’s nothing to suggest that the obligation wouldn’t apply on entry into the contract.   Unless   is the negative counterpart of   if , so in the context of an obligation that uses a verb denoting activity and   that   applies   on   entry   into   the   contract,   the   natural reading of a conditional clause with   unless   is that satisfaction of   the   condition   would   mean   that   the   party   under   the obligation would no longer have to comply with it. But that’s not the meaning sought by the defendant in   Total Recall Technologies .  3.345   That’s perhaps easier to see using simpler examples:  I’ll look after your plants if you’re nice to me. I’ll look after your plants unless you’re not nice to me.  3.346   The first example is clear—it’s a condition to my looking after   your   plants   that   you   be   nice   to   me.   It   would   be semantically anomalous to derive that meaning from the second   example,   but   that   meaning   is   analogous   to   the meaning sought by the defendant in   Total Recall Technologies .",
  "The natural meaning is that I’ll look after your plants, but I’ll stop doing so if you’re not nice to me.  3.347   So the court was mistaken in saying that “use of the word ‘unless’ tends to support the defendant’s construction of the agreement.”  3.348   To avoid this sort of dispute, whenever an obligation that uses a verb denoting activity is coupled with a conditional clause using   unless , replace the   unless   conditional clause with  except that   plus language of discretion (using   is not required to ) and an   if   conditional clause, as in the second version below (the first version is the simplified version of the language at issue in   Total Recall Technologies ):  A shall keep the information confidential unless by 1 July 2012 B has not paid A $10,000. A shall keep the information confidential, except that if by 1 July 2012 B has not paid A $10,000, A will no longer be required to keep the information confidential.  3.349   The second version also has the advantage of not relying on the expectation of relevance (see 3.191).  3.350   The version with   unless   couldn’t be said to be unclear, so why change it? Because it might be prudent not only to be clear but also to avoid possible fights. Disgruntled contract parties might follow the example of the defendant in   Total Recall   Technologies   and   pick   a   fight   based   on   ostensible confusion resulting from a verb denoting activity coupled with a conditional clause using   unless .  Language of Policy Used to Express Conditions  3.351   When deal lawyers refer to conditions, they usually have in mind not conditional clauses but closing conditions, namely a list of requirements introduced by a main clause such as this:   The obligations of Acme under this agreement are subject to satisfaction of the following conditions ... .   Closing conditions are a specialized form of language of policy.",
  "3.352   Traditionally,   each   closing   condition   is   presented   as   a separate sentence using   shall   in either the modal auxiliary ( shall be ) or modal perfect ( shall have been ) form. There are two problems with this approach.  STRUCTURE  3.353   When standard closing conditions are considered apart from the main clause, it isn’t evident that they’re conditions. To express just one condition, rather than a list of them, the appropriate form of introduction would be   The obligations of Acme under this agreement are subject to the condition that ... .  Despite this, standard closing conditions are never expressed as   that- clauses, and as a result they could conceivably be read as statements of fact (see [11-1] and [11-2]), or even language of obligation (when used with   shall ). To make it clear that one   is   dealing   with   conditions,   express   each   closing condition   as   a   tabulated   enumerated   that- clause (see 4.41–.53).  TABLE 11   LANGUAGE OF POLICY USED TO EXPRESS CONDITIONS  The Buyer’s obligations under this agreement are subject to satisfaction of the following conditions: [11-1]   Acme’s statements of fact are accurate at the Closing as though made at the Closing; ... . [11-1a]   that Acme’s statements of fact shall be accurate ... . [11-1b]   that Acme’s statements of fact must be accurate ... . [11-1c]   that Acme’s statements of fact will be accurate ... . [11-1d]   that Acme’s statements of fact be accurate ... . [11-1e]   that Acme’s statements of fact are accurate ... .",
  "[11-2]   the Buyer has received an opinion of Acme’s counsel in the form of exhibit A ... . [11-2a]   that the Buyer shall have received an opinion of Acme’s counsel ... . [11-2b]   that the Buyer must have received an opinion of Acme’s counsel ... . [11-2c]   that the Buyer will have received an opinion of Acme’s counsel ... . [11-2d]   that the Buyer have received an opinion of Acme’s counsel ... . [11-2e]   that the Buyer has received an opinion of Acme’s counsel ... .  TENSE   AND   MOOD  3.354   Using   shall   or   shall have   in closing conditions, as in [11-1a] and   [11-2a],   is   inappropriate,   because   closing   conditions aren’t for expressing obligations. For the same reason, using  must   or   must   have ,   as   in   [11-1b]   and   [11-2b],   is   no improvement. Using   will   or   will have , as in [11-1c] and [11- 2c], is also inappropriate. Determining whether the closing conditions have been satisfied requires that one inquire on the closing date into present, not future, circumstances. Just because the conditions are specified before the closing date doesn’t mean that they must be expressed in future time. Instead, use as appropriate either the present tense, as in [11- 1e], or the present perfect, as in [11-2e].  3.355   Normally it would be appropriate, even desirable, to use the subjunctive in closing-condition   that -clauses, as in [11-1d] and   [11-2d],   but   structuring   the   closing   conditions   as tabulated   that -clauses makes the subjunctive seem an odd choice. Use the indicative mood, as in [11-1e] and [11-2e].  Language of Obligation Used to Express Conditions",
  "3.356   A   third   way   to   express   a   condition   is   by   imposing   an obligation on the subject of a sentence, but by using   must  rather than   shall .  3.357   [12-1b]   is   part   of   a   provision   governing   Widgetco’s reimbursement of Acme’s expenses. With its use of   shall,   [12- 1b] is phrased as an obligation. If a court were to treat it as an obligation,   failure   by   Acme   to   timely   submit   invoices   to Widgetco would represent breach of Acme’s obligation but wouldn’t preclude reimbursement unless Widgetco were able to show damages caused by Acme’s having submitted the invoices late.  TABLE 12   LANGUAGE OF OBLIGATION USED TO EXPRESS CONDITIONS  [12-1]   To be reimbursed, Acme must submit to Widgetco no later than 90 days after Acme receives it each invoice for expenses that Acme incurs. [12-1a]   Acme must submit to Widgetco ... . [12-1b]   Acme shall submit to Widgetco ... . [12-1c]   To be reimbursed, Acme need only submit to Widgetco ... .  3.358   If instead this provision were expressed as a condition, Acme wouldn’t   be   entitled   to   reimbursement   unless   it   were   to timely   submit   the   related   invoices.   Presumably   Widgetco would prefer that arrangement as providing greater certainty.  3.359   Using   must   instead of   shall , as in [12-1a], would suggest that Acme   doesn’t   have   a   duty   to   timely   submit   invoices   to Widgetco—that instead it has to timely submit invoices if it wants to be reimbursed for the related expenses. But it would be reckless to rely on   must   and nothing more, as in [12-1a], to express   a   condition—when   faced   with   uncertainty   over",
  "whether a provision is a condition or an obligation, a court would likely hold that it’s an obligation. See 1-7   Murray on Contracts   § 103; 13   Williston on Contracts   § 38:13. Relying on  shall   and nothing more, as in [12-1b], would render this even more likely. See, e.g.,   Mind & Motion Utah Investments, LLC v. Celtic Bank Corp. , 367 P.3d 994, 1002 (Utah 2016) (holding that the phrase “shall record Phase 1” in a contract expresses an obligation and not a condition). Using   need only , as in [12- 1c], is too colloquial.  3.360   And consider the case of   Howard v. Federal Crop Insurance Corp. , 540 F.2d 695 (4th Cir. 1976), which involved this contract provision: “The tobacco stalks on any acreage of tobacco of types 11a, 11b, 12, 13, or 14 with respect to which a loss is claimed   shall not be destroyed   until the Corporation makes an inspection.” (Emphasis added.) The court held that absent any language plainly requiring that the provision be construed as a condition, it was to be construed as a promise, so   the   insureds   had   not   automatically   forfeited   coverage under the policy by plowing under damaged tobacco stalks.  3.361   So if you wish to use language of obligation to express a condition,   add   language   that   makes   it   clear   that   you’re dealing with a condition. The simplest way to do that would be to add a   to   infinitive clause, as in [12-1],   or   a   clause beginning with   for .  3.362   A possible alternative to [12-1] would be to use language of obligation   that   incorporates   a   time   limit:   Widgetco   shall reimburse Acme for those expenses reflected in any invoice that Acme submits to Widgetco no later than 90 days after Acme receives that invoice.   Besides being a mouthful, that alternative is less clear than [12-1], in that it’s silent regarding invoices submitted after 90 days. The rule of interpretation   expressio unius est exclusio alterius —the expression of one thing implies the   exclusion   of   others—might   suggest   to   a   court   that Widgetco wasn’t under any obligation regarding any such invoices. But given that courts aren’t fond of all-or-nothing arrangements   unless   the   contract   gives   them   no   choice,",
  "making   it   explicit   that   late   submission   of   an   invoice precludes reimbursement would provide greater certainty.  A Condition Doesn’t Make Sense If It Can Be Ignored  3.363   If a party can ignore a condition before taking an action that’s   subject   to   satisfaction   of   that   condition,   use   an obligation   instead   of   a   condition.   The   following   explains why.  3.364   Acme has an inventory of widgets. Acme’s contract with Widgetco contains this:  It is a condition to Acme’s conducting a public sale of widgets that Acme notify Widgetco in advance of the date and location of that sale.  3.365   Compare that sentence to this one:  It is a condition to XYZ’s disputing a Dynaco invoice that XYZ submit a Dispute Notice to Dynaco no later than five business days after XYZ receives that invoice.  3.366   Both sentences use language of policy to express conditions (see 3.351). But in the first, Acme is in a position to ignore the condition and conduct the public sale of widgets whether or not the condition has been satisfied. By contrast, in the second sentence, the process of disputing a Dynaco invoice under   the   contract’s   dispute   mechanism   can’t   happen without Dynaco participating.  3.367   So it doesn’t make sense to state the first sentence as a condition. Structuring something as a condition makes sense only if satisfaction of the condition depends on something that is out of the control of the party that would take the action that is subject to satisfaction of the condition. Instead, the issue should be addressed in an obligation:  Before conducting a public sale of widgets, Acme shall notify Widgetco in advance of the date and location of that sale.",
  "3.368   That would give Widgetco a remedy if Acme doesn’t notify Widgetco. By contrast, it’s not clear what the consequences are of ignoring a condition.  A Condition Might Not Be the Only Condition  3.369   When something is stated as a condition, it might not be the only condition. For example, if someone tells you, “We’ll let you into the party only if you’re wearing a red carnation and a top hat,” it’s unlikely you would be admitted to the party were you wearing   only   a red carnation and a top hat, unless it were a special sort of party.  3.370   Similarly, if a contract specifies that an invoice will be valid only if it’s delivered no later than 60 days after the related services   were   performed,   presumably   that   isn’t   the   only condition—other conditions might be read into the contract. For example, an invoice wouldn’t be valid if it’s for triple the agreed price.  LANGUAGE OF DECLARATION  3.371   “Language   of   declaration”   declares   facts   using   verbs   of speaking. Language of declaration allows parties not simply to assert facts but to be seen to be asserting them—without the verb, it wouldn’t be clear who is making the declaration.  3.372   Contracts   contain   two   kinds   of   assertions   of   fact:   If   the declaring party knows a fact and the other party wants the declaring   party   to   assert   in   the   contract   that   the   fact   is accurate, the declaring party   states   that fact (see 3.416). (This is not a traditional usage; see 3.374.) If the other party wants the   declaring   party   to   accept   in   the   contract   that   the declaring party is unable to challenge the accuracy of a fact known to the other party, the declaring party   acknowledges  that fact (see 3.436).",
  "TABLE 13   LANGUAGE OF DECLARATION  [13-1]   Acme states that the Equipment is listed in schedule A. [13-1a]   Acme hereby states ... . [13-1b]   Acme represents ... . [13-1c]   Acme represents and warrants ... . [13-2]   The Investor acknowledges that it has received a copy of each SEC Document. [13-2a]   The Investor hereby acknowledges ... .  3.373   Language   of   declaration   is   analogous   to   language   of performance—in the former a party is making a specialized declaration by a speech act, and in the latter a party is taking an action by a speech act. But one difference is that   hereby , which   is   a   signal   of   language   of   performance,   is   less commonly used with verbs of speaking, although one does see it, as in [13-1a] and [13-2a]. This manual recommends that you not use   hereby   with language of declaration.  Statements of Fact—Using   Represents and Warrants  3.374   In   the   United   States,   represents   and   warrants   are   used   in business contracts to introduce statements of fact by parties— statements relating to matters they broadly control or that fall within the scope of their operations. Sometimes only one verb is used, as in [13-1b] (using   represents ), but usually both are joined in a doublet— represents and warrants , as in [13-1c], in   which   case   the   statements   of   fact   are   known   as  representations and warranties .",
  "3.375   Sometimes one or more verbs are added to   represents   and  warrants   (whether used separately or together), as in   Acme represents   and   acknowledges   and   Acme   represents,   warrants, covenants, and agrees . That pileup of categories of contract language makes no sense, so this manual addresses use of only   one   or   both   of   represents   and   warrants   to   introduce statements of fact.  3.376   A different function is served by use of the verb   warrants   and the   noun   warranty   on   their   own,   without   represents   and  representation , regarding goods in a contract for the sale of those goods (see 13.879).  REMEDIES   FOR   INACCURATE   STATEMENTS   OF   FACT  3.377   Determining what   represents   and   warrants   each mean requires considering   the   remedies   available   under   U.S.   law   for inaccurate statements of fact in a contract.  3.378   Due to how the common law has developed, if a party’s statement   of   fact   turns   out   to   have   been   inaccurate,   the counterparty might be able to bring a tort-based claim for misrepresentation,   a   contract-based   claim   for   breach   of warranty, or both.  3.379   In that context, the simplest meaning of   representation   is that it’s   a   statement   of   fact   that   might   support   a   claim   for misrepresentation. And the simplest meaning of   warranty   is that it’s a statement of fact that might support a claim for breach of warranty.  THE   REMEDIES   RATIONALE  3.380   Some   U.S.   commentators   have   attempted   to   attribute significance to each verb in   represents and warrants . They fall into two camps, one offering what this manual calls the “remedies rationale,” the other offering what this manual calls the “timeframe rationale.”  3.381   Whether   a   contract   party   can   bring   a   claim   for misrepresentation or a claim for breach of warranty for an",
  "inaccurate statement of fact made by the other party can have   significant   practical   implications.   According   to   the remedies rationale, a drafter can ensure that a statement of fact is treated as a representation, as a warranty, or as both by introducing that statement of fact with   represents ,   warrants , or both,   respectively,   or   by   identifying   that   statement   as   a representation, a warranty, or both. The most vocal advocate of the remedies rationale is Tina L. Stark, in her book   Drafting Contracts: How and Why Lawyers Do What They Do   15, 137–38 (2d ed. 2014).  3.382   The   remedies   rationale   comes   in   two   flavors,   which   this manual calls “permissive” and “restrictive.” Under both the permissive   remedies   rationale   and   the   restrictive   remedies rationale,   explicitly   describing   a   statement   of   fact   as   a representation,   a   warranty,   or   both,   by   means   of   an introductory verb or otherwise, is sufficient to make it so.  3.383   Where the permissive and restrictive rationales differ is how they   treat   a   statement   of   fact   that   isn’t   introduced   by  represents   or   warrants ,   or   both,   or   otherwise   explicitly characterized as a representation, a warranty, or both. Under the permissive version, such a statement of fact could still be deemed a representation or warranty, respectively, depending on   the   nature   of   the   statement   itself.   By   contrast,   the restrictive version holds that a statement of fact will support a claim for misrepresentation only if it is introduced with  represents   or is known as a representation, and a statement of fact will support a claim for breach of warranty only if it is introduced with   warrants   or is known as a warranty. So under the restrictive version, failure to use   represents ,   warrants , or both, or to otherwise explicitly characterize a statement of fact as a representation, a warranty, or both, should prevent that   statement   from   being   deemed   a   representation   or   a warranty, or both, respectively.  3.384   Stark has stated that she doesn’t suggest that using   represents  or   warrants   is   the   only   way   to   make   something   a representation or warranty. That means she in effect endorses",
  "the   permissive   remedies   rationale.   See   Tina   L.   Stark, Comment   to   Kenneth   A.   Adams,   The   Semantics   Fallacy Underlying   “Represents   and   Warrants” ,   Adams   on   Contract Drafting   (24   Sept.   2013,   2:38   PM), http://www.adamsdrafting.com/the-semantics-fallacy- underlying-represents-and-warrants/.  3.385   By contrast, Bryan Garner in effect endorses the restrictive remedies   rationale.   In   the   entry   for   representations   and warranties   in   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 775, Garner suggests that if a statement of fact is introduced by only  warrants   and   not   represents ,   it   wouldn’t   constitute   a representation supporting an action for misrepresentation: the drafter would be in a position to limit what sort of claims could   be   brought   for   an   inaccurate   statement   of   fact regardless of the nature of that statement of fact.  3.386   Both flavors of the remedies rationale fall short in several respects. First,   represents and warrants   is used in every kind of contract. It’s well known that the law of warranties applies to the sale of goods, but even if you also consider the role of the law of warranties in negotiable instruments, bank deposits and   collections,   letters   of   credit,   documents   of   title,   and investment securities, many contracts that use   represents and warrants   would fall outside the scope of the law of warranties as it’s generally understood. So treating as a warranty any contract statement of fact introduced by   warrants   or called a warranty would require extending the law of warranties to statements   of   fact   to   which   the   law   of   warranties   as   it’s generally understood wouldn’t apply. There’s no principled basis for doing so.  3.387   Second,   caselaw   and,   regarding   warranty ,   the   Uniform Commercial   Code   specify   the   elements   of   a   claim   for misrepresentation   and   a   claim   for   breach   of   warranty. Allowing   drafters   to   designate   what   constitutes   a representation or a warranty just by saying so would render those requirements irrelevant.",
  "3.388   Imagine   that   a   contract   contains   this   sentence:   Acme represents that it shall promptly replace defective Equipment . Even though it uses   represents , that sentence imposes an obligation, so   according   to   caselaw   on   the   elements   of   a   claim   for misrepresentation,   it   wouldn’t   constitute   a   representation supporting a claim for misrepresentation. It would elevate form over substance to suggest that use of   represents   would be enough   to   make   that   sentence   a   representation.   (In   fact,  Acme represents that   is “throat-clearing”; see 3.25.)  3.389   It would be equally bizarre to conclude, as the restrictive remedies rationale requires, that an intended remedy isn’t available because it’s not introduced by the appropriate verb. For example, if a party’s statements of fact are introduced by neither   represents   nor   warrants , according to the logic of the restrictive remedies rationale the counterparty would have no remedy, regardless of the nature of those statements. It would be hard to justify that.  3.390   Third,   this   manual   is   not   aware   of   any   U.S.   caselaw supporting the notion that if you use   represents   in a sentence, what   follows   will   as   a   matter   of   law   constitute   a representation supporting an action for misrepresentation, regardless   of   what   the   sentence   says,   or   that   if   you   use  warrants   in a sentence, what follows will as a matter of law constitute   a   warranty   supporting   an   action   for   breach   of warranty, regardless of what the sentence says.  3.391   As for the restrictive version of the remedies rationale, there’s no meaningful support for the notion that to constitute a representation, a statement must be introduced by   represents  or called a representation, and to constitute a warranty, a statement   must   be   introduced   by   warrants   or   called   a warranty.  3.392   Instead, there’s caselaw to the opposite effect, in that use of  represents   or   representations   in   a   contract   hasn’t   precluded courts from holding that the statement in question is actually a warranty. See, e.g.,   Aspect Systems, Inc. v. Lam Research Corp. ,",
  "No. CV 06-1620-PHX-NVW, 2008 WL 2705154, at *9 (D. Ariz. 26   June   2008)   (describing   as   a   “warranty”   a   contract provision introduced by the verb “represents”);   Quality Wash Group V, Ltd. v. Hallak , 58 Cal. Rptr. 2d 592, 596 (Ct. App. 1996) (describing as a “warranty” a provision introduced by “makes the following representations”). And section 2-313(2) of   the   Uniform   Commercial   Code   states   that   “[i]t   is   not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as ‘warrant’ or ‘guarantee’ or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty.”  3.393   Fourth, the semantics of the remedies rationale makes no sense. To permit the verb to have remedies implications, or to require it do so, is to impose on the verb a semantic function   it   doesn’t   have   in   standard   English.   It’s unreasonable to expect readers to make that connection.  3.394   And fifth, what’s the simplest explanation for prevalence of the couplet   represents and warrants , as opposed to one or other verb, for introducing statements of fact other than those relating to goods? Not that after considering potential remedies if a dispute occurs, contract parties opt to make it explicit that inaccurate statements of fact could support an action   for   misrepresentation   or   an   action   for   breach   of warranty, or both.  3.395   Instead, if contract parties are presented with three options with ostensibly meaningful implications— represents, warrants,  or   represents   and   warrants —yet   overwhelmingly   choose  represents   and   warrants   regardless   of   the   nature   of   the transaction,   the   simplest   explanation   is   that   they   don’t recognize they’re making a choice.  3.396   That   impression   is   reinforced   by   the   way   mergers-and- acquisitions contracts generally provide for indemnification as the exclusive remedy yet overwhelmingly use   represents and warrants . If use of   represents and warrants   is an empty gesture there, economy of hypothesis suggests that it’s an empty   gesture   elsewhere.   It   also   follows   that   there’s   no",
  "reason to attribute significance to use of either   represents   or  warrants   alone.  3.397   So it’s reasonable to conclude that in the United States, the remedies rationale for use of   represents   and   warrants   is of no practical relevance.  THE   TIMEFRAME   RATIONALE  3.398   The clearest articulation of the timeframe rationale for using  represents ,   warrants , or both is that offered by the Section of Business Law of the American Bar Association in I   Model Stock Purchase Agreement with Commentary   (2d ed. 2011), which uses the phrase   represents and warrants . At page 77, it says, “Representations are statements of past or existing facts and warranties are promises that existing or future facts are or will be true.” If you take that at face value, it follows, according to I   Business Acquisitions   170 (John W. Herz & Charles H. Baller, 2d ed. 1981), that “[a] party can, for instance, represent and warrant that as of a prior date his net worth was $75,000; he can also warrant that as of a future date his net worth will be that amount.”  3.399   If one looks hard enough, one can find modest caselaw and other   commentary   that   endorses   the   timeframe   rationale. See,   e.g.,   Krys   v.   Henderson ,   69   S.E.2d   635,   637   (1952) (“Generally,   warranties   relate   to   future   events,   and representations   to   past   or   existing   facts   ...   .”).   But   the timeframe   rationale   suffers   from   flaws   that   render   it untenable as an explanation of how one should use   represents  and   warrants   in contracts.  3.400   First, as with the remedies rationale, the timeframe rationale is inconsistent with the law of warranties, because it suggests that   a   statement   of   fact   can   be   a   warranty   not   just   in contracts for the sale of goods and other contracts to which the law of warranties has been held to apply but in any kind of contract.",
  "3.401   Second, one requirement of an action for misrepresentation is indeed that a party have made a false representation as to fact regarding a past event or present circumstance, but not a future event—when a statement as to future circumstances is made, there is no way to determine when it’s made whether it’s accurate or not. But nothing in the law of warranties suggests   that   to   be   a   warranty   a   statement   of   fact   must pertain only to existing or future facts. Instead, the Uniform Commercial Code § 2-313 says that “[a]ny affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain” is sufficient to create an express warranty.  3.402   And third, even if the law of warranties were to apply to every contract, and even if warranties were to pertain only to existing or future facts, the timeframe rationale would still fail because as a matter of semantics, it doesn’t make sense.  3.403   For the timeframe rationale to apply to contract language, a drafter   would   have   to   choose   the   verb   that   introduces   a statement of fact based on the nature of that fact. As the ABA’s   Model Stock Purchase Agreement   suggests, that would be “a drafting nuisance”—drafters would have to use   represents  or   warrants   to introduce a statement of fact, depending on whether that fact is a past or existing fact or a future or existing   fact,   respectively.   But   more   to   the   point,   that exercise would be a charade. It would be evident from a statement of fact itself whether it’s a past fact, existing fact, or future fact, so taking the time to make sure that the verb used to introduce that statement of fact matches its content would add no value. And the timeframe rationale suggests the   bizarre   result   that   if   a   statement   of   past   fact   were introduced   by   warrants   instead   of   represents ,   it   wouldn’t constitute a past fact and so couldn’t be used to support an action for misrepresentation.  3.404   So   as   an   explanation   for   why   contracts   use   the   phrase  represents and warrants , the timeframe rationale is as lacking as the remedies rationale.",
  "ENGLISH   LAW   AND   PRACTICE  3.405   Whereas   in   the   United   States,   courts   and   practitioners mostly treat both   represents   and   warrants   as meaning the same thing when used to introduce a statement of fact, in England a different view prevails. There, it has been standard practice to use only   warrants , the concern being that a claim for misrepresentation could give rise to the remedy of rescission, with the parties being returned to the situation they were in before they entered into the contract. By using only   warrants , the party making statements of fact hopes to avoid making representations and so avoid being subject to a claim for misrepresentation.  3.406   This   view   was   endorsed   by   the   English   High   Court   in  Sycamore Bidco Ltd v. Breslin   [2012] EWHC (Ch) 3443 (Eng.). Sycamore purchased the shares of a company from Breslin and   another.   After   the   transaction   was   consummated, Sycamore found errors in the company’s audited accounts. The sellers had made statements regarding the accounts in the share purchase agreement, so Sycamore sued for breach of warranty and misrepresentation. The relevant language was introduced using the verb   warrant , and the statements were called warranties. Sycamore argued that “the warranties are also capable of being representations so that, if there is a contravention   of   their   terms,   there   is   also   a misrepresentation,” but Justice Mann held that “I find that they are warranties only, and not representations,” primarily because “[t]he warranties in this case are clearly, and at all times,   described   as   such,   and   are   nowhere   described   as representations.” This is the restrictive remedies rationale, offered without explanation.  3.407   Sycamore Bidco   isn’t an anomaly. Another case to similar effect   is   MAN   Nutzfahrzeuge   AG   v.   Freightliner   Ltd   [2005] EWHC 2347, 2005 WL 2893816, at *32 (QBD (Comm Ct) 2005),   where   the   court   said,   “By   drafting   the   clauses   in question as both representations and warranties the parties have attached different characteristics to the statements they",
  "contain which, depending on the circumstances, may give rise to different consequences and different measures of loss.” And citing   Sycamore Bidco , the Commercial Court adopted a similar   approach   in   Idemitsu   Kosan   Co   Ltd   v.   Sumitomo Corporation   [2016] EWHC 1909 (Comm) (27 July 2016).  3.408   In fact, the restrictive remedies rationale has a long history in England. The 1603 case   Chandelor v. Lopus   79 Eng. Rep. 3 (Ex. Ch. 1603) involved a dispute between the buyer and the seller of a bezoar stone—a concretion found in the gut of certain   animals   and   believed   by   some   to   have   occult qualities. The seller had “affirmed” to the buyer that this item was a bezoar stone. The court held that because the seller hadn’t stated that he was “warranting” that the item was a bezoar stone, the buyer couldn’t bring against the seller a claim for breach of warranty.  3.409   But English law is not settled on the matter. For example, the opinion in   Sycamore Bidco   discusses the 2009 High Court opinion by Justice Arnold in   Invertec Ltd v. De Mol Holding BV  [2009] EWHC 2471 (Ch). In that case, the defendants argued that because the claims were “all framed by reference to warranties” in the underlying share purchase agreement, the claimant couldn’t bring a claim for misrepresentation. But the court held that “the warranties in question also amount to representations of fact.” It continued (emphasis added): In those circumstances I cannot see any reason in principle why [the claimant] cannot claim that it was induced to enter into the agreement by   the representations made by those warranties   so as to found a misrepresentation claim if they were false, particularly if they were fraudulently made.  3.410   In other words, by finding that something called a warranty in   the   contract   was   also   a   representation   supporting   a misrepresentation remedy, Justice Arnold in effect rejected the restrictive remedies rationale. Justice Mann’s perfunctory analysis   in   Sycamore Bidco   provides   no   reason   to   consign",
  "Invertec   to   oblivion.   Sycamore   Bidco   was   greeted   with deference by English practitioners, but a 2007 analysis by the London   office   of   the   international   law   firm   Jones   Day expresses   little   enthusiasm   for   the   restrictive   remedies rationale: In reality, the simple categorization of a statement as a warranty (without any further provisions) probably has little bearing on whether the statement is susceptible to being treated as a representation for purposes of [the Misrepresentation Act of 1967].  3.411   To summarize, English courts and practitioners differ from those   in   the   United   States   by   giving   significant   but   not overwhelming support to the restrictive remedies rationale. Yet for English contracts, the remedies rationale suffers from some of the same weaknesses it does for U.S. contracts: First, it   applies   the   law   of   warranties   where   it   doesn’t   belong. Second,   allowing   drafters   to   designate   what   constitutes   a representation or a warranty just by saying so would make a mockery of the substantive law regarding what’s required to bring a claim for misrepresentation and what’s required to bring a claim for breach of warranty. And third, in terms of semantics, it doesn’t make sense.  Statements of Fact—Using   States   and Addressing Remedies Directly  3.412   The main problem with the verbs   represents   and   warrants , used together or apart, is that despite lack of any plausible basis,   some   think   they   imply   particular   remedies.   That confusion   could   spread,   leading   to   time   wasted   in negotiations, as well as time and money wasted in contract disputes that could have been avoided.  3.413   And by using   represents   or   warrants   or both to introduce statements of fact, one unnecessarily injects jurisprudence terms of art into contracts. That makes contracts less clear, even for those who aren’t inclined to see the verbs as having",
  "remedies   implications.   (Regarding   use   of   terms   of   art generally, see 1.7.)  3.414   For U.S. contracts, one could take the position that because a no-reliance   provision   would   provide   greater   protection, there’s no need to concern oneself with whether introducing statements of fact with   represents and warrants   could result in unwanted   tort   liability.   See   Glenn   D.   West,   Reps   and Warranties   Redux—A   New   English   Case,   An   Old   Debate Regarding a Distinction With or Without a Difference , Global Private   Equity   Watch   (2   Aug.   2016), https://privateequity.weil.com/insights/reps-warranties- redux-new-english-case-old-debate-regarding-distinction- without-difference/. That leave-well-enough-alone approach might   make   sense   for   high-value,   one-time   transactions, where efficiency and clarity aren’t high priorities. But with lower-value,   high-volume   deals,   simpler,   clearer   contracts allow you to close deals faster, less expensively, and with less risk   and   less   lawyering.   In   that   context,   represents   and warrants   is more of a nuisance than it is in the big-deal world.  3.415   There’s   a   simple   two-part   alternative   to   represents   and warrants : use   states   to introduce facts and address remedies directly.  USING   STATES  3.416   The first part of the solution aims to eliminate confusion: Don’t use   represents ,   warrants , or the phrase   represents and warrants   to introduce statements of fact. Instead, introduce statements of fact using the simplest verb available, namely  states . Other alternatives, such as   asserts   and   confirms , carry unnecessary rhetorical baggage. And use of   states   suggests use of the corresponding noun phrase   statement of fact   instead of  representation   and   warranty .  3.417   When introducing a series of statements of fact, say [ Party name ]   states that the following facts are accurate , if only to ensure that you have a full independent clause before the",
  "colon that follows (see 4.37). One wouldn’t need to signal that an inaccurate statement of fact can support a remedy, just as one doesn’t need to signal that failure to comply with an obligation can support a remedy.  3.418   Lawyers on one or both sides of a transaction might be concerned   that   states   has   unknown   implications   for remedies. You could allay those fears by adding this to a contract:   The verb used to introduce a statement of fact in this agreement does not affect the remedies available for inaccuracy of that statement of fact.  3.419   A drafter stuck with using   represents   or   warrants   or both could also use that sentence. That situation might arise if using  states   would meet too much resistance or provoke too much discussion.   That’s   more   likely   to   be   the   case   when   you propose revising the other side’s draft to use   states   as opposed to using   states   in your own draft.  ADDRESSING   REMEDIES   DIRECTLY  3.420   The   second   part   of   the   solution   to   problems   posed   by  represents   and   warrants   aims to establish clear meaning: If remedies are an issue, address remedies explicitly. Putting one’s   faith   instead   in   the   smoke-and-mirrors   of   any combination of   represents   and   warrants   is irresponsible.  3.421   Instead   of   using   represents   and   warrants   to   introduce statements   of   fact,   a   drafter   who   embraces   the   remedies rationale could achieve the same effect by stating that each party may bring a claim for misrepresentation, a claim for breach   of   warranty,   or   both   if   the   other   party   makes inaccurate   statements   of   fact.   And   instead   of   using   just  warrants ,   a   drafter   who   embraces   the   restrictive   remedies rationale could achieve the same effect by stating that each party   is   precluded   from   bringing   a   claim   for misrepresentation   if   the   other   party   makes   inaccurate statements of fact. One could also make it explicit that each party may instead bring a claim for breach of warranty. (The",
  "mirror-image of that provision would express the restrictive- remedies-rationale equivalent of using just   represents .)  3.422   Electing one remedy over the other might offer advantages. For   example,   a   claimant   might   prefer   bringing   a misrepresentation claim over a breach-of-warranty claim if doing so offers a longer statute of limitations or seems likely to permit a claim for a greater amount damages, even if the claimant would have to meet a greater burden to prevail.  3.423   But   for   five   reasons,   the   utility   of   such   provisions   is uncertain. First, the likelihood of being able to enforce such provisions   is   mixed.   Saying   that   a   party   may   bring   a particular kind of claim doesn’t guarantee that a court would find that a party had met the requirements for that kind of claim. But courts in the United States and England generally accept that parties may exclude remedies by contract, subject to a fairness or reasonableness standard.  3.424   Second, such provisions are limited in scope. At least in the United States, a simple statement that a party is precluded from   bringing   a   claim   for   misrepresentation   presumably allows   a   claimant   seeking   to   impose   extra-contractual liability plenty of room to make mischief. The best way to protect against that is through a no-reliance provision; see 3.414.  3.425   Third, rote limiting of remedies might not make sense for a given   transaction.   For   example,   the   English   aversion   to rescission as a remedy, regardless of the context, has the merit of simplicity but doesn’t consider that rescission might sometimes   be   an   appropriate   remedy   for   either   party, depending on the circumstances.  3.426   Fourth, for many contract parties, considering the potential sources   of   dispute   and   the   remedies   implications   of   any dispute could be distracting, time-consuming, and ultimately speculative.",
  "3.427   And fifth, if a party wishes to control remedies, it might well elect to do so more simply and assertively by providing for indemnification or liquidated damages or by imposing limits on liability, bearing in mind that doing so effectively poses a different set of challenges.  3.428   But those issues are beyond the scope of this manual. What’s relevant is that instead of using   represents ,   warrants , or both with the aim of including or excluding particular remedies, it would be clearer to express the intended meaning explicitly, although it’s a separate question whether doing so would be worthwhile.  3.429   For a more detailed version of this analysis of   represents and warrants ,   see   Kenneth   A.   Adams,   Eliminating   the   Phrase  Represents and Warrants   from Contracts , 16 Tennessee Journal of Business Law 203 (2015).  Statements of Fact—Alternatives To  3.430   Drafters   routinely   state   as   facts   matters   more   logically handled using another category of contract language.  3.431   For example, it doesn’t make sense, strictly speaking, to have a party make a statement of fact regarding something over which it has no control. You could have the seller state in an asset purchase agreement that on the closing date the market price of unobtanium will be above a stated dollar amount. And doing so would in theory give the buyer a claim for damages if on the closing date the market price were less than the stated amount. But because the seller has no control over the market price, it would be rash to assume that a court would   permit   such   a   claim   rather   than   treating   it   as   a condition to closing. Having a party make a statement of fact regarding something over which it has no control is in effect a form of risk allocation. It would be clearer to provide for explicit   risk   allocation   in   the   form   of   indemnification, liquidated damages, or a breakup fee.",
  "Statements of Fact—Some Related Terminology  3.432   One   breaches   an   obligation,   but   not   a   statement   of   fact (whether   you   call   it   that   or   a   representation).   Instead,   a statement of fact is accurate or inaccurate. If Abigail says that it’s   Monday   but   in   fact   it’s   Tuesday,   Abigail   hasn’t “breached”   anything.   Instead,   she’s   made   an   inaccurate statement.  3.433   This distinction is worth pointing out for its own sake, but it might also help drafters avoid a further problem, namely inappropriately lumping statements of fact with obligations. It’s commonplace for contracts to provide for the possibility of cure of not only breached obligations but also “breached” representations. But if you make an inaccurate statement of fact, you can’t subsequently make it accurate.  3.434   In the same vein, a statement of fact is either accurate or inaccurate—it cannot   become   inaccurate.  3.435   Regarding contract references to survival of statements of fact, see 13.781.  Acknowledgments  3.436   Use   acknowledge   if the declaring party is accepting as accurate a fact offered by another party:  Acme   acknowledges   that the Consultant is in the business of providing services and consulting advice to others. The parties   acknowledge   that breach of any obligation stated in this section 10.2 will cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party and that monetary damages will not provide an adequate remedy. Each Shareholder   acknowledges   that the Merger Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act and are instead being issued under an exemption from registration.  3.437   Having a party acknowledge a fact would preclude it from later challenging that fact.   Understand,   accept , and   concede   are",
  "used   as   alternatives   to   acknowledge .   In   the   interest   of consistency (see 1.63), stick with   acknowledge .  RELATION   TO   RECITALS  3.438   An alternative to having Party X acknowledge that a fact asserted by Party Y is correct would be to include that fact in the recitals. (Recitals too contain assertions of fact, but they don’t   need   language   of   declaration—it’s   clear   enough without it that the parties are making the recitals jointly.) If a fact relates to the background to the transaction, it would fit in the recitals (see 2.131). But if the fact is important, have the declaring party acknowledge that fact in the body of the contract (see 2.135).  INAPPROPRIATELY   USED   TO   INTRODUCE   OTHER   LANGUAGE  3.439   Use   acknowledge   only to introduce a fact asserted by another party.   Don’t   use   it   to   introduce   language   that   itself   falls within   a   category   of   contract   language—don’t   indulge   in throat-clearing (see 3.25). In the following two examples,  acknowledge   is used inappropriately to introduce language of obligation and language of policy, respectively:  Each Lender   acknowledges that it   shall conduct its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of each Borrower.  The parties acknowledge that this   [read   This ] agreement does not supersede, modify, or otherwise affect the terms of any stock options that Acme granted the Executive before the date of this agreement.  RHETORICAL   EMPHASIS  3.440   Don’t   indulge   in   rhetorical   emphasis   (see   1.58) by using  unconditionally acknowledge   or   expressly acknowledge .  USED   WITH   OTHER   VERBS",
  "3.441   It never makes sense to use   acknowledge   with another verb. For example, rather than say   Acme acknowledges and agrees that , use   acknowledge   on its own or omit the entire phrase, if it constitutes throat-clearing (see 3.439). (Regarding   agrees that , see 3.32.)  LANGUAGE OF INTENTION  3.442   Some aspects of a contract relationship can’t be established by the parties in a contract. Instead, it’s up to the courts to make the relevant determination. But it can be helpful for the   parties   to   address   such   issues   in   a   contract,   using language of intention.  3.443   For example, it’s commonplace for consulting agreements to contain a provision regarding the consultant’s status as an independent   contractor   rather   than   an   employee.   What category   of   contract   language   should   you   use   for   such provisions? If you consider the possibilities, it’s clear that language of intention is the logical choice.  TABLE 14   LANGUAGE OF INTENTION  [14-1]   The parties intend that the Consultant will be an independent contractor. [14-1a]   The Consultant shall be ... . [14-1b]   The Consultant will be ... . [14-1c]   The Consultant acknowledges that she will be ... . [14-1d]   The Consultant believes that she will be ... . [14-1e]   The Consultant shall be construed to be ... .",
  "[14-1f]   The Consultant is to be construed to be ... .  3.444   Obviously,   it   wouldn’t   make   sense   to   use   language   of obligation,   as   in   [14-1a]—whether   the   consultant   is   an independent contractor isn’t something that’s entirely within the control of the consultant.  3.445   You could use language of policy, as in [14-1b], but whether a consultant is an independent contractor or an employee isn’t something the parties can decide among themselves. Instead, it depends on the governing law and the nature of the services performed, not on the label the parties choose to apply to the relationship.  3.446   Language   of   declaration,   or   more   specifically   an acknowledgment, as in [14-1c], wouldn’t work either: you acknowledge facts, and whether someone is an independent contractor   isn’t   an   established   fact   that   a   consultant   can acknowledge at the outset of the relationship.  3.447   A statement of fact using   believes   (see 13.113), as in [14-1d], would be inappropriate, as such a statement would express the opinion of a party regarding a legal circumstance on the date of the agreement. Whether someone is a consultant or an   employee   can’t   be   determined   on   the   date   of   the agreement—how the relationship develops is a factor.  3.448   In such contexts, drafters routinely use   shall be construed , as in [14-1e], but besides failing the   has a duty   test (see 3.74), it’s unrealistic,   as   it   in   effect   seeks   to   impose   a   duty   on   a nonparty. And not just any nonparty, but one that will do what it feels appropriate, thank you very much—a court. Using instead   is to be construed , as in [14-1f], is more discreet but attempts to achieve the same result. (Regarding using verb structures to say how a court is to conduct itself, see 3.470.)",
  "3.449   The   only   remaining   possibility   is   [14-1]—language   of intention.   In   other   words,   the   parties   intend   that   the consultant   will   be   an   independent   contractor,   but   if   the nature of the relationship were ever to become an issue, it would be up to a court to decide the consultant’s status, based on the law and the facts.  3.450   Although a consultant’s status would depend on the totality of the circumstances rather than on what label the parties apply, addressing the consultant’s status in a contract using language   of   intention   would   nevertheless   be   worthwhile, because a court might consider what the contract says. See 19  Williston on Contracts   § 54:2 (including among the factors that courts consider “whether the parties believe they are creating the relation of master and servant”).  3.451   Aspects   of   a   contract   relationship   are   subject   to   judicial scrutiny   in   another   respect.   For   example,   in   the   United States, a court might override the parties’ choice of governing law   because   the   state   specified   doesn’t   bear   a   reasonable relationship to the transaction, or because applying the law of that state would be contrary to public policy of the forum state.   But   this   and   analogous   instances   differ   from   those discussed in 3.442–.443. In the latter instances, the nature of the relationship would be entirely a question of law and fact, whereas in the former, the selection of the parties applies, unless it fails to meet minimum legal requirements. Given that distinction, it would be awkward to insist on using for the   governing-law   provision   language   of   intention   rather than language of policy: “The parties intend that the laws of the state of New York will govern ... .” When the choice specified by the parties in a contract applies unless a court decides that it fails to meet minimum requirements, stick with language of policy.  LANGUAGE OF RECOMMENDATION",
  "3.452   One side to a transaction might have significantly greater bargaining power than the other side; that’s usually the case in, for example, a contract between a company and one of its employees.   The   party   with   the   greater   bargaining   power might   take   the   opportunity   to   include   in   the   contract   a recommendation to the other party, as in [15-1]. Presumably, with such recommendations a party seeks to avoid dispute by pointing   out   something   the   other   party   might   otherwise miss. The alternative—letting the other party figure out such matters for itself—might ultimately work to the disadvantage of the party with the greater bargaining power, because the disparity in bargaining power might cause a court to cut the weaker party some slack.  TABLE 15   LANGUAGE OF RECOMMENDATION  [15-1]   The Company recommends that the Participant consult with his or her personal legal advisor if the Participant is uncertain whether the insider rules apply. [15-1a]   The Company advises the Participant to consult with his or her personal legal advisor ... .  3.453   Because   recommends   is a verb of speaking, don’t use   hereby  with   recommends   (see 3.373).  3.454   You could convey the meaning of [15-1] using   advises , as in [15-1a], but   recommends   is   preferable,   because   having   one party give another advice suggests a relationship involving trust.   Other   possibilities   for   language   of   recommendation include   advises ,   encourages , and   reminds .  3.455   An   alternative   to   language   of   recommendation   is   having Party A acknowledge that Party B has recommended that Party A do something or other, or having Party A release",
  "Party B from any liability arising from Party A’s failure to do something or other.  SHALL   AND   MAY   IN RESTRICTIVE RELATIVE CLAUSES  3.456   Shall   and   may   are used inappropriately in a construction that’s unrelated to the categories of contract language—the restrictive relative clause. This topic is nevertheless included in this chapter because inappropriate uses of   shall   and   may  detract from appropriate use and might cause confusion.  Use of   Shall  3.457   In [16-1], the restrictive relative clause is   that Acme specifies in writing . Drafters sometimes use   shall   in   restrictive   relative clauses,   as   in   [16-1a],   as   an   alternative   to   will ,   out   of   a misguided fear that the present tense cannot be used to refer to events that will happen.  3.458   But sometimes this use of   shall   might represent an attempt to address a legitimate issue. Because [16-2] uses a stative verb ( owns ) rather than a dynamic verb (see 3.322), it’s not clear whether the transfer restrictions apply only to shares owned on the date of the agreement or whether shares acquired subsequently are also included. Referring to   Shares that it shall own   isn’t,   however,   the   way   to   resolve   this   ambiguity; instead, as in [16-2b], make it clear that after-acquired shares are included.  TABLE 16   MISUSE OF   SHALL   AND   MAY   IN RESTRICTIVE RELATIVE CLAUSES  [16-1]   Jones shall pay the Purchase Price by wire transfer to any account that Acme specifies in writing. [16-1a]   ... to any account that Acme shall specify in writing.",
  "[16-2]   Other than under the terms of this agreement, no Stockholder may transfer any Shares it owns. [16-2a]   ... any Shares it shall own. [16-2b]   ... any Shares it currently owns or any additional Shares it acquires. [16-3]   If Acme sells Assets to one or more buyers that Roe introduces to Acme ... [16-3a]   ... one or more buyers that Roe may introduce to Acme ...  Use of   May  3.459   In [16-3], the restrictive relative clause is   that Roe introduces to Acme . If it were to include   may,   as in [16-3a], it’s likely that the   intended   meaning   of   may   would   be   might ,   to acknowledge that Roe might introduce no buyers to Acme. In effect,   the   restrictive   relative   clause   would   express   the meaning   one or more buyers, if any, that Roe introduces to Acme . But   it   would   be   redundant   to   add   that   meaning—even without it, the conditional clause in [16-3] reflects that Roe might   not   introduce   any   buyers   to   Acme.   (For   another example of this use of   may,   see 3.218.)  3.460   But in this context,   may   not only adds clutter, it also adds potential confusion. That’s because another possible meaning of the restrictive relative clause in [16-3a] is   one or more buyers that Roe might introduce to Acme, whether or not Roe actually introduces them to Acme . In other words, to fall within the scope of the restrictive relative clause, someone would simply have to be a plausible prospective buyer.  3.461   That meaning seems unlikely, in terms of how transactions work, but at least one court interpreted that way a restrictive relative   clause   containing   may .   383   Madison   LLC   v.

The court held that because the exemption referred to an   entity   “with   which   Tenant   may   be   merged,”   the exemption   applied   “even   to   those   situations   where   a potential merger is contemplated, and it is not contingent upon the actual occurrence of a merger.” In other words, the court attributed to   may   in the restrictive relative clause at issue the significance described in 3.460.  3.462   So not only does using   may   in restrictive relative clauses create ambiguity, the alternative meanings are themselves unpromising—in one meaning   may   is redundant, and the other meaning is unlikely. Most likely omitting   may   would allow you to express the meaning you intend. If not, find some other way to say what you want to say.  NOT A CATEGORY OF CONTRACT LANGUAGE: ASSUMPTIONS  3.463   A   standard   feature   of   statements   of   work   in   commercial contracts   is   sets   of   assumptions.   That   poses   a   drafting problem,   in   that   a   statement   of   work   forms   part   of   the contract to which it’s attached, yet assumptions don’t fall within the categories of contract language proposed in this manual.  3.464   The point of entering into a contract is that it forces the parties to be explicit about their transaction—there should be no   place   for   assumptions.   A   set   of   statement-of-work assumptions is likely to raise questions: What happens if that which is assumed doesn’t happen? Is the assumption in fact a condition? Is it an obligation? Or something else?  3.465   It   would   make   sense   to   recast   each   statement-of-work assumption using whichever category of contract language is appropriate.   That   would   likely   pose   a   challenge   for   an organization’s   contract   process,   because   it’s   standard   for statements of work and the contract proper to be handled by different groups. It’s likely that revising assumptions would,",
  "at   least   initially,   result   in   more   work   being   imposed   on whoever handles the contract.  SELECTING WHICH CATEGORY OF CONTRACT LANGUAGE TO USE  3.466   Once you’re attuned to the categories of contract language, it becomes routine to ask yourself, when drafting a provision, what category of contract language you should use. Working through the possibilities gives you a better understanding of what’s at stake, making you better equipped to address the issues raised. So it’s not only the reader who benefits from adept handling of the categories of contract language but also the drafter and, by extension, the client.  Amending a Contract  3.467   Determining how to say what’s required to amend a contract provides   an   opportunity   to   consider   which   category   of contract language is appropriate. Here are the possibilities:  Language of discretion.   The parties may amend this agreement only by a writing signed by both parties. [Using language of limited discretion presupposes the possibility of breach (if that discretion is exceeded) and a remedy for breach. That doesn’t make sense in this context.]  Language of prohibition.   The parties shall not amend this agreement, except by written agreement of the parties. [Using language of obligation presupposes the possibility of breach and a remedy for breach. That doesn’t make sense in this context.]  Condition using language of obligation.   To be effective, an amendment to this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties. [This works.]  Language of policy.   An amendment to this agreement will be effective only if it is in writing and signed by both parties. [This works too. To see other ways this could be phrased, see 3.333.]",
  "Giving Notice  3.468   Consider these three alternatives:  Language of obligation.   Jones shall submit any Dispute Notice no later than five Business Days after the related invoice is delivered. [This suggests that if Jones submits a dispute notice after five business days, it will be in breach, giving the other party a remedy for breach. That wouldn’t make sense: the only appropriate response to late submission of a dispute notice is that Jones isn’t entitled to dispute the invoice.]  Language of policy.   If Jones submits a Dispute Notice more than five business days after the related invoice is delivered, that Dispute Notice will be void. [This conveys the intended meaning, but it addresses only what happens if Jones is late in submitting a dispute notice, and   is void   is somewhat bureaucratic in tone.]  Language of obligation used to express a condition.   To dispute an invoice, Jones must submit a Dispute Notice no later than five Business Days after the related invoice is delivered. [This is the best choice, because it avoids the shortcomings of the other alternatives.]  Unreasonably Withholding Consent  3.469   How should a contract address a landlord’s unreasonably withholding consent to the tenant’s assigning the lease? Do you prohibit the landlord from unreasonably withholding consent, or do you allow the tenant to assign if the landlord unreasonably withholds consent? Here are your choices:  Language of Prohibition.   The Tenant shall not assign this lease without the Landlord’s consent, which the Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold. [This gives the tenant a remedy for breach if the landlord unreasonably withholds consent. Suing the landlord might not be a realistic option for the tenant, particularly if the contract states that the",
  "only remedy for breach is that the landlord will be deemed to have given consent.]  Carveout from Language of Prohibition.   The Tenant shall not assign this lease without the Landlord’s consent, unless the Landlord unreasonably withholds consent. [This would allow the tenant to assign if the landlord is unreasonable. The landlord would be in a position to prevent the new tenant from occupying the premises, so this version wouldn’t prevent a fight, but it might give the tenant leverage in negotiations.]  Language of Discretion.   The Tenant shall not assign this lease without the Landlord’s consent, except that the Tenant may assign this lease if the Landlord unreasonably withholds consent. [This expresses the same meaning as the previous alternative, but more clearly. (For an explanation why, see 3.327–.332.)]  Stating How a Court Is to Conduct Itself  3.470   Whether   or   not   they   realize   it,   one   way   drafters   try   to preempt judicial discretion is by specifying in a contract what a court may do, isn’t authorized to do, or must do. One example of that, [14-1f], using   is to be construed , is discussed at 3.448, but this urge manifests itself in different ways.  3.471   Various verb structures are used to ostensibly grant a court discretion. Here’s an incomplete list, with   interpret   used as a placeholder for different verbs,   interpret   and   construe   being the most common:  the court may interpret the court will/shall have the right to the court will/shall be entitled to interpret the court will/shall be allowed to interpret the court will/shall have the power to interpret",
  "3.472   All but the first of the above examples is suboptimal, for reasons discussed in this chapter. (The same applies to most of the other examples in this section.) Here’s an example that uses one of these structures:  The courts shall be entitled to modify the duration and scope of any restriction contained herein to the extent such restriction would otherwise be unenforceable, and such restriction as modified shall be enforceable.  3.473   To show that the above list is incomplete, here’s an example that uses a different verb structure to say that a court has the authority to rule on the law and facts of a lawsuit:  Each party hereby agrees that any such court shall have in personam jurisdiction over it and consents to service of process in any manner authorized by Nevada law.  3.474   Similarly, various verb structures aim to prohibit a court from doing something:  the court shall/may not construe no court shall/may construe X shall/may not be construed as neither X nor Y is to be construed as X is not to be construed as nothing in this agreement is to be construed as  3.475   And there are other ways to say that a court is prohibited from doing something. Here are two examples:  No prior drafts of this agreement or any negotiations regarding the terms contained in those drafts shall be admissible in any court to vary or interpret the terms of this agreement. The principal of ejusdem generis shall not be used to limit the scope of the category of things illustrated by the items mentioned in a clause introduced by the word “including.”",
  "3.476   Various verb structures aim to say that a court must do something:  the court shall construe the court will be required to construe X is to be construed X shall be construed  3.477   That list, too, is incomplete. Here’s an example of a different structure used to say that a court must act a certain way:  The Service Provider agrees that in the event of such violation, Acme will, in addition to any other rights and remedies, be entitled to equitable relief by way of temporary or permanent injunction and to such other remedy as any court of competent jurisdiction may deem just and proper.  3.478   On encountering this sort of provision, a judge is likely to think, “Says who!” Contract parties have no basis for telling a court how to act, and a court might well ignore or explicitly reject   anything   that   suggests   as   much.   A   case   before   the Delaware Court of Chancery,   AM General Holdings LLC v. Renco Group, Inc. , No. CV 7639-VCN, 2015 WL 9487922, at *3 (Del. Ch. 29 Dec. 2015), provides an example of a court doing just that. A party to a contract sought a preliminary injunction,   basing   its   claim   in   part   on   the   following provision:  The parties hereto agree that any party by whom this Agreement is enforceable shall be entitled to specific performance in addition to any other appropriate relief or remedy. Such party may ... apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for ... injunctive or such other relief as such court may deem just and proper in order to enforce this Agreement or prevent any violation hereof and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief.  3.479   This   in   effect   requires   that   a   court   grant   specific performance. The Delaware Court of Chancery denied the",
  "motion   for   a   preliminary   injunction,   offering   this explanation: Parties, however, cannot in advance agree to assure themselves (and thereby impair the Court’s exercise of its well-established discretionary role in the context of assessing the reasonableness of interim injunctive relief) the benefit of expedited judicial review through the use of a simple contractual stipulation that a breach of that contract would constitute irreparable harm.  3.480   Drafters can aim for the same result without appearing to boss the court around. For example, instead of saying in a severability provision that a court must interpret the contract in a certain way if it holds that a provision is unenforceable, you could introduce the provision as follows:  The parties acknowledge that if a dispute between the parties arises out of this agreement or the subject matter of this agreement, they would want the court to interpret this agreement as follows:  3.481   This approach has the benefit of putting the focus on the parties, not on the court.  Arbitration Provision  3.482   For   another   example   of   the   diagnostic   value   of   the categories-of-contract-language approach, see 3.104.",
  "LAYOUT  4.1   How the text of the body of the contract is formatted and arranged helps determine how easy it is to read.  THE   MSCD   ENUMERATION SCHEMES  4.2   This manual recommends two enumeration schemes—the “ MSCD   first-line-indent scheme” and the “ MSCD   hanging- indent scheme.” Each comes in two versions, “articles” and “sections,” depending on whether the sections are grouped into articles. See sample 3 for the “articles” version of the first-line   indent   scheme;   see   sample   4   for   the   “articles” version of the hanging-indent scheme.  4.3   The first-line-indent scheme is a more systematic version of the scheme (with many variants) used in the bigger U.S. law firms for bigger transactions. The hanging-indent scheme is a more systematic version of the kind of scheme favored for commercial transactions and favored in particular outside the United   States.   The   first-line-indent   scheme   makes   more efficient use of space; the hanging-indent scheme is easier to navigate. Both are logical, so take your pick.  4.4   The rest of this chapter explains why the two   MSCD   schemes look   the   way   they   do.   It   first   considers   aspects   that   are common   to   both   schemes,   then   it   considers   what distinguishes them.  THE COMPONENTS OF THE BODY OF THE CONTRACT",
  "4.5   The body of the contract is composed of sections (which can be   grouped   into   articles),   subsections,   and   enumerated clauses. Subdividing contract text in this manner makes it much   easier   to   read,   permits   cross-referencing,   and   helps readers to find their way around the document.  4.6   Don’t use footnotes in contracts. Footnotes make a contract harder to read and can lead readers to think that the footnote text is of lesser significance.  Articles  4.7   Whether to group into articles all sections that share a theme is a function of how long the contract is. Consider grouping sections into articles once you have more than 25 or so sections.  SAMPLE 3   MSCD   FIRST-LINE-INDENT ENUMERATION SCHEME, ARTICLES VERSION",
  "4.8   Some contracts use the term   section   for a group of sections. But with that approach, a reference to   section 1 , considered in isolation, could refer to a single provision or to a group of provisions. Using instead   article   distinguishes the whole from its constituent parts.  4.9   UK drafters are partial to using   clause   instead of both   article  and   section . But in general usage   clause   refers to a part of a sentence—in particular, this manual uses the term   enumerated",
  "clause   (see 4.32)—so also using   clause   instead of   article   and  section   would result in   clause   conveying three meanings.  4.10   Give each article a simple, all-encompassing heading, using all capitals; see sample 3. All-capitals text is harder to read (see 16.19), but that’s not an issue when it’s used for only a few   words.   Using   Miscellaneous   as   an   article   heading   is acceptable—it’s generally understood that it refers to a group of “boilerplate” provisions addressing governing law, notices, and other such matters.  4.11   Use digits, not words— article 1 , not   article one . Use Arabic rather   than   Roman   numerals   for   article   numbers—they’re easier to read. Don’t use the multiple-numeration system— use   article 1 , not   article 1.0 .  4.12   In some contracts, the first article is enumerated   article 0  (zero).   Starting   sequences   with   zero   is   a   feature   of mathematics and programming, but there’s no good reason to use it for contract enumeration schemes. Perhaps it’s an inside joke.  SAMPLE 4   MSCD   HANGING-INDENT ENUMERATION SCHEME, ARTICLES VERSION",
  "Sections  FUNCTION  4.13   A section contains provisions relating to a particular topic. In the United States the term   section   is standard. It’s a better",
  "choice than a UK alternative,   clause   (see 4.9).  4.14   In   the   boilerplate   at   the   end   of   a   contract,   provisions addressing unrelated topics are sometimes lumped together in one section. Because that practice can make it harder for readers to find a particular provision, use it only when the provisions in question are sufficiently brief that giving each provision its own section would waste space. Take care when combining disparate provisions in a single section, because the context of one provision could influence interpretation of another provision in the same section. See, e.g.,   Williams v. CDP, Inc. , No. 10-1396, 2012 WL 959343 (4th Cir. 22 Mar. 2012).  4.15   Don’t   use   subsections   in   such   omnibus   sections—if   the provisions are substantial enough for each to be given its own subsection, then they’re substantial enough to be turned into   sections.   Don’t   combine   more   than   two   unrelated provisions in a single section—the added economy is more than offset by the potential for confusion. And give such sections an appropriate heading (see 4.23).  ENUMERATION  4.16   Number each section. Don’t add   Section   in front of each section number—it takes up space without providing any benefit.   Don’t   bold   section   numbers.   If   sections   aren’t grouped into articles, number them consecutively ( 1 ,   2 ,   3 , not   1.0 ,   2.0 ,   3.0 ). (Whether you put a period after the section number   depends   on   whether   you’re   using   the   first-line- indent scheme or the hanging-indent scheme; see 4.55, 4.62.) If   they’re   grouped   into   articles,   number   them   using   the multiple-numeration system (the sections of article 1 being numbered   1.1 ,   1.2 ,   1.3 ,   not   1.01 ,   1.02 ,   1.03 ,   with   the unnecessary   extra   zero,   or   1.1. ,   1.2. ,   1.3. ,   with   the superfluous extra period); see sample 3.  4.17   For section numbers, use the automatic-numbering function in word-processing software, or use specialized paragraph- numbering software. Use it also for subsections (see 4.27) and",
  "tabulated   enumerated   clauses   (see   4.41).   Doing   so   would spare you having to renumber provisions whenever you add, delete, or move an enumerated block of text.  4.18   Some settlement agreements—presumably ones drafted by litigators—enumerate   sections   using   FIRST: ,   SECOND: ,  THIRD: , and so on, as if the contract were an old-fashioned pleading. Don’t do that.  4.19   One school of thought has it that if an article contains just one   section,   you   shouldn’t   enumerate   that   section.   This manual recommends instead that you enumerate each such section, treating each article as a repository of one or more sections. That results in consistent enumeration throughout the   contract.   And   if   you   cross-reference   such   a   section, calling it   section 5.1   would give the reader a better idea of what to expect, compared with calling it   article 5 .  HEADINGS  4.20   Give each section a heading consisting of a bolded word or short phrase. Such headings make it easier to find one’s way around   a   document.   Use   headline-style   capitalization   (see  The Chicago Manual of Style , at 8.159).  4.21   The alternatives to bold are unappealing: Underlining is a hangover from typewriter days (see 16.21). Using all capitals would be too strident and harder to read (see 16.19). And adding   italics   to   bold   would   be   an   unnecessary embellishment.  4.22   Many   headings   recur   in   contract   after   contract.   Certain headings,   such   as   Arbitration   or   Confidentiality ,   are   a straightforward   reflection   of   a   section’s   contents.   Others, such as   Further Assurances , are cryptic terms of art. If you create a heading, make it clear and brief. Don’t use a heading that seems to promise more than the section actually delivers or   is   otherwise   misleading.   (See   13.806   regarding   using  Termination for Convenience   as a section heading.) Courts have refused   to   enforce   provisions   with   uninformative   or",
  "misleading headings, although that would seem unlikely in the case of a contract between ostensibly sophisticated parties represented   by   counsel.   Longer   contracts   often   include   a provision stating that headings are for convenience only and are not intended to affect meaning, but such provisions are of questionable value (see 15.17).  4.23   If a section addresses two distinct issues (see 4.14), you could give it a heading consisting of a word or short phrase for each issue, separated by a semicolon (such as   Amendment; Waiver ).  4.24   Although   MISCELLANEOUS   is   acceptable   as   an   article heading (see 4.10), don’t use it as a section heading. Use instead   several   small   sections,   each   with   an   informative heading.  4.25   Don’t use   etc . to broaden a heading, as in   Notices ,   etc . If a section addresses more concepts than you can comfortably refer to in the heading, that’s a sign you should divide it into two or more separate sections. More generally, don’t use it anywhere in contracts (see 13.266).  4.26   Put all text in the body of the contract within a section. One exception:   when   Acme’s   statements   of   fact   constitute   an article unto themselves, place the introductory language—for example,   Acme states to Widgetco that the following facts are accurate —after the article heading but before the sections. That allows the statements of fact to be presented as sections, complete   with   headings,   rather   than   as   subsections. (Regarding   using   states   and   statements   of   fact   instead   of  represents   and   representations , see 3.412.)  Subsections  4.27   Divide a section into two or more enumerated subsections if each subsection addresses different aspects of a single topic or the section would otherwise be too long to read comfortably (see 4.70). Don’t divide a section into paragraphs that aren’t enumerated. For an example of the confusion that can occur",
  "when   a   section   divided   into   subsections   includes   an unenumerated paragraph, see   Karmely v. Wertheimer , 737 F.3d 197, 209–11 (2d Cir. 2013).  4.28   Use the   (a)   hierarchy to designate subsections. If you run out of letters you could shift to the   (aa)   hierarchy, but if a section has 10 or more subsections, consider grouping them into two or more sections.  4.29   Don’t use instead the multiple-numeration system, with the subsections   of   section   4.3   numbered   4.3.1,   4.3.2,   and   so forth. It has four shortcomings: First, it takes up more space than the   (a)   hierarchy.   Second,   it’s   potentially   confusing: considered in isolation,   section 1.1   could refer to the first section of article 1 or the first subsection of section 1. Third, it would look odd to use the multiple-numeration system if you put the first subsection designation after the heading, as this   manual   recommends.   And   fourth,   this   manual recommends against using the multiple-numeration system for tabulated enumerated clauses (see 4.47), and it would look odd to start with the multiple-numeration system and then   shift   to   the   (1)   hierarchy   for   first-level   tabulated enumerated clauses.  4.30   An advantage to using the multiple-numeration system is that   if   you   find   yourself   on   a   page   without   section enumeration,   you   would   know   from   any   subsection enumeration and tabulated-enumerated-clause enumeration what section they’re part of. But that advantage isn’t enough to offset the disadvantages.  4.31   Don’t give headings to subsections—any benefit a reader might derive from subsection headings is more than offset by the way they detract from section headings. If you keep your sections   a   manageable   length,   you   won’t   miss   subsection headings.  Enumerated Clauses  FUNCTION",
  "4.32   “Enumerated clauses” are the parts of a sentence in a section or subsection that are preceded by introductory text and are designated by a number or letter in parentheses, with the next-to-last enumerated clause followed by   and   or   or . Here’s a sample set of enumerated clauses with introductory text:  Schedule 3.3 lists (1) the name of each financial institution in which Acme has an account or safe-deposit box, (2) the one or more names in which each account or box is held, (3) the type of account, and (4) the name of each Person authorized to draw on or have access to each account or box.  4.33   Designating the parts of a sentence in this manner highlights and renders more readable the individual components of a list or series; use enumerated clauses whenever a list or series is anything other than a short string of very brief clauses.  4.34   Because enumerated clauses are parts of a sentence, don’t begin an enumerated clause with a capital letter, unless the word otherwise requires one. For the same reason, in a set of enumerated clauses the only period marking the end of a sentence should occur at the end of the last enumerated clause.  4.35   An   enumerated   clause   could   itself   contain   enumerated subclauses. And those subclauses could conceivably contain enumerated sub-subclauses, but three levels of enumerated clauses is generally a sign of undue complexity.  4.36   The alternative to using enumerated clauses is to make each enumerated clause into a separate provision, repeating each time the essence of the introductory text. Depending on the context, using that approach might yield clearer prose. For example,   using   as   introductory   text   Acme   shall   do   the following   would   result   in   enumerated   clauses   that   lack   a subject. It might be clearer to use instead separate provisions, each using   Acme shall .  PUNCTUATION",
  "4.37   Use a colon to introduce any set of enumerated clauses that is more than about three lines long. A colon allows readers to catch their breath before tackling the enumerated clauses. Because readers don’t expect to pause at the end of a clause fragment,   structure   whatever   precedes   a   colon   as   a   full independent clause—it should contain a subject and verb and be capable of standing alone. You can easily turn into an independent clause any introductory statement that isn’t one by incorporating   the following   or   as follows . For example,   Since 30   March   2017,   the   Company   has   not:   (1)   incurred   any obligation   ... could be rephrased as   Since 30 March 2017, the Company has not done any of the following: (1) incurred any obligation   ... .  4.38   If   the following   or   as follows   occurs in a single independent clause   or   the   last   independent   clause   in   a   compound sentence, you don’t have to place   the following   or   as follows   at the   end   of   the   introductory   text   preceding   a   colon.   The independent   clause   can   be   followed   by   one   or   more subordinate clauses, as in this example:  Acme shall transfer to Widgetco each of   the following , with its certificate of title attached:  4.39   But   the   following   or   as   follows   is   too   remote   when   it’s separated from the colon by one or more other independent clauses, as here:  If any of   the following   occurs and the Licensor notifies Acme it is terminating this agreement in accordance with this section 6 and includes in that notice its reason for terminating this agreement, this agreement will terminate when Acme receives that notice:  4.40   When the enumerated clauses in a sentence are long and complex or involve internal punctuation, for clarity separate them   with   semicolons;   otherwise,   separate   them   using commas.   If   the   enumerated   clauses   in   a   sentence   are sufficiently   complex   or   lengthy   to   justify   their   being preceded by a colon, then separate them using semicolons",
  "rather   than   commas.   Use   commas,   not   semicolons,   to separate enumerated clauses not preceded by a colon.  TABULATION  4.41   A   sentence   containing   enumerated   clauses   can   constitute part of a paragraph, or a paragraph unto itself, but you can instead use “tabulation” to make each enumerated clause stand   alone.   Each   enumerated   clause   so   treated   is   a “tabulated enumerated clause,” as opposed to an “integrated enumerated clause”; in sample 3 and sample 4, section 1.1(a) contains five tabulated enumerated clauses and section 1.2 contains three. The more enumerated clauses there are in a sentence, and the longer they are, the more likely it is that having them stand alone would make them easier to read. For comparison, sample 5 (using the first-line-indent scheme) shows two versions of the same section, one with integrated enumerated clauses and the other with tabulated enumerated clauses.  SAMPLE 5   INTEGRATED AND TABULATED ENUMERATED CLAUSES (USING  MSCD   FIRST-LINE-INDENT ENUMERATION SCHEME)",
  "4.42   When you tabulate a set of enumerated clauses, you have the choice of either tabulating or integrating any subclauses. But you shouldn’t tabulate subclauses if the enumerated clauses are integrated. The same applies to the relationship between subclauses and sub-subclauses.  4.43   Keep   integrated   those   enumerated   clauses   that   are   not preceded by a full independent clause and a colon and are separated by commas: such enumerated clauses should be relatively short and few in number, and it would look odd to have the introductory statement end without punctuation and the tabulated enumerated clauses end with commas.  4.44   Place tabulated enumerated clauses at the end of a sentence to avoid “dangling” text, which occurs when the first part of a   sentence   consists   of   a   series   of   tabulated   enumerated clauses and the remainder starts flush left below the last enumerated clause; see sample 6 (using the hanging-indent scheme).   To   eliminate   dangling   text,   restructure   the",
  "provision or integrate the enumerated clauses. Similarly, end a section or subsection after a series of tabulated enumerated clauses   instead   of   having   the   remaining   one   or   more sentences as an unenumerated block of text.  SAMPLE 6   TABULATED ENUMERATED CLAUSES FOLLOWED BY DANGLING TEXT (USING   MSCD   FIRST-LINE-INDENT ENUMERATION SCHEME)  ENUMERATION  4.45   Use as the enumeration hierarchy for enumerated clauses the  (1)   series, followed by the   (A)   series for subclauses and the   (i)  series (generally called “Romanette”) for sub-subclauses. This hierarchy reserves the   (a)   series for subsections, to enhance the distinction between subsections and enumerated clauses. The   (1)   series takes precedence over the   (i)   series, because it’s easier to read and takes up less space.  4.46   Don’t   use   “commingled   enumeration”—in   sections   that aren’t   divided   into   subsections,   don’t   use   for   first-level tabulated   enumerated   clauses   the   enumeration   used   for subsections,   namely   the   (a)   hierarchy   (see   4.28).   Because tabulated enumerated clauses serve a different function than do   sections   and   subsections   (see   4.62),   commingled enumeration send mixed signals regarding how a contract is",
  "organized. Reserving the   (a)   hierarchy for subsections and using the   (1) ,   (A) , and   (i)   hierarchies for first-, second-, and third-level   enumerated   clauses   has   the   added   benefit   of facilitating automated enumeration.  4.47   For four reasons, it’s best not to use the multiple-numeration system to enumerate tabulated enumerated clauses. First, the multiple-numeration   system   is   suited   to   conveying taxonomies   and   emphasizes   that   each   component   is subsumed   within   the   next   level   up   in   the   hierarchy. By contrast, the components of a set of first-level tabulated enumerated clauses are simply parts of a sentence within a section   or   subsection;   the   most   important   relationship   is between the tabulated enumerated clauses, not between the set   of   tabulated   enumerated   clauses   and   the   section   or subsection in which it’s located.  4.48   Second, the multiple-numeration system wouldn’t work for integrated enumerated clauses, and it would be awkward to switch enumeration depending on whether your enumerated clauses are tabulated or integrated.  4.49   Third, to avoid commingled enumeration, you would have to use the   1.1.1   hierarchy for first-level tabulated enumerated clauses, even in sections without subsections. That would look odd.  4.50   And   fourth,   using   the   multiple-numeration   system   for second-level   tabulated   enumerated   clauses   (for   example,  6.10.4.5.3   in a contract divided into articles with respect to a section divided into subsections) would be cumbersome and might well interfere with tab settings.  4.51   Don’t   use   bullets   to   enumerate   tabulated   enumerated clauses.   Although   bullets   are   useful   in   other   documents, they’re too informal for contracts and aren’t conducive to cross-referencing.  4.52   In   a   set   of   tabulated   enumerated   clauses,   don’t   have enumeration from one hierarchy followed immediately, with",
  "no intervening text, by enumeration from the next hierarchy down. For example, don’t have   (2)   followed directly by   (A)  and its related clause, with the two enumerations separated only by a tab and with the   (A)   clause followed by one or more other enumerated clauses in the same hierarchy. Such arrangements are awkward and raise the question why the enumerated clauses aren’t all in the same hierarchy.  4.53   Instead   of   using   in   a   section   or   subsection   two   sets   of tabulated   enumerated   clauses,   each   with   a   different enumeration hierarchy (for example the   (a)   hierarchy, but starting with   (x) , and the   (1)   hierarchy), limit yourself to one set, either by eliminating the enumeration from one set or by placing one set in a separate section or subsection.  HEADINGS  4.54   Like subsection headings (see 4.31), headings for tabulated enumerated clauses add more clutter than they’re worth.  The   MSCD   First-Line-Indent Enumeration Scheme  4.55   For sections, the   MSCD   first-line-indent scheme indents the first line (as the name suggests), with the enumeration one tab-setting in and the section heading another tab-setting farther in.  4.56   Because each section number has text immediately below, with the section heading to the right, putting a period after the section number helps it stand out. But don’t put a period after the section number in the “articles” version (see 4.16).  4.57   Because the section heading is followed on the same line by text, put a period after the heading and make the period bold, like the heading (see 4.20).  4.58   Except for the first subsection of a section, each subsection uses first-line indenting, but with the indent one tab-setting farther in than section numbers, to distinguish them (see sample 3). Because sections and subsections serve the same",
  "function—grouping   entire   sentences,   by   topic,   into manageable blocks of text (see 4.27)—it makes sense to have them   share   basically   the   same   format.   Place   the   first subsection designation after the section heading and on the same line, with one space on each side: placing the   (a)   on a new line would waste the better part of two lines of space and   would   isolate   the   heading,   as   compared   with   the headings of sections without subsections.  4.59   A   set   of   tabulated   enumerated   clauses   and   the   phrase introducing that set together constitute a single sentence. So tabulated   enumerated   clauses   serve   an   entirely   different function   from   sections   and   subsections—it   doesn’t   make sense to have them share the same format. Instead, tabulated enumerated   clauses   are   analogous   to   bullet   points.   That’s why the first-line indent scheme uses hanging indents, but puts   on   the   left   margin   the   enumeration   for   first-level tabulated   enumerated   clauses,   so   as   not   to   make   them subservient to sections and subsections.  4.60   For four reasons, the first-line-indent scheme doesn’t use first-line   indents   for   tabulated   enumerated   clauses.   First, staggered first-line indents, with the first line of tabulated enumerated   clauses   beginning   one   tab-setting   further   in compared to the first line of a subsection, would give the reader   a   misleading   sense   of   how   tabulated   enumerated clauses relate to sections and subsections. Second, to avoid having the format look odd, you would need to adjust the first-line indents of a set of tabulated enumerated clauses depending   on   whether   the   section   it   occurs   in   contains subsections.   Third,   first-line   indents   are   used   to   denote paragraphs; because a tabulated enumerated clause is only part of a sentence, it isn’t a paragraph. And fourth, when you indent the first line of a tabulated enumerated clause to the third or fourth tab setting and leave the rest flush left, it looks odd.  4.61   If a tabulated enumerated clause itself contains enumerated subclauses and you tabulate them, use the hanging indent",
  "format again but place each subclause one tab-setting further in from the left margin.  The   MSCD   Hanging-Indent Enumeration Scheme  4.62   For sections, the   MSCD   hanging-indent scheme indents all text,   not   just   the   first   line.   The   text   of   sections   and subsections is indented equally, instead of having the text of subsections indented one tab setting further in, as is usually the   case   with   hanging-indent   schemes.   Indenting   them differently would reflect standard taxonomy logic used in outlines,   but   it   doesn’t   accurately   reflect   the   relationship between   sections   and   subsections.   Subsections   aren’t   one level lower than sections in a taxonomy. Instead, subsections are simply a way of structuring sections so they’re easier to read.   Dividing   a   section   into   subsections   is   analogous   to cutting   a   cake   into   slices.   It’s   misleading   to   indent subsections differently from sections, and it wastes space.  4.63   Instead,   subsections   are   distinguished   from   sections   by indenting subsection enumeration slightly more.  4.64   Because   section   numbers   have   no   text   around   them,   no purpose   would   be   served   in   putting   a   period   after   each section number.  4.65   Whereas with first-line indenting it makes sense to put text after a section heading, that would be awkward with hanging indents. And if a section heading has a line to itself, there’s no point putting a period at the end.  4.66   Tabulated enumerated clauses are indented one tab setting further   in   than   sections   and   subsections.   Tabulated enumerated   clauses   are   in   effect   bullet   points,   so   it’s appropriate   to   put   the   enumeration   at   the   left   edge   of the text.

Don’t Make Blocks of Text Too Long or Too Short  4.70   At some point, a block of text becomes sufficiently long that it’s appreciably harder to read—the reader runs out of steam, and it’s easier to lose your place. If a section or subsection is more than about 15 lines long, consider dividing it into two or   more   sections   or   subsections,   or   tabulating   any enumerated clauses it contains.  FIGURE 2   EXTRACT FROM A U.S. MERGERS-AND-ACQUISITIONS CONTRACT",
  "4.71   U.S. big-deal drafting is notorious for indulging in overlong blocks   of   text.   See   figure   2   for   an   extract   from   a representative example of this kind of drafting, the 2011 merger   agreement   providing   for   Google’s   acquisition   of Motorola Mobility. Contract text that dense is difficult to read.  4.72   At   the   other   extreme,   if   text   is   too   fragmented,   it   turns contract prose into something resembling a shopping list or a set   of   instructions   for   assembling   a   bookshelf.   That   can disrupt   the   reader’s   flow   and   concentration   and   make   it harder   to   keep   track   of   what’s   been   covered.   Consider keeping the shortest components consolidated.  4.73   The too-fragmented end of the spectrum is represented by an approach   to   contract   layout   prevalent   in   Commonwealth countries. Figure 3 (an extract of a lending agreement drafted by   a   substantial   Australian   law   firm)   exhibits   the",
  "characteristics   of   this   kind   of   drafting:   short   subsections, tabulation of even short enumerated clauses, and overuse of enumerated clauses at the expense of clarity (see 4.36). Note how in figure 3 just the word “Interest” is used to introduce the second set of tabulated enumerated clauses.  FIGURE 3   EXTRACT FROM AN AUSTRALIAN LENDING AGREEMENT  4.74   With experience, gauging whether blocks of text are too long or too short becomes a matter of assessing white space on a page. You then make any adjustments necessary to maintain an appropriate balance.  Using a Two-Column Format  4.75   A two-column format is an alternative to the standard one- column format. Both   MSCD   enumeration schemes could be used in a two-column format; see sample 7 for a two-column version of the   MSCD   hanging-indent scheme. For a Word template,   go   to www.adamsdrafting.com/resources/templates.",
  "4.76   A two-column format allows you to pack more words on a page.   That’s   why   it’s   used   most   often   in   commercial agreements—by   reputation,   salespeople   tend   to   be   more concerned about page count than the number of words. A two-column format also reduces the number of characters per line (see 16.39).  4.77   But a two-column format comes at a cost—the small font size it requires, which makes text harder to read. (The two- column version of the   MSCD   hanging-indent enumeration scheme uses 9-point Calibri rather than the 11-point Calibri used in the standard version.) The small font size, together with the limited room in which to mark comments by hand, conveys   to   the   other   side,   in   a   way   that   might   not   be appreciated, that comments are discouraged. And on-screen reading of a two-column contract requires regularly scrolling back up the page as you finish reading the left-hand column and start reading the right-hand column.  4.78   Generally, minimizing a contract’s page count should be a lower priority than making sure that it’s concise, easy to read, and easy to work with. A two-column format should be the exception rather than the rule.  SAMPLE 7   TWO-COLUMN FORMAT OF THE   MSCD   FIRST-LINE-INDENT ENUMERATION SCHEME, ARTICLES VERSION",
  "ARRANGING PROVISIONS IN THE BODY OF THE CONTRACT  4.79   Arranging the text of the body of the contract involves three processes that a drafter would engage in concurrently:  division , creating sections, subsections, and, if applicable, articles",
  "classification , determining the section into which a provision should be placed  sequence , ordering the sections and, if applicable, articles  Division  4.80   Custom   mostly   dictates   what   sections   are   included   in standard   kinds   of   contract.   In   commercial   contracts,   it usually makes sense to have sections address different deal issues. It would be artificial to divide provisions according to the category of contract language—for example, Party A’s statement of facts followed by Party B’s statement of facts and Party A’s obligations followed by Party B’s obligations. But   mergers-and-acquisitions   contracts   are   organized   that way.  4.81   Whether you should group sections into articles is a function of how long the contract is (see 4.7). Whether you should divide a section into subsections depends on how long the section is and the topics it addresses (see 4.27).  Classification  4.82   Make sure each provision is in its proper place. If a contract is organized by category of contract language (see 4.80), it would   risk   confusion   to   include   language   of   obligation among the statements of fact.  Sequence  4.83   Two   factors   come   into   play   in   determining   the   order   of articles (if any) and sections.  4.84   On the one hand, more-important provisions should come before less-important provisions, and provisions consulted more frequently should come before provisions consulted less frequently. It makes sense to give readers easy access to what they need.",
  "4.85   On the other hand, because most contracts aren’t drafted from   scratch   but   are   based   on   models,   the   sequence   of articles   and   sections   is   often   similar   from   contract   to contract. In an acquisition agreement, for example, the body of the contract is generally organized in this sequence: deal terms,   statements   of   fact   (traditionally   known   as  representations   and   warranties ;   see   3.374),   obligations, conditions   to   closing,   termination,   indemnification,   and miscellaneous provisions.  4.86   Such consistency not only saves time when drafting but also enables   lawyers   to   navigate   easily   around   a   contract   and determine whether it addresses all that it should.  4.87   In   some   respects   the   conventional   order   of   contract provisions reverses what would seem the logical order. For example,   a   set   of   statements   of   fact   in   an   acquisition agreement invariably begins with statements of fact about basic matters: that Acme has been duly organized, that its entry into the agreement has been appropriately authorized, and so on. Because such matters are rarely at issue, these statements of fact could safely be pushed farther back. But any inefficiencies caused by retaining the conventional order would be negligible—a reader could readily move past those statements of fact that aren’t at issue.  4.88   So it’s unrealistic to expect drafters to adjust the order of provisions from transaction to transaction based on how the deal   terms   have   affected   the   relative   significance   of   each provision.   Instead,   it’s   up   to   the   drafter   to   decide   what balance to strike between using a conventional sequence and reflecting the priorities of a deal.  4.89   Drafters   sometimes   approach   sequence   with   the   aim   of “burying” a contentious provision by putting it with less significant   provisions.   In   the   case   of   consumer   contracts, burying a provision could cause the provision to be held unenforceable. That’s less likely to happen with contracts between   ostensibly   sophisticated   parties   represented   by",
  "counsel, but other adverse consequences could arise. For one thing,   such   gamesmanship   could   well   sour   a   business relationship and wouldn’t reflect well on whoever does the burying. And it’s unlikely to fool anyone.  4.90   Regarding where to place the definition section, see 6.95.  FRONTLOADING AND BACKENDING  4.91   An   exception   to   the   standard   approach   to   arranging provisions in the body of the contract (see 4.79) is what this manual   calls   “frontloading”—pulling   selected   information out of the body of the contract and placing it at the top of the contract.  4.92   Frontloading   is   a   common   feature   of   commercial agreements. A company might enter into dozens, hundreds, or   thousands   of   transactions   using   a   particular   template. With each transaction, only certain information changes— for example, in the case of a license agreement, the date of the contract, the customer’s name, the product, the term, the fees, and any identification numbers. From the company’s perspective, that’s the most pertinent information, so the company might elect to place it at the top of the contract, perhaps in a table.  4.93   Frontloading offers several potential advantages: it could make it easier for company personnel to assess the transaction and locate key information it could facilitate training salespeople in how to handle the contract process it would likely speed negotiations by highlighting the main terms it allows you to signal to the other side that negotiating anything outside of the frontloaded information would be a more time-consuming process, perhaps involving the legal department",
  "4.94   But the more information you frontload, the harder it can be to   digest.   And   departing   from   conventional   notions   of sequence can disrupt a reader’s expectations regarding where to find a particular provision (see 4.86). So take information out of its conventional context and put it on the first page only   if   justified   by   the   transactional   and   administrative benefits. For example, if a company can readily retrieve its customers’ contact information through its invoicing system, nothing would be gained by frontloading it.  4.95   Also,   if   when   frontloading   you   simply   repeat   the information in question as opposed to moving it from the body of the contract, the result would be a contract that contains the same information in two places. That’s always a bad   idea   (see   1.62).   It   wouldn’t   be   surprising   if   the frontloaded   information   were   revised   without   making conforming changes to the body of the contract, leading to inconsistency and confusion.  4.96   Frontloading   the   signature   blocks   would   allow   company personnel   to   determine,   without   having   to   turn   a   page, whether   a   contract   has   been   signed.   But   it   also   might encourage   customers   to   sign   the   contract   without   paying much   attention   to   what   follows   the   signature   blocks. Dissuading customers from negotiating the boilerplate is one thing; dissuading them from reading it is a different and more problematic notion, one that perhaps invites customers to claim later that they hadn’t known what they were getting into.  4.97   Instead of frontloading deal-specific information, you could put   it   in   a   schedule—this   manual   refers   to   that   as “backending.”   Compared   with   frontloading,   one disadvantage is that it puts the most important information at the back of the contract. But backending makes more sense if the deal-specific information is at all voluminous.  4.98   Analogous to backending is a “master” agreement structure, with the parties specifying in a contract the general terms of",
  "transactions between them and then stating in a separate document,   commonly   called   a   statement   of   work   or   a purchase order, additional terms relating to a specific project. But   that   structure   is   a   function   of   the   serial   nature   of transactions between the parties, whereas frontloading and backending   are   driven   by   repeat   use   of   a   template   with different counterparties.  4.99   Analogous   to   both   frontloading   and   backending   is   the practice   of   handling   a   purchase   using   a   purchase   order supplemented by terms printed on the back of the purchase order or stated separately. Purchase orders can also be used with a “master” agreement (see 4.98).  CROSS-REFERENCES Function  4.100   It’s routine for a contract provision to refer to an article, section, subsection, or enumerated clause in that contract (in which case the reference is called an internal cross-reference) or to a provision in another contract (in which case it’s called an external cross-reference).  4.101   Cross-references can also be categorized as “pointing” cross- references   and   “prioritizing”   cross-references.   A   pointing cross-reference   simply   points   to   another   section.   For example, a termination provision might state that failure to satisfy   one   or   more   conditions   stated   elsewhere   in   the contract is grounds for termination.  4.102   Prioritizing cross-references indicate that in some respect, one provision takes priority over another. That type of cross- reference is associated with   notwithstanding ,   subject to , and  except   as   provided   in .   Those   phrases   are   discussed   in 13.599–.611.  4.103   Generally, the fewer cross-references in a contract, the better. A reader should be able to understand each provision on its own, without having to turn to another part of the same",
  "contract or to another contract. Prioritizing cross-references can be particularly disruptive; in quantity, they’re a sign of inefficient structure.  4.104   See 6.103–.114 regarding cross-references to definitions.  Wording  4.105   In a cross-reference, state whether a section or article is being referred to, plus its enumeration. Don’t add   of this agreement  after internal cross-references, or even   hereof . It’s tiresome to encounter   hereof   at every turn, and it strains credulity to suggest that without   hereof   a contract reference to   section 4.5  could be understood as referring to a section of some other contract. This issue wouldn’t even be worth addressing in an internal rule of interpretation (see 15.9). And don’t add the notation   above   or   below : such notations are more annoying for the drafter and reader than they are helpful.  4.106   A provision can refer to itself— this section 4 . If any such reference is to a section rather than to a subsection, you could omit the section number— this section . But don’t do so —instead   of   including   enumeration   when   referring   to   a subsection and omitting it when referring to a section, it’s simpler always to include enumeration. And when referring to two or more sections, don’t repeat the word   section —say  sections 5 and 7 , not   section 5 and section 7 .  4.107   In a cross-reference to a subsection, use the word   section —as in   this   section   4(c) —rather   than   the   word   subsection .   It’s simpler to use the same word in both contexts, and there’s no risk of confusion. In the interest of consistency and to facilitate revisions, when referring to two or more subsections of the same section, repeat the section number. For example, say   section 6(b) or 6(c)   instead of   section 6(b) or (c) . That would also   spare   readers   momentarily   thinking   that   the   second cross-reference is the enumeration for an enumerated clause.",
  "4.108   In referring to an enumerated clause that isn’t a sentence, it’s arguably preferable to refer to   clause (2) of section 4(b)   rather than   section 4(b)(2) , because the latter suggests that you are referring to an entire provision rather than a fragment. Since nothing   significant   is   riding   on   this   distinction,   it’s unobjectionable to use the more compact formula. A cross- reference to an enumerated clause could be to an enumerated clause in a section, as in   section 7(2) , or a subsection, as in  7(b)(2) .   In   the   interest   of   consistency   and   to   facilitate revisions, when referring to two or more enumerated clauses occurring in the same section and, if applicable, subsection, repeat the section number and, if applicable, the subsection. For example, say   sections 6(b)(2) and 6(b)(3)   instead of   sections 6(b)(2) and (3) .  4.109   In cross-references, don’t use initial capitals in the words  section   and   article   (see 17.34). And don’t use bold, italics, underlining, or any other form of typographic emphasis for cross-references. Doing so could conceivably come in handy if you don’t use automatic cross-referencing (see 4.112) and need to check internal cross-references—emphasizing them could   help   ensure   that   you   don’t   miss   any.   But   using Microsoft Word’s “Find and Replace” function would be a more efficient way to find cross-references. And emphasized internal cross-references are more likely to distract readers than help them.  4.110   An   internal   cross-reference   that   consists   of   only   the enumeration of what’s being referred to gives the reader no indication what’s addressed in the specified provision. The alternative would be to include in each cross-reference the heading of the article or section in question, as in   article 12 (Indemnification) , but this manual doesn’t recommend that practice. It gives the reader a better idea of the significance of the cross-reference, and it makes inaccurate cross-references easier to catch. But in effect it involves referring to the same section twice and as such invites inconsistency (see 1.62).",
  "4.111   An alternative way of making it easier for readers to figure out what’s addressed in the provision being referred to would be to use   the Word   option that   allows you   to insert   an automated cross-reference (see 4.112) as a hyperlink.  Updating  4.112   Adding, deleting, or rearranging blocks of text would likely render inaccurate some or all internal cross-references in a contract. You could painstakingly check them each time you prepare a new draft, but that’s a nuisance. You could leave them   inaccurate   until   just   before   signing,   but   cross- references,   like   the   table   of   contents   (see   2.214),   are   of greatest use when reviewing drafts and negotiating, less so after the contract has been signed. Using Word’s automatic- cross-referencing feature is a simple way to ensure that your cross-references remain up to date—it turns cross-references into   field   codes   that   adjust   automatically   to   changes   in enumeration. But it presents two challenges of its own. First, if anyone modifying a draft contract doesn’t know that the cross-references are coded, chaos can result, with some cross- references being coded, some not, and some turning into error messages. Second, some software for removing metadata —potentially sensitive information automatically embedded in   computer   files—treats   cross-reference   field   codes   as metadata.  4.113   To   avoid   such   problems,   use   automatic   cross-referencing only in the master version of a draft contract. In copies you send out for comment, change the cross-reference field codes to regular text—doing so takes only a few key strokes. When preparing the next draft, make your changes to the master version   and   in   the   process   update   the   cross-references automatically.  4.114   If cross-references would be rendered inaccurate by deleting blocks of text, one alternative to renumbering is replacing the deleted text with the bracketed notation   Intentionally omitted",
  "and   leaving   the   enumeration   unchanged.   Even   an organization that uses automatic cross-references might find this   technique   useful:   if   it   handles   a   high   volume   of transactions   based   on   a   template,   renumbering   template sections for a particular transaction might create confusion.  HEADERS AND FOOTERS Page Numbers  4.115   Number the pages of a contract—except for the first page, which should be unnumbered—using Arabic numerals. If a contract has a cover sheet, use lowercase Roman numerals to number each page of the associated materials (the table of contents and the index of definitions, if present).  4.116   In general, follow standard practice and place page numbers in   the   center   of   the   footer.   But   if   the   footer   contains additional   information,   you   might   want   to   put   the   page numbers flush right and perhaps highlight their function by adding the word   Page .  4.117   Using the notation   Page X of Y , or   X/Y , tells the reader how long   the   document   is   and   precludes   anyone   from surreptitiously adding pages at the end of the contract after it has been signed. But for the contract itself, as opposed to any attachments, those advantages aren’t compelling. Flipping to the signature page just once would tell readers how long a contract is—they don’t need to be constantly reminded of the number of pages. And it’s unlikely that anyone would attempt, let alone pull off, that sort of fraud. So perhaps the slight clutter that this notation adds outweighs the minor benefits. (Regarding using it for attachments, see 4.119.)  4.118   If   a   contract   has   more   than   one   attachment,   you   can number the pages consecutively, as if the attachments are all one document, or number them nonconsecutively, with each attachment treated as a separate document. Nonconsecutive numbering makes it easier for readers to figure out where",
  "they are in an attachment. And if attachment enumeration is added to page numbers, with   C-5   designating page five of attachment   C,   readers   could   also   tell   which   attachment they’re on. But that enhanced numbering would be awkward if attachments are enumerated using section numbers (see 5.86).  4.119   On the other hand, using consecutive numbering with the notation   Page X of Y , or   X/Y , would allow readers to figure out quickly whether they have a complete set of attachments. Because a set of attachments can consist of more than one document and, unlike the rest of the contract, doesn’t end with a signature page, the convention   Page X of Y   is more useful for attachments than for the rest of the contract.  4.120   Because   using   both   consecutive   and   nonconsecutive numbering in a single set of attachments seems excessive, it’s up   to   the   drafter   to   consider   which   system   would   be appropriate for the transaction at hand.  Other Information  4.121   Headers and, more usually, footers are where you find file names and draft lines.  4.122   Drafters who want working drafts kept confidential might add the notation   Confidential   to the header or footer. Adding the notation   Privileged and Confidential   to drafts exchanged with the other side wouldn’t make sense, but it might be appropriate for drafts that are shared only with clients and contain explanatory notes—it might help the client invoke the attorney-client privilege to shield a draft from discovery in later litigation. But it’s hard to see how another notation,  Attorney Work Product , could serve any purpose, because the work-product   doctrine   applies   to   materials   prepared   in anticipation of litigation, not draft contracts.  4.123   Businesses and law firms increasingly place their logo in headers and footers and on cover sheets. There’s little reason",
  "to be concerned that use of an organization’s logo would suggest to a court that, for purposes of the doctrine that ambiguities   are   to   be   construed   against   the   drafter,   the organization should be considered the drafter: presumably plenty   of   other   information   is   available   indicating   who drafted what, if it comes to that.",
  "THE BACK OF THE CONTRACT  5.1   The   body   of   the   contract   is   followed   by   the   concluding clause,   the   signature   blocks,   and   any   attachments.   This manual refers to those components collectively as “the back of the contract.”  THE CONCLUDING CLAUSE  5.2   In most contracts, the signature blocks are preceded by a sentence   known   as   the   concluding   clause.   You   could conceivably dispense with the concluding clause, as it states the obvious, but it’s best to retain it, in an appropriate form —it eases what would otherwise be an abrupt transition to the signature blocks.  The Two Kinds of Concluding Clause  5.3   You have a choice of two forms of concluding clause, one for if you state the date of the agreement in the introductory clause, the other for if you have those signing the contract date their signatures (see 2.23–.28).  5.4   If you state the date of the agreement in the introductory clause, use this concluding clause:   The parties are signing this agreement on the date stated in the introductory clause . (See sample 8.) Don’t name the parties: doing so results in a less concise concluding clause, the wordiness increasing with the number of parties. (Regarding this same issue in the context of the lead-in, see 2.164.)  5.5   If the contract anticipates that those signing will date their signatures, use this concluding clause:   Each party is signing",
  "this agreement on the date stated opposite that party’s signature . (See sample 9.)  5.6   And if you have those signing date their signatures, include this provision in the boilerplate (see sample 9):  This agreement will become effective when all parties have signed it. The date of this agreement will be the date this agreement is signed by the last party to sign it (as indicated by the date associated with that party’s signature).  5.7   The above provision makes it clear that the contract becomes effective once all the parties have signed it, and it explains what date to give the contract. As such, it simply states what the law provides, but there’s value to informing the parties of that. It doesn’t attempt to be comprehensive. In particular, it doesn’t   explain   that   just   signing   a   contract   doesn’t accomplish anything unless the other side knows that you’ve signed it.  SAMPLE 8   CONCLUDING CLAUSE AND SIGNATURE BLOCKS, DATE STATED IN THE INTRODUCTORY CLAUSE",
  "Use   Signing   Instead of   Executing and Delivering  5.8   In most traditional contracts, the concluding clause refers to execution and delivery of the contract by the parties. For a general discussion of   execute and deliver , see 13.274. For the reasons   explained   immediately   below,   this   manual recommends you use   signing   instead.  EXECUTE  5.9   Determining whether one should refer to execution in the introductory clause requires first establishing what it means.  5.10   Black’s Law Dictionary   says that to execute a contract means to make a document legally valid by signing it. But signing a contract isn’t by itself enough to make it legally valid. Other requirements must be satisfied—for example, the signer can’t somehow be incapacitated—and you can’t circumvent those",
  "requirements   simply   by   having   the   party   state   in   the concluding clause that it’s executing the contract.  5.11   Alternatively, executing a contract means having it signed in the name of a party by someone with authority to act on that party’s behalf. See Scott T. FitzGibbon, Donald W. Glazer & Steven O. Weise,   Glazer and FitzGibbon on Legal Opinions   § 9.4 (3d ed. 2008 & Supp. 2012). But if you’re concerned whether someone signing a contract on behalf of a party has been authorized by that party, having that individual sign under a concluding clause that refers to execution shouldn’t provide any comfort. (Regarding authorization generally, see 5.20.)  5.12   Execute   also means to perform or complete a contract or duty, making “to execute a contract” potentially confusing.  5.13   So if   execute   means something other than simply   sign , that additional   meaning   is   irrelevant   for   purposes   of   the concluding clause and simply confuses matters.   Signing   is the much clearer choice.  DELIVER  5.14   It serves no purpose to refer to delivery in the concluding clause. The concluding clause introduces the signatures, and delivery—transfer   of   possession   of   the   signed   contract— happens after signing. And more to the point, delivery isn’t required   for   a   contract   to   be   enforceable,   other   than   a contract under seal (see 5.48–.56) or, under English law, a deed (see 5.58). For more on delivery, see 13.277.  Which Tense to Use  5.15   Contracts aren’t treated as an after-the-fact historical record. That’s why it would be unorthodox to use in the concluding clause   the parties signed . Instead, it’s appropriate to have the contract speak as of the moment of signing. You accomplish that by using the present progressive— the parties are signing . The concluding clause is a statement in anticipation of a transitional   event—a   comparable   sentence   would   be   I’m",
  "giving this package to Sylvia to mail —so the sense of duration normally associated with the progressive doesn’t apply.  5.16   The traditional choice would be the present perfect ( have signed   or   have caused   to be signed ), but it suggest that the action was completed at some point in the past.  5.17   If you use   the parties are signing , consistency would require that you revise the standard statement of fact   This agreement has been validly executed by Acme   to read   This agreement is being validly signed by Acme . (Whether such a statement of fact serves any purpose is a separate question.)  Using an   As Of   Date in the Concluding Clause  5.18   Many   concluding   clauses   refer   to   the   contract   as   being signed   as of   the date in the introductory clause, whether or not   that   date   is   an   as   of   date   (see   2.35).   This   manual recommends that you not use   as of   in association with a date in the introductory clause or in the concluding clause. Failing that, if you use or omit   as of   in one, do the same in the other.  Traditional Concluding Clauses  5.19   Traditional   concluding   clauses   differ   from   those recommended   in   this   manual.   Here’s   a   representative example of a traditional concluding clause that refers to a date stated in the introductory clause:  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, have by their proper and duly authorized officers duly executed and delivered these presents as of the day and year first above written.  5.20   Traditional concluding clauses feature several shortcomings, besides those addressed in 5.8–.17.  REFERRING   TO   AUTHORIZATION",
  "5.21   The body of the contract is a more sensible place than the concluding   clause   for   statements   of   fact   regarding authorization.   But   more   generally,   if   you’re   concerned whether   the   individual   signing   for   the   other   party   is authorized, having the contract state that they’re authorized should provide no reassurance. Instead, ask for confirmation, for example a board resolution.  5.22   A party might nevertheless want to refer to authorization in the concluding clause not because it’s concerned whether the individual signing on behalf of the other party is authorized, but   because   it   wants   to   remind   its   business   people   they shouldn’t sign the contract unless they’ve been authorized to do so. Any such reminder would be more noticeable if placed in the signature blocks (see 5.34).  5.23   Some traditional concluding clauses contain the following, or   a   variant:   Each   individual   signing   for   an   entity   hereby personally warrants his or her legal authority to bind that entity . Aside from the peculiar wording, attempting to establish a remedy against a signer if they’re found not to have authority would seem a low priority. (For a comparable notation used under signature blocks, see 5.36.)  INTENDING   TO   BE   LEGALLY   BOUND  5.24   Under U.S. law the phrase   intending to be legally bound   is pointless:   it   isn’t   a   requirement   for   enforceability   of   a contract that the parties have, or express in writing, an intent to be legally bound. (But see 2.186.) In England, an intention to be legally bound is at least formally required to form a valid   contract.   But   a   presumption   that   commercial agreements are intended to be legally binding, together with other evidentiary rules, means that generally it’s not required that   one   show   that   intention,   including   by   means   of   a statement in the contract to that effect.  5.25   Arguably the phrase   intending to be legally bound   could serve to remind parties that contracts are legally binding. That",
  "might   be   relevant   for   consumer   contracts,   but   not   for business contracts.  ACCEPTING   THE   TERMS   OF   THE   AGREEMENT  5.26   Some traditional concluding clauses state that by signing, the parties are accepting the terms of the agreement. That’s unnecessary, for the same reason that the phrase   intending to be   legally   bound   is   unnecessary   (see   5.24–.25):   signing   a contract is sufficient to indicate assent.  ARCHAISMS  5.27   Traditional   concluding   clauses   are   a   reliable   source   of archaisms:   IN WITNESS WHEREOF   is   a   translation   of   the Latin   cuius   rei   testimonium   and   means   “in   testimony   of which” (regarding this sort of archaism generally, see 2.138);  these presents   is an archaic alternative to   this agreement ; and the phrase   the day and year first above written   is long-winded and imprecise. A standard alternative,   set forth above , is also imprecise.  Avoiding Signature-Page Mix-Ups  5.28   If the parties to a contract are also parties to one or more other   contracts   and   the   concluding   clause   uses   only   this agreement ,   confusion   might   arise   as   to   which   contract   a signature page belongs to. You can avoid that by referring in the concluding clause to the type of agreement involved instead of using   this agreement . (For another solution, see 5.73.)  THE SIGNATURE BLOCKS  5.29   As shown in sample 8 and sample 9, the concluding clause is followed by a signature block for each party. A signature block consists of a party’s name accompanied by a signature line. Don’t use the name of a company division that will be",
  "performing   under   the   contract:   the   division   shouldn’t   be party to the contract (see 2.81–.82).  Format  5.30   If the party is a legal entity and not an individual, place the entity’s name in all capitals above the signature line. Don’t state above the entity name the defined term used for that name in the contract, and don’t note after the entity name the entity’s jurisdiction of organization—doing so just adds clutter,   because   that   information   is   readily   available elsewhere.  5.31   Be cautious about including two or more entity names above a signature line, to indicate that one person is signing on behalf of more than one entity. Under the laws of the U.S. states, all that’s required is a manifestation of assent, so a multientity   signature   block   might   work,   but   it   would   be clearer to have a separate signature block for each entity. Under English law, a separate signature block is required for each company: section 44(6) of the Companies Act 2006 says, “Where a document is to be signed by a person on behalf of more than one company, it is not duly signed by that person for the purposes of this section unless he signs it separately in each capacity.”  SAMPLE 9   CONCLUDING CLAUSE AND SIGNATURE BLOCKS, SIGNATURES DATED (USING   MSCD   HANDING-INDENT ENUMERATION SCHEME)",
  "5.32   Place   By:   next   to   the   signature   line   to   indicate   that   the individual signing is signing as a representative and not in their personal capacity.  5.33   Note the name and title of the person signing on behalf of a party under the signature in lowercase letters with initial capitals. If they are signing in a particular capacity, say so. For example, an individual might be signing as trustee of the party (see 2.78). If you don’t know who will be signing, use  Name:   and   Title: . If you do know, include that person’s name and title (instead of, rather than next to,   Name:   and   Title: ), to spare someone having to write them in by hand.  5.34   If a legal-entity party wants to remind whoever’s signing the contract on its behalf to obtain management approval (see 5.20), that could be accomplished by including the notation  and authorized signatory   (alternatively,   and authorized signer ) after   that   person’s   name   and   title   in   the   legal   entity’s signature block.  5.35   For various possible reasons, a company might have two persons sign a contract on its behalf:",
  "It might be a function of risk management, the idea being that having two people sign the contract would make less likely entry into a contract that’s inconsistent with company policies. The company’s organizational documents might require that two people sign contracts on behalf of the company. The other party might insist that two officers sign on behalf of the company, to allow the other party to benefit from a statutory presumption of authority. For example, California Corporation Code § 313 states that if a contract is signed on behalf of a corporation by two officers holding positions specified in the statute, the contract isn’t invalided as to the corporation by any lack of authority of the signing officers unless the other party knew that the signing officers had no authority. The contract might not be valid unless two people sign it. For example, English law provides that under various circumstances, a contract will not be valid unless two people sign it on behalf of a company.  5.36   A feature of Canadian and other non-U.S. contracts is use, under a signature block, of the notation   I have authority to bind   [ the Corporation ], with the notation using the defined term for that entity’s name. It’s not clear that that approach is   an   improvement   over   other   ways   of   addressing authorization (see 5.21–.22), except that it might facilitate recording a contract in jurisdictions that require a statement of the signer’s authority. (For a comparable notation in the concluding clause, see 5.23.)  5.37   If the signer for a legal-entity party is itself an entity and not an   individual,   as   is   often   the   case   when   a   party   is   a partnership or a limited liability company, a signature block within a signature block is required; see for example the signature block for Jarrow Holdings LLC in sample 8.",
  "5.38   If the party is an individual, place their name under the signature line in capital letters to distinguish it from the name of any individual signing on behalf of an entity. If there’s any risk of confusion, add   in his   [or   her ]   own capacity  after the person’s name. As with entity signature blocks (see 5.30), don’t state above an individual’s signature block the defined term used for that individual’s name in the contract.  5.39   If you want each person signing to note the date they signed (see 5.5),   place   to   one   side   of   each   signature   line   (as   in sample   9),   or   directly   underneath,   the   notation   Date:  followed by the date, leaving one or more elements blank to be filled in by the signer, as necessary.  5.40   Signature blocks are usually aligned one above the other on the right-hand side of the page, as in sample 8 and sample 9. To save space, you can place them side by side. In contracts with dated signatures, that would require moving each date line   from   the   left   side   of   the   page   to   underneath   its corresponding signature and associated information.  5.41   In England, an alternative arrangement for signature blocks persists: the signature-block information is collected on the left side of the page, on perhaps three lines, with to the right of that a vertical line of closing parentheses, one directly above the other, running down the middle of the page. That line of parentheses is the word-processing equivalent of what it replaces—a single curly bracket. The signature goes in the space to the right of the line of brackets. Don’t use this arrangement: it doesn’t make it clear what a signer is to do. If the information on the left contains a blank for the signer’s printed name, don’t be surprised if the signer signs in that blank and assumes that their work is done.  Read before Signing  5.42   Some contracts include above a signature block, or above all signature blocks, the notation   Read before signing , usually in all capitals. (This is a rare instance of use of the imperative",
  "mood   in   a   contract;   see   3.124.)   This   notation   might   be preceded   by   Important   or   Caution ,   with   or   without   an exclamation point. Such notations are unobjectionable for contracts that have as a party an individual who might not be   represented   by   counsel;   otherwise,   they   would   seem pointless.  Dealing with Undated Signatures  5.43   A   recurring   nuisance   in   exchanging   signature   pages containing dated signatures is that sometimes a party forgets to date their signature. An alternative to asking that party to submit   another   signature   page,   this   time   with   a   dated signature, would be to add the following to the provision recommended in 5.6:  If a party signs this agreement but fails to date their signature, the date the other party receives the signing party’s signature will be deemed to be the date the signing party signed this agreement.  5.44   And here’s a version for a contract with more than two parties:  If a party signs this agreement but fails to date their signature, the date [the Company] receives the signing party’s signature will be deemed to be the date the signing party signed this agreement.  5.45   You would have to designate one party by name in the version for more than two parties, because the other parties might receive the signing party’s signature on different dates. Note also the singular   their   in both versions (see 17.15–.17). Change it to   its   for a contract with only entities as parties.  5.46   If   you   receive   an   undated   signature   and   the   contract contains the language in 5.43 or 5.44, write the relevant date by hand in the blank next to the signature, with the notation  Determined in accordance with   the relevant section, and send",
  "the signature pages as so annotated to the one or more other parties.  Parties with Limited Roles  5.47   One can be party to a contract for only certain provisions. If you elect to highlight in the introductory clause a party’s limited role in that contract (see 2.61), do so in that party’s signature block too, by adding the phrase   with respect to only  [ specified provisions ]. That phrase, with an initial capital and a colon at the end, could go above the party’s name in the signature block or, preceded by a comma at the end of the party’s name, immediately below the party’s name. The latter approach is slightly more economical.  Seals and Deeds  BACKGROUND  5.48   In medieval England, a seal—consisting of wax attached to a writing and bearing an impression—served as a marker to identify the parties to an agreement, and sealing was one formality required for a binding contract. For corporate seals, sealing wax gave way to an embossed impression.  5.49   As   literacy   increased,   signatures   slowly   replaced   seals   as identifying markers. And the value of seals as a device for formally   validating   contracts   dwindled   as   requirements regarding what is a seal were relaxed. By judicial decision or statute, the presence of the word   seal   near the signature— even on a preprinted form—has been enough to make a contract   one   under   seal.   The   same   applies   to   use   of   the phrase   locus sigilli —meaning “the place of the seal”—or its abbreviation   L.S.   Some courts have found that a recital to the effect   that   the   parties   consider   the   document   sealed   is sufficient to make it sealed, even if no seal is present—hence the formula   signed, sealed ,   and delivered .",
  "5.50   These indicia of sealing are still in use, but the requirements for a contract under seal depend on the jurisdiction, and the standards can seem arbitrary. For example, under Delaware law the word “seal” must be affixed next to the signature lines—it’s not enough for the concluding clause to refer to the contract being under seal. See   Sunrise Ventures ,   LLC v. Rehoboth   Canal   Ventures,   LLC ,   No.   4119-VCS,   2010   WL 975581 (Del. Ch. 4 Mar. 2010).  5.51   In the U.S. states, whether or not a contract is under seal can have implications in three contexts.  5.52   First, a sealed contract is binding absent consideration, or at least   sealing   creates   a   rebuttable   presumption   of consideration. But if under the law of a state a contract is at risk of being held unenforceable for lack of consideration, making the contract one under seal probably wouldn’t be the clearest   fix,   even   if   the   law   governing   the   contract acknowledges the distinction between sealed and unsealed instruments. For alternative fixes, see 2.183–.184.  5.53   Second, sealing might affect the statute of limitations that applies to a contract, in that more than 20 U.S. jurisdictions acknowledge   contracts   under   seal   in   their   statutes   of limitations.   See   3-10   Corbin   on   Contracts   §   10.18[H].   For example, Delaware has a 20-year statute of limitations for actions brought on contracts “under seal,” as compared with the three-year statute of limitations for ordinary contracts.  5.54   And third, presence of a corporate seal on a contract can affect authorization. For example, section 107 of the New York Business Corporation Law says, “The presence of the corporate   seal   on   a   written   instrument   purporting   to   be executed by authority of a domestic or foreign corporation shall be prima facie evidence that the instrument was so executed.”   So   for   a   contract   governed   by   New   York   law, presence of a corporate seal would shift the burden of proof to whoever would argue that the person signing for that",
  "entity lacked authority. But it’s not clear that this law has encouraged use of corporate seals.  5.55   The problem with attributing significance to a legal formality such   as   sealing   contracts   is   that   the   significance   to   be attributed isn’t evident from the nature of the formality, hence   the   arbitrary   nature   of   the   caselaw   regarding   the requirements for a contract under seal (see 5.50). Instead of requiring   contract   parties   to   go   through   a   formality   to achieve   an   unrelated   legal   effect   on   the   need   for consideration or the duration of a statute of limitations, it would be simpler to have the contract achieve that legal effect explicitly.  5.56   Furthermore,   compared   with   a   wax   seal,   what   currently passes for sealing can’t reasonably be considered conclusive evidence   that   a   party   intended   the   sealed   instrument   to contain   an   enforceable   promise.   And   it   wouldn’t   be reasonable   to   expect   someone   signing   a   contract   to   pay attention   to   or   understand   such   obscure   notations.   That explains why more than half the U.S. states have abolished the   distinction   between   sealed   and   unsealed   instruments, and why section 2-203 of the Uniform Commercial Code has abolished the distinction for sales of goods. Even those states that   haven’t   abolished   the   distinction   altogether   have modified   it   sufficiently   so   that   a   seal   has   little   lingering vitality.  DEEDS  5.57   Signing   formalities   have   a   role   to   play   in   common-law jurisdictions outside the United States.  5.58   In England, the question is whether a contract is “under hand” or is a “deed.” As with a contract under seal, the legal implications   of   whether   a   contract   is   a   deed   relate   to consideration and to limitations periods. But use of a seal is now mostly no longer relevant. Instead, for a document to be a deed, it must be described as a deed or state that it is “executed as a deed,” it must be signed by the appropriate",
  "one or more persons, it must be witnessed, and it must be “delivered” (in other words, the party signing the document must show, by words or by conduct, that it intends to be bound by the deed). The formalities are sufficiently complex that an entire book is devoted to describing them. See Mark Anderson & Victor Warner,   Execution of Documents   (3d ed. 2015). It seems unhelpful to have formalities play such a significant   role   in   allowing   contract   parties   to   achieve unrelated substantive ends.  5.59   Australia recognizes the distinction between deeds and other contracts, and an Australian court opinion highlights the problem with such formalities. In   400 George Street (Qld) Pty Ltd   and   Ors   v.   BG   International   Ltd   [2010]   QSC   66,   the Queensland Supreme Court addressed whether a lease that was   “executed   as   a   deed”   was   in   fact   a   deed.   The   court concluded that it was not a deed, citing a list of factors, one of which was that the lease used as a heading for the recitals “Background” rather than “Recitals.” It’s preposterous that such   an   ostensibly   benign   choice   could   have   such nonobvious   ramifications,   but   the   greater   the   role   of formalities   in   contract   law,   the   greater   the   risk   of   such outcomes.  OTHER   JURISDICTIONS  5.60   In   some   other   jurisdictions,   the   corporate   seal   plays   an important role. For example, in China, contracts are by law binding on a company if a representative signs the contract or if the company’s corporate seal is applied to the contract. Some commentators recommend doing both, to reduce the possibility   of   arguments   over   authority.   And   the   general practice in Russia is for parties to sign contracts and apply the corporate seal.  DRAFTING   IMPLICATIONS  5.61   If by law a contract won’t be enforceable unless signing formalities   are   observed,   or   if   you   would   derive   a   legal",
  "advantage from observing signing formalities, then provide for the appropriate formalities. If that involves applying a corporate seal next to party signatures, consider placing the notation   Corporate seal here , or some similar notation, next to each signature block as a reminder.  5.62   Otherwise, eliminate from your contracts all references to sealing and other irrelevant signing formalities.  Witnessing Signatures  5.63   By law, signatures to certain contracts must be witnessed. For example, statutes in at least some U.S. states require that anyone taking out a mortgage sign the mortgage document in the presence of witnesses. Also, contract signatures are often witnessed even if it’s not required by law, presumably to preclude any claim that the signature to a contract is not that of the person named in the signature block. In most business contexts, this isn’t likely to be a concern.  5.64   If you wish to provide for a signature to be witnessed, place a signature block for the witness, preceded by the notation  Witness: , next to the signature block of the signature being witnessed.   An   alternative   notation   is   Attest: —a   witness “attests” to a signature—but its meaning would be obscure to many readers.  Notarizing Signatures  5.65   By law, signatures to certain contracts must be notarized— attested to by a notary public. For example, under Colorado law signatures to an independent contractor agreement must be notarized. See Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 8-40-202. And under the laws of some states the grantor’s signature on a deed to real property must be notarized. But it’s commonplace for contracts to require that signatures be notarized even if it’s not required by law. As with witnessed signatures (see 5.63), presumably the aim is to avoid any dispute as to the identity of a person signing a contract.",
  "5.66   Generally,   having   a   contract   signature   notarized   in   the United States involves having the person who signed declare to the notary that they freely signed the contract—that’s known as an “acknowledgment.” The notary then adds next to that person’s signature a “certificate of acknowledgment” confirming that acknowledgment occurred.  5.67   The   formalities   involved   in   having   a   signature   notarized depend   on   the   jurisdiction.   In   Louisiana   and   civil-law countries, notaries perform a broader range of duties than do U.S. notaries public.  Signing a Contract Electronically  5.68   It’s becoming commonplace for parties to sign a contract electronically, using an electronic process associated with the contract. (This is different from scanning your signature to create an electronic “signature stamp.”) Electronic signatures generally include the date of signing.  5.69   If signing a contract electronically is optional rather than mandatory, retain the standard concluding clause (see 5.4) and dated signature blocks (see 5.39), and the boilerplate language recommended in 5.6. But if signing electronically is mandatory,   it   would   make   sense   to   dispense   with   the signature blocks and use this form of concluding clause:   Each party is signing this agreement electronically on the date stated in that party’s electronic signature.  Having Legal Counsel Sign  5.70   An   unusual   aspect   of   settlement   agreements   is   that sometimes they contain, under the notation   APPROVED AS TO FORM AND CONTENT , signature blocks for legal counsel to   the   parties.   It   seems   odd   to   have   attorneys   formally approve   a   settlement   agreement.   It’s   the   parties   who   are agreeing   to   settle—they   don’t   need,   and   shouldn’t   seek, attorney approval. If the aim is to show that the parties had",
  "the advice of attorneys, it would make more sense to have the parties state as much in the settlement agreement.  CONSENTS  5.71   The signature blocks of a contract might be followed by a consent—referred to as such or as an “acknowledgment”—in which nonparties consent to something provided for in the contract.   A   contract   restructuring   Acme’s   indebtedness   to Widgetco might contain, after the signature blocks, a consent signed by guarantors of Acme’s debt. Strictly speaking, such a consent might be unnecessary, because guarantees usually provide that the underlying debt may be modified without the guarantor’s consent.  BLANK SPACE AFTER THE BODY OF THE CONTRACT  5.72   When a page break would otherwise cause the concluding clause and the signature blocks to be spread over two pages, it’s neater to make sure that they stay together on a single page. But this can put the concluding clause at the top of a page, with the previous page occupied by the end of the body of the contract followed by an expanse of blank space. This can also occur when the concluding clause and signature blocks are kept on a separate page so a signer can sign in advance and not have that signature page rendered obsolete by later revisions. (Take care that this practice doesn’t result in someone signing a contract without being aware of the most recent changes.) Either way, such blank space might be disconcerting to the reader, so you might want to add this notation   after   the   end   of   the   body   of   the   contract:  [SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS] .  GIVING THE SIGNATURE PAGE AN IDENTIFYING NOTATION  5.73   As an alternative to the approach suggested in 5.28, you can avoid the risk of misidentifying a signature page by stating at",
  "the   bottom   of   the   signature   page   the   type   of   agreement involved, including as necessary the date and one or more party   names:   [Signature   page   to   Acme   Corporation   credit agreement dated 17 July 2017] .  5.74   A bottom-of-the-page notation is particularly useful when the signature blocks occupy more than one page, so you wouldn’t   have   the   benefit   of   the   concluding   clause   to identify any signature pages other than the first.  ATTACHMENTS Kinds of Attachments  5.75   Contracts   feature   two   kinds   of   attachments,   those   that consist of stand-alone documents and those that consist of information that could have been included in the body of the contract but instead was moved to an attachment. It’s helpful to use different terms to describe the two kinds of attachment.  5.76   In   the   United   States,   the   prevailing   but   not   universal convention is to use   exhibits   for attachments consisting of stand-alone   documents   and   schedules   for   attachments containing   information.   This   manual   follows   that convention.   Other   jurisdictions   might   use   different terminology. For example, the convention in Australian is to use   annexure   instead of   exhibit .  5.77   Instead of   exhibit   or   schedule   you can use   appendix ,   annex , or  attachment , which are generic terms for attachments.  5.78   If a contract has only a few attachments, don’t feel you have to observe the distinction between exhibits and schedules—it can   be   awkward   to   refer   to,   say,   three   exhibits   and   one schedule   rather   than   simply   four   exhibits   or   four attachments.  Placement of Attachments",
  "5.79   In   a   contract   that   contains   both   schedules   and   exhibits, reader convenience suggests putting the schedules before the exhibits:   the   body   of   the   contract   and   the   schedules constitute two parts of a single text, and readers are likely to flip to the schedules more often than to the exhibits.  5.80   In the United States, the convention is to place schedules and   exhibits   after   the   signatures,   but   other   jurisdictions might   observe   different   conventions.   For   example,   in Australia it’s standard practice to place the signature pages after the schedules but before the exhibits (or annexures, to use the Australian term), perhaps as a way of acknowledging that the body of the contract and the schedules constitute a single text. But that makes for an abrupt transition between the body of the contract and the schedules and makes it harder to find the signature page.  References to Attachments  5.81   When referring to an attachment, don’t use   hereto , as in   a copy of which is attached as   exhibit B hereto —it’s unnecessary to do so, because it would be unreasonable to think that the attachment is an attachment to some other contract.  5.82   Drafters often emphasize references to attachments, but it serves no purpose to do so—readers generally don’t seek out references   to   attachments.   (Regarding   what   text   to emphasize,   see   16.18.)   And   it’s   pointless   to   put   the enumeration in quotation marks, as in   exhibit “A” .  5.83   Don’t   use   initial   capitals   in   contract   references   to attachments, as in   as stated in Schedule 4.2 . Instead, follow the recommended   practice   in   general   writing   and   use   all- lowercase letters in referring to attachments, as in   as stated in schedule 4.2   (see 17.34).  Enumerating Attachments",
  "5.84   Enumerating   attachments   serves   two   functions.   First,   the number or letter used in referring to a particular attachment tells readers where they can expect to find it among the schedules or exhibits.  5.85   Enumerating attachments can also tell readers where in the body of the contract they could find at least one reference to that attachment. That could be useful for a reader who goes to an attachment and wants to return to the related provision but doesn’t recall the section number.  5.86   When a contract is divided into articles and so uses the multiple-numeration system for section numbers (see 4.16), you can have attachment enumeration serve both functions by using for each schedule and exhibit the number of the section that refers to it. If more than one section refers to a particular schedule or exhibit, use the number of the section with the primary reference.  5.87   Even if a contract isn’t divided into articles and so doesn’t use   the   multiple-numeration   system,   you   could   still enumerate schedules and exhibits using section numbers. But that could cause reader miscues: A reader who consults a schedule and notes that it’s schedule 10 wouldn’t be able to tell whether the schedules were keyed to section numbers or simply   numbered   consecutively.   Figuring   the   system   out might require flipping through the contract. Furthermore, someone   who   encounters   in   the   body   of   the   contract   a reference to schedule 10 wouldn’t be able to tell from that alone whether it comes after schedule 9 or might come after a schedule bearing a lower, nonconsecutive number.  5.88   This confusion would also occur if in a contract not divided into articles you were to enumerate schedules and exhibits with consecutive numbers. Using consecutive letters ( A ,   B ,   C ) instead would prevent miscues of this sort.  5.89   There   are   other   advantages   and   disadvantages   to   the different   systems   of   enumerating   attachments.   If   you   use section   numbers,   you   wouldn’t   have   to   renumber",
  "attachments if a new attachment is inserted for a section. But if a new section is inserted, that would change the section number used for each attachment that follows (in a contract not divided into articles) or each attachment that follows in that article (in a contract divided into articles). On the other hand,   if   you   use   consecutively   numbered   attachments, adding a new attachment would require renumbering those that follow. But attachments are usually compiled after the contract has been finalized, so these considerations shouldn’t weigh heavily. Also, using section numbers for attachments means   you   wouldn’t   know   from   looking   at   a   list   of attachments whether one was missing. But that too wouldn’t seem a compelling factor.  5.90   In contracts divided into articles, you could use a hybrid system for enumerating attachments, with schedules using section numbers and exhibits using consecutive letters. A hybrid   system   would   have   the   advantage   of   preventing confusion between, say, schedule 3.2 and exhibit 3.2. As it is, exhibits aren’t often keyed to multiple-numeration section numbers.   You   could   also   use   a   hybrid   system   for enumerating   attachments   in   contracts   not   divided   into articles,   with   schedules   using   consecutive   numbers   and exhibits   using   consecutive   letters.   That   would   prevent confusion between, say, attachment 1 and exhibit 1, if that’s a concern.  Exhibits  5.91   An exhibit is a stand-alone document. It can be a document that’s   currently   in   effect,   such   as   the   organizational documents   of   Target   Co.   attached   as   exhibits   to   an acquisition agreement. Or it can be a document that’s to be effective after signing, such as an ancillary contract to be entered into at the closing of the transaction provided for in the attaching contract. For example, someone selling all the stock of their company might require as a condition to the sale that at closing they and the company enter into an",
  "employment agreement in the form attached as an exhibit to the stock purchase agreement.  5.92   When in the body of the contract you refer to a form of document attached as an exhibit, use   in the form of exhibit A  rather than the more long-winded   in the form attached as exhibit   A   hereto .   An   exhibit   is   by   definition   attached,   so  attached   is unnecessary.  Schedules  5.93   Schedules consist of materials that could be included in the body of the contract but instead have been moved to after the signature blocks.  DISCLOSURE   SCHEDULES  5.94   One kind of schedule is that containing factual information, such as details of ongoing litigation or lists of contracts; such schedules are often called “disclosure schedules.” Link each disclosure   schedule   to   the   contract   provision   to   which   it relates (usually a statement of fact) by indicating in that provision that   stated in schedule X   are all instances of the thing at issue (or that   schedule X contains a list   of all such instances). Alternatively, indicate that other than as stated in the schedule there are no such instances; this approach is generally used when the thing at issue is either undesirable or present in limited quantities.  5.95   Disclosure   schedules   are   used   for   four   reasons.   First,   the information   in   schedules   is   often   sufficiently   voluminous that it would be awkward to include it in the body of the contract.  5.96   Second, it’s often the case that the party responsible for collecting factual information isn’t the party whose attorneys are drafting the contract, so it simplifies matters to present that information separately.",
  "5.97   Third, even if the party collecting the information is also the party responsible for drafting, collecting information about a company’s operations involves a different process, perhaps a different time frame, and usually different personnel than does drafting and negotiating the contract.  5.98   And fourth, if the information to be disclosed to the other side is sensitive, putting it in a set of schedules can help minimize   the   risk   of   wider   disclosure,   as   schedules   are routinely omitted from drafts circulated for review. Also, Item 601(b)(2) of Regulation S-K under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 allows schedules to merger agreements to be omitted from filing and disclosure, unless they contain information material to an investment decision and that information isn’t otherwise   disclosed   in   the   agreement   or   the   disclosure document.  5.99   If a section refers to information on a schedule but it’s later determined   that   no   such   information   is   required,   it’s preferable to delete the reference to that schedule rather than force readers to flip to a schedule page that states   None   or   Not applicable .  5.100   Put in the body of the contract, not on a cover sheet to the disclosure   schedules,   provisions   governing   the   effect   of disclosure schedules. They’re provisions like any other, so the best place for them is the body of the contract. (See also 5.101.)  PLACING   CONTRACT   SECTIONS   IN   SCHEDULES  5.101   Don’t   place   contract   sections   in   a   schedule,   as   doing   so makes it less convenient to refer to them. In particular, don’t place contentious provisions in a schedule to “bury” them (see 4.89). And don’t shunt ostensibly routine provisions into schedules; they would be sufficiently out of the way if placed at the end of the body of the contract.  5.102   But if you wish to incorporate into a negotiated contract standardized provisions that aren’t subject to negotiation,",
  "sometimes   the   simplest   course   is   to   relegate   them   to   a schedule.   In   effect,   you’re   “frontloading”   not   only   the provisions   subject   to   negotiation   but   also   the   signature blocks (see 4.96). Also, if a contract is sufficiently long and complex, some drafters prefer to place the definition section in a schedule that you can pull out and review side by side with the rest of the contract. (But see 6.95–.97 regarding placement of the definition section.) And if any deal terms— such as pricing information—are particularly sensitive, some drafters place them in a schedule to minimize the risk of wider disclosure (see 5.98).  IN ,   NOT   ON  5.103   It’s worthwhile to make a principled decision regarding even minor issues, for example whether to say   in schedule X   or   on schedule X . Since   in   works in all circumstances, it’s the better choice.  5.104   For referring to information stated in a work, use of the preposition   on   is   generally   limited   to   references   to   a particular   page— the   information   stated   on   page   43 .   That’s understandable, because a page is a single surface. Otherwise, use   in — the information stated in   [ section 4.3 ]   [ chapter 6 ].  5.105   As in the case of a section, a schedule might occupy one page, but it could just as well occupy more than one page. It would be odd to adjust one’s prepositions based on how long a schedule is. Because   in   works   no   matter   how   long   the schedule, it’s the better choice.  Attachments as Part of a Contract  5.106   Although   many   drafters   assume   otherwise,   generally   it’s unnecessary to state explicitly that attachments to a contract constitute part of that contract. Any attachment to a contract would be mentioned in the body of the contract, and that reference by itself would be all that’s required to bring the attachment within the scope of the contract.",
  "5.107   So omit anything that seeks to make attachments part of the contract. Here are some examples:  Schedule A constitutes a part of this agreement. All exhibits referenced in this agreement are made a part of this agreement. All exhibits and schedules annexed hereto are expressly made a part of this agreement as though fully set forth herein. This agreement (including any exhibits and schedules hereto) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto.  5.108   See 2.127 and 13.388 for two other techniques that drafters use, unnecessarily, to make attachments part of the contract.  5.109   But make an exception for contracts with self-contained sets of provisions placed in schedules. Contracts with a “master” agreement structure (see 4.98) can feature such schedules. Because the body of the contract doesn’t otherwise mention those   schedules,   to   make   them   part   of   the   contract   it’s necessary   to   state   in   the   body   of   the   contract   that   the schedules constitute part of the contract.  Virtual Attachments  5.110   Sometimes it’s useful to make an ancillary document part of a contract without physically attaching it. This manual uses the term “virtual attachment” to describe any such ancillary document. An employment agreement might include as a virtual   attachment   the   company’s   employee   handbook;   a commercial contract might include as a virtual attachment a web page containing general terms.  MAKING   VIRTUAL   ATTACHMENTS   PART   OF   A   CONTRACT  5.111   To make sure that a court considers a virtual attachment to be part of a contract, say that the virtual attachment is part of the contract.",
  "5.112   Don’t   say   that   the   contract   is   subject   to   the   virtual attachment, as a court might hold that   subject to   fails to adequately express an intention to be bound by the virtual attachment. See   Affinity Internet ,   Inc. v. Consolidated Credit Counseling Services, Inc. , 920 So. 2d 1286 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006). And don’t simply say that the virtual attachment can be found on a specified web page. See   Manasher v. NECC Telecom ,   No.   06-10749,   2007   WL   2713845   (E.D.   Mich. 18 Sept. 2007).  5.113   Also, be cautious about using definitions to bring a virtual attachment within the scope of a contract:  “ Support Services ” means Product support services described in the description of support services provided at the Acme Licenses website (http://www.acme.com/licenses) at any given time.  5.114   Acme’s counsel might think this a low-key way to introduce Acme’s ability to unilaterally amend a virtual attachment (see 5.115),   but   it’s   sufficiently   wishy-washy   that   one   could imagine   a   court   holding   that   the   description   of   support services doesn’t in fact constitute part of the contract.  AMENDING   VIRTUAL   ATTACHMENTS  5.115   A   contentious   issue   relating   to   virtual   attachments   is whether   a   party   may   unilaterally   amend   a   virtual attachment. A related issue is whether one party must notify the other of any such amendment, and if so, how. Discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this manual.",
  "DEFINED TERMS  6.1   A   contract   usually   contains   terms   for   which   it   provides definitions.   Those   terms   are   called   “defined   terms.” Definitions of defined terms are either autonomous (see 6.28) or integrated (see 6.61).  PURPOSE  6.2   A defined term makes a contract easier to read by allowing the drafter to use throughout the contract the shorter defined term instead of the longer definition. It also ensures that whatever is defined is expressed consistently throughout the contract.  THE NATURE OF DEFINED TERMS  6.3   Defined   terms   are   almost   always   nouns—both   common ( employee ) and proper ( Smith )—and noun phrases ( material adverse   change ),   although   occasionally   one   sees   a   verb ( transfer ) or even a prepositional phrase ( to Acme’s knowledge ).  6.4   If the defined term is a common noun, use the singular form when defining it, unless it’s simpler to use the plural form; see, for example, how the term   the Hastings Parties   is defined in sample 1. Defining a term in the singular and using it in the   plural,   or   vice   versa,   wouldn’t   confuse   a   reasonable reader, so no purpose would be served by addressing this practice in an internal rule of interpretation (see 15.22). And nothing is gained by using both the singular and plural form",
  "when defining a term, as in   “Note” and “Notes” mean   ... and as in   each a “Member” and, collectively, the “Members” .  6.5   Don’t use as alternative defined terms both a word or phrase and   an   initialism   or   abbreviation,   as   in   “Customer Service Request” or “CSR” means   ... . Simplicity favors using one or the   other;   choosing   between   them   involves   balancing readability and concision.  6.6   To allow the reader to recognize defined terms, use initial capitals to distinguish defined terms from words for which the contract doesn’t provide a definition. Do so even if the defined term is a routine one such as   Person   or   Subsidiary . Don’t   use   anything   more   emphatic—bold,   italics,   or   all capitals—every   time   you   use   a   defined   term,   because   it’s distracting.  6.7   Don’t make exceptions to using initial capitals to distinguish defined terms. If a contract contains many instances of a defined term, that can make the contract harder to read (see 6.51), but not using initial capitals in stating that defined term could confuse readers. A better fix would be to find a way to omit that defined term.  6.8   Provide definitions for all initialisms, even those that are widely known, for example   SEC , meaning the U.S. Securities and   Exchange   Commission.   Contract   drafting   is   most efficient   when   you   apply   an   approach   consistently—it complicates   matters   if   the   drafter   makes   judgment   calls regarding whether the meaning of a particular initialism is obvious. And if drafters dispense with particular definitions, at   some   point   you   can   expect   reader   confusion,   either because a contract might have a broader readership than expected or because the drafter had an expansive notion of what terms have an obvious meaning.  ABBREVIATIONS AS DEFINED TERMS",
  "6.9   Using abbreviations as defined terms offers economy. You can use acronyms or initialisms. According to   The Chicago Manual of Style , at 10.2, “The word   acronym   refers to terms based on the initial letters of their various elements and read as   single   words   (AIDS,   laser,   NASA,   scuba),”   whereas “ initialism   refers to terms read as a series of letters (IRS, NBA, XML).”   ERISA   is an example of an acronym one often sees in contracts;   SEC   is an example of an initialism.  6.10   When an abbreviation follows an indefinite article (in other words, acts as a common noun, not a proper noun), whether you use   a   or   an   as the indefinite article is determined by how the first syllable is sounded.  6.11   Consider the defined term   SOW   (meaning a statement of work issued under the contract in question). If treated as an acronym, it’s likely that   SOW   would be sounded so it rhymes with   now   (as   opposed   to   rhyming   with   doe ).   It   seems unpromising   to   use   as   an   important   contract   term   a homophone for the word for a female pig, but some people do use   SOW   as an acronym. In that case, it would begin with a consonant sound, so you’d say   a SOW . If it’s treated as an initialism, it would begin with the same vowel sound as   egg . It follows that you’d say   an SOW .  6.12   When used to excess, acronyms and initialisms can turn contracts into alphabet soup. See 2.102, 2.128, and 9.79.  SELECTING DEFINED TERMS  6.13   If you wish to create a defined term to express a particular meaning and it’s conventional to use a particular defined term—such as   Business Day ,   the Code ,   GAAP ,   Indemnifiable Losses —to express that meaning or something close to it, use the   conventional   defined   term.   Contract   drafting   favors predictability over novelty.  6.14   If you use a conventional defined term but you give it a definition   that’s   unorthodox,   alert   the   reader   to   that   by",
  "modifying   the   defined   term   appropriately.   For   example, instead of   Net Operating Income   use   Adjusted Net Operating Income .  6.15   If you need to create a defined term for a definition that’s unique to a particular transaction, use a term that’s concise yet informative. Your choice of defined term will in part depend   on   what’s   required   to   distinguish   it   from   other defined terms used in that contract. The term   the Property  might work as the defined term for a property in Acmetown if   that   property   is   the   only   property   involved   in   the transaction. If other properties are involved, you must be more specific and use as the defined term, say,   the Acmetown Property .   If   the   other   properties   include   other   Acmetown properties,   the 144 Ninth Street Acmetown Property   would be your best choice. The need to distinguish a defined term from other defined terms in a contract can require a defined term that’s a bit of a mouthful, such as   the PLM/Whitman Excluded Asset Proceeds .  6.16   See 2.90–.123   regarding   selecting   defined   terms   for   party names.  CIRCULAR DEFINITIONS  6.17   Dictionaries shouldn’t use in a definition the term being defined, as that constitutes a form of circular definition. For example, it would be unhelpful for a dictionary definition of  chair   to include the word   chair . But that doesn’t apply to contract definitions. In a contract, a defined term simply serves as a convenient substitute for the definition, and only for that contract. So repeating a contract defined term in the definition   is   unobjectionable.   An   example:   “Trademark” means a registered trademark or service mark or any trademark or service mark that is the subject of any application ,   registration ,   or renewal .  6.18   But contract definitions are prone to a different form of circular definition, in which concept A is defined in terms of",
  "concept   B   and   the   definition   of   concept   B   refers   either directly   or   indirectly   to   the   definition   of   concept   A.   An example would be defining an oak as a tree that grows from an acorn and defining an acorn as a nut produced by an oak.  6.19   These contract definitions are circular:  “ Bonus Date ” means a date on which Acme determines that a Bonus Period concludes. “ Bonus Period ” means a period that commences on a date determined by Acme and concludes on a Bonus Date.  6.20   Their combined effect is to make the first definition read as follows:  “ Bonus Date ” means a date on which Acme determines that a period that commences on a date determined by Acme and that concludes on a Bonus Date concludes.  6.21   And to make the second definition read as follows:  “ Bonus Period ” means a period that commences on a date determined by Acme and concludes on a date on which Acme determines that a Bonus Period concludes.  6.22   So a Bonus Date is a date of unknown significance, and a Bonus Period is a period of unknown significance. Because in each case the defined term is in effect also in the definition, you’re left chasing from one definition to the other, looking for meaning. The fix is to anchor one definition to some external reality.  6.23   Here’s another example of circular definitions:  “ Licensed Products ” means products that are within one or more claims of the Licensed Patents. “ Licensed Patents ” means any patents owned by the Licensor that claim any aspect of the Licensed Products.  OVERLAPPING DEFINITIONS",
  "6.24   Be alert to the possibility of overlapping definitions. For example,   if   a   contract   uses   the   defined   terms   Licensor ,  Software ,   and   Licensor   Software ,   a   reader   who   encounters  Licensor Software   away from its definition might mistakenly think that it’s a combination of the defined terms   Licensor  and   Software   and not its own defined term.  6.25   And if a contract uses the defined terms   Control   (relating to the   power   to   direct   management)   and   Change   of   Control  (relating   to   ownership   of   securities),   a   reader   might mistakenly think that the defined term   Change of Control  incorporates the defined term   Control , or wonder whether it does.  6.26   It might be difficult to come up with alternatives to   Control  and   Change of Control , but usually it should be possible to choose defined terms that eliminate any overlap.  TYPES OF DEFINITIONS  6.27   This   manual   calls   definitions   either   “autonomous”   or “integrated,” depending on how a definition is linked to its defined term.  Autonomous Definitions  6.28   An autonomous definition is linked to its defined term by a “definitional   verb.”   The   definition,   definitional   verb,   and defined   term   together   constitute   a   sentence,   but   for simplicity   this   manual   uses   the   term   “autonomous definition” also to refer to the entire sentence.  STRUCTURE  6.29   In autonomous definitions, the defined term can be placed after the definition, as in   Any such transfer is referred to in this agreement as a   “ Permitted Transfer . ”   But it’s more economical to   place   the   defined   term   before   the   definition,   as   in  “Exchange   Act”   means   the   Securities   Exchange   Act   of   1934 .",
  "(Using   an   integrated   definition   might   be   even   more economical.)  6.30   In an autonomous definition, don’t put the definite article  the   or the indefinite article   a   (or   an ) before the defined term. And it adds clutter to put   The term   before the defined term.  6.31   At   the   front   of   a   single   autonomous   definition,   add   the phrase   In this agreement , followed by a comma. Before a set of autonomous definitions, whether “on site” or in a definition section   (see   6.33),   say   In   this   agreement ,   the   following definitions apply , followed by a colon. It’s more efficient than wordier alternatives, such as   For purposes of this agreement ,   the following terms have the following meanings .  6.32   In a set of autonomous definitions, state each autonomous definition as a separate paragraph, without a first-line indent (see 16.55). Don’t add any additional text at the end of a paragraph constituting an autonomous definition. Put any set of autonomous definitions in alphabetical order. Don’t enumerate them—it wastes space and distracts the reader, because   alphabetical   order   by   itself   is   enough   of   an organizing framework. And don’t put a semicolon instead of a period at the end of autonomous definitions: it makes more sense to treat each autonomous definition as a sentence.  PLACEMENT  6.33   A single autonomous definition can be placed “on site” (see 6.88), either with other text in a section or subsection or, if it’s more than a couple of lines long, in its own subsection. Alternatively, it can be placed in a definition section (see 6.87).  6.34   A set of autonomous definitions can constitute the entire definition section or it can be placed on site, in its own subsection.  6.35   Autonomous definitions placed on site should follow, in a section, right after the provisions that use the terms being defined. Placing definitions before the provisions that use the",
  "defined terms would cause readers to wonder why they’re being provided the definitions. Placing definitions later in a section, separated by unrelated text from the provisions that use the defined terms, would force readers to work harder to consult the definitions.  EMPHASIS  6.36   Place in quotation marks and emphasize in bold a defined term linked to an autonomous definition—using quotation marks in this context is consistent with standard English, and using both conventions makes autonomous definitions easier to   spot.   Don’t   bold   the   quotation   marks.   (This   manual follows that convention for the samples and the indented examples of contract text, but in examples incorporated in regular paragraphs, any terms being defined aren’t stated in bold, to avoid distracting the reader.)  DEFINITIONAL   VERBS  6.37   If the definition gives the entire meaning of the defined term (in other words, if the definition is “full”), use   means   as the definitional verb.  6.38   Don’t use   mean   as the definitional verb:  “ Products ”   mean   [read   means ] the MegaSonic motors listed in exhibit A.  6.39   Drafters who use   mean   do so on the assumption that because the defined term is defined in the plural, the verb should be plural too. But that misconstrues the function of the defined term in an autonomous definition: the definition says what the word or phrase means, not what each individual element means.  6.40   An “enlarging” definition, which expresses only part of the intended meaning, uses   includes   as the definitional verb, and a “limiting” definition, which excludes something from the meaning of the defined term, uses   does not include . Enlarging and limiting definitions can create mischief, because they",
  "don’t state the full scope of the definition. For example, protracted litigation in the United States over “Bratz” dolls concerned in part whether the defined term “inventions,” as used in the employment agreement between Mattel and one of   the   litigants,   included   ideas.   The   definition   of “inventions” was an enlarging definition, because it used as the definitional verb “includes, but is not limited to”—hence the   potential   for   dispute.   See   Mattel ,   Inc.   v.   MGA Entertainment ,   Inc. , 616 F.3d 904, 909 (9th Cir. 2010).  6.41   Sometimes it’s useful to combine a full definition with an enlarging   definition   or   a   limiting   definition,   or   both:   W means X   [ and includes Y ] [ but does not include Z ] [ and includes Y but does not include Z ]. That avoids the uncertainty inherent in using enlarging and limiting definitions on their own. (For two contexts where it would be appropriate to use a full definition with a limiting definition, see 8.118 and 9.133.)  6.42   Don’t use   means and includes —as a matter of logic, it’s not feasible   to   express   complete   and   incomplete   meanings simultaneously.   And   don’t   use   includes   only ,   which   is equivalent to   means   but wordier and less clear.  6.43   Don’t   use   a   dash   instead   of   a   definitional   verb,   as   in  “ERISA”—the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 , because a dash is less precise than a definitional verb .   The same goes for using a colon instead of a definitional verb.  6.44   Use   the   definitional   verb   in   the   present   tense,   since definitional sentences are language of policy (see 3.307 and example [8-4]). No duty is being expressed, so don’t use   shall mean   instead of   means   (see 3.308).  THE   PART   OF   SPEECH   OF   THE   DEFINED   TERM  6.45   If the definitional verb is   means ,   includes , or   does not include , the part of speech of the defined term should match that of the   definition,   whether   verb,   adjective,   noun,   or   other. Otherwise, use   refers to .",
  "6.46   If the part of speech of the defined term doesn’t match that of the definition, usually it’s because the defined term is stated in more than one form, each one a different part of speech, as in   “Register”, “Registered”, and “Registration” refer to a   registration   effected   by   preparing   and   filing   a   registration statement under the 1933 Act   ... .  6.47   Another way to define different forms of a defined term is to handle each separately. Here are two ways to do that if the different forms are identical, which would be the case with the noun and verb forms of   Control   and   Transfer :  “[ Defined Term ]” means, when used as a noun, [first definition], and when used as a verb, [second definition]. “[ Defined Term ]” when used as a noun means [definition]. “[ Defined Term ]” when used as a verb has a corresponding meaning.  6.48   Omit from these examples the references to the parts of speech   if   the   different   forms   of   a   defined   term   aren’t identical,   which   would   be   the   case   with   the   noun  Commercialization   and the verb   Commercialize .  6.49   Yet another option would be to have an internal rule of interpretation (see 15.2) do the work:  If a term is defined as one part of speech (for example, a noun), it will have a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (for example, a verb).  6.50   But if an undefined related form of a word that is used as a defined term occurs in the same contract, this principle of interpretation could have unexpected consequences. It would be safer to state explicitly what the defined terms are.  6.51   Defining different forms of a defined term can add to a contract many instances of that defined term in its different forms. That can make a contract harder to read. If you have an alternative to defining different forms of a defined term, take advantage of it.",
  "“ STUFFED ”   DEFINITIONS  6.52   Don’t “stuff” or “load” autonomous definitions by including in them language better placed elsewhere.  6.53   One way to stuff a definition is to include in it language that couldn’t constitute part of the definition proper. A symptom of that is use of   shall ,   must ,   may , or   will   in an autonomous definition.   So   don’t   tack   on   to   the   definition   of   Acme Financial Statements   the clause   which Acme shall deliver no later than three months after the end of each Acme fiscal year . Instead, state that deadline elsewhere as language of obligation.  6.54   Here’s another example of a stuffed autonomous definition:  “ Alternative Clearing System ” means any clearing system designated by the Company and approved by the Trustee (any such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  6.55   In this case, the stuffing isn’t only the prohibition imposed on the trustee but also the requirement that the trustee have approved the company’s choice of clearing system. It would be clearer to address these issues in a substantive provision. One symptom of a stuffed definition is repetition in the substantive provisions of elements in the definition. In this case, some references to   Alternative Clearing System   in the substantive   provisions   were   accompanied   by   duplicative references to trustee approval.  6.56   Here’s a third example:  “ Committee ” means the Acme stock option committee composed of two or more members of the board of directors, which committee will be responsible for administering the Plan.  6.57   It would be preferable to limit the definition of   Committee   to “the Acme stock option committee” and address the makeup of the committee and its function in a substantive provision.  6.58   Stuffed   definitions   can   pervade   a   contract   if   the   drafter misguidedly thinks that it’s best for the operative provisions to appear simple yet be full of defined terms. The complexity",
  "is swept into definitions stuffed to the point of bursting. That imposes on the reader the awkward task of unpacking the complexity.  OTHER   MISUSE   OF   AUTONOMOUS   DEFINITIONS  6.59   Don’t include an integrated definition (see 6.61) within an autonomous definition, as in   “Effective Date” means the date on which the Registration Statement is declared effective by the Securities   and   Exchange   Commission   (the   “SEC”) .   Doing   so makes integrated definitions longer and harder to read. Also, a reader wouldn’t necessarily think to look in an autonomous definition for the definition of another term. It would be clearer to define the term   the SEC   elsewhere and use just the defined term in the autonomous definition.  6.60   Regarding using an autonomous definition to bring a virtual attachment within the scope of a contract, see 5.113–.114. And   consider   using   however referred to   as   a   way   to   avoid including many examples in an autonomous definition (see 1.50).  Integrated Definitions  6.61   The   alternative   to   autonomous   definitions   (see   6.28)   is “integrated” definitions.  STRUCTURE  6.62   Whereas an autonomous definition is a separate sentence, an integrated definition is part of a sentence included with the substantive provisions of a contract, with the defined term following the definition and in parentheses. An example:  Since 1 January 2017 ,   Dynaco has filed with the SEC all reports ,  proxy statements, forms ,   and other documents it has been required by law to file with the SEC (those documents ,   the “Dynaco SEC Documents”).   This   manual   refers   to   such   language   in parentheses as a “defined-term parenthetical.”",
  "6.63   If you put the defined-term parenthetical at the end of a list of items and syntactic ambiguity (see 12.1) makes it unclear which items constitute the definition, consider prefacing the list with   the following   plus a colon and putting the defined- term parenthetical before the colon. That would make the definition   the following , which is equivalent to the list of items.  6.64   Don’t introduce the defined term using a traditional word or phrase   such   as   hereafter   or   hereinafter   referred   to   as .   Such introductory text is redundant, because the parentheses and the emphasis used (see 6.68)   signal   that   a   term   is   being defined.  6.65   In contrast to autonomous definitions (see 6.28), include in a defined-term parenthetical the definite article   the   or the indefinite article   a   (or   an ), as appropriate. An article isn’t necessary unless the defined term is a common noun (see 6.3). You can omit the article from a common noun that’s a party-name defined term, although this manual recommends that you use an article (see 2.106). And if you do use the article with a party-name defined term, signal as much (for the benefit of anyone who’ll be negotiating or revising the contract)   by   including   the   article   in   the   defined-term parenthetical too.  6.66   It’s   awkward   to   put   a   defined-term   parenthetical   after   a possessive, as in   If a customer’s (a “Terminating Customer”) contract   with   Acme   terminates   ...   .   The   result   is   that   the definition   and   the   defined   term   aren’t   grammatically equivalent. Another example:   If Acme, Inc.’s and its affiliates’ (“Acme”) privacy practices   ... . (For another problem with that definition, see 2.95.)  6.67   Don’t put a defined-term parenthetical in a section heading. And don’t put another set of parentheses within a defined- term parenthetical.  EMPHASIS",
  "6.68   Place in quotation marks and state in bold any defined term that’s being defined in a defined-term parenthetical. Don’t bold the quotation marks. In general writing you can do without the quotation marks (see   The Chicago Manual of Style , at 10.3), but use them in contracts so the conventions used for   both   autonomous   and   integrated   definitions   are consistent (see 6.36). To avoid distracting the reader, in this manual   the   terms   defined   in   examples   incorporated   in regular   paragraphs   (as   opposed   to   the   samples   and   the indented examples of contract text) aren’t stated in bold.  6.69   Follow standard practice and exclude the definite article   the  and   the   indefinite   article   a   (or   an ),   if   present,   from   the quotation   marks.   One   could   put   the   article   within   the quotation marks, because it constitutes part of the defined term, but it makes sense to put within the quotation marks only what’s specific to that defined term.  WHERE   TO   PLACE   A   DEFINED - TERM   PARENTHETICAL  6.70   The   principal   source   of   confusion   regarding   integrated definitions is where to place the defined-term parenthetical and what it should consist of.  6.71   Don’t place the defined-term parenthetical in the middle of the definition, as in each of the following examples. Instead, put it at the end. In each example, the mislocated text is shown in strikethrough and the text in italics shows the preferred location.  The Company’s board of directors has received a written opinion (the “ Fairness Opinion ”) of the Financial Advisor stating that the proposed consideration to be received by the holders of Shares in connection with the Offer and the Merger is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Shares   (that opinion, the “ Fairness Opinion ”) . The Company will have an irrevocable and exclusive option (the “ Repurchase Option ”), for a period of 90 days from the Termination Date, to repurchase some or all of the Unvested",
  "Restricted Shares at the Repurchase Price   (that option, the “ Repurchase Option ”) . This amendment is effective on the first date (the “ Effective Date ”) on which all the following conditions are satisfied   (that date, the “ Effective Date ”) : ... . No later than 120 days after the Closing, the Company shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-1 (the “ New Registration Statement ”) registering for resale all Registrable Securities   (that registration statement, the “ New Registration Statement ”) . Acme shall maintain confidential all information it obtains from Widgetco (the “ Confidential Information ”) in the course of providing services under this agreement   (that information, the “ Confidential Information ”) .  6.72   Usually,   mid-definition   defined-term   parentheticals   are merely awkward, but sometimes they can change meaning. Take this example:  Schedule 3.12 contains an accurate list of all agreements, oral or written (“ Contracts ”), to which Dynaco is a party   (each such agreement, a “ Contract ”) .  6.73   As originally positioned, the defined term encompasses all agreements   regardless   of   the   identity   of   the   parties.   That might be appropriate in another contract, but in this case the drafter had intended that the defined term would encompass only Dynaco’s agreements.  6.74   Don’t place the defined term beyond the definition, as in these examples:  The lease for Blackacre   (the   “ Lease ” )   must be substantially in the form of exhibit B (the “ Lease ”). The purchase price for the Shares   (the   “ Purchase Price ” )   is $3 million (the “ Purchase Price ”).  6.75   Regarding   where   to   place   the   defined-term   parenthetical when creating the defined term for a party name, see 2.94.",
  "CLARIFYING   THE   SCOPE   OF   THE   DEFINITION  6.76   If it might be unclear how far back an integrated definition goes, include in the defined-term parenthetical, just before the defined term, a reference to the pertinent noun in the definition:   that   litigation,   the   “Acme   Litigation” ;   those documents ,   the “Dynaco SEC Documents” ;   each such consent ,   a “Required Consent”.   This manual refers to this technique as “clarifying the scope” of a definition. It’s featured in the examples in 6.71–.72.  6.77   If a definition consists of one or more of a set of enumerated clauses, make that clear in the defined-term parenthetical:  (the litigation listed in clauses (1) through (4) of this section 4(b), the “Acme Litigation”) .  COLLECTIVELY  6.78   If an integrated definition encompasses an entire string of nouns, you can help make that clear by adding the word  collectively   to the defined-term parenthetical, just before the defined term and after any language clarifying the scope of the definition (see 6.76): ...   relating to the confidential affairs of the Company, the Parent, and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the “Acme Entities”) .  BOOSTING   A   DEFINED   TERM  6.79   You can supplement an integrated definition and thereby change the meaning conveyed by the defined term by adding language—generally using   together with —to the defined-term parenthetical, just before the defined term and just after any language clarifying the scope of the definition (see 6.76) and the word   collectively   (see 6.78), if used. This manual refers to this practice as “boosting” a defined term. In this example, the boosting language is in italics:  ... the Companies’ officers, directors, financial advisors, accountants, attorneys, and other Affiliates (collectively,  together with the Company , the “ Company Group ”).",
  "6.80   For an example of inappropriate use of boosting, see 2.95.  STACKING   DEFINED   TERMS  6.81   You can define more than one term within a defined-term parenthetical   by   separating   the   defined   terms   with   a semicolon and clarifying the scope of each (see 6.76):   Parent, Sub, and Target are party to a merger agreement dated 3 October 2016 providing for acquisition of Target by Parent by means of a merger   of   Sub   into   Target   (that   agreement,   the   “Merger Agreement”; that merger, the “Merger”) . This manual refers to this practice as “stacking” defined terms.  6.82   Stacking more than two defined terms is cumbersome:   Roe desires to sell to Jones 5,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Acme Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Acme”; that common stock, the “Common Stock”; those shares, the “Shares”) . Instead, restructure the provision to define one or more terms separately.  6.83   You   can   boost   (see   6.79)   the   second   defined   term   in   a stacked set:   (the “Endorsement Agreement”; together with the PSB Purchase   Agreement   and   the   RCO   Purchase   Agreement,   the “Continuing Agreements”) .  MATCHING   THE   PARTS   OF   SPEECH  6.84   As   with   autonomous   definitions   (see   6.45),   in   integrated definitions the part of speech of the defined term should match that of the definition. Mismatch occurs more with integrated definitions than with autonomous definitions.  6.85   Here’s an example of such a mismatch:   At the Effective Time ,  Merger Sub will merge into Acme (the “Merger”).   It’s not clear what the definition is, because the preceding sentence uses the verb   merge   whereas the defined term is a noun. You can fix this by adding transition language before the defined term. In this case, revise the defined-term parenthetical to read as follows:   (the merger thus effected, the “Merger”).   That makes   the   definition   of   Merger   a   combination   of   the",
  "preceding sentence and the transition language. But perhaps curing   a   particular   mismatch   is   best   accomplished   by restructuring the provision or defining the term elsewhere.  WHICH TYPE OF DEFINITION TO USE  6.86   How to present a definition is in part a function of how long it is. If a definition is relatively succinct, it’s probably more efficient to present it as an integrated definition rather than as   an   autonomous   definition,   to   save   space   and   avoid disrupting the reading process unnecessarily. The longer the definition, the more   likely it   is that   it would   be best   to present it as an autonomous definition, to avoid clogging up the related provision. Another factor in determining which type of definition to use is whether the best place for a definition is “on site” or in a definition section, an issue discussed immediately below.  THE DEFINITION SECTION  6.87   A definition can be placed in a definition section, which lists autonomous   definitions   in   alphabetical   order   by   defined term. Use the heading   Definitions , and not   Glossary , which is less informative. In longer documents, the definition section can constitute an entire article, and in particularly lengthy contracts it can be many pages long. (Regarding language to introduce the autonomous definitions in a definition section, see 6.31.)  Versus Defining Terms On Site  6.88   Alternatively, you can create a defined term “on site” by placing   the   definition,   in   the   form   of   an   integrated   or autonomous definition, with a provision that uses the related defined term. An on-site autonomous definition can simply be a sentence among others in a section or subsection, or it can be placed in a separate subsection, either on its own or with   other   autonomous   definitions   (see   6.33–.34).   Either",
  "way, the autonomous definition should come right after the provision that uses the defined term—placing it before would likely puzzle readers (see 6.35).  6.89   Drafters   have   traditionally   favored   placing   definitions   in definition sections. That has the disadvantage of forcing any reader who encounters an unfamiliar defined term to turn to the definition section to read the definition of that term. From there, the reader might have to consult the definition of one or more other defined terms in the definition section before   resuming   reading.   In   a   document   with   many,   or complex, defined terms, this flipping back and forth can disrupt one’s reading.  6.90   But the definition section serves a purpose, in that it reduces clutter that would otherwise be caused by defining on site a term that readers likely know the meaning of. So deciding which terms can be placed in a definition section involves assessing   the   extent   to   which   they   can   be   understood independently of their definition.  6.91   Readers   can   be   counted   on   to   know   the   meaning   of initialisms of relevant government agencies (for example, in the United States,   the SEC   and   the IRS ), relevant statutes (for example, in the United States,   ERISA ), and a basic business term such as   GAAP , meaning “generally accepted accounting principles.”  6.92   Somewhat less inherently comprehensible are defined terms with definitions that can vary somewhat from transaction to transaction—defined terms such as   Affiliate ,   Lien ,   Government Authority ,   Business Day , and   Subsidiary . To know the exact meaning of such a defined term you would need to read the definition, but the defined term on its own gives a good general   sense   of   its   meaning.   It’s   unlikely   that   your understanding of the provisions in which such a defined term   occurs   would   be   meaningfully   compromised   if   you haven’t yet read the definition.",
  "6.93   At the other end of the spectrum are defined terms such as  Equity   Infusion   or   Excess   Insurance   Proceeds —defined   terms with a definition that is unique to the transaction, so the defined   term   can’t   be   understood   without   consulting   the definition.  6.94   Define in the definition section terms in the first category (6.91) and second category (6.92), so they don’t unnecessarily clutter up the text. Define on-site terms in the third category (6.93), so they’re readily accessible to the reader.  Where to Place the Definition Section  6.95   The definition section has traditionally been placed at the beginning of the body of the contract. This is inconsistent with the notion that provisions that are more important should come first (see 4.84). Readers generally turn first to the   deal   provisions   rather   than   slogging   through   the definitions, and those who tackle the definitions head-on would likely need to reread them when they encounter, often many pages later, the provisions using the defined terms.  6.96   If you pare the definition section down to terms that are inherently familiar, no justification remains for keeping it at the   beginning   of   the   body   of   the   contract,   since   readers would   need   to   refer   to   it   only   to   fine-tune   their understanding. You can safely move a pared-down definition section toward the back of the contract, to the boilerplate. When purged of terms best defined on site, the definition section might be slight enough to consist of a single section rather   than   an   entire   article.   In   fact,   it   might   be   slight enough for you to dispense with a definition section entirely and   define   on   site   those   few   defined   terms   that   would otherwise have been defined in the definition section.  6.97   It’s best not to place the definition section in an attachment (see 5.101). Offering readers the convenience of being able to pull out the definition section and read it side by side with the rest of the contract is trivial compared with putting on",
  "site, with the relevant provisions, the definitions that readers would need to consult.  The Two-Column Definition Section  6.98   In   contracts   drafted   in   Commonwealth   countries,   the definition section is commonly presented in two columns, with   the   defined   terms   in   the   first   column   and   the definitions in the second column. This manual recommends not using a two-column format for the definition section.  6.99   The rationale for the two-column format is that keeping the defined term apart from the rest of the definition makes it easier to scan through the defined terms and find the one you’re looking for. (If you use a paragraph structure and the definition is more than one line long, the defined term will have text immediately below it.)  6.100   One version of the two-column format omits the definitional verb,   making   it   implicit   that   means   is   the   connection between the first column and the second column. But that precludes using other definitional verbs, including   refers to  (see 6.45).  6.101   If you use the definitional verb with the two-column format, whatever   nominal   advantage   is   presented   by   stating   the defined term free of any surrounding text is offset by the awkwardness of chopping a sentence in two.  6.102   The   two-column   definition   section   is   consistent   with   an approach to layout that places undue emphasis on breaking up text (see 4.73).  CROSS-REFERENCES TO DEFINITIONS  6.103   Cross-referencing in general is discussed in 4.100–.114, but it also applies to definitions.  The Index of Definitions",
  "6.104   Definition sections have traditionally been used to provide, besides definitions, cross-references to sections where other terms are defined. But definition sections aren’t suited to this task. The cross-references are rather cumbersome (the typical format is   “Material Permits” has the meaning given that term in section 3.4 ). And because the cross-references are interspersed with   autonomous   definitions   and   occur   throughout   the definition section, it’s likely that any reader consulting the definition section to see where a particular term is defined would have to flip through some pages.  6.105   A more efficient vehicle for helping readers quickly find their way around definitions is an index of definitions that lists the defined terms in two columns in alphabetical order and indicates   the   page   where   the   definition   of   each   term   is located.   (A   page   number   is   more   useful   than   a   section number, because readers told the page on which a section occurs would be able to turn to it more quickly than they would   if   they   were   given   just   the   section   number.   Also, sections routinely occupy more than one page.)  6.106   The conventional term for such indexes is “index of defined terms.” But seeing as they don’t state the page number of each   page   where   a   defined   term   is   used,   “index   of definitions” is a more accurate term.  6.107   Place an index of definitions after the table of contents (see 2.217).   If   a   contract   is   too   short   to   warrant   a   table   of contents, you can assume that it’s also too short to warrant an index of definitions.  6.108   You could instead place an index of definitions at the end of a definition section and include only those terms defined on site. But such an index would be less accessible and less useful than a comprehensive index of definitions placed after the table of contents, so this option is perhaps best reserved for those times when you want to use an index of definitions even though the contract doesn’t have a table of contents.",
  "6.109   Generate   an   index   of   definitions   using   Microsoft   Word’s indexing feature. As with any word-processing function that uses   field   codes,   ensuring   that   an   index   of   definitions remains   accurate   through   the   drafting   and   negotiating process usually requires that one person retain control of the draft (see 4.113).  Referring to the Definition Section  6.110   If a definition section is located someplace other than at the beginning of the body of the contract (see 6.95), the first section of the contract sometimes states that all or some defined terms are defined in a specified section, namely the definition   section.   Such   provisions   run   counter   to   the principle that more-important provisions should come before less-important provisions (see 4.84). And such a provision would serve little purpose if, as recommended in 6.91, the definition section contains only definitions of terms with inherently   familiar   meanings.   Omit   such   provisions   and instead include in longer contracts an index of definitions.  If a Defined Term Is Used Before It Is Defined  6.111   Convention has it that a defined term should be defined where it’s first used, so the reader doesn’t have to flip pages looking for the definition. But in contracts that follow that convention, sometimes a defined term is used upstream of the definition, perhaps because the first use of that defined term   is   an   incidental   one.   And   sometimes   revisions   to   a contract result in a defined term being inserted upstream of its definition and it’s not thought worthwhile to relocate the definition. In such situations it’s commonplace to add in parentheses,   after   the   first   use   of   the   defined   term,   the unhelpfully imprecise   as defined below , the more precise   as defined in section X , or some variant.  6.112   The   problem   with   this   approach   is   that   it   assumes   that readers start at the top of the contract and work their way",
  "methodically   through   to   the   end.   Instead,   it’s   likely   that most readers skim through the text and focus on whichever provisions are of interest to them.  6.113   This has two implications. First, defining a term when it’s first used doesn’t necessarily help readers. Unless it makes more sense to define it in a definition section (see 6.91), define a term on site, right after the provision that makes the most extensive use of that defined term (see 6.88).  6.114   Second,   parenthetical   cross-references   to   where   a   term   is defined are of little value. For readers jumping from one provision to another, it would be a matter of chance whether any such parentheticals happen to be of use. Also, it’s tedious to have to check drafts to ensure that every defined term that precedes its definition is given a cross-reference the first time it’s used. One could include many more such cross-reference parentheticals, but they would clog up the contract. Instead, in general drop such cross-references in favor of an index of definitions, if appropriate (see 6.104), using them only when, in the absence of an index of definitions, a defined term stranded in a far corner of the contract might have a reader wondering where it’s defined.  USE DEFINED TERMS EFFICIENTLY  6.115   Don’t create a defined term if you don’t use it after having defined it. And usually it’s not worthwhile to create a defined term if you use it only once or twice. Defined terms make prose harder to read, and creating a defined term adds clutter, so create a defined term only if the efficiencies it offers more than offset the drawbacks.  6.116   But a concept might be sufficiently complex that the only sensible course is to state it separately as an autonomous definition—even if it’s only used once—rather than working it into a provision.",
  "6.117   Also, if in revising a template contract for a transaction you delete all but one or two instances of a defined term, it might not be worthwhile to go back and eliminate that defined term on grounds of insufficient use.  6.118   Be alert to provisions that don’t reflect the full meaning of a defined term. For example, in a reference to   Change in Control of   the   Company ,   the   words   of   the   Company   would   be redundant   if,   as   is   usually   the   case,   Change   of   Control   is defined with respect to the Company.  LOOKING TO DICTIONARIES FOR DEFINITIONS  6.119   Some contracts tell readers to consult a dictionary. Here are two examples:  [T]erms not defined in this agreement have the meaning ordinarily ascribed to them in the Oxford English Dictionary (Second Edition). All words, unless otherwise specifically defined in this agreement, have their ordinary meanings as set forth in any dictionary of American English in common usage; there are no secret or code words.  6.120   But seeking to attribute meaning to basic words divorced of any context is unpromising.  6.121   Some contracts that state that a dictionary is to be used to determine the meaning of specific terms:  The Employee shall not make any disparaging comments, whether oral, written or via any web-based or social media vehicle, to anyone about Acme, any of its executives or employees, or its products or services, as the term “disparage” and “disparaging” is set forth in any dictionary of English or of law.  6.122   It’s hard to imagine a court willingly limiting itself to what a dictionary says regarding the meaning of a legal term of art like   disparage .",
  "SOURCES OF UNCERTAIN MEANING IN CONTRACT LANGUAGE  7.1   Confusing contract language leads to uncertain meaning, and uncertain meaning can lead to disputes. This chapter provides an introduction to the different kinds of uncertain meaning in contract language, in particular ambiguity and vagueness.  7.2   Chapter 1 considers the characteristics of optimal contract language. This chapter 7 might seem the reverse image of chapter 1, with deviation from the characteristics of optimal contract language creating the different kinds of uncertain meaning. But the connection is less clear cut than that. Some of the characteristics of optimal contract language—notably omitting   archaisms—relate   primarily   to   making   contract prose easier to read rather than avoiding uncertain meaning. And not all sources of uncertain meaning are a function of suboptimal   contract   language.   For   example,   two   separate provisions in a contract might be models of clarity, but if they conflict, the result is uncertain meaning.  7.3   Uncertain   meaning   in   contract   language   arises   from   five sources—ambiguity,   failure   to   be   sufficiently   specific, mistake, conflict, failure to address an issue, and vagueness. The first four are pernicious, whereas the last—vagueness—is an essential drafting tool when used with restraint.  7.4   Courts tend to attribute all instances of uncertain meaning to   ambiguity—witness   how   Black’s   Law   Dictionary   defines  ambiguity   in part as “Doubtfulness or uncertainty of meaning",
  "or intention, as in a contractual term or statutory provision.” But the sources of uncertainty operate differently from each other. Lump them together and you risk misunderstanding them.  AMBIGUITY  7.5   For linguists, text is ambiguous if it’s capable of conveying two   or   more   inconsistent   meanings.   If   some   who   read   a contract provision think it means one thing and others think it means something else, that provision is ambiguous.  7.6   Some   who   work   with   contracts   are   partial   to   “creative ambiguity”—the   practice   of   deliberately   including   in   a contract an ambiguous provision, with the aim of permitting the client to invoke, after signing, the hidden, alternative meaning if doing so would offer an advantage.  7.7   But such gamesmanship seems antithetical to a successful contract relationship, and it might violate lawyer ethics rules. And if the other side thinks a provision means one thing, and you’re aware of that and do nothing to suggest that the provision means anything else, then a court might hold that that precludes you from arguing that the provision means something else. See, e.g.,   United Rentals ,   Inc. v. RAM Holdings Inc. ,   937   A.2d   810,   836   (Del.   Ch.   2007)   (invoking   “the forthright negotiator principle,” namely that “a court may consider the subjective understanding of one party that has been   objectively   manifested   and   is   known   or   should   be known by the other party”).  7.8   Different kinds of ambiguity occur in contracts. Some are addressed elsewhere in this manual: for discussion of ambiguity in references to time, see chapter 10 for discussion of the ambiguity this manual considers under the rubric “the part versus the whole,” see chapter 11",
  "for discussion of syntactic ambiguity, which arises principally out of the order in which words and phrases are used and how they relate to each other, see chapter 12 for ambiguity associated with language of discretion, see 3.201–.214  7.9   Three other kinds of ambiguity are discussed in the following sections.  Lexical Ambiguity  7.10   Lexical ambiguity occurs when a word has more than one meaning.   One   form   of   lexical   ambiguity   is   homonymy, which occurs when words have identical forms but unrelated meanings. An example is   bank , which might mean a financial institution   or   the   bank   of   a   river.   Given   the   unrelated meanings, homonymy is unlikely to cause to confusion—the context   allows   readers   to   determine   which   meaning   is intended.   That’s   particularly   the   case   in   the   limited   and stylized context of contracts.  7.11   The other kind of lexical ambiguity, polysemy, occurs when a   word   has   lexical   senses   that   relate   to   the   same   basic meaning of the word as it occurs in different contexts. To expand on the example above,   bank   can mean a financial institution or a building that houses a financial institution. Those meanings are complementary.  7.12   Lexical ambiguity occurs in some words and phrases that are standard in contracts, for example   represents   (see 3.374),   best efforts   (see chapter 8),   material   (see 9.7–.23),   year   (see 10.92), and   willful   (see 13.896). Another example is   foreclosure : does it refer to foreclosure proceedings or to a foreclosure sale? See  Provident Bank v. Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Co. , 234 F. App’x 393 (6th Cir. 2007) (holding that it was unclear whether   the   term   foreclosure   referred   to   foreclosure proceedings or to a foreclosure sale).",
  "7.13   To eliminate lexical ambiguity, make clear which meaning you have in mind, either by stating that meaning instead of using the ambiguous word or phrase or by using a defined term. For routine instances of lexical ambiguity, applying the fix should be routine too. But it can require imagination to spot lexical ambiguity in words and phrases that don’t occur routinely in contracts.  Antecedent Ambiguity  7.14   In   the   sentence   John   is   late   because   he   overslept ,   the antecedent of   he   is   John   (assuming that the broader context doesn’t   suggest   an   alternative,   such   as   John’s   father). Confusion can arise if it’s not clear what the antecedent is of a given element. For example, in   John read Bill’s email ,   and he is furious , the antecedent of   he   could be either   John   or   Bill .  7.15   This kind of ambiguity arises in contracts. For example, in  Loso v. Loso , 31 A.3d 830, 831, 832–33 (Conn. App. Ct. 2011), the following contract language was at issue:  The defendant agrees to pay for one-half the cost of Sarah’s college educational expenses for a four year degree net of scholarships or grants subject to the limitation that said cost shall not exceed the tuition for a full-time residential student at UCONN-Storrs.  7.16   Was the defendant’s liability capped at half the tuition for a full-time residential student at UCONN-Storrs (the meaning sought by the defendant), or was it capped at the full amount of that tuition? In other words, was the antecedent of “said cost” “one-half the cost” or “the cost” of Sarah’s expenses? Disagreeing with the lower court, the appellate court held that the defendant’s liability was capped at the full amount of the tuition. Furthermore, it said that the language was “clear and unambiguous”—a debatable assessment.  7.17   The drafter should have made the intended meaning clear enough to preclude a fight. Here’s how the provision at issue",
  "could have been drafted to achieve the meaning sought by the defendant:  The defendant shall pay half the cost of Sarah’s college educational expenses for a four-year degree net of any scholarships and grants, up to an amount equal to half the tuition for a full-time residential student at UCONN-Storrs.  7.18   Another case involving antecedent ambiguity is   Trustees of First   Union   Real   Estate   Equity   &   Mortgage   Investments   v. Mandell , 987 F.2d 1286 (7th Cir. 1993). Here’s the language at issue (emphasis added):  Tenant shall pay, from time to time, to Landlord as additional rent fifty percent (50%) of any and all percentage rent which S.S. Kresge Company, or its successor or assigns, pays to Tenant under their lease for part or all of the Demised Premises during the initial term and   any period thereof , promptly after Tenant receives such percentage rent payments.  7.19   The question was whether “any period thereof” referred to “initial term” or “their lease”.  7.20   Another relevant Seventh Circuit case is   Tompkins v. Central Laborers’ Pension Fund , 712 F.3d 995 (7th Cir. 2013). In the contract provision at issue in that case, it was not clear what the phrase “For such” referred to.  7.21   And an English case,   Rainy Sky S. A. and others v. Kookmin Bank   [2011] UKSC 50, involved uncertainty over what was the antecedent of “such sums” in the phrase “all such sums due to you under the contract.”  7.22   As with all forms of ambiguity, the only solution is to be aware   of   the   sources   of   such   ambiguity   and,   when alternatives present themselves, to be clear which antecedent you’re referring to. It’s perhaps no coincidence that three of the   four   examples   of   antecedent   ambiguity   cited   above involve archaisms— said   (see 13.720),   thereof   (see 13.349), and  such   used instead of   those   (see 13.768). It’s more challenging",
  "to spot antecedent ambiguity if you’re wading through a fog of traditional contract language.  Contract-Reference Ambiguity  7.23   Ambiguity can arise in how a contract refers to itself. For example, does the word   hereunder   in a section apply just to that   section   or   to   the   entire   contract?   See   Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , No. CV 8095-VCP,   2013   WL   4509652   (Del.   Ch.   12   Aug.   2013);  Weichert Co. of Maryland, Inc. v. Faust , 419 Md. 306 (2011).  7.24   The same sort of confusion can be prompted by use of   herein . See   Karmely v. Wertheimer , 737 F.3d 197, 209–11 (2d Cir. 2013);   Bayerische   Landesbank,   New   York   Branch   v.   Aladdin Capital Management LLC , 692 F.3d 42 (2d Cir. 2012). And  hereinbelow . See   Dean St. Capital Advisors, LLC v. Otoka Energy Corp. , No. 15-CV-824 (RJS), 2016 WL 413124, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 1 Feb. 2016).  7.25   It isn’t only   here-   words that pose a risk of contract-reference ambiguity. You can create comparable confusion by pointing above or below in a contract. The phrase   except as provided below   resulted in a dispute over what was being referred to. See   In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. , 513 F. App’x 75, 77 (2d Cir. 2013). So did   the foregoing . See   Karmely v. Wertheimer , 737 F.3d 197, 211 (2d Cir. 2013). It’s easy to imagine the phrase  as aforesaid   creating comparable confusion. Say instead   in accordance with section X   or   as stated in section X .  7.26   The word   hereunder   can cause this kind of confusion too, besides confusion over whether you’re referring to an entire contract or just a part (see 7.23). In   Yosemite Insurance Co. v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. , No. 16 CIV. 5290 (PAE), 2016 WL 6684246 (S.D.N.Y. 10 Nov. 2016), an arbitration panel   had   held   that   hereunder   referred   not   to   the   entire reinsurance contract but instead to the two articles below the provision in question. The arbitration panel in effect decided that the - under   in   hereunder   meant not   by operation of   but",
  "instead meant   below . So   hereunder   has the potential to create two kinds of confusion.  7.27   The fix for contract-reference ambiguity is straightforward. First, never use   here - words (see 13.349). And second, instead of using   above   and   below   to refer to other parts of a contract, refer to specific sections (see 4.105).  FAILURE TO BE SUFFICIENTLY SPECIFIC  7.28   If a word or phrase in a contract turns out to have been too general, the parties might end up fighting over which more specific meaning had been intended.  7.29   For example, a dispute over alimony involved the meaning of the phrase   on a full-time basis . See   In re C.P.Y. , 364 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2012). The husband had to pay the wife alimony until, among other events, she returned to work “on a full-time basis.” The wife got work as a contract attorney, so the husband sought an order declaring that he no longer had to pay alimony. The court held that the phrase “full-time basis” is ambiguous, but it would be more accurate to say that it was insufficiently specific, in that it can be uncertain in several respects what   on a full-time basis   means. How many hours a day and days per week must you work for work to be full-time? How long must that level of work be maintained? Must someone be an employee to work full-time, or can you be a consultant? Does volunteer work count?  7.30   Here   are   some   other   disputes   involving   a   failure   to   be sufficiently specific:  Mosser Constructions, Inc. v. Travelers Indemnity Co. , 430 F. App’x 417 (6th Cir. 2011) (considering whether “subcontractor” means any supplier to a contractor or something more)  Graev v. Graev , 898 N.E.2d 909 (N.Y. 2008) (holding that the word “cohabitation” as used in a separation agreement did not have a plain meaning and that relevant factors",
  "might include whether those living together engaged in sexual relations or commingled their finances)  Jones v. Francis Drilling Fluids , 613 F. Supp. 2d 858 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (considering whether the word “offshore,” in connection with an oil rig, refers to a location in the Gulf of Mexico or in inland waters, and holding that it could convey either meaning)  7.31   See also discussion of the phrases   close of business   (see 10.34) and   moral turpitude   (see 13.528).  7.32   A failure to be sufficiently specific might be a function of changing   circumstances   rather   than   a   drafting   glitch.   For example,   Richey v. Metaxpert LLC , 407 F. App’x 198 (9th Cir. 2010),   involved   a   dispute   between   a   company   and   an employee who had agreed that he wouldn’t compete with the company “in the computer gaming business” for two years after leaving the company. After he left the company, the   employee   started   designing   software   for   smartphone games. At issue in the dispute was whether the word   computer  included   smartphones.   The   year   the   employee   signed   his contract   was   also   the   year   the   iPhone   was   launched,   so perhaps one can’t fault the drafter of that contract for not having anticipated the smartphone boom.  MISTAKE  7.33   Uncertainty   of   meaning   can   also   arise   if   the   parties   are mistaken   as   to   the   facts   and   the   contract   reflects   that mistake. A famous instance of such a mistake is found in the English case   Raffles v. Wichelhaus , 159 Eng. Rep. 375 (Ex. 1864). The contract provided for purchase of cotton from a ship named “Peerless” that was to depart from Bombay. It transpired that two ships named “Peerless” were to depart from Bombay a couple of months apart—the buyer had one ship in mind, the seller the other.",
  "7.34   The term   latent ambiguity   has been used to describe such situations. For example,   Black’s Law Dictionary   defines latent ambiguity as “An ambiguity that does not readily appear in the   language   of   a   document,   but   instead   arises   from   a collateral matter once the document’s terms are applied or executed,” and it alludes to   Raffles v. Wichelhaus . But the contract text at issue in   Raffles v. Wichelhaus   doesn’t present alternative   meanings,   so   it’s   unhelpful   to   attribute   the confusion   to   ambiguity.   Judicial   fondness   for   the   phrase  latent ambiguity   perhaps arises from euphonious contrast with the phrase   patent ambiguity   (namely actual ambiguity).  CONFLICT  7.35   Conflict occurs when two or more components of a contract aren’t compatible. It can be caused by careless repetition (see 1.62), for example when the words and digits used to state a number don’t match (see 14.1–.16).  7.36   Entire provisions can conflict. For example,   United Rentals, Inc. v. RAM Holdings, Inc .,   937 A.2d 810 (Del. Ch. 2007), a high-profile case involving an abortive acquisition, involved conflict between two provisions on remedies. See Kenneth A. Adams,   Merger   Pacts:   Contract   Drafting ,   Cerberus   Litigation , New York Law Journal, 19 Feb. 2008.  FAILURE TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE  7.37   Uncertainty   can   occur   if   by   oversight   a   drafter   fails   to address an issue that should have been addressed. That’s different from the parties electing not to address an issue to facilitate their reaching agreement.  7.38   Consider   Sabatini v. Roybal , 150 N.M. 478 (Ct. App. 2011), which   addressed   use   of   the   phrase   “private   garage”   in   a contract. The lower court had held that for a restriction on building, “private garage” meant a garage capable of holding no more than a reasonable number of vehicles for use by a",
  "single family, rather than the 100-foot-by-50-foot structure built by the Roybals.  7.39   After noting that the phrase “private garage” was ambiguous, the   court   of   appeals   reversed,   holding   that   the   Roybals’ garage   complied   with   the   restrictive   covenant,   as   (1)   the garage was used to store the Roybals’ vehicles and was not available for use by the public and (2) the phrase “private garage” didn’t incorporate any limits on size.  7.40   But   “private   garage”   isn’t   ambiguous:   it   doesn’t   present alternative meanings. Instead, it’s clear that the garage wasn’t to be used by the public, but the drafter overlooked another issue likely to arise in a Santa Fe, New Mexico, subdivision— whether there was a limit on the size of the garage.  7.41   Avoiding this sort of uncertainty is more challenging than is avoiding the sorts of uncertainty discussed above, in that instead of eliminating that which is problematic, you have to figure out what’s missing.  VAGUENESS  7.42   Vague   words   used   in   contracts   include   the   adjectives  reasonable ,   prompt ,   material ,   negligent ,   satisfactory ,   and  substantial   (among many others) and the related adverbs. With vagueness, whether a given standard has been met is a function   of   the   circumstances.   For   example,   how   fast   a contract party must act to comply with an obligation to do something   promptly   is   a   function   of   what   would   be reasonable   under   the   circumstances.   There’s   no   specific deadline.  7.43   So   with   vagueness   comes   the   possibility   of   dispute.   A contract party under an obligation to do something promptly might act fast enough that no one could reasonably say they hadn’t acted promptly. But the longer they take, the greater the likelihood of the other party deciding that they hadn’t acted promptly.",
  "7.44   That being the case, it would seem sensible to be specific instead of vague, for example by saying   no later than five days after . But drafters use vagueness if lack of control (over the future; over someone else’s conduct) means that a precise standard wouldn’t make sense. For example, if a provision requiring reimbursement of legal expenses would apply to a broad range of litigation, from the trivial to the catastrophic, it might make sense to express a cap not as a specific amount but instead by referring to   reasonable legal expenses —a vague standard.  7.45   Vagueness might also be expedient if addressing an issue precisely   would   make   negotiations   longer   or   more contentious than one or both parties want.  7.46   Different vague words might pose different challenges. For example, in a given context the time constraints might be clear-cut   enough   that   there’s   little   room   for   dispute   over what’s required for a party to act promptly. By contrast, a provision subject to a   substantial   standard might leave the parties   wondering   at   what   point   along   a   spectrum   from nothing   to   everything   something   has   to   be   before   it’s substantial.  Limiting the Risk in Vagueness  7.47   Vagueness in a contract can be more risky or less, depending on how it’s used.  7.48   It would be prudent to use vagueness only if not too much is at stake and the context is sufficiently commonplace that the parties and any court would have a basis for determining what would be reasonable in the circumstances.  7.49   It would also make sense to reduce the scope of vagueness. For how to do that when using the phrase   reasonable efforts , see 8.88, 8.117.  Gradations of Vagueness",
  "7.50   The notion of gradations in vagueness is unhelpful. It’s on display   in   how   people   understand   the   phrases   negligent ,  grossly negligent ,   reckless , and   wanton   (see 13.561–.577). But perhaps the biggest misconception regarding gradations of vagueness is the notion of a spectrum of standards featuring the word   efforts . See 8.18–.33.  7.51   But in the appropriate context, it’s possible to subdivide coherently a spectrum of vagueness. See the distinction this manual draws between   material   and   nontrivial   (see 9.17–.23).  BLURRED BOUNDARIES  7.52   Instead   of   being   distinct,   the   categories   of   uncertain meaning can blend into each other.  7.53   The   difference   between   lexical   ambiguity   (see   7.10)   and failure to be sufficiently specific (see 7.28) is one of degree. The former involves established alternative meanings; the latter involves a broader range of alternative meanings. The one can shade into the other.  7.54   Similarly, the distinction between failing to be sufficiently specific about an issue and failing to address it at all is one of degree.  7.55   And   contract   usages   can   be   both   vague   and   ambiguous. Given   the   confusion   over   ostensible   gradations   in   efforts  standards, the phrase   best efforts   can be considered not only vague but also ambiguous (see 8.18–.27). So can the word  material   (see 9.7).",
  "REASONABLE EFFORTS   AND ITS VARIANTS  CONFUSION OVER   EFFORTS   (AND   ENDEAVOURS )  8.1   There’s widespread confusion over phrases using the word  efforts   (and   in   England   and   Australia,   endeavours ).   This chapter considers the function of   efforts   standards, the variety of   efforts   standards, what people who work with contracts believe about   efforts   standards, how   efforts   standards evolved, and what caselaw says.  8.2   This   manual   recommends   that   of   the   different   efforts  standards, you use only   reasonable efforts . Doing so allows  efforts   standards   to   serve   their   intended   function,   and   it eliminates a potential source of confusion. The notion that different   efforts   standards   impose   obligations   of   different levels of onerousness is an illusion. But that’s only part of what’s   involved   in   using   efforts   standards   effectively.   See 8.84–.122 for all this manual’s recommendations regarding  efforts   standards.  THE FUNCTION OF   EFFORTS   STANDARDS  8.3   When   accomplishing   a   specific   goal   isn’t   entirely   within Acme’s control, Acme should be reluctant to enter into a contract that imposes on Acme an unqualified obligation to accomplish that goal—doing so would pose undue risk of liability for nonperformance. The parties might instead agree to use   reasonable efforts , or some other   efforts   standard, to express that obligation. All provisions using   efforts   standards",
  "are vague—complying with a given   efforts   obligation   is   a function of the circumstances (see 7.42).  8.4   Contracts   use   efforts   standards   in   connection   with   many different   obligations,   such   as   an   obligation   to   cause   a securities   registration   statement   to   become   effective   by   a certain time, an obligation to obtain consents required for closing, or an obligation to promote sales of a product.  8.5   Efforts   standards are also used as a matter of expediency, if the   parties   don’t   want   to   spend   time   negotiating   precise guidelines or decide it would be too contentious to do so.  8.6   This chapter addresses only explicit   efforts   standards. They’re different from an   efforts   standard that a court imposes even though   the   contract   appears   to   impose   an   unqualified obligation,   or   that   a   court   implies   in   the   absence   of   an explicit obligation.  A VARIETY OF   EFFORTS   STANDARDS  8.7   Drafters use a bewildering variety of   efforts   standards and alternatives to   efforts   standards. This section identifies the principal variants. Those discussed in 8.8–.12 are summarized in figure 4.  8.8   In the United States, it’s conventional to use   efforts , but in England and Australia   endeavours   is favored over   efforts . One even encounters the Americanized version— endeavors . Both are also used in the singular,   effort   and   endeavour . Although this   section   refers   primarily   to   efforts   (and   effort ),   the alternatives   described   apply   equally   to   endeavours   (and  endeavor ).  8.9   Drafters   use   a   broad   assortment   of   adjectives   in   efforts  provisions. Those used most frequently are   best efforts   and  reasonable efforts , with   good-faith efforts   lagging behind. On the   U.S.   Securities   and   Exchange   Commission’s   EDGAR system, one sees a bewildering variety of other adjectives used to create eccentric   efforts   standards:   extraordinary ,   utmost ,",
  "substantial ,   persistent ,   good ,   diligent ,   prompt ,   business ,   and perhaps   others.   Adjectives   are   often   combined   in   twos ( reasonable   best   efforts )   and   even   threes   ( best   good-faith reasonable efforts ).  8.10   And there’s the adverb   commercially . It’s used most often with   reasonable , but you also see it with   best   and   good-faith , although that doesn’t make sense: one describes something as being   commercially reasonable , but not   commercially best   or  commercially good-faith .  8.11   The determiner   all   can be used with   efforts , usually with an adjective (as in   all reasonable efforts ), but sometimes on its own ( all efforts ). The determiner   every   is always used with  effort , sometimes on its own ( every effort ), and sometimes with one of the usual adjectives ( every reasonable effort ).  8.12   Adding   to   the   variety   is   the   range   of   verbs   used:   make ,  exercise ,   exert ,   expend ,   undertake , and   use . You can also add a pronoun:   her ,   his ,   its , or   their .  FIGURE 4   THE COMPONENTS OF   EFFORTS   PROVISIONS IN TRADITIONAL CONTRACT DRAFTING  8.13   An alternative to adjectives is to place a modifier after   efforts , as in   efforts that are reasonable ,   efforts in good faith , and   efforts that are consistent with the Servicing Standard .",
  "8.14   Drafters also use alternatives to   efforts   provisions that rely on an adjective (for example,   utmost ), an adverb (for example,  aggressively ), an adverb phrase ( to the best of its ability ,   to the extent it is able to do so ), or a verb ( endeavor ,   seek ,   strive ,   try ). And instead of requiring that a party use reasonable efforts to stop something, some contracts state that the party   shall not negligently   permit   the   act   in   question.   These   alternatives simply add to the confusion.  WHAT PEOPLE THINK   EFFORTS   STANDARDS MEAN  8.15   Anecdotal   evidence   suggests   that   many   who   work   with contracts believe that   best efforts   obligations are more onerous than   reasonable efforts   obligations. The distinction is often expressed like this:   reasonable efforts   requires only what is reasonable in the context, whereas   best efforts   requires that you do everything you can to comply with the obligation, even if you bankrupt yourself. People are less certain of the implications of other   efforts   standards.  8.16   Commentators chime in on this. You can find blog posts confidently asserting distinctions among   efforts   standards. For example, that   best efforts   is equivalent to   all reasonable efforts , which is more onerous than   commercially reasonable efforts , which in turn is more onerous than   reasonable efforts .  8.17   In   an   example   of   the   no-smoke-without-fire   school   of contract interpretation (see p. xxxviii), judges and those who work with contracts are prone to suggesting that if people believe that different   efforts   standards are onerous to differing degrees, there must be something to that notion.  WHAT   EFFORTS   STANDARDS ACTUALLY MEAN  8.18   Suggesting   that   different   efforts   standards   are   onerous   to different degrees requires ignoring English usage, contract law, and how   efforts   standards have evolved. What follows might seem professorial, but it crucially supplies what has",
  "been   missing   from   discussion   of   efforts   standards—actual evidence.  Best Efforts   Is Not More Onerous Than   Reasonable Efforts  HOW   EFFORTS   STANDARDS   HAVE   EVOLVED  8.19   The precursor of   efforts   is   endeavour , both singular and plural, in   the   phrase   to   do   one’s   endeavour(s) .   The   Oxford   English Dictionary   offers as the definition “to exert oneself to the uttermost; to do all one can (in a cause or to an end),” and notes that the phrase is archaic. It offers quotations using   to do one’s endeavor(s)   from around 1500 to 1873.  8.20   In the same entry,   The Oxford English Dictionary   also offers quotations featuring variants of the phrase using the word  best . One is a line from Shakespeare’s   Merchant of Venice , “My best endeuours shall be done heerein.”  8.21   The simplest explanation of this use of the word   best   is that it’s a rhetorical flourish that doesn’t change meaning, just as adding the word   best   to   It’s in your interests   ( It’s in your best interests ),   to my knowledge   ( to the best of my knowledge ), and   use your judgment   ( use your best judgment ) doesn’t change their meaning.   Instead,   use   of   the   word   best   simply   signals   a measure of formality. It’s consistent with this interpretation that   in   the   entry   for   to   do   one’s   endeavour(s) ,   The   Oxford English Dictionary   doesn’t distinguish quotations that use   best  from those that do not and doesn’t comment on use of   best  in some quotations but not in others.  8.22   As   for   the   level   of   exertion   inherent   in   to   do   one’s endeavour(s) , look to how modern equivalents are understood. If a 56-year-old man—a lawyer with no heroic sporting deeds in his past—says, “In the 2017 Garden City Turkey Trot, I’ll do   my   best   to   improve   on   my   2016   time,”   he’s   not committing   himself   to   hiring   a   running   coach,   strength coach, nutritionist, and physiotherapist and embarking on a full-time regimen involving high-altitude training, bariatric",
  "chambers, cutting-edge footwear, and the like. Instead, he’s telling   himself   and   anyone   else   idly   listening   that considering   his   age,   physique,   family   obligations,   work commitments,   and   his   other   interests,   he’ll   try   hard. Expressions of an intention to do one’s utmost, however they’re worded, make sense only if the speaker and listeners assume a level of effort that’s reasonable, considering the circumstances.  8.23   According   to   a   Google   Ngram   of   best   endeavours   and  reasonable   endeavours   showing   the   frequency   with   which those   phrases   occur   in   Google’s   British-English   corpus   of digitized books between 1800 and 2000, use of   best endeavours  rose to a peak around 1820 then gradually decreased. By contrast,   reasonable endeavours   is essentially absent from the Ngram until after 1980, when the frequency with which it appears starts creeping up. But even by 2000,   best endeavours  still occurs about ten times as often as   reasonable endeavours .  8.24   The   links   to   Google   Books   in   that   Ngram   suggest   that whereas   best endeavours   occurs in a variety of publications,  reasonable   endeavours   occurs   primarily   in   legal   and governmental   publications.   It   has   never   been   used   in everyday   English.   It   appears   that   reasonable   endeavours  developed as an alternative to   best endeavours , but one that conveys the same meaning. The most plausible explanation is   that   because   lawyers   are   prone   to   literal-minded hairsplitting, writers of legal texts thought it appropriate to come up with an alternative to   best endeavours . Presumably the   aim   was   to   avoid   the   suggestion,   prompted   by   the dictionary definition of   best   as “exceeding all others,” that  best endeavours   requires endeavours that are somehow better than other endeavours.  8.25   A Google Ngram of occurrence of   best efforts   and   reasonable efforts   in Google’s American-English corpus shows use of   best efforts   gradually   increasing   over   the   two   hundred   years covered by the Ngram, much as   best efforts   increases in the British-English   corpus.   But   reasonable   efforts   is   essentially",
  "absent for the first fifty years and thereafter increases only very gradually until 1960, after which it increases markedly. But in 2000,   best efforts   still occurs four times as often as  reasonable efforts . (Images of the two Ngrams described in 8.23–.25 and   The Oxford English Dictionary ’s definition of   to do one’s   endeavour(s)   are   available   at   Kenneth   A.   Adams,  Distinguishing   Between   “Efforts”   Standard   Makes   No   Sense , Adams   on   Contract   Drafting   (4   Apr.   2017), http://www.adamsdrafting.com/distinguishing-between- different-efforts-standards-makes-no-sense/.)  8.26   The principal difference between the British-English Ngram and the American-English Ngram is decreasing use of   best endeavours   in the former and increase use of   best efforts   in the latter. That’s presumably a function of   endeavours   becoming less popular and   efforts   becoming more popular, something evident from an Ngram comparing the fortunes of those two words (see 8.91).  8.27   So   best endeavours   and   best efforts   are the only phrases used in everyday English, and they make sense only if understood as connoting conduct that is reasonable in the circumstances.  Reasonable endeavours ,   reasonable efforts , and other variants have   never   been   used   in   everyday   English   and   are   best understood as alternatives to   best endeavours   and   best efforts  introduced   by   the   legal   profession,   to   avoid   having   the idiomatic meaning of those phrases disregarded by literal- minded judges and lawyers.  IN   CONTRACTS ,   MORE   THAN   REASONABLE   IS   UNREASONABLE  8.28   There’s another reason why it doesn’t make sense to suggest that a   best efforts   obligation is more onerous than a   reasonable efforts   obligation. If that were the case, then anyone under an obligation to use   best efforts   would be at risk of having to act more   than   reasonably—in   other   words,   unreasonably—to comply   with   that   obligation.   Nothing   in   contract   law suggests a standard requiring that one act unreasonably to comply   with   an   obligation:   contracts   default   to",
  "reasonableness   in   the   absence   of   specificity.   Furthermore, one would have no basis for determining at what point a   best efforts   obligation   had   been   complied   with—just   how unreasonably would one have to act to meet that standard?  OBJECTIVE - VERSUS - SUBJECTIVE   DOESN ’ T   MAKE   SENSE  8.29   Some who work with contracts think that   reasonable efforts   is an objective standard and   best efforts   a subjective standard, or vice   versa.   Objective   refers   to   that   which   anyone   can,   in principle, observe.   Subjective   is a function of an individual’s own particular viewpoint and traits. The first problem with tying   reasonable   efforts   and   best   efforts   to   objective   and  subjective   is   that   nothing   in   the   labels   best   efforts   and  reasonable   efforts   suggests   a   distinction   analogous   to   the distinction between   objective   and   subjective .  8.30   But beyond that, whether someone has expended sufficient efforts is a function of the circumstances—in other words, objective reality. There’s no basis for leaving it to a party under an   efforts   obligation to determine whether it felt it had done   enough   and   having   courts   bound   by   that determination, no matter how divorced from reality.  All   Doesn’t Affect Meaning  8.31   In   all reasonable efforts , the word   all   is a rhetorical flourish that does not affect meaning—it’s used to the same effect in phrases such as   all due respect   and   all deliberate speed .  8.32   Furthermore, must a party under an obligation to use   all reasonable efforts   take every action that might contribute to achieving the goal, as long as each action is reasonable? It would be nonsensical to suggest that under an   all reasonable efforts   standard you don’t consider the task as a whole. After all, if you’re asked to move a mountain of sand from one place to another using only a pair of tweezers, each act of moving a few grains of sand could readily be accomplished, but the task as a whole would nevertheless be unreasonable.",
  "Commercially   Doesn’t Affect Meaning  8.33   There’s   no   basis   for   saying   that   adding   commercially   to  reasonable   efforts   affects   its   meaning—because   efforts  standards are vague (see 8.3), they take into account the circumstances of the transaction.  Reasonable Efforts   Doesn’t Require Moderation  8.34   One   meaning   of   reasonable   is   “moderate”—getting   a reasonable amount of exercise usually wouldn’t extend to running a marathon. So if you want to impress on the other side   that   you   expect   it   to   do   its   utmost   to   sell   widgets,  reasonable   can   seem   lacking,   and   the   notion   of   efforts  standards that are more onerous can be seductive.  8.35   But that’s not a real concern, because a   reasonable efforts  standard   takes   circumstances   into   account   (see   8.22). Nothing prevents a given set of circumstances from requiring that a reasonable person charged with performing a task act with urgency or commit considerable resources.  CASELAW AND THE UCC ON THE MEANING OF DIFFERENT  EFFORTS   STANDARDS  8.36   So as a matter of English usage, contract law, and how   efforts  standards   have   evolved,   the   notion   that   different   efforts  standards   express   different   meanings   is   unworkable,   and nothing a court says can change that. If courts elect to jump off an   efforts   cliff, don’t follow them.  8.37   But those who work with contracts should be aware of the caselaw   on   efforts   standards.   It   can   affect   how   others approach   efforts   standards, and it relates to issues other than whether a reasonableness standard or some other standard applies.  U.S. Caselaw",
  "8.38   To the credit of U.S. courts, they have largely avoided falling prey to the same misconception as those who work with contracts—the notion that different   efforts   standards express different meanings.  THE   MEANING   OF   BEST   EFFORTS  8.39   U.S. courts haven’t required that a party under a duty to use best   efforts   to   accomplish   a   specific   goal   make   every conceivable effort to do so, regardless of the detriment to it. See, e.g.,   Coady Corp. v. Toyota Motor Distributors, Inc. , 361 F.3d 50, 59 (1st Cir. 2004) (“‘Best efforts’ ... cannot mean everything possible under the sun ... .”);   Triple-A Baseball Club Associates v. Northeastern Baseball, Inc ., 832 F.2d 214, 228 (1st Cir. 1987) (“We have found no cases, and none have been   cited,   holding   that   ‘best   efforts’   means   every conceivable effort.”);   Bloor v. Falstaff Brewing Corp ., 601 F.2d 609, 614 (2d Cir. 1979) (“The requirement that a party use its best efforts necessarily does not prevent the party from giving reasonable consideration to its own interests.”).  8.40   Different   courts   have   used   different   terminology   in attempting to articulate what   best efforts   does mean. Some have held that the appropriate standard is one of good faith, a standard grounded in honesty and fairness. See   Triple-A Baseball Club Associates , 832 F.2d at 225 (“We have been unable to find any case in which a court found ... that a party acted in good faith but did not use its best efforts.”);  Soroof Trading Development Co. v. GE Fuel Cell Systems, LLC , 842 F. Supp. 2d 502, 511 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (holding that a   best efforts   provision imposes an obligation to act with good faith in light of one’s own capabilities);   Bloor , 601 F.2d at 614 ( best efforts   imposes an obligation to act with good faith in light of one’s own capabilities);   Western Geophysical Co. of America v. Bolt Associates ,   Inc ., 584 F.2d 1164, 1171 (2d Cir. 1978) (an obligation   to   use   best   efforts   can   be   met   by   “active exploitation in good faith”).",
  "8.41   But some cases have held that the standard is higher than that of good faith. See   Martin v. Monumental Life Insurance Co. , 240 F.3d 223, 234 (3rd Cir. 2001) (“Precedent treats ‘best efforts’   as   a   form   of   good   faith   and   sound   business judgment.”);   Satellite Broadcasting Cable, Inc. v. Telefonica De Espana, S.A ., 807 F. Supp. 210, 217 (D.P.R. 1992) (the net effect of the   best efforts   provision at issue was “to expand extra-contractual   damages   beyond   a   mere   good   faith requirement”);   Kroboth v. Brent , 215 A.D.2d 813, 814 (N.Y. App. Div. 1995) (“‘[B]est efforts’ requires more than ‘good faith,’ which is an implied covenant in all contracts ... .”).  8.42   Other cases have held that the appropriate standard is one of diligence. See   National Data Payment Systems, Inc. v. Meridian Bank , 212 F.3d 849, 854 (3d Cir. 2000);   T.S.I. Holdings ,   Inc. v. Jenkins , 924 P.2d 1239, 1250 (Kan. 1996).  8.43   Still   other   cases   have   invoked   reasonableness.   See,   e.g.,  Corporate   Lodging   Consultants,   Inc.   v.   Bombardier   Aerospace Corp ., No. 03-1467-WEB, 2005 WL 1153606, at *6 (D. Kan. 11 May 2005) (“Best efforts does not mean perfection and expectations   are   only   justifiable   if   they   are   reasonable.”);  Coady   Corp. ,   361   F.3d   at   59   (“‘Best   efforts’   is   implicitly qualified by a reasonableness test ... .”);   Kroboth , 215 A.D.2d at   814   (“‘Best   efforts’   requires   that   plaintiffs   pursue   all reasonable methods ... .”).  8.44   And some courts have acknowledged that   best efforts   and  reasonable efforts   mean the same thing. See, e.g.,   Stewart v. O’Neill , 225 F. Supp. 2d 6, 14 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (stating that “the agency was obligated to use its best efforts—that is, all reasonable   efforts—to   comply   with   all   terms   of   the settlement agreement”);   Soroof Trading Development Co. , 842 F. Supp. at 511 (holding that New York courts use the term  reasonable efforts   interchangeably with   best efforts ); see also  Trecom Business Systems, Inc. v. Prasad , 980 F. Supp. 770, 774 n.1 (D.N.J. 1997) (in a case involving an implied rather than express duty, referring to the distinction between   best efforts  and   reasonable efforts   as “merely an issue of semantics”).",
  "8.45   It appears that only two courts have suggested that one can distinguish between   best efforts   and   reasonable efforts . See   In re Chateaugay Corp. , 198 B.R. 848, 854 (S.D.N.Y. 1996);   Krinsky v. Long Beach Wings , LLC, No. B148698, 2002 WL 31124659, at *8 (Cal. Ct. App. 26 Sept. 2002). But in neither case does the court provide a coherent rationale for its position.  8.46   So   U.S.   courts   have   overwhelmingly   rejected—either explicitly or by adopting an alternative interpretation—the notion that   best efforts   represents a more onerous standard than   reasonable efforts .  8.47   Don’t attribute any particular significance to the fact that courts   use   different   buzzwords— diligence ,   good   faith ,  reasonableness —in   describing   what   best   efforts   does   mean. That’s   a   predictable   result   of   courts   seeking   to   explain   a vague phrase by using other vague words and phrases.  A   DELAWARE   DISSENT  8.48   In his dissent in   Williams Companies, Inc. v. Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. , No. 330, 2016, 2017 WL 1090912, at *9 (Del. 23 Mar. 2017), Chief Justice Strine observed that a particular obligation   to   use   commercially   reasonable   efforts   was   “an affirmative covenant and a comparatively strong one.” In a footnote supporting this proposition, he cites a 2001 edition of a treatise as stating that a   best efforts   obligation can require a   party   to   take   “extreme   measures”   and   a   commercially reasonable efforts   obligation is “a strong, but slightly more limited,   alternative.”   See   Kenneth   A.   Adams,   “Efforts” Provisions and the Delaware Supreme Court’s Opinion in the ETE- Williams Dispute , Adams on Contract Drafting (3 Apr. 2017), http://www.adamsdrafting.com/delaware-supreme-court- opinion-ete-williams-dispute/.  8.49   The Chief Justice’s observation regarding   efforts   provisions is inconsistent with the evidence (see 8.18–.28). And he cites no supporting   caselaw—no   meaningful   caselaw   to   that   effect exists. His dissent doesn’t create binding precedent, but it",
  "muddies the waters, because what readers will take away from it is that one   efforts   obligation can be more onerous than another.  THE   MEANING   OF   REASONABLE   EFFORTS  8.50   Although   it’s   the   meaning   of   best   efforts   that   has   most perplexed those who work with contracts,   reasonable efforts  has potential for mischief. Consider two New York cases.  8.51   In   Rex Med. L.P. v. Angiotech Pharmaceuticals (US) ,   754   F. Supp. 2d 616 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), the court was of the view that in   determining   whether   a   party   has   complied   with   an obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve an objective, its financial hardship was irrelevant—that was an   argument   that   the   party   in   question   should,   in   the memorable words of the court, “save for a bankruptcy court.” By contrast, in   MBIA Ins. v. Patriarch Partners VIII , 950 F. Supp. 2d 568 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), the court held that acting in a commercially reasonable manner “does not require a party to act against its own business interests.”  8.52   It make no sense to attempt to determine the reasonableness of   a   party’s   actions   without   considering   its   financial resources.   Once   you   eliminate   the   need   for   a   rational relationship   between   efforts   expended   and   the   return   on those   efforts,   anything   that   leads   to   progress   toward achieving the objective becomes mandatory, no matter what it costs.  8.53   But the role of the contract drafter isn’t to complain about how a court was irrational in interpreting a contract. And although the approach of the court in   Rex Med   appears to be something of an anomaly, other courts might adopt a similar approach. So the task facing anyone drafting or reviewing a contract is to word   reasonable efforts   provisions to limit the scope for extreme interpretations.  ENFORCEABILITY   OF   EFFORTS   PROVISIONS",
  "8.54   Courts   in   most   U.S.   jurisdictions   have   held   that   efforts  provisions are enforceable. The principal exception is Illinois courts, which have held that a promise to use best efforts is too vague to be binding if the parties fail to articulate what performance the phrase requires.   See   Kraftco Corp. v. Kolbus , 274 N.E.2d 153, 156 (Ill. App. Ct. 1971).  8.55   But some U.S. courts have held unenforceable an unlikely subset of   efforts   provisions, namely an obligation to use “best efforts” to agree. See, e.g.,   Pinnacle Books, Inc. v. Harlequin Enterprises Ltd ., 519 F. Supp. 118, 121–22 (S.D.N.Y. 1981). And at least one English case has held likewise regarding an obligation   to   use   “reasonable   endeavours”   to   agree.   See  Phillips Petroleum Co. UK Ltd. v. Enron Europe Ltd . [1997] CLC 329. By contrast, in   Denil v. DeBoer, Inc. , 650 F.3d 635 (7th Cir. 2011), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held   that   an   obligation   to   use   “best   efforts”   to   reach agreement is equivalent to an obligation to negotiate in good faith. So if you want to include in a contract a provision making some arrangement contingent on future agreement, using a good-faith standard rather than an   efforts   standard would reduce the risk of a court holding that the provision is unenforceable.  8.56   Sometimes you can’t avoid the uncertainty that goes with making contract relations contingent on future agreement. But if you incorporate the notion of future agreement as a way   of   putting   off   negotiations—as   was   the   case   in   the dispute in   Denil —you risk dispute.  WHETHER   A   PARTY   HAS   MADE   REASONABLE   EFFORTS  8.57   Because   reasonable efforts   is vague, determining whether a party   has   complied   with   a   reasonable   efforts   obligation depends, as with all   efforts   standards, on the circumstances of the case, with all the uncertainty that entails. See   Martin , 240 F.3d   at   233   (“‘Best   efforts’   depends   on   the   factual circumstances surrounding an agreement.”);   Triple-A Baseball Club   Associates ,   832   F.2d   at   225   (stating   that   best   efforts",
  "“cannot be defined in terms of a fixed formula; it varies with the facts and the field of law involved”).  8.58   So anyone inclined to include a   reasonable efforts   standard in a   contract   would   benefit   from   understanding   how   courts have determined whether a party has in fact made reasonable efforts.  STANDARD   FOR   MEASURING   PERFORMANCE  8.59   In   Kevin M. Ehringer Enterprises, Inc. v. McData Services Corp. , 646 F.3d 321 (5th Cir. 2011), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, applying Texas law, held that McData’s promise to use “best efforts” to promote, market, and sell products during the three-year term wasn’t an enforceable promise and so couldn’t support a fraudulent-inducement claim. According to the court, that’s because “a best efforts contract must set some kind of goal or guideline against which best efforts may be measured.”  8.60   Another Fifth Circuit case applying Texas Law,   Herrmann Holdings Ltd. v. Lucent Technologies Inc. , 302 F.3d 552 (5th Cir. 2002), involved “best efforts” provisions that required the defendant to file a registration statement and cause it to become effective “as promptly as practicable” and “in the most expeditious manner practicable.” The court held that the latter two phrases established an objective goal, rendering the “best efforts” provision enforceable.  8.61   These   two   cases   highlight   that   imposing   on   Acme   an obligation to use reasonable efforts to sell widgets doesn’t make sense unless you indicate how many widgets it must sell,   and   how   quickly.   And   that   imposing   on   Acme   a  reasonable efforts   obligation to file a registration statement doesn’t make sense unless you include an indication of how soon Acme has to file it. For an obligation to use reasonable efforts,   always   incorporate   a   standard   for   measuring performance.   A   vague   standard—for   example,   one   using  promptly —would be sufficient.",
  "IDENTIFYING   A   BENCHMARK  8.62   Determining   whether   a   party   has   complied   with   an obligation to use reasonable efforts is facilitated if the efforts made can be compared against a benchmark. Courts have used different benchmarks:  Past performance.   See   Bloor v. Falstaff Brewing Corp ., 601 F.2d 609, 614 (2d Cir. 1979) (in assessing compliance with a provision requiring the purchaser of assets relating to Ballantine beer to “use its best efforts to promote and maintain a high volume of sales,” the court considered, among other things, sales figures over several years).  Promises made during contract negotiations for guidance on what efforts had been expected.   See   Stone v. Caroselli , 653 P.2d 754, 757 (Colo. Ct. App. 1982) (stating that testimony by manufacturers as to distributors’ promise during negotiations to “hit the road” to promote the product was admissible to explain the distributors’ implied duty to use best efforts). But see   Olympia Hotels Corp. v. Johnson Wax Development Corp. , 908 F.2d 1363, 1373 (7th Cir. 1990) (“The contract contains an integration clause, and the district judge was correct that the parol evidence rule forbade inquiry into precontractual discussions or agreements concerning the meaning of best efforts.”).  Industry practice.   See   Zilg v. Prentice-Hall Inc. , 717 F.2d 671, 681 (2d Cir. 1983) (noting that plaintiff’s expert testified that “[defendant’s] efforts were ‘perfectly adequate,’ although they were ‘routine’ and [defendant] ‘did not follow through as they might’”);   First Union National Bank v. Steele Software Systems Corp. , 838 A.2d 404, 448 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2003) (stating that in determining whether an obligation to use best efforts had been satisfied, the jury was entitled to consider such things as “the standard in the industry regarding similar contracts between banks and their settlement service vendors”).  Efforts used by the promisor in connection with other contracts",
  "imposing an   efforts   standard.   See   Olympia Hotels Corp. , 908 F.2d at 1373 (holding that if the promisor has similar contracts with other promisees, “‘best efforts’ means the efforts the promisor has employed in those parallel contracts where the adequacy of his efforts have not been questioned”).  How the promisor would have acted if the promisor and promisee had been united in the same entity. See   Petroleum Marketing Corp. v. Metropolitan Petroleum Corp. , 151 A.2d 616, 619 (Pa. 1959) (in a case involving a promise by the buyers of a business to use best efforts to collect all accounts receivable on the books of the business on the closing date, the court noted that the parties had accepted that the buyers had had the duty to “use such efforts as it would have been prudent to use in their own behalf if they had owned the receivables, or such efforts as it would have been prudent for the [sellers] to use if they had retained possession of them”).  8.63   Absent any such benchmark, a requirement that a promisor use reasonable efforts to accomplish a contract goal would likely be balanced against the broader constraints faced by the promisor in conducting the business that is the subject of the contract. See   Martin v. Monumental Life Insurance Co. , 240 F.3d 223, 235 (3rd Cir. 2001) (holding that in agreeing to use best   efforts,   defendant   did   not   compromise   its   right   to exercise sound business judgment). Without this balancing, the promisor could be forced to expend resources at a level that renders the contract uneconomic.  NARROWLY   DIRECTED   EFFORTS  8.64   A   situation   that   poses   a   risk   of   a   court   holding   that   a promisor had to make what might seem like disproportionate efforts   arises   when   an   efforts   provision   applies   only   to   a discrete   aspect   of   a   business   relationship.   That   makes   it perhaps less obvious that one is to consider the required efforts   in   a   broader   context.   For   example,   one   court",
  "suggested, in dicta, that a party that undertook to use best efforts to take all actions necessary on its part to permit consummation of a merger might have to divest a subsidiary if   that   was   necessary   to   obtain   regulatory   approval.   See  Carteret Bancorp v. Home Group, Inc. , No. 9380, 1988 Del Ch. LEXIS 2, at *20–21 (Del. Ch. 13 Jan. 1988).  English Caselaw  8.65   In   Rhodia International Holdings Ltd v. Huntsman International LLC   [2007] EWHC 292 (Comm), the court held as follows: As a matter of language and business common sense, untrammelled by authority, one would surely conclude that [“best endeavours” and “reasonable endeavours” did not mean the same thing]. This is because there may be a number of reasonable courses which could be taken in a given situation to achieve a particular aim. An obligation to use reasonable endeavours to achieve the aim probably only requires a party to take one reasonable course, not all of them, whereas an obligation to use best endeavours probably requires a party to take all the reasonable courses he can.  8.66   Use of the words “surely” and “probably” is wishful thinking —the court’s reasoning is inconsistent with the evidence (see 8.18–.28, 8.31–.32).  8.67   And in   UBH (Mechanical Services) Ltd v. Standard Life Assurance Co.   T.L.R., 13 Nov. 1986 (Q.B.), the court suggested, contrary to   English   usage   (see   8.31–.32),   that   “the   phrase   ‘all reasonable   endeavours’   is   probably   a   middle   position somewhere   between   the   other   two,   implying   something more   than   reasonable   endeavours   but   less   than   best endeavours.” For a more recent English case to the same effect, see   Hiscox Syndicates v. Pinnacle Limited   [2008] EWHC 145 (Ch). See also   Astor Management AG v. Atalaya Mining plc  [2017] EWHC 425, at para. 67 (Comm) (referring to “judging whether the endeavours used were ‘reasonable’, or whether",
  "there were other steps which it was reasonable to take so that it cannot be said that ‘all reasonable endeavours’ have been used”).  8.68   These   cases   are   symptomatic   of   an   English   approach   to contract interpretation that prizes spurious distinctions over plain meaning. (For similarly problematic English caselaw relating to   represents and warrants , see 3.405.)  8.69   In   Jet2.com Ltd v. Blackpool Airport Ltd   [2012] EWCA Civ 417, which involved a dispute over what an airport operator had to do to comply with a   best endeavours   obligation, the English Court of Appeal displayed a more logical approach. In its opinion, it didn’t discuss gradations of   endeavours   provisions, even though the contract used both   best endeavours   and   all reasonable   endeavours .   The   court   said   that   the   “natural meaning   of   [‘all   reasonable   endeavours’]   is   that   [the appellant] would do   its best   to ensure that charges made for ground services would support Jet2’s low-cost pricing model.” (Emphasis added.) That suggests a willingness to equate   best  with   reasonable   in this context. The court also noted that the litigants had agreed that the two   endeavours   standards “meant the same thing.”  8.70   Perhaps the   Jet2.com   case is a sign that there’s hope for a return to a more rational approach to   endeavours   provisions in England. But judging by the analyses offered by law firms, many   English   lawyers   appear   to   endorse   the   notion   that different   endeavours   provisions   express   varying   degrees   of onerousness.  Canadian Caselaw  8.71   The leading Canadian case on   best efforts   is an opinion of the British Columbia Supreme Court,   Atmospheric Diving Systems Inc. v. International Hard Suits Inc.   (1994), 89 B.C.L.R. (2d) 356 (S.C.). Here are the first two points of its seven-point digest of the relevant caselaw:",
  "1.   “Best efforts” imposes a higher obligation than a “reasonable effort”. 2.   “Best efforts” means taking, in good faith, all reasonable steps to achieve the objective, carrying the process to its logical conclusion and leaving no stone unturned.  8.72   So   a   best   efforts   obligation   represents   a   more   onerous standard than does   reasonable efforts   ... but to comply with that obligation, all that’s required is that you act reasonably! The   court’s   first   two   points   are   incompatible,   so   the ostensible   distinction   collapses.   But   that   hasn’t   stopped courts from citing it as precedent. See, e.g.,   Diamond Robinson Building Ltd. v. Conn , 2010 BCSC 76. And Canadian law firms continue mentioning it in earnest misinformation on   efforts  standards.  8.73   Another legacy of   Atmospheric Diving Systems   is the tendency of Canadian lawyers to invoke “leaving no stone unturned” to   explain   what   best   efforts   means.   It’s   silly   to   think   a metaphor can reduce the uncertainty inherent in vagueness.  Other Caselaw  8.74   In   Hospital Products Ltd. v. United States Surgical Corp . (1984), 156 CLR 41, at 64, the High Court of Australia stated sensibly that “an obligation to use ‘best endeavours’ does not require the person who undertakes the obligation to go beyond the bounds of reason; he is required to do all he reasonably can in the circumstances to achieve the contractual object, but no more.” But the urge to create an unwarranted distinction is strong: in   Waters Lane v. Sweeney   [2007] NSWCA 200, the New South Wales Court of Appeal noted, but did not follow, a distinction offered by the trial court.  8.75   In   KS Energy Services Ltd v. BR Energy (M) Sdn Bhd   [2014] SGCA 16,   the   Singapore   Court   of   Appeal   considered   the implications   of   an   obligation   to   use   “all   reasonable",
  "endeavours.”   The   court   surveyed   relevant   caselaw   in Singapore, England, and Australia. To its credit, the court held that “we do not find it useful to distinguish an ‘all reasonable endeavours’ obligation from a ‘best endeavours’ obligation.” But the court also held that “We accept that an ‘all   reasonable   endeavours’   obligation   is   ordinarily   more onerous   than   a   ‘reasonable   endeavours’   obligation.”   That doesn’t make sense (see 8.31–.32, 8.67).  Misleading Commentary on Caselaw  8.76   In the United States, those who work with contracts are confused about   efforts   standards, but courts have dealt with them sensibly. Ideally, commentators would act as a bridge between   the   two   constituencies,   explaining   to   those   who work with contracts that the ostensible distinctions between  efforts   standards are an illusion. But unfortunately, much of the commentary on   efforts   standards is ill-informed.  8.77   For example, according to   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 108, “[T]he majority view is for courts to consider   best efforts   as imposing a higher standard than   reasonable efforts . But   others   treat   the   two   as   synonyms.”   That’s   woefully inaccurate.  8.78   The entry continues: Perhaps the safest course is, when possible, to use a   best- efforts   provision when insisting on an opposite number’s performance—and to use a   reasonable-efforts   provision for one’s own client’s performance. Yet the phrases are fuzzy, the judicial decisions irreconcilable, and the effects admittedly uncertain.  8.79   So with a shrug,   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage   leaves its readers to figure out for themselves how to handle   efforts  standards.  8.80   Efforts   misinformation has even appeared in the news. For example, Gretchen Morgensen,   After Merger, Two Competing",
  "Drugs and Billion-Dollar Questions , N.Y. Times, 13 Nov. 2015, says this: Under the agreement, Sanofi would make “diligent efforts” to shepherd Lemtrada through the F.D.A. approval process and promote it as it would any drug. This set out a higher standard than Sanofi would have faced under an agreement to make only a “reasonable effort” with the drug.  8.81   That might accurately reflect the conventional wisdom in some circles, but it doesn’t accurately reflect the caselaw or how the English language works.  The Uniform Commercial Code  8.82   The drafters of article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code evidently   saw   no   distinction   between   best   efforts   and  reasonable efforts . Section 2-306(2) states as follows regarding implied obligations: A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale.  8.83   Official Comment 5 to section 2-306(2) says that subsection (2) makes explicit the commercial rule under which parties “are held to have impliedly, even when not expressly, bound themselves to use reasonable diligence as well as good faith in their performance of the contract.” Whatever might have been intended by equating   best efforts   with reasonableness, diligence, and good faith in this manner, doing so precludes, for purposes of article 2, using   best efforts   as a more onerous standard than   reasonable efforts .  HOW TO DRAFT   EFFORTS   PROVISIONS",
  "8.84   Efforts   provisions are a source of confusion and uncertainty, but those who draft or review contracts can cut through the fog   with   efforts   provisions   that   aren’t   susceptible   to misinterpretation.  Whenever Possible, Be Precise Instead of Vague  8.85   Efforts   standards are vague, and as such they can lead to a dispute (see 7.42) and unpredictable outcomes at trial (see 8.50–.53). Ideally, use   efforts   provisions only if justified by a party’s   lack   of   control   (see   7.44).   Avoid   using   efforts  provisions   as   an   expedient   alternative   to   being   specific (see 7.45).  Use Only   Reasonable Efforts  8.86   Although it’s clear from the evidence that there’s no basis for claiming   reasonable   efforts,   best   efforts,   and   other   efforts standards   require anything other than what is reasonable, judges (depending on the jurisdiction) and those who work with contracts will doubtless continue to seek to distinguish the two by claiming that a party under an obligation to use  best efforts   must be willing to take extraordinary measures (see 8.15–.17). So using   efforts   standards other than   reasonable efforts   will always entail a significant risk of confusion, and you can’t rely on them to deliver what many think they promise. To avoid that, use only   reasonable efforts .  8.87   You could use something more colloquial, such as   shall try , but the concept of   efforts   is entrenched in contracts. In a precedent-driven part of a conservative profession, it’s best not to try to teach old dogs new tricks unless the benefits are meaningful.  8.88   To   reduce   the   vagueness   inherent   in   a   reasonable   efforts  obligation, make it an unqualified obligation of the party in question to perform in addition tasks that are related to the desired goal and that the party does have control over. For example, you could supplement an obligation that Acme use",
  "reasonable efforts to obtain a permit by requiring that by a specified date Acme apply for the permit.  8.89   If the other side of a transaction balks at using   reasonable efforts , tell them that the notion that   best efforts   is more onerous than   reasonable efforts   is mistaken and that caselaw doesn’t   support   it   (in   the   United   States)   or   is   confusing (elsewhere).   If   the   other   side   nevertheless   insists   on   best efforts   and your client wishes to do the deal, consider telling the other side that your client is prepared to sign but doesn’t accept their view of the implications of   best efforts   and is prepared to litigate if that ever becomes an issue.  8.90   You might be tempted to use   best efforts   in a contract because the other side isn’t aware of the U.S. caselaw on   best efforts  and as a result might exert itself more than it would have if the contract had contained a reasonable efforts standard. But it would be more conducive to healthy contract relations if you sought a meeting of the minds.  Consider Using   Reasonable Efforts   Instead of   Reasonable Endeavours  8.91   Those who use   endeavours   instead of   efforts —they’re mostly in England and Australia—should consider joining the rest of the world in using   efforts . The word   endeavours   is dated. A Google Ngram of use of   efforts   and   endeavours   in Google’s British-English corpus of digitized books shows that despite some ups and downs, use of   efforts   in 1950 was essentially where it was in 1800, but from 1950 to 2000 it experienced an upswing. By contrast, although in 1800   endeavours   was used only slightly less frequently than   efforts , from 1800 to 2000   endeavours   experienced a long decline that suggests it’s headed for oblivion. The modern choice is   efforts .  8.92   In a newsletter available online in 2014, one English law firm said this: Also, please note that the majority of English case law",
  "looks at the interpretation of phrases using “endeavours” rather than “efforts”. Consequently, for greater certainty of interpretation of such terms, it is better to frame obligations under English law as requiring the use of “endeavours” rather than “efforts”.  8.93   That’s   unnecessarily   timid.   Although   English   caselaw   on  endeavours   is misguided (see 8.65–.70), nothing suggests that English courts would consider that use of   efforts   instead of  endeavours   has substantive implications.  Set Standards for Measuring Performance  8.94   Consistent with caselaw on the subject (see 8.59), state in  efforts   provisions how performance is to be measured. For example, don’t just say   Acme shall manufacture widgets —state the timeframe for performing. You could state a period of time ( one year ), or you could just use   promptly   (see 8.60).  8.95   Find a way to express what volume of widgets Acme must manufacture to comply with the obligation. But it wouldn’t make sense to express it as a number of widgets—if you could do that, you wouldn’t need to use an   efforts   provision.  8.96   Similarly,   courts   can   be   unrealistic   in   saying   that   efforts  provisions must include guidelines. For example, New York caselaw refers to the need for “a clear set of guidelines against which to measure a party’s best efforts” to enforce such a provision. See   TPTCC NY v. Radiation Therapy Services , 784 F. Supp. 2d 485, 506–07 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), quoting   Mocca Lounge v. Misak , 94 A.D.2d 761, 763 (N.Y. App. Div. 1983). Again, it doesn’t make sense to expect drafters to offer much in the way of guidelines for interpreting   reasonable efforts   provisions: the whole point of   reasonable efforts   provisions is that drafters use them when they can’t or don’t want to be specific.  8.97   Understand   how   other   provisions   might   affect   a   court’s notions of what performance is expected under an   efforts  provision. Suppose you’ve prepared a contract that imposes",
  "on   Acme   an   obligation   to   use   reasonable   efforts   to   sell widgets. If you leave it at that, a fight could arise at any time over whether Acme has used reasonable efforts.  8.98   You could add to the contract a provision saying that you may terminate if Acme doesn’t reach stated sales targets. That would give you an exit that you wouldn’t have to fight over. But the trade-off is that if Acme achieves those targets, you might well have a harder time convincing a court that Acme hasn’t used reasonable efforts, even though the one isn’t necessarily related to the other. After all, it could be that unexpected   market   conditions   mean   that   Acme   reached those targets easily, and since doing so it has twiddled its thumbs. But you couldn’t blame a court for assuming that any target you set for termination constitutes your minimum notion of acceptable performance by Acme.  8.99   And for two reasons, using sales targets in a termination provision wouldn’t eliminate the need for a   reasonable efforts  obligation. First, you would retain the possibility of an action for breach, even if it might be challenging to recover if Acme meets the targets. Second, and more importantly, retaining a  reasonable   efforts   obligation   would   give   you   a   basis   for terminating the contract for breach (depending on how the termination provisions are worded) instead of having to wait until Acme fails to meet the targets.  Eliminate Clutter and Inconsistency  8.100   Of the verbs used with   efforts   (see 8.12), the best option is  use . If contracts filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are at all representative,   use   is the most popular option. Using   make   would be more colloquial, but no one would mistake for colloquial English provisions using the phrase   reasonable   efforts ,   and   there’s   no   point   pretending otherwise.  8.101   Omit   all   (see 8.11, 8.31–.32), and don’t use a pronoun (see 8.12).",
  "8.102   Instead of   every effort   (see 8.12), use   efforts   in the plural. Consistency favors using only one or the other, and   efforts   is the more widely used.  8.103   Some contracts require a party to use efforts to accomplish something   to the extent possible   (or words to that effect). That notion   is   redundant,   because   it’s   implicit   in   an   efforts  provision   that   the   party   under   the   obligation   might   be unable to comply, even after making the required effort. The phrase can be deleted, as in this example:  Acme shall use reasonable efforts to cancel or mitigate , to the extent possible,   each obligation that would cause Acme to incur expenses ... .  8.104   Don’t refer to good faith or diligence in a   reasonable efforts  provision,   as   in   Each   party   shall   use   reasonable   efforts, undertaken diligently and in good faith, to obtain all Consents before Closing . Mixing different standards would only muddy the waters. And don’t place the modifier after   efforts   in any other way (see 8.13).  Don’t Use More than One   Efforts   Standard in a Contract  8.105   Because the notion that different   efforts   standards convey different   meanings   is   unworkable,   using   two   or   more different   efforts   standards   in   a   single   contract   invites confusion. But it’s routine for contracts to have multiple  efforts   standards.  8.106   Usually   it’s   the   result   of   promiscuous   copy-and-pasting without   taking   the   trouble   to   make   sure   everything   is consistent. A sign of that is when you have not only multiple  efforts   standards   but   also   inconsistent   ancillary   usages, notably the verb used (see 8.12), whether pronouns are used (see 8.12), and whether   all   is used (see 8.11).  8.107   But sometimes it’s clear that the drafter intended to invoke different efforts standards. Here are two examples of that:  Guarantors shall use reasonable best efforts to file, and shall use",
  "commercially reasonable efforts to have become effective ... . Each party shall use best efforts, and in no event less than reasonable efforts, to ensure that the confidentiality of the other party’s Confidential Information will be maintained ... .  8.108   Regarding the first example, a judge asked to interpret it should treat it as an example of mistake, whatever the drafter thought they were doing. The second example is nonsense:  and in no event   is for adding a precise standard after a vague one; it’s not for adding another vague standard after a vague one.  Defining   Reasonable Efforts  8.109   Even though the phrase   reasonable efforts   doesn’t pose the same risk of confusion as   best efforts , consider using it as a defined term. Doing so might assist a court and might help the   parties   better   understand   the   implications   of   using  reasonable efforts . And in the definition the parties could fine- tune their understanding of what   reasonable efforts   means.  THE   CORE   DEFINITION  8.110   A definition of   reasonable efforts   should specify what the core meaning   is—it   will   necessarily   be   vague—and   specify anything that’s to be excluded from the definition. Here is the recommended core definition:  “ Reasonable Efforts ” means, regarding conduct by a party, the efforts that a reasonable person in the position of that party would use to engage in that conduct competently and promptly.  8.111   For a definition to apply in all contexts, it must reflect that  reasonable   efforts   isn’t   used   exclusively   in   obligations—it could also be used in a conditional clause ( If Acme fails to use reasonable efforts   ...) or even in a statement of fact ( Acme states that it has used reasonable efforts   ...).  8.112   Use of   reasonable efforts   isn’t just about getting something done competently and promptly. It might not even relate to",
  "accomplishing a specific task. Instead, it might be a matter of maintaining   a   status,   or   stopping   something   from happening. It would make sense to elucidate in the   reasonable efforts   provision   the   parties’   expectations   regarding   the activity in question.  8.113   The parties might want to specify that what   reasonable efforts  means   is   to   be   determined   by   reference   to   the   party   in question’s   past   practice   or   the   practice   in   a   particular industry. That could be accomplished by tacking on to the end of the core definition   consistent with its past practice   or, say,   consistent with the practice of comparable pharmaceuticals companies   regarding   pharmaceutical   products   of   comparable market potential . That might spare a court from having to come up with a suitable benchmark (see 8.62).  8.114   Otherwise, the core definition could be customized to reflect that,   for   example,   reasonable   efforts   is   used   only   in obligations, or that all instances of   reasonable efforts   apply to only one party.  8.115   Sometimes   a   definition   of   reasonable   efforts   will   specify actions that a party must take for its efforts to constitute reasonable efforts. For example, when in a registration rights agreement an issuer is required to use reasonable efforts to cause a registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable   after   filing,   the   contract   typically   uses   as   a definition of   reasonable efforts   something like this:  “ Reasonable Efforts ” means, among other things, that the Company shall submit to the SEC, within two business days after the Company learns that no review of a particular Registration Statement will be made by the staff of the SEC or that the staff has no further comments on the Registration Statement, as the case may be, a request for acceleration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement to a time and date not later than 48 hours after submission of that request.  8.116   Don’t   use   such   definitions:   A   reasonable   efforts   standard captures what the parties can’t or don’t want to address in",
  "detail when they enter into the contract (see 8.3–.5). If you’re able to express in an absolute obligation something that a party must accomplish, state it as a freestanding obligation rather than in a definition of   reasonable efforts . And more generally, don’t use in autonomous definitions language of obligation   and   other   language   suited   to   substantive provisions (see 6.53).  CARVE - OUTS  8.117   Because   the   principal   concern   of   a   party   subject   to   a  reasonable efforts   standard would be to avoid having to take actions out of proportion to the benefits to it under the contract (see 8.50–.53), it’s likely that negotiations regarding the   definition   of   reasonable   efforts   would   mostly   concern carve-outs,   which   specify   what’s   excluded   from   the definition.  8.118   One issue is the language used to introduce carve-outs. Often a definition will place the carve-outs in a proviso:   provided, however, that an obligation to use Reasonable Efforts under this agreement does not require the promisor to ... .   But given the shortcomings of the traditional proviso (see 13.665), a clearer and   more   economical   way   to   introduce   carve-outs   in definitions is by using   but does not include   (see 6.41).  8.119   Because carve-outs are intended to provide certainty to offset the vagueness of the core definition, they should be specific. For   example,   one   could   exclude   from   the   definition   of  reasonable efforts   any one or more of the following (revising the wording to include any defined terms): incurring expenses [in excess of $X individually and $Y in the aggregate] other than as provided in this agreement incurring liabilities changing that party’s business strategy disposing of significant assets of that party taking actions that would violate any law or order to which",
  "that party is subject taking actions that would imperil that party’s existence or solvency initiating any litigation or arbitration  8.120   Some commonly used carve-outs would likely fall outside the scope   of   reasonable   efforts   anyway,   but   a   party   might nevertheless   wish   to   make   doubly   sure   of   avoiding   any dispute   over   what   kind   of   efforts   are   required.   Here’s   an example of such a carve-out: taking actions that would, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material adverse change in that party  ADD - INS  8.121   If you have in mind that complying with a given   reasonable efforts   obligation might require conduct that goes beyond what would be considered reasonable, you could say as much by supplementing a definition, or the provision itself, with something   like   the   following,   which   takes   an   extreme approach that is broadly consistent with what many think  best efforts   means:  Acme acknowledges that the money that a reasonable person in Acme’s position would be willing to expend on, and the personnel that a reasonable person in Acme’s position would be willing to devote to, complying with its obligations under this section 11 are unlimited.  8.122   But don’t be surprised if the other side reacts adversely.",
  "MATERIAL   AND   MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE  MATERIAL  9.1   An important drafting tool is the adjective   material , as in  Widgetco is not party to any material litigation . Drafters use it, and the adverb   materially   (as in   at a price materially below Fair Market Value ), to narrow an otherwise overly broad provision so it covers only what really matters. Whether something is material   depends   on   the   circumstances— material   and  materially   are vague words (see 7.42).  9.2   The word   material   features   in   the   phrase   material adverse change , or   MAC . (The phrase   material adverse effect , or   MAE , is used to convey essentially the same meaning; see 9.69–.77.) MAC provisions are always a focus of attention, particularly when uncertain economic conditions prompt deal parties, and   the   business   and   legal   communities   as   a   whole,   to consider anew on what basis a MAC provision would allow a party to get out of a deal.  Vagueness  9.3   In   TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc. , 426 U.S. 438 (1976), the U.S. Supreme Court articulated what material means in securities fraud cases: “An omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider   it   important   in   deciding   how   to   vote.”   (In   this chapter,   this   meaning   is   called   the   “affects-a-decision” meaning.)",
  "9.4   The influence of that decision can be seen in   Black’s Law Dictionary , which gives as one meaning of   material   “Of such a nature that knowledge of the item would affect a person’s decision-making.”   The   affects-a-decision   meaning   has   also been embraced in cases addressing suppression of evidence in criminal   matters   and   a   variety   of   other   fields,   as   well   as in Delaware Court of Chancery opinions on materiality in a merger-and-acquisitions (M&A) context, including   IBP, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. , 789 A.2d 14 (Del. Ch. 2001). In an M&A context, and from the buyer’s perspective, this meaning of  material   refers to information that would have caused the buyer not to enter into the agreement or would cause the buyer not to want to close the transaction. The standard is a high one—think “deal-breaker.”  9.5   But the affects-a-decision meaning is inescapably vague. The  TSC Industries   definition uses three vague words ( substantial ,  reasonable , and   important ).  9.6   Lawyers apparently think that if you add enough words, you can escape vagueness. That much is suggested by the wordy but still vague definitions of   material   offered by regulatory bodies. See Emily Chasan,   Definition of Materiality Depends Who You Ask , Wall St. Journal, 3 Nov. 2015.  A Source of Ambiguity  9.7   According   to   Black’s   Law   Dictionary ,   another   meaning   of  material   is “significant”—in other words, important enough to   merit   attention.   This   meaning   encompasses   a   broader range of significance than the affects-a-decision meaning—in this sense of the word, for something to be material to a contract party, it would simply have to be of more than trivial significance.  9.8   In a particular provision, such as the statement of fact   Acme’s financial   records   contain   no   material   inaccuracies ,   either meaning could conceivably be intended. So   material   is not only vague, it’s ambiguous, although that isn’t the case with",
  "material   when used in the phrase   material adverse change   (see 9.16, 9.88).  9.9   This ambiguity could cause confusion. For example, a buyer and   its   counsel   might   assume   that   any   nontrivial nondisclosure   regarding   a   statement   of   fact   containing   a qualification using   material   would render that statement of fact   inaccurate.   By   contrast,   a   court   might   hold   that   for purposes   of   that   statement   of   fact,   material   conveys   the affects-a-decision meaning. That could result in the buyer not being entitled to indemnification for nondisclosure regarding a statement of fact qualified using   material   unless it were to meet the high standard associated with that meaning.  How   Material   Is Used  9.10   Given that cases addressing materiality invariably invoke the affects-a-decision   meaning,   one   might   ask   whether   the ambiguity   inherent   in   material   is   theoretical   and   of   no practical significance. But lawyers use the word   material   so liberally in drafts and in negotiation as to make it unlikely that each time they do so they have in mind a deal-breaker level of significance. Two pieces of evidence suggest that regardless of the caselaw, in many contexts drafters do in fact have   in   mind   the   important-enough-to-merit-attention meaning when they use the word   material .  9.11   First, attributing the affects-a-decision meaning to the word  material   would often strip a provision of much of its utility. Consider this statement of fact:   There is no material litigation pending   against   the   Company.   If   in   this   statement   of   fact  material   were given the affects-a-decision meaning, it would be   inaccurate   only   if   litigation   were   pending   against   the Company and it were sufficiently significant that it would affect the buyer’s decision whether to go ahead with the transaction. But one suspects that that’s not what the buyer had in mind—that instead it would want to be compensated for   any   losses   it   incurs   due   to   any   nontrivial   pending",
  "litigation that it hadn’t been informed of. For the statement of fact to convey that meaning,   material   would have to mean “important enough to merit attention.”  9.12   Consider also this example:   A credit agreement requires the lender to deliver certain forms unless doing so would result in the imposition   on   the   Lender   of   any   additional   material   legal   or regulatory burdens, any additional material out-of-pocket costs not indemnified hereunder, or be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Lender . It’s unlikely in this case that the lender thought it   would   be   reimbursed   only   if   the   burdens,   costs,   and disadvantages   imposed   on   the   lender   were   sufficiently significant that it wouldn’t have made the loan if it had known about them.  9.13   And the phrase   material breach   could mean different things depending on where it occurs in a contract. In the statement of   fact   Widgetco   is   not   in   material   breach   of   any   Excelsior Contract ,   the   drafter   might   well   have   intended   that   only trivial breaches would render it inaccurate. By contrast, for the   termination   provision   Widgetco   may   terminate   this agreement on material breach by Acme of any its obligations under this agreement , it’s likely that the drafter had in mind the affects-a-decision meaning of   material .  9.14   The second piece of evidence suggesting that drafters do in fact have in mind the important-enough-to-merit-attention meaning of   material   is that in some contexts one cannot, as a matter of semantics, say that   material   conveys the affects-a- decision meaning.  9.15   Consider this statement of fact:   The Seller is not in breach of any material contract to which it is party.   The focus of this statement of fact is breach of the contracts, not the contracts themselves. It wouldn’t make sense to modify the phrase  contract to which it is party   (as opposed to the word   breach ) with the word   material   if it were meant to convey the affects- a-decision   meaning.   In   this   context,   material   could   only mean “important enough to merit attention.”",
  "9.16   Courts and practitioners appear to accept that in the phrase  material adverse change , the word   material   conveys the affects- a-decision meaning—any party invoking a MAC provision would need to make a strong showing (see 9.4). But in any other context, either meaning of   material   could conceivably be the one intended. Although the context might suggest that one or the other meaning is intended, from a semantics perspective one cannot know for sure, because agreements invariably fail to specify which meaning is intended. For example, in the phrase   material inaccuracy , it’s not clear how significant   an   inaccuracy   must   be   in   order   for   it   to   be material.  Avoiding Ambiguity  9.17   As   described   in   9.7–.9,   drafters   use   material   not   only   to express the affects-a-decision meaning but also to express the important-enough-to-merit-attention   meaning.   That   can create confusion.  9.18   Because courts attribute the affects-a-decision meaning to  material , that can be considered the safe meaning—it would be counterproductive to look for another word to express that meaning. Instead, the sensible thing to do would be to look for another word to express the meaning “important enough to merit attention.”  9.19   The   obvious   candidate   for   that   is   significant .   There’s precedent for according   significant   the important-enough-to- merit-attention meaning: In connection with guidance on evaluating internal controls, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has defined the term “significant deficiency” to mean   a   deficiency   “that   is   less   severe   than   a   material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible   for   oversight   of   the   registrant’s   financial reporting.” See SEC Release No. 33-8829.  9.20   But colloquially,   significant   can be used to suggest a greater level of importance— That was a significant achievement!   So it’s",
  "not a safe choice.  9.21   Previous   editions   of   this   manual   recommended   using  significant   as a defined term. Now this manual recommends using instead the word   nontrivial . It’s a little awkward, but that’s more than offset by how it makes it clear that the standard can be triggered by something at the less important end of the spectrum of importance: anything more than trivial is nontrivial.  9.22   Nontrivial   is vague, so it’s possible to have differences of opinion as to whether something is nontrivial. But because it relates to the less-important end of the spectrum, not much would be at stake. Given that its meaning is relatively clear and given that serious fights over what   nontrivial   means are unlikely, no purpose would be served treating it as a defined term.  9.23   Trivial   can be useful too— Acme’s financial records contain no inaccuracies other than trivial inaccuracies .  Defining   Material  9.24   Using   nontrivial   to express the meaning “important enough to merit attention” reduces the risk of ambiguity. But the risk of confusion remains, because some readers might not know that   courts   attribute   the   affects-a-decision   meaning   to  material .  9.25   The surest way to avoid that confusion would be to use  material   as a defined term and define it to make explicit that it expresses the affects-a-decision meaning. You would also need to make clear whose perspective applies for determining materiality. In   IBP, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. , 789 A.2d 14 (Del. Ch.   2001),   the   court   considered   materiality   from   the perspective of the “reasonable acquiror”; for this approach to apply   in   any   context,   one   would   need   to   refer   to   the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the party in question. (A more conventional alternative would be",
  "simply to say, for example,   from the Buyer’s perspective , but it’s preferable to make it clear that the standard isn’t a subjective one—you wouldn’t adopt the perspective of an unreasonable buyer.)  9.26   You might find it useful to also define   materially.   As a matter of   logic,   it’s   the   most   appropriate   choice   to   use   in   the bringdown condition (see 9.52) instead of the phrase   material adverse change   (see 9.56).  9.27   Exactly how you would define   material   would depend on the context and on which parties are covered by the definition. This definition of   material   would apply to the buyer in an M&A transaction:  Definition of “Material” and “Materially” (Applies to the Buyer)  “ Material ” and “ Materially ” refer to a level of significance that would have affected any decision of a reasonable person in the Buyer’s position regarding whether to enter into this agreement or would affect any decision of a reasonable person in the Buyer’s position regarding whether to consummate the transaction contemplated by this agreement.  9.28   By referring to entry into the agreement and consummation of   the   transaction,   the   definition   addresses   circumstances relating to the periods before and after signing.  9.29   It’s commonplace for both the seller and the buyer to be subject to provisions containing a materiality standard. For example, if in a contract the bringdown condition to the buyer’s obligations is subject to a materiality standard, often the   bringdown   condition   to   the   seller’s   obligations   will likewise incorporate a materiality standard (see 9.53). In such contexts, the definition of   Materially   (and   Material   too) would need to apply to all parties:  Definition of “Material” and “Materially” (Applies to More Than One Party)  “ Material ” and “ Materially ” refer, regarding a given Person, to a level of significance that would have affected any decision of a",
  "reasonable person in that Person’s position regarding whether to enter into this agreement or would affect any decision of a reasonable person in that Person’s position regarding whether to consummate the transaction contemplated by this agreement.  9.30   It’s not the current practice to treat   material   as a defined term, and this manual doesn’t suggest that it should become standard to do so. But it might be appropriate for a particular transaction.  Limiting Qualifications Relating to Significance  9.31   A buyer that wishes to close a transaction without delay might be amenable to having a statement of fact be subject to a qualification using   material   or   nontrivial   if the alternative would be having the seller devote an inordinate amount of time to compiling a schedule of exceptions. Beyond that, whether to make a statement of fact or a condition subject to such a qualification is essentially a function of the respective bargaining power of the parties.  9.32   But   some   statements   of   fact   are   rarely   subject   to qualifications relating to significance, either because they are too straightforward to be anything other than unqualified or because   the   matters   being   represented   are   sufficiently fundamental   that   the   buyer   is   unwilling   to   accept   any inaccuracies. Such statements of fact include statements of fact as to organization, capitalization, and authority to enter into the transaction.  9.33   Of the two standards, qualifications using   nontrivial   seem the less useful. Determining whether an issue merits the buyer’s attention is prone to arbitrariness, given the low threshold involved. A party could reasonably claim that if it’s willing to go   to   court   to   recover   damages   it   claims   arose   from inaccuracy of a statement of fact subject to a qualification using   nontrivial ,   then   by   definition   the   inaccuracy   was nontrivial.",
  "9.34   So consider using bright-line alternatives to a qualification using   nontrivial.   Instead of having a party make a statement of fact as to absence of   breach of any nontrivial agreement to which the Seller is party , you could refer to absence of   breach of any agreement to which Acme is party listed in schedule 2.4.   And rather than having a party make a statement of fact as to absence of   any pending nontrivial litigation , consider referring to absence of litigation over a stated dollar amount or seeking injunctive   relief.   (Using   quantitative   guidelines   in   this manner   to   replace   materiality   is   different   from   using quantitative guidelines in defining MAC; see 9.91.)  9.35   And in some contexts you might decide to dispense with a qualification using   nontrivial   and do without any substitute. For example, rather than imposing on Acme a duty to notify Widgetco of changes that merit attention in an agreement that Acme has entered into with a nonparty, it would be simpler to impose an unqualified obligation if it’s unlikely that   the   agreement   would   be   amended   sufficiently extensively, and sufficiently often, to render that obligation burdensome. So in this instance, a significance qualification would accomplish nothing other than to add an unnecessary element of uncertainty.  9.36   And more generally, in a transaction that provides for a delayed   closing   and   indemnification,   the   seller   might   be willing   to   omit   from   its   statements   of   fact   some   or   all qualifications   relating   to   significance—whether   using  material ,   nontrivial ,   or   more   precise   alternatives—if   you incorporate   a   materiality   qualification   in   the   seller’s bringdown condition (see 9.45), using   materially   (see 9.27), and   specify   in   the   indemnification   provisions   that indemnification   doesn’t   apply   until   indemnifiable   losses have reached a specified amount—in other words, if you establish   a   “basket,”   whether   of   the   “threshold”   or “deductible” variety. Doing so should eliminate any concern on the part of the seller that giving an unqualified statement of fact could result in the transaction not closing due to a",
  "relatively minor inaccuracy, or result in that party’s incurring indemnification liability for a relatively minor inaccuracy.  9.37   A   seller   might   want   to   retain   qualifications   relating   to significance in any statements of fact that it expects would otherwise likely be inaccurate when made at closing, but it should be able instead to address that concern by negotiating an appropriate basket.  Which Noun to Modify  9.38   A statement of fact might contain only one noun that could be   modified   by   material ,   as   in   example   [1]   below.   But   a statement of fact might contain two such nouns, raising the question   whether   for   qualifying   the   statement   of   fact   by materiality you should modify one or the other noun, as in [2] and [2a], or both, as in [2b]. It would make the most sense to modify the noun that’s the focus of the statement of fact. The focus of example [2] and its variants is contract defaults, not the contracts themselves, so it would make the most sense to have   material   modify   default , as in [2].  [1]   Schedule 4.8 lists each material contract to which the Seller is party. [2]   The Seller is not in material default under any contract to which it is party. [2a]   The Seller is not in default under any material contract to which it is party. [2b]   The Seller is not in material default under any material contract to which it is party.  9.39   By contrast, example [2a] would seem both overinclusive and underinclusive—it would be rendered inaccurate by any default under any of the contracts in question, no matter how trivial, but wouldn’t be rendered inaccurate by default under   a   contract   that   doesn’t   meet   the   high   level   of significance inherent in   material , no matter how serious the consequences   of   that   default.   And   [2b]   would   be underinclusive—it would seem unhelpful to exclude from the scope of the statement of fact, just because they involve",
  "contracts other than material contracts, defaults that would otherwise fall within the definition of   material .  MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE  9.40   MAC   provisions   raise   many   subtle   drafting   issues.   These issues fall into two categories: those relating to using MAC provisions and—since MAC is generally used as a defined term—those relating to how MAC is defined. (If all that you are looking for is a basic definition of MAC, see 9.80.)  Using   Material Adverse Change  WHERE   MAC   PROVISIONS   ARE   USED  9.41   MAC provisions are used in different parts of a contract. They occur most commonly in statements of fact, where they can be used in two ways.  9.42   First,   a   party   can   make   a   statement   of   fact   regarding nonoccurrence   of   a   MAC   since   a   specified   date— Since 31 December 2016, no MAC has occurred . (This chapter uses the term “absolute MAC provision” to mean any provision that in this manner addresses directly nonoccurrence of a MAC. Regarding an expanded form of absolute MAC provision, see 9.68.)  9.43   A buyer might want to rephrase an absolute MAC statement of fact as follows to ensure that it also encompasses adverse changes   that   are   only   material   when   considered   in   the aggregate— Since 31 December 2016, no events or circumstances have occurred that constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a MAC.   But   in   this   context   a   court   should   be   willing   to aggregate   adverse   changes   even   without   explicit   contract language to that effect. The absolute MAE and the definition of MAE at issue in the   IBP   case didn’t explicitly provide for aggregation of adverse changes, yet the court didn’t dispute the defendant’s assertion that a combination of factors can amount to an MAE. See   IBP , 789 A.2d at 65 (noting that",
  "“taken together, Tyson claims that it is virtually indisputable that the combination of these factors amounts to a Material Adverse Effect”).  9.44   Second, a MAC provision can modify a statement of fact as to some aspect of a party’s operations to indicate the absence of anything leading to a MAC. The modification is in the negative when the noun or noun phrase being modified—in the   following   example,   inaccuracies —is   in   the   negative:  Acme’s   financial   records   contain   no   inaccuracies   except   for inaccuracies that would not reasonably be expected to result in a MAC.   The   modification   is   in   the   affirmative   when   the negative is expressed elsewhere in the statement of fact:   Acme is   not   [or   No   Seller   is ]   party   to   any   litigation   that   would reasonably be expected to result in a MAC.   (This chapter calls a “modifying”   MAC   provision   any   MAC   provision   that modifies   a   statement   of   fact   in   this   manner.)   Adding  individually   or   in   the   aggregate   would   aggregate,   for determining materiality, instances of the thing in question, but using a mass noun ( litigation ) or a plural count noun ( inaccuracies ) should be sufficient to accomplish that.  9.45   MACs also occur in closing conditions. Any statement of fact containing   a   MAC   provision   could,   with   a   suitable introduction, serve as a condition:   The Buyer’s   obligation to consummate at the Closing the transactions contemplated by this agreement is subject to satisfaction, or waiver by the Buyer, of the following   conditions   at   or   before   the   Closing:   ...   that   since 31 December 2016, a MAC has not occurred; that Acme is not party to any litigation that would reasonably be expected to result in a MAC ... .   It would, however, be redundant to repeat in the closing conditions any statements of fact made in that contract, since it’s standard practice to require as a closing condition   that   the   statements   of   fact   be   accurate   on   the closing date as well as on the signing date. This “bringdown” of the statements of fact would allow the party relying on the statements of fact to avoid its obligations under the contract",
  "if a statement of fact is inaccurate at closing. (The bringdown condition is discussed further at 9.51–.57.)  9.46   A MAC provision could be incorporated as a condition rather than   as   a   statement   of   fact,   but   it   would   afford   better protection   if   drafted   as   a   statement   of   fact:   although   an unsatisfied   condition   would   allow   a   party   to   walk,   an inaccurate statement of fact could also result in that party’s having   a   cause   of   action   for   damages   or   a   claim   for indemnification.  9.47   MAC provisions are also found in parts of a contract other than the statements of fact and conditions. For example, a contract might impose on Acme an obligation to promptly notify Widgetco of any MAC. And a contract governing an ongoing relationship between the parties, such as a license agreement, might give a party the right to terminate upon occurrence of a MAC affecting the other party. Similarly, a credit agreement might provide that occurrence of a MAC affecting the borrower constitutes an event of default.  MAC   VERSUS   SIMPLE   MATERIALITY  9.48   An alternative to a modifying MAC provision is simply to use the word   material   on its own. For example, the modifying MAC statement of fact in 9.44 could be rephrased as   Acme’s financial records contain no material inaccuracies . If Widgetco is concerned that an inaccuracy in an Acme statement of fact could adversely affect Acme’s fortunes, then in the interest of precision   it   would   be   best   to   use   MAC   to   qualify   that statement   of   fact,   even   though   a   court   might   hold   that  material   by itself in effect conveys the same meaning. But if Widgetco is instead concerned about a potential inaccuracy directly affecting Widgetco—if, for example, the statement of fact is in an asset purchase agreement and concerns an Acme asset that is of little significance to Acme but is central to Widgetco’s plans—it would be best to stick with   material .",
  "9.49   But not all provisions using   material   can be turned into MAC provisions. A statement of fact as to absence of any   breach of any material contract to which Acme is party   cannot, as a matter of semantics, be restructured to use a MAC provision instead (see 9.15).  9.50   In some contexts—for example, in a statement of fact stating that a party   has made no material change in any method of accounting or accounting practice —it’s likely that the drafter is seeking   to   convey   a   level   of   significance   below   that associated with MAC provisions (see 9.88). In that case, it would be best to restructure the provision to use   nontrivial  (see 9.21) as opposed to a MAC provision or to eliminate any significance qualification (see 9.34).  THE   BRINGDOWN   CONDITION  9.51   A   bringdown   condition   (including   the   introductory language) could be phrased like this:  The Buyer’s obligation to consummate the transaction contemplated by this agreement is subject to satisfaction of the following conditions: ... that the statements of fact made by the Seller in article 2 were accurate on the date of this agreement and are accurate at Closing;  9.52   But   usually   the   seller   succeeds   in   having   the   buyer’s bringdown condition be subject to a materiality qualification. Often that’s accomplished by having the condition require that the statements of fact be   accurate   in all material respects , but   materially accurate   is a more concise way of expressing the same concept:  that individually and in the aggregate, the statements of fact made by the Seller in article 2 were materially accurate on the date of this agreement and are materially accurate at Closing;  9.53   You could elect to use   materially   as a defined term (see 9.26). If you do and, as is often the case, the bringdown condition to the buyer’s obligations and the bringdown condition to",
  "the   seller’s   obligations   both   incorporate   a   materiality standard,   materially   would have to be defined to apply to all parties   (see   9.29).   That   in   turn   would   require   that   each bringdown condition make it clear from whose perspective materiality is determined:  that from the Buyer’s perspective, individually and in the aggregate the statements of fact made by the Seller in article 2 were Materially accurate on the date of this agreement and are Materially accurate at Closing;  9.54   If   a   bringdown   condition   incorporates   a   materiality qualification, it would be to the buyer’s benefit to have it include   the   phrase   individually   and   in   the   aggregate ,   so materiality is determined by considering not only the extent to which each statement of fact is inaccurate but also the cumulative effect of all inaccuracies. Arguably that could be accomplished by saying just   in the aggregate , but using the longer phrase makes it clearer what is intended.  9.55   If you omit   individually and in the aggregate , the bringdown condition should refer to   each statement of fact made by the Seller —that would make it clear that the cumulative effect of all inaccuracies has no effect on materiality.  9.56   A   materiality   qualification   incorporated   in   a   bringdown condition is often phrased using MAC. But it’s illogical to think in terms of a statement-of-fact inaccuracy resulting in a MAC, given that the only consequence of an inaccurate seller statement of fact would be that the buyer is entitled not to close   or   has   a   claim   for   indemnification.   It’s   the   facts underlying a statement-of-fact inaccuracy, rather than the inaccuracy itself, that could result in a MAC.  9.57   The materiality qualification in a bringdown condition can be subject to carve-outs if the buyer is reluctant to have the materiality qualification apply across the board. A statement of   fact   often   included   in   such   carve-outs   is   the   seller’s statement of fact regarding its capitalization. This sort of carve-out would only make sense if the statement of fact",
  "itself   did   not   include   a   materiality   qualification.   More generally,   it’s   not   clear   that   such   carve-outs   accomplish much, given that the notion of the buyer refusing to close because   of   an   immaterial   inaccuracy   seems   unpromising, whatever the statement of fact.  DOUBLE   MATERIALITY  9.58   Another issue related to materiality is “double materiality.” It ostensibly arises when a materiality qualification is included in the bringdown condition to one party’s obligation to close and in one or more statements of fact of the other party. The concern is apparently that if the bringdown condition to the buyer’s   obligation   to   close   incorporates   a   materiality qualification, then to determine whether that condition has been satisfied you apply a discount to the accuracy required for a given seller statement of fact to be accurate. If a seller statement of fact itself includes a materiality qualification, the same discount is also applied to the statement of fact, so that the level of accuracy required to satisfy the bringdown condition is further reduced. The buyer could be required to close even if a seller statement of fact was on the date of the agreement, or is at closing, materially inaccurate.  9.59   It’s common practice for drafters to seek to neutralize double materiality.   To   do   so,   either   they   incorporate   in   the bringdown   condition   a   materiality   qualification   regarding only those statements of fact that do not themselves contain a materiality qualification, or for the bringdown condition they   strip   out   materiality   qualifications   from   those statements   of   fact   that   have   them   and   apply   instead   a materiality qualification across the board.  9.60   But such contortions are unnecessary. If   material   conveys the affects-a-decision   meaning   (see   9.3),   then   materiality qualifications are not in fact equivalent to an across-the- board discount on accuracy, and materiality on materiality isn’t equivalent to a discount on a discount. Instead, for determining both accuracy of a statement of fact subject to a",
  "materiality   qualification   and   satisfaction   of   a   bringdown condition subject to a materiality qualification, one would consider the same external standard—whether the statement- of-fact inaccuracy would have affected the buyer’s decision to enter into the contract or would affect the buyer’s decision to consummate   the   transaction.   Because   the   same   standard applies in both contexts, for determining satisfaction of the bringdown condition it’s irrelevant whether the statement of fact too contains a materiality qualification.  9.61   So   the   notion   of   double   materiality   is   based   on   a misunderstanding   of   how   materiality   operates.   Not surprisingly, caselaw makes no mention of double materiality —it’s a figment of practitioner imagination.  9.62   Because   courts   don’t   recognize   double   materiality, attempting to neutralize it would seem to put a party in no worse a position than would have been the case had the issue been ignored. But the verbiage needed to address double materiality adds useless clutter. And if parties spend time negotiating double-materiality language, that’s time wasted. Furthermore,   assuming   that   double   materiality   is   a   valid concept requires a skewed view of materiality. On balance, disregarding   double   materiality   seems   the   more   efficient option.  9.63   Including the following novel provision could help remove double materiality as a negotiation issue:  Double Materiality.   The parties acknowledge that regardless of whether any court recognizes it for other contracts, the contract- interpretation concept known as “double materiality” does not apply to this agreement, so the level of statement-of-fact inaccuracy permitted by the materiality qualification to which section X [the bringdown condition] is subject will not be affected by a materiality qualification to which a statement of fact is subject.  USE   OF   VERBS   IN   MAC   PROVISIONS",
  "9.64   A   modifying   MAC   provision   (see   9.44)   addresses   the possibility of future MACs, so it might seem natural to use  will   in   expressing   it:   Acme’s   financial   records   contain   no inaccuracies except for inaccuracies that will not result in a MAC.  Using   will   in this statement of fact would mean that the statement of fact would be inaccurate only if a MAC were to materialize before closing or if it were to become apparent before closing that a MAC is certain to occur in the future.  9.65   A party to whom such a statement of fact is made would generally want it phrased in such a way that if the party identifies a problem with the potential to lead to a MAC, it could   avoid   its   obligations   under   the   contract   or   recover damages caused by the inaccurate statement of fact. This could be achieved by using   could , as in   could   [or   could not ]  result in a MAC.   This formulation is very favorable to the party not making the statement of fact. Assume that Acme makes this statement of fact:   Acme’s financial records contain no inaccuracies except for inaccuracies that could not result in a MAC.   To say that an inaccuracy could not result in a MAC is to say that no matter how the future might develop, no possible alternative course of events could lead to a MAC occurring. If, after signing, it were discovered that Acme’s financial records contain an inaccuracy that might result in a MAC, that discovery would in theory render the statement of fact inaccurate, no matter how remote the possibility of a MAC’s actually occurring.  9.66   So your best bet would be to use instead the formulation  would   [or   would not ]   reasonably be expected to result in a MAC , meaning   that   a   reasonable   person   would   (or   would   not) expect the subject of the statement of fact to result in a MAC. In this context,   expect   means “regard as likely to happen,” but it’s not clear what   likely   means, so don’t expect to establish with mathematical certainly what level of likelihood that conveys (see 13.496).  9.67   Other alternatives are available, such as   could   [or   could not ]  reasonably be expected   or   would   [or   would not ]   result in a MAC ,",
  "but they offer no advantages.  9.68   For an absolute MAC statement of fact (see 9.42), the present perfect— no MAC has occurred —is the appropriate tense. That’s because   such   statements   of   fact   address   MACs   that   have occurred. But it would be advantageous to the party that has the benefit of an absolute MAC provision if it were extended to cover, in the manner of a modifying MAC provision, the possibility of future MACs. This can be easily achieved by grafting a modifying MAC provision onto any absolute MAC provision:   Since 31 December 2016, there has not occurred any MAC or any events or circumstances that would reasonably be expected   to   result   in   a   MAC.   This   sort   of   modifying   MAC provision   supplements   any   modifying   MAC   provisions   in statements   of   fact   addressing   specific   aspects   of   the operations of the party making the statement of fact. Using the   plural   nouns   events   and   circumstances   should   make   it unnecessary to add   individually or in the aggregate ; see 9.44.  WHETHER   TO   USE   MAC   OR   MAE   AS   THE   DEFINED   TERM  9.69   The   defined   term   MAE   is   used   as   an   alternative   to   the defined term MAC. In absolute provisions one can say that since a specified date   no MAE has occurred , but MAC works better—it sounds a little odd to refer to an   effect , as opposed to a   change , as not having occurred since a specified date.  9.70   Some drafters attempt to cure this awkwardness by inserting transitional language—for example,   there has been no change, event, or condition that has resulted in a MAE . This sort of fix is more than just wordy—it also suggests that it’s not enough to show that an MAE has occurred. Instead, you have to show that something has caused an MAE. Such a cause-and-effect scenario not only doesn’t make sense, it potentially reduces the buyer’s protection.  9.71   For example, in the purchase agreement at issue in   Great Lakes Chemical Corp. v. Pharmacia Corp. , 788 A.2d 544, 557 (Del. Ch. 2001), the seller, Pharmacia, stated that since the",
  "baseline date “there has been no change in the business of the Company which would have a Material Adverse Effect.” It would have been simpler to have the statement of fact say instead that   no MAC has occurred . Perhaps the drafter, having opted to use MAE, thought it odd to have the statement of fact say   there has been no MAE   and so shoehorned in the additional   language.   The   additional   language   had   the potential to be detrimental to the buyer, in that it could be interpreted as meaning that what falls within the scope of the absolute MAE provision is not any MAE, but only a subset of all MAEs, namely those caused by a change in the Company’s business. This raised the possibility of the seller’s claiming   that   the   absolute   MAE   provision   covers   only internal changes at the seller, rather than external market changes and problems at other companies. This is what the seller claimed in a motion for summary judgment made by the seller in response to a breach-of-contract claim brought by the buyer. The court denied the seller’s motion but noted that the seller might ultimately prevail on this theory at trial. The seller might have made the same argument even if the absolute provision had been drafted as recommended in 9.42, but it would probably have had a harder time doing so.  9.72   An agreement might use both MAC and MAE. There are two reasons for this practice (a third is described in 9.85).  9.73   First, a drafter might want to use the terms interchangeably. One   way   to   accomplish   this   would   be   to   provide   a   full definition for one term, then piggyback off that definition for the other definition by specifying that MAC   means a change that has   a MAE. Another way would be to create a twofer definition:   “Material Adverse Change” and “Material Adverse Effect” mean any material adverse change or material adverse effect in ... .   There is some value to each approach, because drafters cannot always be relied on to keep track of which defined term they are using. (For example, sometimes the text of a section entitled “No Material Adverse Effect” will",
  "refer to MAC.) But rather than providing a safety net for imprecision, it’s better to be precise.  9.74   Second, a drafter might want to use in modifying provisions a broader definition of MAC than is used in an absolute statement of fact in the same contract; because one defined term cannot have two definitions, the drafter uses MAC as the defined term for one definition and MAE for the other. For   example,   credit   agreements   often   use   MAC   for   the absolute statement of fact and MAE for modifying provisions, with MAE being defined more broadly than MAC because it incorporates any material adverse effect on the rights of the agent or any lender under the loan documents or on the borrower’s ability to perform its obligations under the loan documents (see 9.99). Presumably, the reason for this is that since in the absolute statement of fact the focus is more on past adverse changes, the impact on rights and obligations under the loan documents is less relevant.  9.75   But   using   both   MAC   and   MAE   as   defined   terms   in   this manner   is   potentially   confusing   and   generally   should   be unnecessary,   since   the   broader   definition   should   work equally well in all contexts.  9.76   Given that usually you should be able to make do with one defined term, you have a choice between MAC and MAE. Because MAC is better suited to absolute statements of fact (see 9.69)   and   should   work   as   well   as   MAE   in   all   other contexts, MAC is the better term to use.  9.77   One encounters in the literature on MAC provisions the suggestion that there is a substantive basis for distinguishing between MAC and MAE. That’s not the case.  THE   BASELINE   DATE  9.78   An absolute MAC statement of fact must specify the baseline date, which is the date from which the statement of fact runs. Common baseline dates include the date the agreement was signed and the date of the most recent audited, or most",
  "recent   unaudited,   financial   statements.   Given   a   choice between using as a baseline date the date of audited or the date of unaudited financial statements, a buyer will generally prefer to use the date of audited financial statements, because they provide a more reliable picture of the target. One can also use other dates as the baseline date. For example, in the case of an unaudited startup company, the date of formation would be an appropriate baseline date. And a lender might want the borrower’s absolute MAC statement of fact to use the date when the lender issued the financing commitment.  Defining   Material Adverse Change  9.79   Drafters generally provide a definition for MAC and use it as a   defined   term.   Doing   so   allows   you   to   specify   precisely what’s meant by MAC but without burdening readers by requiring them to wade through the entire definition every time the contract refers to MAC. And it allows you to ensure that the concept is expressed consistently throughout the contract (see 6.2). You could use the initialism MAC as the defined term, but it’s preferable that you spell it out—the fewer   acronyms   and   initialisms   in   a   contract   the   better, because they make a contract harder to read (see 2.128). This chapter uses the initialism so as not to use the entire phrase repeatedly.  9.80   Here’s the basic definition recommended by this manual (although you also have the option of using   material   as a defined term; see 9.27):  “ Material Adverse Change ” means any material adverse change in the business, results of operations, assets, liabilities, or financial condition of the Seller, as determined from the perspective of a reasonable person in the Buyer’s position.  9.81   The remainder of this chapter will explain the basis for this definition.  CHANGE   VERSUS   EXPECTATION   OF   CHANGE",
  "9.82   When defining MAC, a drafter must decide whether a MAC should be defined as a material adverse change in something, as   any   event   or   circumstance   that   would   reasonably   be expected to result in a material adverse change in something, or as both.  9.83   The   first   approach   is   the   better   one.   If   the   definition incorporates the   would reasonably be expected   formula,   the drafter should omit it from the MAC provisions themselves, since it would be redundant and potentially confusing to have it present at both levels. (Regarding its use in absolute and modifying MAC provisions, see 9.44, 9.66, and 9.68.) But a MAC provision from which this formula has been omitted ( Acme’s   financial   records   contain   no   inaccuracies   except   for inaccuracies that do not constitute a MAC ) presents its own problems:   relegating   to   the   definition   the   concept   of likelihood   conveyed   by   the   would   reasonably   be   expected  formula would suggest to readers who have not studied the definition that the MAC provisions are concerned solely with current, rather than future, adverse changes. This probably explains why many drafters who use the   would reasonably be expected   formula   in   the   definition   of   MAC   also   use   it, however incongruously, in the MAC provisions themselves.  9.84   Similar redundancy occurs when a drafter uses the   would reasonably be expected   formula, including a reference to   events , or   events   and   circumstances , in the definition of MAC and also refers   to   events ,   or   events   and   circumstances ,   in   a   MAC provision.  9.85   Often when a drafter incorporates the   would reasonably   be expected   formula in the MAC definition, the drafter created the defined term expressly for use in absolute provisions, with   the   defined   term   MAE   (defined   without   the   would reasonably   be   expected   formula)   being   used   in   modifying provisions.   (The   relationship   between   these   two   defined terms is discussed in 9.69–.77.) Presumably drafters do this because it’s not immediately obvious to them how to fit the",
  "would reasonably be expected   formula into absolute provisions. But it’s easily done (see 9.68).  NO   TAUTOLOGY   IN   USING   MATERIAL   ADVERSE   CHANGE   IN   THE   DEFINITION   OF   MAC  9.86   Using the phrase   material adverse change   in the definition of MAC doesn’t entail circularity or tautology—in contracts it’s commonplace   for   a   definition   to   include   the   term   being defined (see 6.17).  USING   NOUNS   BESIDES   CHANGE   IN   THE   DEFINITION   OF   MAC  9.87   Instead of referring to material adverse change, often the definition of MAC will state that MAC means   any change, effect, development, or circumstance materially   adverse to ...   ,   or some   variant.   The   extra   language   is   superfluous   and   is evidence of lawyers’ appetite for redundancy (see 1.37). It’s clearer and more concise simply to state that MAC means   any material adverse change in ... .  WHAT   DOES   MATERIAL   ADVERSE   CHANGE   MEAN ?  9.88   The   adverse change   part   of   material adverse   change   means, evidently enough, a change for the worse. As regards   material , courts and practitioners appear to accept that when used in MAC,   material   conveys the affects-a-decision meaning. Any court would likely echo the   IBP   court in requiring that a party   “make   a   strong   showing”   when   invoking   a   MAC provision. See   IBP , 789 A.2d at 68. Using   material   as a defined term would allow you to avoid any confusion on that score (see 9.24).  9.89   If you elect to use a definition of   Material   that applies to more   than   one   party   (see   9.29),   then   not   only   in   the bringdown condition (see 9.53) but also in the definition of MAC   you   would   need   to   specify   from   whose   perspective materiality is determined:  “ Material Adverse Change ” means, from the perspective of the Buyer, any Material adverse change in the business, results of",
  "operations, assets, liabilities, or financial condition of the Seller.  9.90   If you elect not to use in the definition of MAC the defined term   Material ,   you   would   need   to   make   it   clear   in   the definition of MAC whose perspective applies for determining materiality. That’s what the definition in 9.80 does.  QUANTITATIVE   GUIDELINES  9.91   To   relieve   courts   of   any   responsibility   for   determining whether   a   given   adverse   change   is   material,   parties sometimes   include   in   a   contract   quantitative   guidelines regarding what constitutes a MAC. Sometimes a quantitative guideline   provides   the   exclusive   basis   for   determining whether an adverse change is a MAC, as when a purchase agreement defines MAC as   a   material adverse change in the business,   results   of   operations,   assets,   liabilities,   or   financial condition of Acme in an amount equal to $6.5 million or more . Alternatively,   quantitative   guidelines   can   supplement   a conventional definition of MAC.  9.92   But such an approach presents four problems:  9.93   First,   adverse   changes   could   conceivably   be   measured   by means of several quantitative indicia. Setting a threshold for all possible indicia would seem impractical, and addressing only a limited number could be arbitrary.  9.94   Second, establishing one or more numerical thresholds for materiality can complicate the negotiation process.  9.95   Third, if the quantitative indicia are illustrative rather than exclusive,   adding   them   to   the   definition   of   MAC   would increase the risk that a court wouldn’t consider to be a MAC a change that doesn’t resemble the examples.  9.96   And fourth, MAC provisions are intended to capture the unknown. If a party is able to articulate a concern sufficiently to be able to quantify it, it follows that the concern would be better addressed somewhere other than in the definition of MAC.",
  "9.97   Given these concerns, it’s not surprising that quantitative guidelines are little used. But an aggressive buyer, or one with ample bargaining power, might nonetheless want to have one   or   more   favorable   quantitative   guidelines   in   the definition of MAC to make it easier for the buyer to invoke a MAC provision.  A   MATERIAL   ADVERSE   CHANGE   IN   WHAT ?  9.98   Defining MAC requires that you determine what needs to experience a material adverse change for a MAC to occur; in the following discussion, this is called the “field of change.”  9.99   When   representing   a   buyer   acquiring   a   company,   an appropriate field of change would consist of   the   business, results of operations, assets, liabilities, or financial condition   of the target, but the exact formulation depends on the type of transaction involved. For example, if the acquisition is in the form of an asset purchase, you might want to formulate the definition so it covers a MAC in the assets being acquired. Sometimes the field of change can be unusually broad. For example, credit agreements often define MAE to include— instead of, in addition to, or as an alternative to a more traditional field of change—any material adverse effect on the   rights   of   the   agent   or   any   lender   under   the   loan documents   or   the   ability   of   the   borrower   to   perform   its obligations   under   the   loan   documents.   And   in   merger agreements it’s commonplace to include within the field of change any event that results in a material adverse change in the ability of one or more parties to complete the merger.  9.100   The word   liabilities   can mean financial obligations required to be disclosed on a balance sheet. It can also mean, more broadly, any legal responsibility to another— liabilities   in this sense would include contract obligations or an obligation to remediate   environmental   contamination.   For   the recommended field of change, the broader sense is intended. It   would   be   cumbersome   to   attempt   to   eliminate   this ambiguity   with   a   more   explicit   field   of   change,   but   if   a",
  "contract   uses   the   defined   term   Liabilities   elsewhere   (for example,   in   indemnification   provisions)   to   convey   the broader meaning, that defined term could be used in the field of change.  9.101   If when a deal is signed the target is planning to enter into a new line of business, the buyer’s counsel might want to have the field of change refer to   the business (as it is currently being conducted or as Target currently proposes to conduct it) . (Changes that adversely affect the target’s plans to enter into a new line of business might well fall within the scope of   prospects , but as discussed in 9.114, a buyer would be better off excluding  prospects   from the field of change. Since such changes would likely not be covered if, as recommended in 9.114, one were to   incorporate   prospects   by   the   “back   door,”   it   would   be appropriate to address such changes separately (see 9.116).) If the target’s plans to enter into a new line of business are sufficiently   developed,   a   more   precise   alternative   to appending a parenthetical to   the   business   and relying on an absolute MAC statement of fact or condition would be to have   statements   of   fact   or   conditions   that   address circumstances relating to the proposed expansion.  9.102   You can find surplusage in the field of change. For example, excluded from the field of change recommended above are  properties ,   operations , and   capitalization . Little is to be gained by including both   assets   and   properties,   and   operations   (as opposed to   results of operations ) should fall within the scope of   business —otherwise, one might wonder what, if anything,  business   means. Regarding   capitalization , it’s an ambiguous word that could refer either to the number and type of shares outstanding or to the “market capitalization,” or value, of those shares. If the former meaning is intended, it isn’t clear what   an   adverse   change   would   consist   of;   if   the   latter meaning is intended, the parties would be advised to address explicitly,   in   exchange-ratio   provisions   or   elsewhere,   the impact on their deal of changes in stock price. In any event, only rarely does   capitalization   feature in the field of change.",
  "Don’t assume that changes in stock price would come within the   scope   of   a   standard   field   of   change   that   excludes  capitalization —it’s far from clear that it would.  9.103   Many definitions include   condition   (financial or otherwise) , but you can use instead just   financial condition , because whatever might fall within the scope of   otherwise   would be covered by the other elements in the recommended field of change.  9.104   One could argue that the standard elements of the field of change other than   business   are also surplusage, in that any adverse change to the results of operations, assets, liabilities, or financial condition of Acme (to use the elements of the recommended field) would fall within the scope of Acme’s business. But in   Pine State Creamery Co. v. Land-O-Sun Dairies, Inc. , No. 5:96-CV-170-BO, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22035, at *9 (E.D.N.C.   22   Dec.   1997),   the   district   court   held   that   the operating profits and losses of Pine State did not fall within the scope of a condition requiring that “there shall not have occurred   any   material   adverse   change   in   the   Business.” “Business” was defined to mean a dairy processing plant and wholesale dairy distribution system. Although in overturning that decision the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated that “Pine State’s financial activities are fairly included within the term ‘Business,’”   Pine State Creamery Co. v. Land-O- Sun Dairies, Inc. , No. 98-2441, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 31529, at *10 n.1 (4th Cir. 2 Dec. 1999), other courts might be inclined to narrowly interpret a field of change consisting solely of   the business . Accordingly, it would be prudent to sacrifice some economy in the field of change.  9.105   Even if you use a broad field of change, a court could hold that   a   development   doesn’t   constitute   a   MAC   because   it doesn’t constitute change falling within the field of change. There’s mixed caselaw on whether industry-wide or general factors over which a party had only partial control (such as market share) or no control (such as the availability or price of one or more commodities) constitute a MAC. In cases such as   Borders   v.   KRLB,   Inc. ,   727   S.W.2d   357,   358   (Tex.   App.",
  "1987), and   Pittsburgh Coke & Chemical Co. v. Bollo , 421 F. Supp. 908, 930 (E.D.N.Y. 1976), the court held that such change didn’t constitute a MAC. On the other hand, in   IBP  the   court   declined   to   “preclude   industry-wide   or   general factors from constituting a Material Adverse Effect”—if the target, IBP, had wanted to exclude the factors, “IBP should have bargained for it.”   IBP , 789 A.2d at 66.  9.106   So if a party wants to ensure that it could walk away from a deal if a MAC is caused by one or more specific industry-wide or general developments, it had best incorporate that concept in the contract.  9.107   One   way   to   make   clear   that   certain   changes   constitute material adverse changes falling within the field of change would be to list them at the end of the MAC definition, preceded by   including . But for reasons explained in 9.131, it would be best to address those concerns in a statement of fact,   condition   (either   directly   or   by   bringdown   of   the statements of fact), or other provision.  PROSPECTS  9.108   A   recurring   topic   in   negotiations   is   whether   to   include  prospects   in the field of change. The buyer wants it included— the future of the business, it says, is a legitimate concern, because the buyer is acquiring the business to operate it in the future. The seller wants it excluded—it’s willing, it says, to stand behind how the business is currently being operated, but risks relating to future operations are the buyer’s concern. More often than not the seller wins this battle.  9.109   But generally little thought is given to what   prospects   means and what the implications are of including it in, or excluding it from, the field of change.  9.110   In everyday usage,   prospects   means “chances or opportunities for success.” The term is not often defined in contracts, but when it is, this is often the definition used:   “Prospects” means, at   any   time,   results   of   future   operations   that   are   reasonably",
  "foreseeable based on facts and circumstances in existence at that time.  9.111   Here’s an example of the effect of including   prospects   in the field   of   change:   If   one   of   Acme’s   competitors   secures   an alternative source of raw materials that would allow it to produce goods more cheaply, that development could be said to have an adverse effect on Acme’s prospects if it appears that Acme would likely be forced to reduce its profit margins. And an adverse effect on prospects could be predicated not only on the occurrence, preclosing, of an event likely to have an   adverse   effect   on   Acme’s   business,   but   also   on   the preclosing likelihood of such an event occurring sometime in the future. Such a circumstance was at issue in   Pacheco   and  Goodman , discussed immediately below.  9.112   The   question   arises   how   prospects   relates   to   the   other standard elements of the field of change. Arguably, material adverse   change   in   a   company’s   prospects   constitutes   a material adverse change in the company’s current business condition, so a change in the company’s prospects would allow one to say a MAC has occurred even if   prospects   is absent from the field of change. But in the two cases bearing on   the   meaning   of   prospects ,   the   courts   rejected   this argument.   See   Pacheco   v.   Cambridge   Technology   Partners (Massachusetts), Inc. , 85 F. Supp. 2d 69 (D. Mass. 2000), and  Goodman   Manufacturing   Co.   v.   Raytheon   Co. ,   No.   98   Civ. 2774(LAP), 1999 WL 681382 (S.D.N.Y. 31 Aug. 1999).  9.113   But you can effectively render   prospects   superfluous. As stated in 9.44, 9.66, and 9.68, if you represent a party that has the benefit   of   MAC   provisions   in   a   contract,   then   your   best course would be to use in any modifying MAC provisions the formula   would   [or   would not ]   reasonably be expected to result in a MAC   and to tack on to any absolute MAC provision the phrase   or any event or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to result in a MAC . Determining how likely it is that an event or circumstance will cause a MAC requires that one make   a   reasonable   assessment,   based   on   facts   and",
  "circumstances in existence at the time, of how the business would operate, both in the presence and in the absence of the event or circumstance in question. This analysis is largely identical   to   the   analysis   required   to   determine   whether something constitutes a material adverse change in results of future operations that are reasonably foreseeable based on facts and circumstances in existence at that time — in other words,   prospects   as the term is commonly defined.  9.114   Given that the two approaches serve essentially the same purpose,   omitting   prospects   from   the   field   of   change   and instead (1) using consistently the formula   would   [or   would not ]   reasonably   be   expected   to   result   in   a   MAC   and   (2) expanding as suggested any absolute MAC provisions should afford protection equivalent to   prospects   to the party that would benefit from the MAC provisions while sparing it— with luck—the skirmishing that parties commonly engage in over whether to include   prospects   in the field of change. This approach has been called incorporating   prospects   by the “back door.” There is, however, no caselaw on point.  9.115   But in two contexts, a drafter might be reluctant to dispense with   prospects . First,   Pacheco   is precedent for the notion that if a company is likely to fail to meet its publicly announced financial   projections,   that   constitutes   a   material   adverse change in the company’s prospects. Some might think it rash to lose the benefit of that precedent by relying on the back- door   approach.   But   relying   on   a   court   to   follow   Pacheco  presents risks of its own; if you represent a buyer that wants to be certain that it can walk if it appears that the target will fail to meet its projections, your safest bet would be to make it   a   condition   to   closing   that   there   exists   no   event   or circumstance   reasonably   expected   to   result   in   the   target failing to meet any publicly announced financial projections.  9.116   Second,   what   if   a   buyer   learns   before   closing   that   the anticipated expansion of the target, Acme, into a new line of business has been stymied? If the definition of MAC includes  prospects , a court might well consider that such an adverse",
  "development   falls   within   the   scope   of   the   absolute   MAC statement of fact in the purchase agreement. If by contrast the contract sought to incorporate   prospects   by the back door, it’s   not   clear   that   a   court   would   find   that   a   MAC   had occurred: under the back-door approach, the absolute MAC statement of fact would encompass future changes to Acme’s current   business   but   not   necessarily   future   changes   to   a business that Acme had yet to engage in (in this case, the failure of a line of business to materialize). But don’t rely on  prospects   to address in a MAC provision a target’s knowledge of   adverse   developments   about   a   proposed   expansion. Instead, your best bet would be either to refer in the field of change to   the business (as it is currently being conducted and as Acme currently proposes to conduct it)   or, if the plans to enter into a new line of business are sufficiently developed, to include   statements   of   fact   or   conditions   that   address circumstances relating to the proposed expansion (see 9.101).  9.117   As a general matter a party with specific concerns that might fall within the scope of   prospects , either directly or through the back door, would be advised to also address them in statements of fact, conditions, or termination provisions.  WHOSE   MATERIAL   ADVERSE   CHANGE ?  9.118   If the definition of MAC is meant to encompass only adverse changes to a single company, make that clear by referring to, for example,   a material adverse change in ... of the Seller .  9.119   MAC definitions are often drafted to cover an entity and some   or   all   of   its   subsidiaries,   using   taken   as   a   whole . Sometimes a party’s parent entity is included, and in merger agreements MAC is sometimes defined to include an adverse change to the surviving entity. A MAC definition can also cover   several   parties   on   one   side   of   a   deal,   such   as   all borrowers   under   a   credit   agreement   together   with   their subsidiaries and, perhaps, any guarantors.",
  "9.120   An agreement might contain some MAC provisions that can be invoked by Acme against Widgetco, and others that can be invoked by Widgetco against Acme. (Whether the target in   an   acquisition   should   seek   the   protection   of   MAC provisions would depend on the consideration to be paid. If the buyer were paying cash, the target would normally forgo such protection. If the buyer were paying with its own stock, whether the target would benefit from the protection of MAC provisions would depend on the exchange ratio and whether the   agreement   incorporates   other   mechanisms   to   address major changes in the buyer’s business.)  9.121   When   both   sides   of   a   deal   have   the   benefit   of   MAC provisions, any MAC provision should state which party that MAC provision applies to. It would be simplest to refer to   a Seller MAC   rather than, say,   a MAC of   [or   in ]   the Seller .  9.122   You could define MAC generically so it applies to more than one party. Here’s a generic definition that uses the defined term   Material :  “ Material Adverse Change ” means, regarding any Person, any Material adverse change in the business, results of operations, assets, liabilities, or financial condition of that Person.  9.123   And here’s a generic definition that doesn’t use the defined term   Material :  “ Material Adverse Change ” means, regarding any Person, any material adverse change in the business, results of operations, assets, liabilities, or financial condition of that Person, as determined by a reasonable person in the position of any party having the benefit of that provision.  9.124   But   it   would   be   clearer   to   give   each   side   its   own comprehensive MAC-defined term, such as   Buyer MAC   and  Seller   MAC .   This   approach   would   allow   you   to   create customized definitions of MAC that take into account the parties’ differing roles in the transaction and any differences in negotiating leverage.",
  "9.125   If   both   sides   to   a   transaction   have   the   benefit   of   MAC provisions   and   the   generic   definition   or   the   customized definitions (as applicable) use the defined term   Material , you would need to use the generic definition of   Material   (see 9.29).  9.126   Finally, if a definition of MAC applies to only one party, take care not to use that defined term in a MAC provision that applies to another party.  AGGREGATING   INSTANCES   OF   CHANGE  9.127   As discussed in 9.43, 9.44, 9.54, and 9.68, for determining occurrence of a MAC, a MAC provision can raise for the drafter whether events or circumstances should be considered individually or should be considered individually and in the aggregate.  9.128   Occasionally   one   finds   aggregation   addressed   in   the definition of MAC. A simple way to accomplish this would be by   modifying   the   recommended   form   of   definition   as follows:  “ Material Adverse Change ”   means any adverse change in the business, results of operations, assets, liabilities, or financial condition of the Seller that is material, as determined from the perspective of a reasonable person in the Buyer’s position, when considered individually or together with each other such adverse change.  9.129   But   this   sort   of   definition   is   awkward.   It   aims   to   lump together   all   adverse   changes,   of   whatever   kind,   for determining whether a MAC has occurred. It’s clear enough how this definition would affect an absolute MAC provision, which   looks   at   MACs   that   have   already   occurred,   but   it wouldn’t seem to make sense for a modifying MAC statement of fact. For example, if Acme states that its financial records contain no inaccuracies except for inaccuracies that would not reasonably be expected to result in a MAC, and a dispute arises regarding an inaccuracy, the inquiry would be whether",
  "at   signing   or   closing   (as   applicable)   it   would   have   been reasonable to expect that inaccuracy to result in a MAC. Since that inquiry would look to the possibility of future adverse   change,   it’s   unclear   what   other   adverse   changes could be aggregated with any adverse change that one could reasonably expect to be caused by that inaccuracy in the financial records.  9.130   The   expanded   absolute   MAC   provision   recommended   in 9.68 offers a better way to ensure broad-based aggregation of adverse changes.  INCLUSIONS   AND   CARVE - OUTS  9.131   Given that, as described in 9.105, some courts have held that a MAC provision was not triggered by an adverse change in a matter over which the seller had only partial control or no control, any buyer that wants to be able to get out of a deal on such grounds had best specify as much in the agreement. Furthermore,   a   buyer   might   have   in   mind   some   other circumstances   that   it   wants   to   be   sure   would   constitute MACs. One way to make clear that certain changes constitute material adverse changes coming within the field of change would be to list them out at the end of the MAC definition, preceded by   including . But it would be best not to include in the definition of MAC examples of changes that would fall within the definition, because doing so would increase the risk that a court would not consider to be a MAC a change that does not resemble the examples (see 13.371). You would avoid this risk by instead incorporating nonoccurrence of any of those changes in statements of fact, conditions to closing, or termination provisions, as appropriate.  9.132   It has become commonplace to exclude from the definition of MAC, by means of “carve-outs,” specific adverse changes. And   carve-outs   can   themselves   be   subject   to   carve-outs. Carve-outs don’t relate to historical facts, but instead are worded generally to cover the stated circumstances, whatever",
  "the time frame. There are many possible carve-outs; here are some common ones: any change affecting economic or financial conditions generally (global, national, or regional, as applicable) any change affecting the party’s industry as a whole (it can be specified that this carve-out does not apply if those conditions disproportionately affect the party in question) any change caused by announcement of the transaction or any related transaction (this carve-out can be general or limited to changes related to specific aspects of the party’s operations, such as loss of customer orders or employee attrition; note that this carve-out could increase the buyer’s risk as to whether it could successfully invoke a MAC provision, because it might be unclear whether a particular adverse effect was caused by announcement of the transaction) any change in a party’s stock price or trading volume (in most contexts a carve-out for changes in stock price would probably be unnecessary, since it isn’t clear that a drop in stock price would fall within the scope of a field of change that doesn’t include capitalization (see 9.102), but the cautious drafter might want to avoid any possibility of confusion on the subject by including this carve-out) strikes or other labor disruptions any failure to meet analysts’ or internal earnings estimates any action contemplated by the agreement or taken at the buyer’s request any action required by law  9.133   You can introduce carve-outs by stating that MAC   means any material adverse change in ... other than   [or   except for   or   but does not   include ]   any   of   the   following,   either   alone   or   in combination ... .",
  "9.134   Any   time   you   represent   an   acquisition   target,   you   must decide the extent of the carve-outs that you wish to seek. One factor in your decision would presumably be the parties’ relative   bargaining   power.   A   second   factor   would   be   the nature of your client’s business. Carve-outs are associated with technology deals because they address the distinctive characteristics of technology companies, such as unusually short   product   cycles,   intense   competition,   and   the importance of qualified personnel. These characteristics are not unique to technology companies. For example, in any industry   in   which   personnel   represent   an   important component   of   a   company’s   assets,   announcing   the   deal might result in target personnel leaving. A third factor would be the deal-making practices at the time.  9.135   A restrained position for seller’s counsel to take would be to propose carving out adverse changes in the economy or in the   industry   in   question   as   well   as   adverse   changes attributable to the deal or announcement of the deal. But in negotiating carve-outs, bear in mind that not including a carve-out for a particular circumstance when defining MAC doesn’t   necessarily   mean   that   a   court   would   hold   that occurrence of that circumstance resulted in a MAC.  HOW   MAC   PROVISIONS   RELATE   TO   OTHER   PROVISIONS  9.136   Whether   a   plaintiff   convinces   a   court   that   a   MAC   has occurred under an agreement can be influenced by what is, or isn’t, included in the other provisions of that agreement.  9.137   For one thing, caselaw shows that a court might use the narrow scope of a statement of fact or condition to conclude that a MAC had not occurred. In   Gordon v. Dolin , 434 N.E.2d 341,   348–49   (Ill.   App.   Ct.   1982),   the   buyer   of   a manufacturing   plant   claimed   that   the   absolute   MAC statement   of   fact   in   the   purchase   agreement   had   been triggered by the decision of the seller’s principal customer to shift part of its business to a new supplier. It was a condition to closing that before the closing date the seller not have",
  "received   “actual   notice”   from   any   customer   that   the customer intended to stop purchasing any products from the seller   or   intended   to   reduce   the   quantity   of   products purchased; the seller had not in fact received actual notice. The court held that the buyer could not rely on the absolute MAC   statement   of   fact,   because   the   narrower   condition “modified and limited” the absolute MAC statement of fact: “Where   a   contract   contains   both   general   and   specific provisions relating to the same subject, the specific provision is controlling.”  9.138   One could conclude from this case that the buyer’s MAC claim would have succeeded had the contract not contained the   condition   regarding   customer   purchases.   But   a   court might consider that if a contract doesn’t address a given topic, then that topic could not have been material to the deal. In   Northern Heel Corp. v. Compo Industries, Inc. , 851 F.2d 456, 465–66 (1st Cir. 1988), the court, affirming a lower court,   found   meritless   defendant   Compo’s   claim   that   a downturn in daily shoe production constituted inaccuracy of certain   statements   of   fact   in   the   purchase   agreement, including an absolute MAC statement of fact. One reason for the court’s decision was the absence of a statement of fact about   daily   shoe   production:   “Had   the   parties   deemed average daily production important (‘material’ to the deal), surely an appropriate reference would have been included. But, it was not.”  9.139   The   lesson   to   draw   from   this   is   that   when   drafting   a contract, ideally include—and express as broadly as possible —provisions   addressing   any   issue   that   might   conceivably form the basis for a claim by your client or provide grounds to walk. With luck, your client would then need to rely on an absolute MAC provision only in disputes relating to matters that were not foreseeable when the contract was signed.",
  "REFERENCES TO TIME  10.1   In a contract, a reference to time could serve one of four functions:  10.2   First, it could give a date to something, as in   the financial statements dated 31 December 2016 .  10.3   Second, it could specify a point in time, as in   Roe became an Acme employee on 23 March 2016 .  10.4   Third, it could specify a period of time that begins or ends at a stated point in time and has a stated duration, as in   Roe was an Acme employee for two years starting 23 March 2014 , and  Acme may exercise the Option during a 90-day period starting 1 July 2018 . Paired points in time are equivalent to a period of time beginning or ending at a point in time, and the former can with varying degrees of awkwardness be restated as   the   latter,   and   vice   versa.   The   preceding   examples   of periods of time can be restated as   Roe was an Acme employee from 23 March 2014 to 23 March 2016   and   Acme may exercise the Option from 1 July 2018 to 28 September 2018 .  10.5   And fourth, it could apportion a quantity per unit of time, as in   Acme shall pay Doe an annual salary of $250,000   and   Acme shall not exercise the Option more than twice a year .  10.6   This chapter considers in turn issues raised by each of these four functions.  DATES",
  "10.7   A date is a numbered day in a month, usually stated with the month and the year ( 23 April 2018 ). In other words, a date is the designation used for a given day, to anchor that day in time. Dates can also be referred to indirectly. For example,   the date of this agreement   refers to the date used to fix when the contract was signed (see 2.30).  Format  10.8   To state dates, this manual uses the format   1 January 2018 . One reason is that this format—the day-month-year format— is used in most of the world. The format generally used in the United States is   January 1, 2018 —the month-day-year format —but the United States is the only country in which that format predominates. And even in the United States, there are important exceptions. For example, the U.S. military uses the day-month-year format, and that’s the format used in U.S. passports.  10.9   Furthermore,   the   month-day-year   format   is   awkward.   In terms of logic, it has the disadvantage of putting the middle value at the front. Also, it requires a comma after the one or more digits representing the day, to set them apart from the digits representing the year, and another comma after the year (unless the date is used as an adjective). Those commas add clutter to prose. (A date would nevertheless be followed by a comma if the date comes at the end of introductory matter:   Since 30 January 2017, Acme has not   ... .)  10.10   For a book geared to an international readership, it doesn’t make sense to use an awkward format that’s widely used in only one country. That’s why this manual joins, for example,  Garner’s Modern English Usage   in using the day-month-year format.  10.11   The drawbacks to using the month-day-year format in this manual apply equally to contract drafting. Drafters based in the   United   States   should   consider   switching   to   the   day- month-year format. It creates no confusion, it streamlines",
  "your   prose,   and   it   would   result   in   greater   consistency internationally. And if it’s good enough for the U.S. military and the U.S. State Department, it should be good enough for those reading your contract.  10.12   Because all-digit dates generally aren’t used in books or in contracts, the confusion that results from mixing all-digit dates   that   use   different   formats   isn’t   relevant   for   this discussion.  10.13   Last,   it’s   eccentric   to   add   A.D. ,   short   for   Anno   Domini  (meaning   in the year of the Lord ), before the year.  Date   and   Day  10.14   Day   is a generic unit of time. (See 10.72.) If you’re referring to a day without anchoring it in time, use the word   day . But drafters are prone to using the word   date   in this context:  Those values may be determined on either (1) the   date   [ read  day] of purchase or (2) the   date   [ read   day] the person became a director, whichever value is greater. ... plus interest from the beginning of the   date   [ read   day] the disputed payment was originally due through the   date   [ read   day] before the   date   [ read   day] of payment.  10.15   It follows that it would make sense to use   closing day   to refer to the day a closing would take place. But instances of   closing date   greatly outnumber   closing day . Because overuse of   date  couldn’t result in confusion, it would be pedantic to insist that   day   be used instead.  The Date That Is  10.16   The phrase   the date that is —as in   before the date that is ,   after the date that is ,   no later than the date that is , and so on—is almost always clutter:  If the Exchange Offer is not completed ...   on or before the date that is   [read   by ] 270 days after the Closing Date ... .",
  "... and in no event later than   the date that is   60 days after the closing of the merger with Everbright Solar, Inc. Each Letter of Credit will expire on the earlier of (1)   the date that is   one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit ... .  10.17   The phrase is appropriate only in the definition of a defined term that uses the word   date :  “ LIBOR Determination Date ” means (1) with respect to the initial Interest Accrual Period,   the date that is   two LIBOR Business Days before the Closing Date ... .  The Date Notified  10.18   Here’s an example of use of the phrase   the date notified :  “ First Hand Date ” means   the date notified   by ABC to XYZ upon which the first hand of poker is played for real money on the Platform.  10.19   The phrase forms part of a passive-voice construction. To put the above example in the active voice, you would say * the date ABC notified to XYZ . That’s ungrammatical (hence the asterisk): you notify someone, you don’t notify a date. That’s masked somewhat when you use the passive voice, but it’s still a problem.  10.20   Say instead   the date that ABC specifies by notice to XYZ . And more generally, don’t use   the date notified .  POINTS IN TIME  10.21   Drafters generally fix a point in time by reference to a date (such as 24   January 2017 ,   or   the date of this agreement ) or other day ( the Closing Day ). You can also specify an anniversary of a date (see 13.26); the concept of an anniversary is equivalent to a forward-looking period of years (see 10.62).  Prepositions Used to Refer to a Day",
  "10.22   On   is the preposition used to express something happening by reference to a date ( The Option will expire on 9 April 2019 ) or other day ( The Option will expire on the Closing Day ).  10.23   If a point in time comes at the beginning or end of a period of time, it can be unclear whether the day in question is to be excluded (in other words, is “exclusive”) or is to be included (is “inclusive”) for determining exactly when that point in time occurs.  10.24   Each of the following examples uses one of the prepositions most often used to denote a beginning point in time; next to it is a short assessment of the caselaw addressing whether that preposition is inclusive or exclusive.  Acme may exercise the Option   from   9 April 2018. Most courts have held that   from   is exclusive, but some have held that it’s inclusive. Acme may exercise the Option   after   9 April 2018. Most courts have held that   after   is exclusive, but some have held that it’s inclusive. Acme may exercise the Option   starting   9 April 2018. A court would likely hold that   starting   is inclusive. The Option Period commences   on   9 April 2018. A court would likely hold that in this context   on  is inclusive.  10.25   And   each   of   the   following   examples   uses   one   of   the prepositions most often used to denote an ending point in time:  Acme may exercise the Option  until   9 April 2019. Some courts have held that   until   is inclusive, others that it’s exclusive. Acme may exercise the Option   to  9 April 2019. Some courts have held that   to   is inclusive, others that it’s exclusive. The Option Period will end   on  9 April 2019. A court would likely hold that in this context  on   is inclusive. Acme may exercise the Option  before   9 April 2019. A court would likely hold that   before   is exclusive. Acme may exercise the Option  through   9 April 2019. A court would likely hold that   through   is inclusive. If Acme exercises the Option   by  9 April 2018, ... . Some courts have held that   by   is inclusive, others that it’s exclusive.",
  "10.26   Between   links beginning and ending points in time; most courts consider   between   to be exclusive at both ends. Pairing  from   and   to , as in   from 1 February 2017 to 30 April 2017 , and  after   and   before , as in   after 1 February 2017 and before 30 April 2017 , can serve the same purpose, but subject to whatever ambiguity afflicts the individual prepositions.  10.27   Although U.S. caselaw relating to some prepositions provides a   good   indication   of   whether   a   court   would   treat   it   as exclusive   or   inclusive,   the   caselaw   relating   to   other prepositions is less clear-cut. And a court could always hold that based on the circumstances, a preposition that most courts have considered exclusive is inclusive (or vice versa).  10.28   Even   if   the   caselaw   regarding   the   effect   of   a   particular preposition is mostly consistent, that doesn’t mean that the parties to a contract had that effect in mind. If anything, the potential   for   confusion   caused   by   prepositions   is   perhaps greater than is suggested by the caselaw.  When in a Day a Point in Time Occurs  10.29   Even if it’s certain on which day a stated point in time is to occur, there remains the question of when on that day it is to occur. In this context   day   means the 24 hours from one midnight to the next, so a beginning point in time could occur at midnight at the beginning of the day in question (if it’s inclusive) or at the end of the day in question (if it’s exclusive),   and   an   ending   point   in   time   could   occur   at midnight at the end of the day in question (if it’s inclusive) or at the beginning of the day in question (if it’s exclusive). Or a party might decide that it had in mind some other time of day (see 10.34). As such, referring to a point in time by reference to a day is an example of failure to be sufficiently specific (see 7.28).  10.30   Instead   of   simply   tolerating   the   uncertainty   inherent   in references to points in time, you can make it explicit whether the date for a point in time is inclusive or exclusive. One way",
  "to accomplish that would be to say as much, as in   Acme may exercise the Option any time from 1 February 2017, inclusive, to 30 April 2017, exclusive , although that’s legalistic.  10.31   Or you could say   from the beginning of 15 April 2017 to the end of 30 April 2017 , but references to the beginning or end of a day could be understood as referring to business hours rather than a day of 24 hours.  10.32   Another   alternative   would   be   to   include   in   contracts   a section   specifying   how   references   to   time   are   to   be interpreted,   but   to   be   comprehensive—and   it   should   be comprehensive—such a section would have to be lengthy. (For a fragment of such a provision, see 15.16.)  Stating the Time of Day  10.33   A clearer way to avoid uncertainty in referring to a point in time is to state a time of day for each beginning and ending point in time.  10.34   It’s best to state the time of day directly— the Option expires at 2:00   p.m.   on   25   September   2017 .   You   could   refer   to   it indirectly, as in   the Option expires at the close of business on 25 September 2017 ,   with the exact time to be determined by reference to the practice of the business in question. But   close of business   can cause dispute. See   Lehman Brothers International (Europe)   v.   ExxonMobil   Financial   Services   BV   [2016]   EWHC 2699   (Comm)   (opinion   of   the   High   Court   of   Justice   of England and Wales);   Re Electron Holdings; McCann v. Halpin  [2013] IEHC 495 (opinion of the High Court of Ireland). The same applies to   opening of business .  10.35   The simplest time of day to use in beginning or ending points in time is midnight. It’s simplest to deal in entire days. And because most businesses are closed at midnight, using  midnight   to specify a point in time reduces the likelihood of dispute over when a notice or payment was received.",
  "10.36   But don’t refer to midnight, or noon for that matter, as   12:00 a.m.   or   12:00 p.m.   Just as noon isn’t part of either the 12   ante meridiem   (before noon) hours or the 12   post meridiem   (after noon) hours, but represents the boundary between the two, midnight is the boundary between any set of   post meridiem  hours and the following set of   ante meridiem   hours.  10.37   Although simply referring to noon avoids any confusion as to which day is intended—each day has only one noon— referring to midnight raises the issue whether you’re referring to   the   midnight   that   marks   the   beginning   of   the   day question   or   the   midnight   that   marks   its   end.   There’s   a convention that   midnight of 15 August   refers to the midnight that follows 15 August, but it’s not clear that it has been universally accepted or that the parties to a contract know of it.  10.38   One way that drafters address this ambiguity is by moving forward by one minute to 12:01 a.m. any midnight point in time that begins a period in time and by moving back by one minute to 11:59 p.m. any midnight point in time that ends a period of time, but that’s a clumsy way around the problem. An overly subtle variant is to specify that the beginning point in time occurs at one minute before 12:01 a.m. and the ending point in time occurs at one minute after 11:59 p.m. A simpler solution would be to refer to   midnight at the beginning  [or   end ]   of   the date in question. (For another explanation of use of   12:01 a.m.   and   11:59 p.m. , see 10.42.)  TIME   OF   DAY   AS   A   BOUNDARY   BETWEEN   PERIODS   OF   TIME  10.39   A time of day isn’t a period of time. Instead, it’s a boundary between the period of time that comes before and the period of time that comes after.  10.40   So if a contract states that a deadline is midnight at the end of a given day, the deadline will pass once the last second of the 11:00 p.m. hour expires and the first second of the next",
  "hour begins. Midnight is the boundary between those two seconds.  10.41   It seems that some drafters aren’t convinced of that. For example, included in contracts filed on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR system are plenty of contracts that use   5:01 p.m.   to state a point in time. The implication is that when you state a time of day, you’re referring   to   a   minute-long   period   of   time,   so   5:00   p.m.  constitutes a period of time that isn’t over until   5:01 p.m.  10.42   That suggests that although drafters might use   12:01 a.m.  and   11:59   p.m.   to   avoid   the   ambiguity   in   midnight   (see 10.38),   it’s   likely   that   some   who   use   12:01   a.m.   and  11:59 p.m.   are doing so because they think that a time of day refers to a minute-long period of time.  10.43   There’s no sign that this potential for confusion has caused fights, with a contract party claiming that it should have been given an extra minute. And there’s no simple way to draft around this misconception—you’d have to include an internal rule of interpretation (see chapter 15) that says, in effect, a time of day is a boundary between periods of time. It would be silly to indulge the misconception by stating a time of   day   in   hours,   minutes,   and   seconds   (for   example,  17:00:00 ), presumably so that the period of time ostensibly at issue is one second rather than one minute. So instead, be on the lookout for the misconception, a potential sign of which is a draft that states a time of day that is a minute more or less than what you’d expect.  USING   AT   TO   STATE   A   DEADLINE  10.44   Because a time of day marks the boundary between blocks of time   and   occupies   no   time   itself,   it’s   impossible   for something to take place   at   a point in time. Instead, it will take place before or after, or it will straddle the point in time. It follows that providing in a contract for an act to occur at a specified time is to invite confusion, as it’s not clear how",
  "much time before or after that time the party in question has to perform the act.  10.45   A court might conclude that for something to happen at a specified time, it’s sufficient that it happen in the minute after that point in time. See, e.g., a Canadian case,   Bradscot (MCL)   Ltd.   v.   Hamilton-Wentworth   Catholic   District   School Board   [1999] 42 O.R.3d 723 (O.C.A.). But it would be reckless to build this uncertainty into a contract, so don’t use   at   to state a deadline. Use instead a beginning point in time (see 10.24) or an ending point in time (see 10.25).  HOW   TO   STATE   A   TIME   OF   DAY  10.46   Use digits, not words, to state the time of day—say   5:30 p.m. , not   five thirty p.m . And don’t use both words and digits, as in  five thirty (5:30) p.m.   (Regarding using words and digits to state numbers generally, see 14.1.)  10.47   Don’t include   o’clock   when stating a time of day, as in   2:00 o’clock p.m.  10.48   The abbreviations   a.m.   and   p.m.   can instead be stated in capitals, in which case periods are unnecessary— 5:30 PM . In book publishing it would be standard to use small capitals, but that would be unnecessarily fussy for contracts.  10.49   In jurisdictions that use the 24-hour system, it would be appropriate to use that system in contracts— 17:30   instead of  5:30 p.m.   But don’t state time in hours, minutes, and seconds ( 17:30:00 ) unless extraordinary circumstances require it.  TIME   ZONES  10.50   If a contract is between parties based in different time zones, or if a contract contemplates business being transacted across time zones, specify in any reference to the time of day which time zone is to be used for determining when that time of day has come.",
  "10.51   You could accomplish that by stating the applicable time zone, but doing so poses three minor problems relating to daylight saving time. Daylight saving time—also known as “summer   time”—is   the   convention   of   adjusting   clocks forward in spring, so that afternoons have more daylight and mornings have less, and then adjusting them backward in autumn. The time when daylight saving time is not in effect is known as “standard time.”  10.52   First, it’s commonplace for drafters to forget to take into account daylight saving time and when it applies. And many people are unaware that the initialisms PST, MST, CST, and EST refer to standard time and so shouldn’t, strictly speaking, be used for references to time on days when daylight saving time is in effect. As a result, many drafters use incorrect time- zone designations—for example Pacific Standard Time rather than Pacific Daylight Time, as in   1:00 p.m. PST   [read   PDT ]   on 5 July 2017 .  10.53   Second, within a given time zone some jurisdictions might observe   daylight   saving   time   and   others   might   not.   For example, in the Mountain Time Zone, Colorado observes daylight saving time, but not Arizona (except for the Navajo Nation), meaning that in the notation   1:00 p.m. MDT on 5 July 2017 , the time-zone designation would be correct if you’re referring to time in Colorado but incorrect if you’re referring to time in most parts of Arizona.  10.54   And third, if you’re specifying the time of day on a day that could occur any time during the year—as in   Acme shall cause Product Support personnel to be on call from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. PST each Business Day —it would arguably be preferable to use instead the neutral, albeit informal, designation   PT , given that on some days Pacific Standard Time would be observed and on the other days Pacific Daylight Time.  10.55   A simple way to avoid such annoyances and any potential uncertainty is to refer to time in a city, presumably one with some bearing on the transaction— 6:00 p.m., New York time .",
  "You could elect to do so by means of an internal rule of interpretation; see 15.7. It can be safer to refer to time in a city than in a state, as some states are in more than one time zone.  Prepositions to Use to Refer to Occurrence of an Event  10.56   Prepositions used to refer to a day (see 10.22) can also be used to express something happening on occurrence of an event (for example,   sale of the Acme Assets ). So can   upon .  10.57   In this context,   upon   and   on   express the meaning “on the occasion of” or “when (something) occurs.” This use of   upon  and   on   can cause confusion.  10.58   Use of   upon   or   on   doesn’t pose a problem when language of policy   is   used   to   express   something   that   happens automatically   on   occurrence   of   an   event   ( The Option will expire upon sale of the Acme Assets ). But with language of discretion ( Acme may exercise the Option upon sale of the Acme Assets )   or   language   of   obligation   ( Acme   shall   vacate   the Premises upon sale of the Acme Assets ), the question arises how long after occurrence of the event you have to take the action specified.  10.59   This issue arose in   IPE Asset Management, LLC v. Fairview Block & Supply Corp. , 999 N.Y.S.2d 465 (App. Div. 2014). The contract at issue stated that upon expiration of a 15-month period after closing, the buyer could elect to sell the property back to the seller. The closing took place on 30 June 2005; in November   2010   and   again   in   December   2010   the   buyer notified the seller that it wished to sell the property back to the seller. The buyer argued that the contract gave it an open- ended   option;   the   seller   argued   that   the   plaintiffs   could exercise the option only during “a reasonable time” after the 15-month period had expired. The appeals court held that the language was ambiguous.",
  "10.60   To avoid this confusion, state a period for taking the action in question, using something other than   upon —for example,  If during the 30 days after that 15-month period the Buyer notifies the Seller that it wishes to sell the Property back to the Seller   ... .  PERIODS OF TIME  10.61   A period of time can run either forward or backward from a point in time.  Forward-Looking Periods of Time  10.62   A   forward-looking   period   of   time   is   usually   indicated   by  from ,   following , or   after   (as in   Smith may exercise the Option during the ten days from his receipt of   [or   following his receipt of  or   after he receives ]   the Option Notice ). To determine the ending date of a forward-looking period of time using any of these prepositions, the convention is that you leave out the day from which you are counting and include the last day of the specified period, unless it’s clear that the period must consist of a certain number of entire days, in which case both the first and last days are excluded, or unless it’s clear that the parties intend that the first day be included. Applying this convention to the preceding example, if Smith receives the Option Notice on 1 January, the first day of the ten-day period   is   2   January   and   Smith   must   exercise   the   Option before midnight at the end of 11 January. This convention is generally recognized by courts, so usually contracts aren’t explicit   as   to   how   the   ending   date   of   a   forward-looking period   of   time   is   to   be   determined.   But   to   avoid   any uncertainty, be explicit.  10.63   If you know the beginning and end points of a forward- looking period of time, it would be clearer to express it by paired points in time, because that would render irrelevant having to determine when the forward-looking period ends.  Backward-Looking Periods of Time",
  "10.64   A backward-looking period of time is usually indicated by  before   (as in   Acme may exercise the Option during the ten days before the Exclusivity Period expires ) and   prior to.   (Regarding  prior to , see 17.19.) To determine when a backward-looking period of time begins, the convention is that you count one of the terminal days and don’t count the other. Using the preceding   example,   if   the   Exclusivity   Period   expires 31   December,   then   30   December   is   the   first   day   before expiration, 21 December is the tenth day before expiration, and   the   first   day   that   Acme   may   exercise   the   Option   is 21 December. As with forward-looking periods of time (see 10.62),   making   it   explicit   how   the   beginning   date   of   a backward-looking period of time is to be determined would eliminate any uncertainty.  10.65   Backward-looking periods of time are often used to specify the   minimum   notice   that   must   be   given   in   a   certain situation, as in   Smith shall provide Jones with at least   [or no  fewer   than ]   ten   days’   prior   notice   of   any   Proposed   Transfer . (Regarding   prior notice , see 13.585.) Many courts have held that in this context too the general rule applies—you count one of the terminal days but not the other. But other courts have held that requiring at least   a certain number of days’ (or weeks’ or months’) advance notice means that those days (or weeks or months) must be “clear” or “entire” days, so you must exclude both the first and last terminal days. Consider how these differing approaches would play out using the preceding example, with 31 December being the date of the Proposed   Transfer:   Using   the   exclude-one-day   approach, 21 December, the tenth day before 31 December, would be the last day on which notice could validly be given. Using the exclude-both-days approach, 20 December, the eleventh day before 31 December, would be the last day on which notice could validly be given.  10.66   Given the divided caselaw on minimum-notice provisions, it would be best to eliminate the ambiguity in such provisions, at least to avoid confusing contract parties and their lawyers.",
  "Besides being explicit about how to calculate the beginning date (see 10.64), you could accomplish that by denoting a minimum-notice period in   entire days ,   entire   being a term that occurs in the caselaw. The term   clear   occurs more frequently in caselaw, but it might be less evident what   clear   means.  Don’t Use Confusing Points in Time  10.67   To determine a period of time, don’t use a point in time that could result in the parties arguing when, or whether, the point in time occurred. For example, using as a point in time  final resolution of any disputes   raises the question what   final resolution   means.  Don’t Use   Within  10.68   It’s best not to use   within : depending on the context, it can denote a period of time that is both forward- and backward- looking, a fact that might escape a party and its lawyers. For example, if a contract provides that   to validly exercise the Option, Acme must submit an Option Notice to Widgetco within seven days of the first anniversary of this agreement , that could be   interpreted   as   meaning   that   Acme   may   exercise   the Option no more than seven days before and no more than seven days after the anniversary, or the drafter might have thought it meant one or the other. It would be best to make the intended meaning explicit.  10.69   In a given context it might be apparent that the period of time   could   only   run   forward,   as   in   to   validly   exercise   the Option, Acme must submit an Option Notice to Widgetco within seven days of receiving a Sale Notice , but it would be clearer to use instead   no later than seven days after it receives a Sale Notice . That’s   because   instead   of   presenting   the   reader   with   the ambiguity caused by   within , then resolving it, it would be clearer to avoid the ambiguity.  10.70   Under   California   law,   the   word   within   is   particularly awkward when used in leases. For exercising a lease option to",
  "purchase, it has been held that   within 30 days prior to   means  during the 30 days before , but for options to renew leases, California courts have decided that   within 30 days prior to  means   at least 30 days before . See   Wilson v. Gentile , 10 Cal. Rptr.   2d   713   (Ct.   App.   1992).   It’s   bizarre   to   attribute   a different meaning to a phrase depending on the kind of contract it occurs in—instead of using   within X days prior to , express more clearly the meaning you intend.  Which Unit of Time to Use  10.71   Drafting a provision referring to a period of time requires determining not only when the period begins or ends and how long it lasts, but also what unit of time to state it in.  10.72   The smallest unit is the day. Often it’s preferable to denote periods of time in   business days   rather than simply   days.   (A business day is usually defined in contracts to mean any day other   than   a   weekend   or   a   public   holiday   in   a   specified jurisdiction, or any day that banks generally are, or a named bank is, open for business.) Denoting a period of time in business days gives the parties a better sense of the working days available to take a specified action. It would also ensure that the last day is a business day, which would make it more feasible   for   a   party   to   act   at   the   last   minute.   Similarly, denoting in business days a period for giving notice would ensure that the last day is a business day; this could be significant if the contract also provides—as is often the case— that notice given on a day other than a business day is not effective until the next business day.  10.73   On the other hand, using simply   days   makes it easier to quickly determine without a calendar when the period begins or   ends,   as   applicable.   It’s   unnecessary,   and   potentially confusing, to use   calendar days   instead of   days .  10.74   And don’t use the awkward   nonbusiness day . Instead, say   a day other than a business day .",
  "10.75   You can also state periods of time in months. It’s a generally accepted   convention   that   a   period   of   a   month   counting forward from a date ends at midnight at the beginning of the corresponding day of the following month, the day from which one is counting having been excluded. If next month doesn’t have a corresponding day, the period ends on the last day of that month; in other words, a period of a month counting from 31 March ends on 30 April. Because one can quickly determine without referring to a calendar the end date of a period denoted in months, it can simplify matters to denote in months periods of time of longer than, say, 90 days.  10.76   You   can   denote   periods   of   time   in   weeks,   but   doing   so provides no advantages over using days or months. In fact, it’s simpler to determine the end date of a period of time if it’s denoted in months rather than weeks. In this context,  week   is generally defined as a space of any seven consecutive days,   whatever   the   starting   point,   rather   than   seven successive days beginning with the day traditionally fixed as the first day of the week, whether it be Sunday or Monday.  10.77   A period of time can also last one or more years, in which case it runs through the day before the relevant anniversary of the first day included.  10.78   Some drafters are reluctant to express periods of time in months or years for fear that a court will construe   month   to mean one of the 12 months of the year, starting on the first day of that month, or   year   to mean 12 consecutive months starting 1 January. Because a period of time is measured from a stated beginning or ending point, this isn’t a valid concern. (But see 10.92–.98.)  10.79   The prefixes   bi-   and   semi-   are confusing.   Bimonthly   means “occurring   every   two   months,”   and   semimonthly   means “occurring twice a month.”   Biweekly   and   semiweekly   reflect the same distinction. But   biannual   and   semiannual   both mean “occurring   twice   a   year,”   although   some   dictionaries   also",
  "have   biannual   meaning the same thing as   biennial , namely “occurring every two years.” To avoid this confusion, use instead   twice   a   week / month / year   and   every   two weeks / months / years .  One Year and a Day  10.80   One encounters in lending documents provisions in which a lender   agrees   not   to   commence   bankruptcy   proceedings against the borrower until   one   [ or a ]   year and a day   after the borrower has repaid the specified debt. That’s because section 547   of   the   U.S.   Bankruptcy   Code   permits   the   trustee   or debtor-in-possession to avoid certain preferential transfers, and one element of a preferential transfer is that the transfer must have occurred between 90 days and one year before the petition was filed if at the time of the transfer the creditor was an insider.  10.81   But it would be sufficient to say instead   no sooner than one year   after. If the debt was repaid on 1 January 2017, one year after that would be 2 January 2018, assuming you exclude the day from which the year is being counted, as is standard (see 10.62). One year before that day would be 2 January 2017, assuming again that you exclude the day from which you’re counting. It follows that repayment on 1 January 2017 would be more than a year before the day the petition was filed.  10.82   The origin of   one year and a day   perhaps lies in the rhetorical flourish it offers, one that’s on display in   forever and a day , meaning “for a very long time.” If the   and a day   construct made sense, you would see it used routinely, and with   month  too. You don’t.  Using   On   to Denote a Day-Long Period of Time  10.83   A period of time need not be anchored to a stated beginning or ending point in time in one context—when an act or event must take place   on   a specified date. In that case, the",
  "period of time is the 24 hours of the day in question, and no beginning or ending point in time need be explicitly stated— they are midnight at the beginning and end of that day, respectively. A reference to an event that is to occur on a given day can be supplemented by adding a beginning or ending time of day, or both (see 10.33).  Using a Time of Day for the End of a Period of Time  10.84   Consider the following:   If the Buyer delivers a Claim Notice to the Seller before 2:00 p.m. on the date that is 20 Business Days after the Closing ... .  10.85   Because that sentence conveys two possible meanings, it’s not clear how long the buyer has to deliver a claim notice. The first possible meaning is that the condition would be satisfied if the notice were delivered anytime during the 20 business days up to 2:00 p.m. on the 20th business day. To convey that meaning, say instead   If the Buyer delivers a Claim Notice to the Seller between the Closing and 2:00 p.m. 20 Business Days after the Closing ... .  10.86   The second possible meaning is that the condition would be satisfied if the notice were delivered before 2:00 p.m. on the 20th business day, whereas delivery on any of the preceding 19 business days would not satisfy the condition. To express that meaning, say instead   If the Buyer delivers a Claim Notice to the Seller on the 20th Business Day after the Closing, before 2:00 p.m. ... .  Confusion Resulting from Referring to a Point in Time Instead of a Period in Time  10.87   If a contract refers to, for example,   the Revenues as of the 24- Month Revenue Measurement Point , don’t be surprised if a fight ensues over whether that reference is to revenues for only the second   12-month   period   or   for   both   12-month   periods. When referring to a figure that pertains to a period of time,",
  "refer to that period of time, not to the point in time marking the end of that period.  During the Period  10.88   Usually there’s a better alternative to   during the period   (and  during a period ) for establishing a period of time:  ...   during the period   from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under section 6(d).  During the period that   [read   While ] the Warrant is outstanding, the Company shall ... . ... by reason of the Employee’s separation from service   during a period in which   [read   while ] the Employee is a Specified Employee ... .  10.89   But nothing is wrong with, for example,   during that period , or  during the period specified in , or   during the period for calculating the Exercise Price —they’re used not to establish a period but instead to refer to a period stated elsewhere in the contract or in another document.  Will Have   Plus a Period of Time  10.90   Stating   that   a   party   will   have   a   period   of   time   to   do something can result in confusion as to whether what is being expressed is an obligation or a condition. Consider this sentence:   After termination, Acme will have 60 days to return to Widgetco any Confidential Information in Acme’s possession . The drafter presumably intended it to function as an obligation, so it would be better to express it as such:   No later than 60 days   after   termination,   Acme   shall   return   to   Widgetco   any Confidential Information in Acme’s possession   (see 3.72). Now consider this sentence:   After termination, Acme will have 60 days to exercise the Option by notice to Widgetco . The drafter presumably   intended   it   to   function   as   a   condition,   so   it would be better to express it as such (see 3.356):   To validly",
  "exercise   the   Option,   Acme   must   no   later   than   60   days   after termination notify Widgetco that it is doing so .  APPORTIONING QUANTITIES PER UNIT OF TIME  10.91   When apportioning quantities per unit of time (as in   Acme shall pay Doe an annual salary of $250,000 ), two issues arise. First, the alternative meanings of the unit of time used. And second, how to deal with any short period at the beginning or end of the contract.  The Possible Meanings of Certain Units of Time  10.92   When apportioning quantities per unit of time (as opposed to stating periods of time; see 10.78), the word   year   can be ambiguous, in that it could mean a year from the date of the agreement   and   each   subsequent   anniversary,   or   it   could mean   the   12-month   period   from   any   1   January.   In   this context, most courts have held that   year   means the 12-month period from 1 January.  10.93   In this context, the same ambiguity afflicts   month , in that  month   can mean the period from one day to midnight at the beginning of the corresponding day of the following month (see 10.75), but it can also mean one of any of the 12 months of the year.  10.94   It would be best to avoid this ambiguity by stating what   year  or   month   means. You could do so by using a more specific alternative to   month   or   year   consistent with the alternative meanings given in 10.92 and 10.93. Or you could use a defined term, although it would make sense to do so only if you use the term several times (see 6.115).  10.95   U.S. caselaw suggests that using the term   calendar year   would make it more likely that a court interprets   year   to mean the period from 1 January through 31 December. On the other hand,   it’s   not   the   clearest   usage—that   there’s   caselaw regarding what it means suggests as much. The term   civil year",
  "means the same thing as   calendar year , but if anything it’s less familiar.  10.96   Some contracts say that the meaning of   year   (and   month ) is to be determined according to the Gregorian calendar—the most widely used civil calendar—but that does nothing to resolve which meaning of   year   applies.  10.97   U.S. caselaw suggests that for apportioning quantities per unit of time, as opposed to measuring a period of time, a U.S. court would likely hold that   calendar month   refers to one of the months of the year. But it’s not the clearest way to express that meaning. English courts are inclined to treat  calendar month   as meaning the period from a given day to the beginning of the corresponding day of the following month. That inconsistency confirms the potential for confusion.  10.98   You can use   day   when apportioning quantities per unit of time, but it’s rare that parties need to apportion quantities daily. As regards using   week , the ambiguity that afflicts   year  and   month   would be aggravated: not only could   week   mean any   seven   consecutive   days   or   seven   consecutive   days beginning with the day traditionally fixed as the first day of the week, it’s also unclear what that tradition is. If you wish to   apportion   quantities   by   the   week,   specify   what   week  means.  Handling Short Periods  10.99   If in apportioning quantities per unit of time you use   year   to mean the 12-month period beginning any 1 January or use  month   to mean one of the 12 months of the year beginning with the first day of each month, it might be necessary to state how the parties are to treat any short period between the date of the agreement and the beginning of the next month or year, as well as any short period between the end of   the   last   complete   month   or   year   and   the   date   of termination. If instead the meaning of   month   or   year   is keyed",
  "to the date of the agreement, one is still faced with the possibility of an ending short period.  10.100   It might be sufficient to say that any short period is to be handled by prorating the number or amount—such as the number of vacation days to which an employee is entitled— that applies in the case of a complete month or year; you would probably also need to provide for rounding up, down, or to the nearest whole number. (Regarding rounding, see 14.53.)  10.101   If   the   number   or   amount   apportioned   to   a   period   is expressed as a percentage of a performance or other index— as is the case when Roe’s bonus is based on her employer’s annual gross revenue—it might be appropriate to provide that if there is a short period, the percentage will be of that portion of the index that applies to the short period rather than of a pro-rata portion of the entire period. Doing so in the   case   of   Roe   would   result   in   Roe   receiving   the   stated percentage of gross revenue for the short period between her starting work and 1 January of the next year, rather than the stated percentage of a pro-rata portion of gross revenue for the   entire   year.   This   approach   might   produce   an   unfair result; for example, giving Roe the stated percentage of gross revenue for a short period consisting of the last two months of the year would be particularly favorable to Roe if her employer is a retailer that collects the bulk of its earnings during   the   holiday   season.   Also,   it   might   be   difficult   or impossible   to   determine   what   portion   of   the   index   is attributable to the short period.  10.102   An alternative would be to use the entire index and prorate the percentage figure, but that might not make sense in the case of a performance bonus. For example, that approach would mean that Roe’s first bonus would depend in part on how her employer’s business performed during a period that preceded   Roe   becoming   an   employee.   Also,   if   the   short period comes at the end of the contract, it might not be reasonable to expect Roe to wait until after the end of the",
  "year in which she was terminated to receive any bonus to which she is entitled for the short period starting 1 January of that year.  10.103   Given these difficulties, it might be necessary to arrange for beginning and ending short periods.  Apportioning Units of Time  10.104   When what is being apportioned in a unit of time is one or more other units of time, that raises the question whether the units of time being apportioned have to constitute a single block of time.  10.105   Consider the following:   For two months each year the Employee shall work in Acme’s Budapest office . Leaving aside what   year  means (see 10.92), it’s not clear whether to comply with this obligation the employee must spend one two-month block of time   working   in   the   Budapest   office   or   instead   can accumulate the required time during two or more visits to Budapest.  10.106   The simplest way to make it clear that an apportioned period of time must constitute a block of time is to use the word  consecutive , as in   For two consecutive months each year . (For that to work, the block of time would have to consist of more than one unit   of time,   so you   would need   to convert   a reference to one month to   30 consecutive days .) If that’s not the intended meaning, make that clear. For example, you could say   Over the course of one or more visits, each no shorter than five business days, excluding travel days, the Employee shall work in Acme’s Budapest office for two months of each year .  OTHER STANDARDS FOR SPEED, FREQUENCY, AND DURATION  10.107   In   addition   to   containing   precise   references   to   time, contracts also use vagueness to state when and how often actions are to take place. (For vagueness generally, see 7.42.)",
  "Promptly, Immediately  10.108   For obligations and conditions, it’s likely that in the minds of many drafters   immediately   requires speedier action than does   promptly . Some caselaw supports that distinction. For example, the District Court for the Southern District of New York has said that   promptly   doesn’t mean   immediately , but rather within a reasonable time. See   Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. Bay View Franchise Mortgage Acceptance Co. , No. 00 CIV. 8613 (SAS), 2002 WL 818082 (S.D.N.Y. 30 Apr. 2002).  10.109   But this distinction disappears when you look more closely at it.  PROMPTLY  10.110   The   Oxford   English   Dictionary   defines   promptly   to   mean “readily,   quickly,   directly,   at   once,   without   a   moment’s delay.” And courts have uniformly held that promptness is a function   of   circumstances.   Here   are   three   representative cases:  State v. Chesson , 948 So. 2d 566, 568 (Ala. Civ. App. 2006) (stating that the term “promptly” has been construed to mean within a reasonable time in light of all the circumstances).  Doe Fund, Inc. v. Royal Indemnity Co. , 825 N.Y.S.2d 450, 451 (App. Div. 2006) (“[W]hen an insurance policy requires notice of an occurrence or action be given promptly, that means within a reasonable time in view of all of the facts and circumstances.”).  Buck v. Scalf , No. M2002-00620-COA-R3-CV, 2003 WL 21170328, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. 20 May 2003) (“It has generally been held that the terms ‘promptly’ or ‘prompt notice’ mean that notice must be given within a reasonable time in view of all the facts and circumstances of the case.”).",
  "10.111   The tenth edition of   Black’s Law Dictionary   doesn’t contain an entry for   promptly , but the sixth edition, published in 1990, does, saying that the meaning of   promptly   “depends largely on the facts in each case, for what is ‘prompt’ in one situation   may   not   be   considered   such   under   other circumstances or conditions.”  10.112   Given   that   the   meaning   of   promptly   depends   on   the circumstances, it follows that saying   as promptly as practicable  [or   possible ] adds nothing other than some unnecessary extra words.  IMMEDIATELY  10.113   The   Oxford   English   Dictionary   gives   as   the   definition   of  immediately   “Without any delay or lapse of time; instantly, directly,   straightaway;   at   once.”   ( Immediately   has   other meanings,   including   “without   intermediary,”   as   in   the immediately preceding Business Day .)  10.114   The   current   edition   of   Black’s   Law   Dictionary   says   that  immediate   means   occurring   without   delay,   and   the   sixth edition says that   immediately   means “without delay; directly; within a reasonable time under the circumstances of the case; promptly and with reasonable dispatch.”  10.115   So just in terms of dictionary definitions,   immediately   looks very much like   promptly . And this similarity becomes more pronounced when you look at the caselaw, which indicates that   just   like   promptly ,   immediately   is   subject   to   a reasonableness standard. Here are some representative cases:  Dwoskin v. Rollins, Inc. , 634 F.2d 285, 294 n.6 (5th Cir. 1981) (“[S]everal Georgia cases arising in a variety of contexts suggest that immediate delivery means performance with reasonable diligence concerning the circumstances.”)  Continental Savings Association v. U.S. Fidelity and Guaranty Co. , 762 F.2d 1239, 1243 (5th Cir. 1985) (“Under Texas law, similar phrases, such as ‘as soon as practicable’ or",
  "‘immediately,’ require only that notice be given within a reasonable time in light of the circumstances involved.”)  Briggs Ave LLC v. Insurance Corp. of Hannover , No. 05 Civ. 4212 (GEL), 2006 WL 1517606, at *5 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 30 May 2006) (“In any event, there is little or no functional difference between terms like ‘immediately’ or ‘as soon as practicable’; whatever language a policy uses to limit the time for notice, the touchstone is always the same, reasonableness under the circumstances.”)  Martinez v. District 1199J National Union of Hospital & Health Care Employees , 280 F. Supp. 2d 342, 353 (D.N.J. 2003) (“The Court finds that ‘immediately prior’ means that a reasonable amount of time would pass between eligibility for health coverage with the Fund and the start of unemployment.”)  Sunshine Textile Services, Inc. v. American Employers’ Insurance Co. , No. 4:CV-95-0699, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22904, at *7 (M.D. Pa. 12 May 1997) (“The requirement of notice ‘as soon as practicable’ or ‘immediately’ both prescribe notice within a reasonable amount of time under the circumstances after learning of the occurrence, taking into account the exercise of due diligence.”)  10.116   In   Morgan Guaranty   (see 10.108), the court said that   promptly  doesn’t mean   immediately ,   but   rather   within   a   reasonable time.   But   that   was   a   case   construing   promptly ,   not  immediately ,   so   it’s   of   no   real   value   as   support   for   the proposition that   immediately   isn’t subject to a reasonableness standard.  10.117   And plenty of cases use the phrase   immediately or within a reasonable time , suggesting that   immediately   isn’t subject to a reasonableness standard, but those cases don’t address the meaning of   immediately   either.  THE   SEMANTICS",
  "10.118   The net effect is that for contract drafting,   promptly   and  immediately   mean the same thing. The same goes for the adjectives   prompt   and   immediate .  10.119   In   idiomatic   usage,   immediately   can   mean   “instantly”— I didn’t hear what John said, but Mathilde immediately turned and walked away .   Immediately   can also be used when some time would be required— the U.S. Navy immediately began work on a new aircraft carrier .  10.120   As for   promptly , it conveys a sense that some time would be required.   Promptly   can mean “instantly,” but only if you’re aiming for a slightly droll effect— I didn’t hear what John said, but Mathilde promptly turned and walked away .  10.121   So   immediately   conveys   a   slightly   broader   meaning   than  promptly . But the instantaneous sense of   immediately   works best   when   you’re   describing   events   that   have   occurred, particularly   simple   cause-and-effect   scenarios.   To   regulate conduct—as in contracts—it’s problematic, because business affairs manifestly don’t lend themselves to instant responses. You must always consider what the circumstances reasonably permit.  10.122   The notion that   immediately   requires speedier action than does   promptly   is   reminiscent   of   the   ostensible   distinction between   best efforts   and   reasonable efforts   (see 8.18–.27). In both   cases,   an   untenable   distinction   lives   on   due   to   the failure   of   drafters   to   appreciate   how   a   reasonableness standard limits the reach of the seemingly more onerous standard.  RECOMMENDATION  10.123   Because   immediately   seems   to   promise   more   than   it   can deliver, omit it from your contracts for stating obligations and conditions. Use   promptly   instead.  10.124   One exception would be if you’re seeking to express a real sense   of   urgency,   as   in   If   the   Service   Provider   detects   any unauthorized use of a User’s account, the Service Provider shall",
  "suspend that account immediately . But even in such contexts, assume that anyone under an obligation to act immediately isn’t required to act instantaneously.  10.125   Don’t include both   promptly   and   immediately   in a contract. To   do   so   is   to   invite   a   disgruntled   party   to   argue   for gradations of meaning where none had been intended.  10.126   It would be pointless to indulge in synonyms such as   as soon as practicable ,   expeditiously , the stale and officious   forthwith , and   right away . Similarly, don’t use   without undue delay —by using   promptly   you express the intended meaning positively instead of negatively and save two words in the process. But in   a   contract   governed   by   German   law,   it   might   be appropriate   to   use   without   undue   delay   as   a   convenient English equivalent to the German legal term   unverzüglich .  10.127   If future circumstances are predictable enough for you to specify an absolute time limit rather than a vague one, do so —it   would   allow   you   to   reduce   the   uncertainty   in   your contract   (see   7.42).   Or   you   could   combine   a   vague   and absolute limit— promptly, but not later than X days after   ... .  At Any Time  10.128   If a contract uses   may   to grant Acme discretion to take a particular action, then absent any indication to the contrary Acme would be free to take that action whenever it wishes. It follows that   at any time   should generally be redundant in language of discretion:  Any Lender may at any time assign or pledge to a Federal Reserve Bank all or any portion of that Lender’s rights under this agreement and any Term Notes issued to it.  10.129   But if an instance of language of discretion is particularly important, a drafter might nevertheless find it prudent to use  at any time   to preclude any argument on the issue.  10.130   Don’t use   at any time   in language of obligation—nothing is gained by saying   Each party shall at any time before the Effective",
  "Time   as opposed to   Each party shall before the Effective Time . The same applies to use of   at any time   in conditional clauses, except see 3.322.  From Time to Time   and   On One or More Occasions  10.131   To make it explicit that a right isn’t a one-time-only right, use   on one or more occasions   instead of   from time to time .  10.132   In language of discretion, the phrase   from time to time   is used to mean, in essence, “on one or more occasions.” In theory,  from time to time   makes it clear, with respect to a given right, that a party isn’t limited to exercising that right just once.  10.133   That might not be an issue. For one thing, repeated exercise of a right isn’t possible in the case of a right that by its nature can be exercised only once, as in   Acme may terminate this agreement in the following circumstances . And if a right allows a party to engage in an ongoing process, it would be odd to state that the party may exercise that right on one or more occasions.   For   example,   if   a   contract   says   Acme   may   sell Widgets   to   any   Person   outside   the   Territory ,   you   couldn’t reasonably claim that Acme had exhausted that right after having sold a single lot of widgets.  10.134   But that leaves instances in which a party is granted a right to   take   a   specified   action   and   nothing   in   the   provision suggests how often the right may be exercised.  10.135   You might be willing to assume that absent any language indicating otherwise, a right may be exercised multiple times. Or it might be clear, as a matter of industry practice, that the right isn’t a one-time-only right, so it would be odd to say so explicitly:  The Maker may   on one or more occasions   prepay all or any portion of the Principal or Interest of this Note to the Holder without premium or penalty.  10.136   But the safest approach is to make it explicit that the right isn’t   a   one-time-only   right,   to   avoid   giving   a   desperate",
  "litigant even a weak argument to make. In such contexts,  from time to time   isn’t the ideal phrase. It means “once in a while,” and although a party could conceivably exercise a right periodically, it might instead exercise it, for example, twice   in   quick   succession.   Both   alternatives   are   better captured by the phrase   on   one or more occasions :  The Bank may   from time to time   [read   on one or more occasions ] adjust the Advance Rate based on changes in its collection experience regarding Accounts or other factors relating to the Accounts or other Collateral.  10.137   By extension, if you wish to make it clear in language of obligation   or   in   a   conditional   clause   that   the   action   in question could be taken on one or more occasions, use that phrase and not   from time to time .  At All Times  10.138   You shouldn’t need to use   at all times , but the reasons for that depend on the context.  10.139   If you state an ongoing obligation ( The Debtor shall maintain at   its   principal   place   of   business   all   records   relating   to   the Collateral ), usually the obligation applies at all times without your having to say so.  10.140   But   that   isn’t   necessarily   always   the   case.   Consider   this example:   Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Payment   Fund   includes   cash   sufficient   to   satisfy   the   Parent’s obligation to pay the Merger Consideration . One could argue that the account need contain the cash only when it’s time to pay the Merger Consideration. If you want to make it clear that   the   account   always   has   to   contain   the   minimum amount, that’s the word to use— always , not   at all times .  10.141   And consider this statement of fact:   Acme has conducted its operations in compliance with   ... . Someone looking for a fight could   argue   that   it   means   that   at   some   point,   but   not necessarily   always,   Acme’s   operation   complied   with   the",
  "standard in question. The simplest fix for that isn’t adding   at all times . Instead, state a time period. For example,   since 1 January 2017 .  So Long As  10.142   In   everyday   English,   the   phrase   so   long   as   means   “on condition that”. As in,   You may go to the movies, so long as Juanita goes too . It’s used to convey that meaning in contracts too, but it would be simpler and clearer to use   if   instead:  After the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on Notes called for redemption   so long as   [read   if ] the Company has deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay ... .  10.143   But   so long as   is also used to convey the meaning   for as long as , or   while , as in,   We’ll be able to remain on the island so long as our water supplies last . For contracts,   if   is the simplest and clearest choice to convey this meaning too:  So long as   [read   If ] the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Nonparty Claim in accordance with section 8.7(b), the Indemnifying Party will not be responsible for ... .  Periodically  10.144   Don’t use   periodically , which means “at regular intervals” or just “from time to time.” Instead, be specific. Consider this language of obligation:  The Bank shall   periodically   provide the Client with a statement of account for each Account, identifying Assets held in the Accounts.  10.145   It   would   be   clearer   to   omit   periodically   and   instead   state specific   intervals,   or   have   the   bank   provide   a   statement whenever the client asks for one.  10.146   And consider this language of discretion:  The Trustees of the Trust may   periodically   review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the",
  "commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio.  10.147   Presumably   the   idea   is   that   the   trustees   would   review commissions whenever they think it appropriate. The word  periodically   doesn’t express that.  10.148   And if you want to express that things might change over time, you can do better than   periodically :  ... and will be determined by the Agent in accordance with this agreement and the Agent’s loan procedures   periodically   [read  then ] in effect ... .  AVOIDING CONFUSION BY ADDING A TIME COMPONENT  10.149   When in a contract you refer to one or more things that pertain to a party (or anyone else, for that matter), make it clear whether you’re referring to those one or more things at the time the contract is being signed or at some other time, to   preclude   the   possibility   of   a   fight   over   the   intended meaning.  10.150   For   example,   a   provision   that   applies   to   affiliates   or subsidiaries of a party can cause confusion if it’s not made clear whether it applies only to affiliates or subsidiaries in existence when the contract was signed, as opposed to when the   provision   is   being   applied.   See   GTE   Wireless,   Inc.   v. Cellexis   International,   Inc. ,   341   F.3d   1   (1st   Cir.   2003) (regarding the meaning of   affiliates );   Ellington v. EMI Music, Inc. , 21 N.E.3d 1000 (N.Y. 2014) (same).  10.151   To avoid that kind of confusion, address the issue explicitly in the provision in question or in a related definition. The following definition shows in italics and in brackets language intended to make it clear that it applies at signing (the first addition) or at any time in the future:  “ Subsidiary ” means, for a Person [ on the date of this agreement ] [ at a given time] , a ... legal entity of which that Person or one of",
  "that Person’s Subsidiaries ...   then   owns ... .  10.152   In   Alliantgroup, L.P. v. Solanji , No. 01-12-00798-CV, 2014 WL 1089284, at *1 (Tex. App. 18 Mar. 2014), a similar dispute arose over the meaning of   client . And in   Kia Motors Am., Inc. v. Glassman Oldsmobile Saab Hyundai, Inc. , 706 F.3d 733 (6th Cir. 2013), the issue was whether   applicable law   referred to the law at the time the contract was signed or as in effect in the future. (See 13.54 regarding   as amended .)  10.153   Also, see 3.458 for how it can be unclear whether a reference to   shares   means   just   shares   owned   on   the   date   of   the agreement or whether shares acquired later are also included. Again, it’s best to make it clear which meaning is intended.",
  "AMBIGUITY OF THE PART VERSUS THE WHOLE  11.1   Use of plural nouns and the words   and ,   or ,   every ,   each , and  any   can   cause   ambiguity.   In   each   case,   the   question   is whether it is a single member of a group of two or more that’s being referred to, or the entire group, so this manual uses the phrase “the part versus the whole” to refer to this sort of ambiguity. This chapter explores the sources of this kind of ambiguity and how to avoid it or eliminate it. The level of detail is justified, given the shifting complexity of the topic   and   the   alternative   meanings   riding   on   subtle distinctions. So as not to introduce unhelpful complexity, the terminology used ignores some linguistics nuances.  11.2   To illustrate the analysis, this chapter contains numbered example sentences. (Chapter 12 also contains such example sentences.) Each such sentence that is ambiguous is followed by one or more italicized sentences that convey its alternative meanings, like this:  [0]   Each numbered example in regular text is either ambiguous or unambiguous. [0a]   Each numbered-and-lettered example in italics represents one of the possible meanings of the immediately preceding numbered example.  WHETHER SINGULAR MEANS PLURAL  11.3   It can be unclear whether a reference in the singular also applies to the plural. The drafter might have omitted the plural to exclude the plural from the scope of the provision",
  "or because they hadn’t spotted the issue or had assumed that the provision would include the plural anyway.  11.4   One   example   of   this   uncertainty   was   featured   in   Coral Production Corp. v. Central Resources, Inc. , 273 Neb. 379 (2007). The contract provision at issue stated that a preferential right to   purchase   certain   oil   and   gas   assets   wouldn’t   apply   if “substantially all of the assets and/or stock of the selling party   is   sold   to   a   non-affiliated   third   party.”   The   party seeking to invoke the preferential right contended that sale of the oil and gas assets didn’t fall within that exception because   the   assets   had   been   sold   to   more   than   one nonaffiliated person. The court found in favor of the party that had sold the assets, holding that the exception applied to sale to more than one person.  11.5   Similarly,   ION Geophysical Corp. v. Fletcher International, Ltd. , No. CIV.A. 5050-VCP, 2010 WL 4378400 (Del. Ch. 5 Nov. 2010),   concerned   whether   a   party   to   a   stock   purchase agreement   could   issue   more   than   one   notice   under   a procedure   that   would   allow   that   party,   under   certain circumstances,   to   increase   the   total   number   of   common shares   into   which   it   could   convert   preferred   shares.   The provision in question used “notice” in the singular. After analyzing, none too convincingly, use of “notice” with the definite article   the   and the indefinite article   a , the court held that   the   provision   was   unambiguous—the   parties   had intended that more than one notice could be issued.  11.6   But what the courts held in these disputes is less relevant than how the disputes could have been avoided. Whenever you’re   drafting   a   provision   that   refers   to   a   thing   or   an unnamed person, consider whether you want that provision to apply (1) regardless of the number of things or persons, (2) only regarding one thing or person, or (3) only regarding more than one thing or person. More often than not, the first meaning is the one you’ll want to convey. In that case, make it explicit. Whoever drafted the language at issue in   Coral Production   could have accomplished that by using the phrase",
  "one or more , as in “one or more non-affiliated persons.” By contrast, to fix the language at issue in   ION Geophysical , the drafter would have had to add another sentence.  11.7   Use the phrase   one or more   rather than the formula   X or Xs — say   one or more widgets   instead of   the widget or widgets .  11.8   Don’t rely on an internal rule of interpretation to ensure that another   provision   in   a   contract   applies   regardless   of   the number of things or persons. Such provisions are clumsy (see 15.22), and you can’t assume that such a provision would be enough to prevent a fight over singular versus plural. For example, the contract at issue in   Coral Production   featured just such an internal rule of interpretation.  The Role of   Any  11.9   Consider the following:  if Acme files a complaint with a government body if Acme files a complaint with any government body  11.10   Some might think that using   any   in the second example would ensure that the provision couldn’t be read as applying only if Acme files a complaint with a single government body, as opposed to two or more government bodies. (If you think it unlikely that anyone would argue for the narrower interpretation, consider   Coral Production ; see 11.4.)  11.11   But   any   can’t be counted on to accomplish that, because it could be taken to mean that the provision applies to any one member   of   the   class   in   question   (see   11.103).   That’s   the meaning   conveyed   by   the   indefinite   article   a ,   so   using instead   any   serves only, in some contexts, a minor rhetorical function.  11.12   If you want to convey the broader meaning, use   one or more , as in   if Acme files a complaint with one or more government bodies .",
  "A Balanced Approach  11.13   You could go out of your way to make it clear that every provision that’s phrased as applying to a single item also applies to more than one of that item, but the result would be ponderous prose. Compare the following two versions of the same provision, the first of which is worded to apply to single items and the second of which is worded to apply to one or more items:  Acme shall not disclose to a Representative any information if doing so would cause Acme to breach a duty to another Person to keep that information confidential or would cause Acme to violate a law or an order of a Government Body. Acme shall not disclose to one or more Representatives any information if doing so would cause Acme to breach a duty to one or more other Persons to keep that information confidential or would cause Acme to violate one or more laws or orders of one or more Government Bodies.  11.14   The second version is sufficiently ponderous as to suggest that it’s not feasible to make it explicit in each case that a provision that applies to one item also applies to more than one of that item. Instead, the more reader-friendly approach would be to use   one or more   intermittently, presumably in those contexts that pose a greater risk of dispute.  PLURAL NOUNS  11.15   Sentences containing plural nouns can be unambiguous—for example,   The Acme Subsidiaries are Delaware corporations.   But in many sentences a plural noun can engender ambiguity, with the nature and extent of the ambiguity being a function of context. In the following examples, adding   all of   to a plural noun—for example, saying   all of the Stockholders   rather than simply   the Stockholders —wouldn’t affect the analysis.  Subject Ambiguity",
  "11.16   When a plural noun is the subject of a sentence that uses any category of contract language other than language of discretion,   as   in   [1]   below   (which   uses   language   of obligation), it can be unclear whether the persons or things constituting the subject are to act individually, as in [1a], or collectively, as in [1b], so the group is treated as one. Often when   a   contract   requires   that   parties   act   collectively,   an agent is appointed to act on their behalf. That precludes ambiguity of the sort exhibited by [1].  [1]   The Stockholders shall notify Acme. [1a]   Each Stockholder shall notify Acme.  [1b]   The Stockholders, acting collectively, shall notify Acme.  11.17   When language of discretion is used, an additional meaning is possible. Imposing an obligation on each member of a group,   as   in   [1a],   has   the   same   effect   as   imposing   that obligation on all members of that group. By contrast, saying that the members of a group have discretion to take a given action could mean either (1) that any one member may take that action, regardless of whether any other member takes that action (see [2a]), or (2) that no member may take that action unless all members do (see [2b]).  [2]   The Stockholders may notify Acme. [2a]   One or more Stockholders may notify Acme.  [2b]   The Stockholders may notify Acme, but only if they all do.  [2c]   The Stockholders, acting collectively, may notify Acme.  Direct-Object Ambiguity  11.18   When a plural noun is other than the subject of a sentence, the potential ambiguity is similar to the ambiguity that arises when a plural noun is the subject. See [3], in which the plural noun serves as the direct object. But when it doesn’t make sense to distinguish between treating the persons or things constituting the direct object individually and treating them collectively, the potential number of meanings is reduced.",
  "For example, whereas [3b] is one of the possible meanings of [3] because giving a single notice could notify a group, no analogous meaning is possible in the case of [4].  [3]   Acme shall notify the Stockholders. [3a]   Acme shall notify each of the Stockholders.  [3b]   Acme shall notify the Stockholders, considered collectively.  [4]   Acme   shall   sell the Shares.  11.19   As is the case when the plural noun is the subject of the sentence, the potential number of meanings in [3] increases when the sentence is expressed using language of discretion: when   the   members   of   the   object   group   are   considered individually rather than collectively, it’s not clear whether the subject has discretion to act regarding all the members, as in [5a], or some or all of them, as in [5b]. The same ambiguity is present when one restates [4] using language of discretion (see [6]).  [5]   Acme may notify the Stockholders. [5a]   Acme may notify the Stockholders, but only if it notifies all of them.  [5b]   Acme may notify one or more Stockholders.  [5c]   Acme may notify the Stockholders, considered collectively.  [6]   Acme may sell the Shares. [6a]   Acme may sell the Shares, but only if it sells all of them.  [6b]   Acme may sell one or more Shares.  Subject-and-Direct-Object Ambiguity  11.20   When   both   the   subject   and   the   direct   object   are   plural nouns, it can be unclear whether the plural direct object relates   to   each   member   of   the   plural   subject   considered separately or to all members considered as a whole. In the case   of   [7],   the   question   is   whether   each   Stockholder   is required   to   submit   one   questionnaire   or   more   than   one. Often it will be clear from the context which is the intended meaning.",
  "[7]   The Stockholders shall promptly submit the completed questionnaires. [7a]   Each Stockholder shall promptly submit a completed questionnaire.  [7b]   Each Stockholder shall promptly submit the completed questionnaires.  [7c]   The Stockholders, acting collectively, shall promptly submit the completed questionnaires.  AND  11.21   Related   to   the   ambiguity   caused   by   plural   nouns   is   that engendered by nouns or adjectives linked by   and.  11.22   And   concerns a set in its totality.   We’ll invite Kim, Pat, and Alex   entails inviting them all. See   The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language   (referred to in this chapter as   CGEL ), at 1293.  11.23   Often   and   is   unambiguous,   as   in   the   sentence   Acme and Widgetco   are   Delaware   corporations.   But   and   can   engender ambiguity—it can convey that the members of a group are to be considered together but can also convey that they are to be   considered   together   and   separately.   This   has   been acknowledged in the literature on drafting. See, e.g., F. Reed Dickerson,   The Fundamentals of Legal Drafting   (2d ed. 1986), at   105;   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at   639. Furthermore, in contracts it can be unclear whether nouns linked by   and  are acting, or are being acted on, individually or collectively. (The latter kind of ambiguity also arises in connection with plural nouns; see 11.6.) Whether   and   is ambiguous, and in what way, depends on the grammatical context, something that the literature on drafting has not explored in any detail.  Subject Ambiguity  11.24   When contract parties linked by   and   constitute the subject of a sentence using any category of contract language other than language of discretion, as in [8] (which uses language of obligation), it can be unclear whether the persons or things constituting the subject are to be considered individually, as",
  "in [8a], or collectively, as in [8b]. (The ambiguity in [8] is analogous to that in [1].)  [8]   Able and Baker shall notify Acme. [8a]   Able and Baker shall each notify Acme.  [8b]   Able and Baker, acting collectively, shall notify Acme.  11.25   Language of discretion causes greater ambiguity than does language of obligation. (The ambiguity in [9] is analogous to that in [2].)  [9]   Able and Baker may notify Acme. [9a]   Both Able and Baker, as opposed to just one or the other of them, may notify Acme.  [9b]   Able or Baker, or both of them, may notify Acme.  [9c]   Able and Baker, acting collectively, may notify Acme.  Direct-Object Ambiguity  11.26   A similar range of potential meanings arises when parties linked by   and   are other than the subject of the sentence. See, for example, [10], in which nouns linked by   and   serve as direct objects. But when the persons or things constituting direct objects cannot be considered collectively, as in [11], the potential ambiguity is reduced.  [10]   Acme shall notify Able and Baker. [10a]   Acme shall notify both Able and Baker.  [10b]   Acme shall notify Able and Baker, considered collectively.  [11]   Acme shall dissolve Subsidiary A and Subsidiary B.  11.27   As with [8], the number of potential meanings conveyed by [10]   increases   when   it   is   expressed   using   language   of discretion;   when   the   members   of   the   object   group   are considered individually rather than collectively, it’s not clear whether the subject has discretion to act regarding all the members, as in [12a], or some or all of them, as in [12b]. The same   ambiguity   is   present   when   one   restates   [11]   using language of discretion; see [13].",
  "[12]   Acme may notify Able and Baker. [12a]   Acme may notify both Able and Baker, as opposed to one or the other of them.  [12b]   Acme may notify either Able or Baker, or both of them.  [12c]   Acme may notify Able and Baker, considered collectively.  [13]   Acme may dissolve Subsidiary A and Subsidiary B. [13a]   Acme may dissolve both Subsidiary A and Subsidiary B, as opposed to one or the other of them.  [13b]   Acme may dissolve one or both of Subsidiary A and Subsidiary B.  11.28   A range of ambiguity comparable to that in [12] and [13] arises when instead one uses language of prohibition, as in [14] and [15]. The more natural meaning of [14] and [15] is conveyed by [14a] and [15a], respectively. If you wish to convey the meaning in [14b] or [15b], you shouldn’t rely on [14] or [15] to do so.  [14]   Acme shall not notify Able and Baker. [14a]   Acme shall not notify Able and shall not notify Baker.  [14b]   Acme shall not notify both Able and Baker but may notify just one or the other of them.  [14c]   Acme shall not notify Able and Baker, considered collectively.  [15]   Acme shall not dissolve Subsidiary A and Subsidiary B. [15a]   Acme shall not dissolve Subsidiary A and shall not dissolve Subsidiary B.  [15b]   Acme shall not dissolve both Subsidiary A and Subsidiary B but may dissolve one or the other of them.  Subject-and-Direct-Object Ambiguity  11.29   Example [16] demonstrates the ambiguity found in [8], but in addition, it’s unclear whether the   and -coordination of the subjects is “distributive” (as in [16a]) or “joint” (as in [16b]). See   CGEL , at   1282. In other words, it’s unclear whether each of   the   subjects   is   to   notify   one   or   both   of   the   objects. (Regarding   respectively , as used in [16b], see 13.706.)",
  "[16]   Able and Baker shall notify Acme and Widgetco. [16a]   Able and Baker shall each notify Acme and Widgetco.  [16b]   Able and Baker shall notify Acme and Widgetco, respectively.  [16c]   Able and Baker, acting collectively, shall notify Acme and Widgetco.  Multiple Verb Phrases  11.30   A variant of the ambiguity present in [12] occurs when in language of discretion the subject and a single   may   are used with two verb phrases, as in [17]. Using   may   in each verb phrase,   as   in   [17b],   would   make   it   clear   that   Acme’s discretion is not limited to either selling assets and making capital   expenditures   or   doing   neither.   Example   [17c] accomplishes the same goal. When there are three or more verb phrases, it may be most efficient to express this meaning by stating that the subject   may do any one or more of the following .  [17]   Acme may sell assets and make capital expenditures. [17a]   Acme may sell assets and make capital expenditures, but not just one or the other.  [17b]   Acme may sell assets and may make capital expenditures.  [17c]   Acme may sell assets or make capital expenditures, or it may do both.  11.31   When the first verb phrase logically leads to the second, it is likely that the sense   together and not separately   is intended, as in [18].  [18]   Parent may dissolve Sub and liquidate its assets.  Ambiguity of Direct Object Plus Objects of Preposition  11.32   When a direct object is accompanied by nouns separated by  and   that are functioning as objects of a preposition (in the case of [19], [20], and [21], the indirect objects   Echo   and  Foxtrot ), the ambiguity can be analogous to that exhibited in [10], [12], and [14].  [19]   Delta shall issue a promissory note to Echo and Foxtrot.",
  "[19a]   Delta shall issue a promissory note to each of Echo and Foxtrot.  [19b]   Delta shall issue a promissory note to Echo and Foxtrot jointly.  [20]   Delta may issue a promissory note to Echo and Foxtrot. [20a]   Delta may issue a promissory note to each of Echo and Foxtrot, as opposed to just one or the other.  [20b]   Delta may issue a promissory note to Echo, to Foxtrot, or to each of them.  [20c]   Delta may issue a promissory note to Echo and Foxtrot jointly.  [21]   Delta shall not issue a promissory note to Echo and Foxtrot. [21a]   Delta shall not issue a promissory note to each of Echo and Foxtrot, as opposed to just one or the other.  [21b]   Delta shall not issue a promissory note to Echo or Foxtrot.  [21c]   Delta shall not issue a promissory note to Echo and Foxtrot jointly.  11.33   But when the objects of prepositions cannot be considered collectively, there is reduced scope for ambiguity. Because it would not be possible to construct a factory located in both California and Florida, the language of obligation in [22] is unambiguous   and   the   language   of   discretion   in   [23] and language   of   prohibition   in   [24]   exhibit   fewer   possible meanings than the analogous [20] and [21].  [22]   Acme shall construct a factory in California and Florida. [23]   Acme may construct a factory in California and Florida. [23a]   Acme may construct a factory in California, in Florida, or in both states.  [23b]   Acme may construct a factory in both California and Florida, as opposed to in just one state or the other.  [24]   Acme shall not construct a factory in California and Florida. [24a]   Acme shall not construct a factory in California or in Florida.  [24b]   Acme shall not construct a factory in both California and Florida, as opposed to in one or the other.  The Effect of Adjectives",
  "11.34   Another form of ambiguity associated with   and   is that which derives from (1) adjectives that modify a noun and are linked by   and   (as in   temporary and part-time employees ) and (2) nouns modified by adjectives and linked by   and   (as in   temporary employees and part-time employees ).  11.35   The ambiguity that arises in a provision using a plural noun modified by adjectives joined by   and   is a function of context and of the kind of contract language used. Below are two examples: [25]   uses   language   of   obligation   and   [26]   uses language   of   discretion.   Because   [26]   uses   language   of discretion, it exhibits a greater number of possible meanings than does [25] (see 11.17).  [25]   Tango shall terminate the employment of Acme’s temporary and part- time employees. [25a]   Tango shall terminate the employment of those Acme employees who are temporary and those Acme employees who are part-time.  [25b]   Tango shall terminate the employment of those Acme employees who are both temporary and part-time.  [26]   Tango may terminate the employment of Acme’s temporary and part- time employees. [26a]   Tango may terminate the employment of no fewer than all Acme employees who are temporary and no fewer than all Acme employees who are part-time. Tango shall not terminate all the employees in one group without also terminating all the employees in the other group.  [26b]   Tango may terminate the employment of one or both of the following: (1) no fewer than all Acme employees who are temporary and (2) no fewer than all Acme employees who are part-time.  [26c]   Tango may terminate the employment of (1) one or more Acme employees who are temporary and (2) one or more Acme employees who are part-time.  [26d]   Tango may terminate the employment of no fewer than all Acme employees who are both temporary and part-time.  [26e]   Tango may terminate the employment of one or more Acme employees who are both temporary and part-time.",
  "11.36   But in the case of an   and -coordination featuring mutually exclusive   attributes,   ambiguity   would   be   reduced.   An example of mutually exclusive attributes is   full-time and part- time employee —an employee cannot be both full-time and part-time   simultaneously.   Using   that   and -coordination   in [25] would eliminate the ambiguity, because the meaning conveyed by [25b] wouldn’t be possible, leaving as the only possible meaning that of [25a] .   Using that   and -coordination in [26] would have the same effect, eliminating [26d] and [26e] as possible meanings.  11.37   An alternative to having a noun modified by two or more adjectives is to repeat the noun with each adjective, as in  temporary employees and part-time employees . Using that   and - coordination in [25] and [26] would have the same effect as using   an   and -coordination   featuring   mutually   exclusive attributes (see 11.36).  Every X and Y   and   Each X and Y  11.38   When   every   and   each   are used before two or more nouns linked by   and , another kind of ambiguity results. In [27], the question arises whether every director and every officer is entitled to indemnification, or whether only persons who are both a director and an officer are entitled to indemnification. Context will often suggest the intended meaning; in the case of [27], the intended meaning is presumably that expressed in [27a] rather than that expressed in [27b].  [27]   Acme shall indemnify every director and officer of Widgetco. [27a]   Acme shall indemnify every director and every officer of Widgetco.  [27b]   Acme shall indemnify every person who is both a director and an officer of Widgetco.  Adding Contingency to   And  11.39   Drafters might find it helpful to acknowledge a contingent quality in one or more elements linked by   and .",
  "11.40   Consider   County of Du Page v. Illinois Labor Relations Board , 231 Ill. 2d 593, 900 N.E.2d 1095 (2008). At issue was section 9(a-5)   of   the   Illinois   Public   Labor   Relations   Act,   which provides that as an alternative to an election, the Illinois Labor Relations Board may certify a union based on evidence showing   that   a   majority   of   the   employees   wish   to   be represented   by   the   union   for   the   purposes   of   collective bargaining.  11.41   Section 9(a-5) provides in part as follows (emphasis added): If the parties to a dispute are without agreement on the means to ascertain the choice, if any, of employee organization as their representative, the Board shall ascertain the employees’ choice of employee organization, on the basis of dues deduction authorization   and   other evidence, or, if necessary, by conducting an election.  11.42   An employer objected to certification of a union. Among other things, it argued that section 9(a-5) required the union to submit both evidence of authorization to deduct dues and some other evidence of majority support. The Illinois Labor Relations   Board   rejected   this   argument,   but   the   appellate court vacated the Board’s decision and remanded the matter to the Board for further proceedings.  11.43   On   appeal,   the   Illinois   Supreme   Court   reversed,   holding “that the word ‘and,’ as used in the phrase ‘dues deduction authorization   and   other   evidence,’   was   intended   by   the legislature to mean ‘or.’” In other words, the union wasn’t required to submit evidence in addition to a dues checkoff card.  11.44   This protracted and unedifying litigation could have been avoided if the drafters had simply inserted the word   any   after  and . That would have made it clear that the union wasn’t required to submit additional evidence but instead had the option to do so.",
  "11.45   Although this case involved the language of a statute, it applies equally to contracts. So, drafters, remember the utility of   and any .  OR  11.46   Or   indicates   that   the   members   of   a   set   are   alternatives. Whereas   We’ll invite Kim, Pat, and Alex   (see 11.22) entails inviting all of them,   We’ll invite Kim, Pat, or Alex   entails only that we’ll invite (at least) one of them. See   CGEL , at   1293–98.  11.47   The literature on drafting says that   or   can be “inclusive,” with   A or B   conveying   A or B or both , or “exclusive,” with   A or B   conveying   A or B, but not both.   See F. Reed Dickerson,   The Fundamentals of Legal Drafting   104 (2d ed. 1986);   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at   639. But the literature on drafting hasn’t explored this subject in any depth.  Background  11.48   By contrast with the ambiguity caused by plural nouns and the ambiguity caused by   and , the ambiguity engendered by nouns or adjectives linked by   or   is not simply a function of context.   One   must   also   address   a   broader   issue—the distinction between the exclusive   or   and the inclusive   or.  11.49   According to   CGEL ,   or   is most characteristically used when the   speaker   believes   that   only   one   of   the   component propositions joined by   or   is true, and as a result   or   typically conveys the implicature that not all of the propositions are true .   An   implicature   is   a   proposition   that   is   implicitly conveyed rather than being explicitly said. It is not strictly part of the meaning of the sentence itself: as   CGEL   says, “ or  doesn’t mean that only one of the alternatives is true.”  11.50   CGEL   explains the “not and” implicature of   or as follows:  In general we don’t use the weaker of two terms if we could use the stronger—e.g. we don’t generally say   ‘P or Q’ if we know ‘P and Q’ to be true. If I know they appointed",
  "Kim and Pat to oversee the election ,   it will normally be inappropriate to say   They appointed Kim or Pat to oversee the election ,   for this is likely to suggest that they appointed just one but that I don’t know which of the two it was. Similarly, if I intend to invite Kim and Pat to dinner, it is normally misleading to say   I’ll invite Kim or Pat to dinner.   The most likely reason for saying   ‘P or Q’  rather than   ‘P and Q’,   therefore, is that the latter would be false, which leads to the “not and” implicature. But that isn’t the only reason for saying   ‘P or Q’ : it may be that I know that one or other of ‘P’ and ‘Q’ is true, but don’t know whether both are ... .  11.51   As an example of use of   or   when the speaker doesn’t know whether both propositions are true,   CGEL   offers   Either the mailman hasn’t arrived yet or there’s no mail for us , saying that this example “certainly does not rule out the case where the mailman is still on his way but has no mail for us.”  11.52   And   CGEL   uses the example   They are obtainable at Coles or at Woolworths   to suggest that even a speaker who knows that both propositions are true might nevertheless use   or.   The reason for using   or   here even though the speaker could have said   and   is that it reflects that you have a choice as to which store you obtain them from.  11.53   CGEL   points   out   that   alternatives   joined   by   or   are often mutually exclusive, as in   He was born on Christmas Day 1950 or 1951.   In such contexts, our knowledge of the world allows us to rule out the possibility that both propositions are true.  11.54   Regarding confusion as to whether a given   or   is inclusive or exclusive,   CGEL   says   that   “the   implicature   can   be   made explicit in a   but -coordinate:   He’ll invite Kim or Pat, but not both ” and that “it can be cancelled in similar ways:   He’ll invite Kim or Pat, perhaps both. ”  11.55   And   CGEL   says that   either   tends to strengthen the “not and” implicature:",
  "I’ll be seeing her on either Friday or Saturday   conveys somewhat more strongly than the version without   either  that I’ll be seeing her on just one of those days. Exclusiveness nevertheless is still only an implicature:  They are obtainable at either Coles or Woolworths  emphasizes the choice but, like the version without  either ,   could readily be used in a context where they are obtainable at both stores.  11.56   CGEL   notes that “When a sub clausal   or -coordination falls within the scope of a negative, it is equivalent to an   and - coordination of negative clauses”— I didn’t like his mother or his father   means   I didn’t like his mother and I didn’t like his father.   (In negation, the distinction between the inclusive and   exclusive   or   doesn’t   apply.)   That’s   also   the   meaning derived from application of one of the pair of logic rules known as De Morgan’s laws, the relevant rule being in effect  Not (A or B) = (Not A) and (Not B) . But   CGEL   goes on to note that   “wide   scope   readings   are   possible   as   less   likely interpretations.”   A   less   likely   reading   of   the   preceding example is   I didn’t like his mother or his father, I liked them both . Using a   neither ... nor   structure— I liked neither his mother nor   his   father —would   preclude   the   possibility   of   such   an alternative meaning. Another less-likely reading is   I didn’t like his mother or his father, I can’t remember which .  As Applied to Contracts  11.57   In a contract, it might be that a given   or   could only be exclusive. One example is the   or   in   Parent shall incorporate Sub in Delaware or New York —a company cannot be incorporated in more than one state simultaneously.  11.58   But   regarding   how   the   inclusive   and   exclusive   or   is manifested in contracts, consider [28], which is language of obligation. Maybe the drafter intended the   or   to be exclusive and didn’t think of making the implicature explicit, as in [28a].   Alternatively,   the   drafter   may   have   focused   on",
  "expressing   that   Acme   has   a   choice   and   didn’t   think   of canceling the implicature, as in [28b]. (Regarding alternative ways of expressing   or both , see 11.87.) Which is more likely would   depend   on   the   context.   The   same   alternatives   are present in other categories of contract language, except for language of prohibition; [29] is language of discretion.  [28]   Acme shall dissolve Subsidiary A or Subsidiary B. [28a]   Acme shall dissolve Subsidiary A or Subsidiary B but not both.  [28b]   Acme shall dissolve Subsidiary A or Subsidiary B or both.  [29]   Acme may dissolve Subsidiary A or Subsidiary B. [29a]   Acme may dissolve Subsidiary A or Subsidiary B but not both.  [29b]   Acme may dissolve Subsidiary A or Subsidiary B or both.  11.59   A drafter should seek to avoid having a court decide what a provision means. If you’re looking for a particular   or   to be exclusive and an inclusive meaning is possible, you shouldn’t rely on the “not and” implicature, whether or not bolstered by   either , to ensure that the provision in question has the intended   meaning.   A   court   might   be   influenced   by   the presence of   either   to hold that a given   or   is exclusive. See, e.g.,  Mintz v. Pazer , No. 32842(U), 2014 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 4827 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 7 Nov. 2014). But winning a fight is a distant second-best to avoiding the fight.  11.60   And if you’re looking for a particular   or   to be inclusive, you shouldn’t   assume   that   the   context   will   be   sufficient   to override   the   “not   and”   implicature.   Consider   the   case   of  SouthTrust Bank v. Copeland One ,   L.L.C. , 886 So. 2d 38 (Ala. 2003). Defendant SouthTrust operated an automated teller machine (ATM) at an Alabama mall. It did so under a lease with   the   landlord   that   provided   as   follows:   “Tenant [SouthTrust] shall have the exclusive right during the term of this lease and any renewals to operate an ATM or any other type   of   banking   facility   on   the   Property.”   This   caused litigation over whether the   or   in this provision was exclusive or   inclusive.   After   deciding   that   the   provision   was",
  "ambiguous,   the   court   construed   it   against   the   drafter, SouthTrust, holding that the   or   was exclusive.  11.61   So express explicitly the meaning intended: instead of [28] use either [28a] or [28b], and instead of [29] use either [29a] or [29b].  11.62   As explained in 11.56, the inclusive and exclusive   or   plays no role   in   language   of   prohibition.   But   there’s   uncertainty nevertheless: According to   CGEL ’s analysis, the more likely meaning of [30] is [30a]. Using   neither ... nor , as in [30b], conveys that meaning more economically. Another possible meaning is that the prohibition applies to only one or the other of Subsidiary A and Subsidiary B. That’s articulated more clearly in [30c]. A third possible meaning is [30d]. It’s unlikely that anyone would derive the meaning of [30d] from [30] without the benefit of the language of discretion in [30d], but it’s conceivable that a disgruntled contract party might attempt such a leap. A fourth possible meaning is [30e], which is analogous to the example in 11.56,   I didn’t like his mother or his father, I liked them both . But no reader could derive the meaning of [30e] from [30] without stress on the   or  in [30] and the benefit of the second clause in [30e].  [30]   Acme shall not dissolve Subsidiary A or Subsidiary B. [30a]   Acme shall not dissolve Subsidiary A and shall not dissolve Subsidiary B.  [30b]   Acme shall dissolve neither Subsidiary A nor Subsidiary B.  [30c]   Acme shall not dissolve both Subsidiary A and Subsidiary B but may dissolve just one or the other of them.  [30d]   Acme shall not dissolve just one or the other of Subsidiary A and Subsidiary B, but it may dissolve both.  [30e]   Acme shall not dissolve just one or the other of Subsidiary A and Subsidiary B but shall instead dissolve both.  11.63   Alternative meanings analogous to the possible meanings of [30] can be found in negation used in other contexts, for example in language of declaration ( Acme has not dissolved Subsidiary A or Subsidiary B ) and condition clauses ( If Acme has not dissolved Subsidiary A or Subsidiary B ).",
  "11.64   As with use of   or   with other categories of contract language, be explicit which meaning is intended when using   or   in negation. For example, in one case the language at issue was equivalent to   You may not eat ice cream on Saturday or Sunday . Although the more likely meaning is that you’re not allowed to   eat   ice   cream   on   both   days,   the   court   held   that   the prohibition applied only to one of the two days. See   Alloy Bellows & Precision Welding, Inc. v. Jason Cole , No. 1:15CV494, 2016 WL 1618108, at *1 (N.D. Ohio 22 Apr. 2016). And it would be reckless for anyone to draft on the assumption that a court would invoke De Morgan’s laws (see 11.56).  When One of a Series Linked by   Or   Is Modified by a Conditional Clause  11.65   In   addition   to   uncertainty   over   whether   a   given   or   is exclusive or inclusive, ambiguity can also arise when one of a series of items linked by   or   is modified by a conditional clause.  11.66   Consider this example featuring two items linked by   or :  [31]   Charles will have dinner with Fred or, if she’s in town, Nancy. [31a]   Charles will have dinner with Fred or Nancy; if Nancy isn’t in town, he’ll have dinner with Fred.  [31b]   Charles will have dinner with Nancy if she’s in town; if she isn’t, he’ll have dinner with Fred.  [32]   Charles will have dinner with Nancy, if she’s in town, or with Fred.  11.67   In [31], the second item (Nancy) is modified by a conditional clause. Examples [31a] and [31b] are the possible alternative meanings of [31], with [31a] perhaps being the more natural reading.   Examples   [31a]   and   [31b]   are   also   the   possible alternative meanings of [32], with [31b] perhaps being the more natural reading. The difference between [31] and [32] is that in [32], the conditional clause is associated with the first item.",
  "11.68   The difference between [31a] and [31b] is that the more limited meaning of [31b] isn’t derived from a strict reading of [31]; instead, the reader understands that it’s implied. That reading is encouraged by the fact that Nancy’s presence in town is referred to at all. If the choice were between Fred and Nancy, regardless of whether Nancy were in town, then it wouldn’t be necessary to refer to Nancy’s presence in town: if she were out of town, it would follow that Charles wouldn’t be having dinner with her.  11.69   The analysis changes when more than two items are linked by   or , as in these examples:  [33]   Charles will have dinner with Inga, Fred, or, if she’s in town, Nancy. [33a]   If Nancy is in town, Charles will have dinner with Inga, Fred, or Nancy; if Nancy is out of town, Charles will have dinner with Inga or Fred.  [33b]*   If Nancy is in town, Charles will have dinner with Nancy; if Nancy is out of town, Charles will have dinner with Inga or Fred.  [34]   Charles will have dinner with Inga or Fred or, if she’s in town, Nancy. [34a]   If Nancy is in town, Charles will have dinner with Inga, Fred, or Nancy; if Nancy is out of town, Charles will have dinner with Inga or Fred.  [34b]   If Nancy is in town, Charles will have dinner with Nancy; if Nancy is out of town, Charles will have dinner with Inga or Fred.  11.70   Example [33a] conveys the same meaning as [33], perhaps more   clearly.   But   most   readers   of   [33]   likely   wouldn’t conclude that it conveys the meaning of [33b], which is analogous to [31b] (hence the asterisk next to [33b]). That’s because   if   dinner   with   Nancy   were   to   take   priority,   you would expect the three names to be presented not in a group of three, as in [33], but in two groups, with Nancy by herself and Inga and Fred in a second group separated from Nancy by one   or , with a second   or   between Inga and Fred, as in [34]. So [33] isn’t subject to the same ambiguity as [31] and [32].  11.71   One of the two alternative meanings of [34] is [34b], which is the same as [33b]. If you wish to convey the meaning of",
  "[34b], you’d be advised to use the wording of [34b] rather than [34], to avoid also conveying the meaning of [34a].  11.72   Statute language analogous to [31] was at issue in   Brooks Capital   Services,   LLC   v.   5151   Trabue   Ltd. ,   No.   10CVE-07- 10386,   2012   Ohio   App.   LEXIS   3901   (27   Sept.   2012).   A member of 5151 Trabue Ltd., a limited liability company (LLC)   whose   management   had   not   been   reserved   to   its members,   fraudulently   signed   a   promissory   note   and mortgage on behalf of the LLC. The question was whether those   documents   were   valid   under   Ohio   Rev.   Code   Ann. section 1705.35, which provides as follows: Instruments and documents providing for the acquisition, mortgage, or disposition of property of a limited liability company are valid and binding upon the company if the instruments or documents are executed by one or more members of the company or, if the management of the company has not been reserved to its members, by one or more of its managers.  11.73   The lender argued that under the statute, loan documents signed by one member bound the LLC; the LLC argued that they did not. The trial court granted summary judgment to the   LLC;   the   Court   of   Appeals   affirmed.   In   reaching   its conclusion, the Court of Appeals said that “R.C. 1705.35 is ambiguous and susceptible of different interpretations.” The dissent disagreed.  11.74   The Court of Appeals in effect held that the language at issue conveyed a meaning analogous to [33b]; the dissent was in effect of the view that it conveyed a meaning analogous to [33a]. In its analysis, the Court of Appeals distinguished the language at issue from Ohio Rev. Code Ann. section 1705.44, which features three items linked by   or . The Court of Appeals in   effect   held   that   section   1705.44   conveyed   a   meaning analogous to [33a].  11.75   Brooks Capital Services   involved   statute   language,   but   this kind of ambiguity is just as likely to occur in a contract. To",
  "avoid it, use unambiguous language—language analogous to the examples above in italics.  Plural Nouns  11.76   When   nouns   linked   by   or   constitute   the   subject   of   a sentence, the number of potential meanings increases when the direct object is plural, as in [35], whatever the category of contract language. The added uncertainty relates to whether the items constituting the direct object are to be treated individually or as a group.  [35]   Able or Baker shall submit invoices to Charlie. [35a]   Able or Baker shall submit invoices to Charlie, with all invoices being submitted by Able and none by Baker, or vice versa.  [35b]   Able or Baker shall submit invoices to Charlie, with any invoice being submitted by Able or Baker individually and not by Able and Baker jointly.  [35c]   Able or Baker shall submit invoices to Charlie, with any invoice being submitted by Able or Baker individually or by Able and Baker jointly.  11.77   The same issue arises when the direct object is plural and is accompanied by nouns separated by   or   that are functioning as objects of a preposition (in the case of [36], the indirect objects   Echo   and   Foxtrot ).  [36]   Delta shall issue promissory notes to Echo or Foxtrot. [36a]   Delta shall issue promissory notes to Echo or Foxtrot, with Echo being issued all the promissory notes and Foxtrot none of them, or vice versa.  [36b]   Delta shall issue promissory notes to Echo or Foxtrot, with any promissory note being issued to Echo or Foxtrot individually and not to Echo and Foxtrot jointly.  [36c]   Delta shall issue promissory notes to Echo or Foxtrot, with any promissory note being issued to Echo or Foxtrot individually or to Echo and Foxtrot jointly.  11.78   And ambiguity arises when the nouns linked by   or   are plural. For example, in [37], which uses language of obligation, it’s uncertain whether each group of fruit should be considered",
  "collectively.   This   ambiguity   also   arises   in   language   of discretion.  [37]   Acme shall sell apples or oranges. [37a]   Acme shall sell apples and not oranges or shall sell oranges and not apples, without alternating from selling one to selling the other.  [37b]   Acme shall sell apples and not oranges or shall sell oranges and not apples, but it may as often as it wants alternate from selling one to selling the other.  [37c]   Acme shall sell apples or oranges and may sell both concurrently.  The Effect of Adjectives  11.79   As with   and , another form of ambiguity associated with   or   is that which derives from (1) adjectives that modify a noun and are linked by   or   ( temporary or part-time employees ) and (2) nouns modified by adjectives and linked by   or   ( temporary employees or part-time employees ).  CUMULATION   OF   ATTRIBUTES  11.80   But first, determining the meaning conveyed by adjectives in an   or -coordination   requires   considering   what   this   manual calls “cumulation of attributes.” For example, [38] raises the question whether termination of an Acme employee who is both a temporary employee   and   a part-time employee would mean that Tango has complied with the obligation expressed in [38]. If [38] is understood as conveying the meaning of [38a],   that   would   mean   Tango   has   complied;   if   it’s understood as conveying the meaning of [38b], that would mean Tango hasn’t complied.  [38]   Tango shall terminate the employment of one Acme temporary or part- time employee. [38a]   Tango shall terminate the employment of one Acme employee who is temporary or part-time or both.  [38b]   Tango shall terminate the employment of one Acme employee who is temporary or part-time but not both.",
  "11.81   Stated more generally, the question raised by [38] is whether an   or -coordination featuring attributes that aren’t mutually exclusive applies to anything that combines those attributes. Cumulation of attributes arises in connection with not only adjectives but also adjectival phrases; see for example the sample   language   in   13.542.   But   it   doesn’t   arise   with   or - coordination   featuring   mutually   exclusive   attributes,   for example   full-time or part-time employee —an employee cannot be both full-time and part-time simultaneously.  11.82   If a provision applies to anything exhibiting one of two or more   attributes   in   an   or -coordination,   economy   of hypothesis would suggest that it also applies to anything exhibiting   any   combination   of   those   attributes.   That presumption might be strong enough that it wouldn’t be reasonable to describe the alternative meanings of [38] as rising to the level of ambiguity—it’s hard to imagine why the parties would intend that terminating an Acme employee who   is   both   temporary   and   part-time,   as   opposed   to terminating an Acme employee who is one or the other, wouldn’t represent compliance with that obligation. So if you wish   to   preclude   cumulation   of   attributes,   it   would   be reckless   not   to   make   that   explicit   by   using   language analogous to [38b].  11.83   Making it explicit that you can cumulate attributes would preclude a disgruntled contract party from arguing otherwise. Whether   making   that   explicit   is   worthwhile   involves balancing the added certainty against the cost, namely the extra effort involved in having the drafter articulate that you can cumulate attributes and having the reader digest it (see 11.145).  PLURAL   NOUNS  11.84   Examples   [39]   and   [36]   demonstrate   the   ambiguity   in   a provision using a plural noun modified by adjectives joined by   or.   Just   as   [26]   exhibits   a   greater   number   of   possible meanings than does [25], use of language of discretion results",
  "in [40] exhibiting a greater number of possible meanings than does [39]. The variants of [39] and [40] don’t reflect the alternative meanings relating to cumulation of attributes— each variant would give rise to two cumulation-of-attributes alternative meanings.  [39]   Tango shall terminate the employment of Acme’s temporary or part- time employees. [39a]   Tango shall terminate the employment of those Acme employees who are temporary or those Acme employees who are part-time.  [39b]   Tango shall terminate the employment of all those Acme employees who are temporary and all those Acme employees who are part-time.  [40]   Tango may terminate the employment of Acme’s temporary or part- time employees. [40a]   Tango may terminate the employment of no fewer than all Acme employees who are temporary or no fewer than all Acme employees who are part-time.  [40b]   Tango may terminate the employment of one or more of those Acme employees who are temporary or one or more of those Acme employees who are part-time.  [40c]   Tango may terminate the employment of no fewer than all those Acme employees who are temporary and no fewer than all those Acme employees who are part-time, but Tango shall not terminate the employment of all the employees in one group without also terminating the employment of all the employees in the other group.  [40d]   Tango may terminate the employment of one or more of those Acme employees who are temporary and may terminate the employment of one or more of those Acme employees who are part-time.  11.85   An alternative to having a plural noun modified by two or more   adjectives   would   be   to   repeat   the   noun   for   each adjective,   as   in   temporary   employees   or   part-time   employees . Using   that   or -coordination   in   [39]   would   eliminate   the ambiguity, because the meaning conveyed by [39b] wouldn’t be possible, leaving as the only possible meaning that of [39a] .   Using   that   or -coordination   in   [40]   would   have   the same   effect,   leaving   only   the   two   alternative   meanings arising from use of language of discretion with plural nouns.",
  "AND/OR  11.86   Since   the   mid-20th   century,   judges   and   legal-writing commentators have railed against use of   and/or   to convey the meaning of the inclusive   or   (see 11.47).   But given all that ails traditional contract language, it seems that   and/or   has gotten more   than   its   fair   share   of   spittle-flecked   invective.   And  and/or   does have a specific meaning— X and/or Y   means   X or Y   or   both .   One   could   conceivably   use   Acme   may   dissolve Subsidiary A and/or Subsidiary B   as an alternative to [13b].  11.87   But   X or Y or both   is clearer than   X and/or Y.   (Depending on how   X   and   Y   are worded, it may be preferable to use the structure   one or both of X and Y , or even   one or both of the following: X; and Y .) Because   and/or   is less clear, that makes it more likely that a disgruntled contract party will attempt to use it as a stick in a dispute, even in a way that makes no sense. See, e.g.,   Redmond v. Sirius International Insurance Corp. , No. 12-CV-587, 2014 WL 1366185, at *1 (E.D. Wis. 7 Apr. 2014).  11.88   And here are three additional sources of   and/or   confusion: First, drafters sometimes use   and/or   when the only possible meaning is that conveyed by   or :   Acme shall incorporate the Subsidiary in Delaware and/or New York.  11.89   Second, it’s confusing to use   and/or   in language of obligation or   language   of   prohibition,   with   the   obligation   or prohibition in effect being stated two different ways. Instead of   Acme shall purchase Widget A and/or Widget B , say   Acme shall purchase Widget A or Widget B and may purchase both .  11.90   And third, if   and/or   is used to link more than two items, it would be unclear whether the   or   is inclusive or exclusive (see 11.58). In other words,   A, B, and/or C   could mean either   one or all of A, B, and C   or   one or more of A, B, and C . One suspects that usually the latter meaning is intended.  11.91   So given these issues, don’t use   and/or.   If you find that using  and/or   in a provision offers significant economy, that’s a sign",
  "you should restructure the provision.  AND   ...   OR  11.92   When   in   any   string   of   three   nouns   (as   in   [41]),   verbs, adjectives,   adverbs,   or   clauses   the   first   and   second   are separated by   and   and the second and third are separated by  or , or vice versa, the meaning varies depending on which conjunction “has scope over” the other. See   CGEL , at   1279– 80. In [41], either   or   has scope over   and   (with the choice being between Able and Baker on the one hand and Charlie on the other) or   and   has scope over   or   (with the choice being between Baker and Charlie).  [41]   Acme shall hire Able and Baker or Charlie. [41a]   Acme shall hire (1) Able and Baker or (2) Charlie.  [41b]   Acme shall hire either Able and Baker or Charlie.  [41c]   Acme shall hire Able and Baker, on the one hand, or Charlie, on the other hand.  [41d]   Acme shall hire (1) Able and (2) Baker or Charlie.  [41e]   Acme shall hire Able and either Baker or Charlie.  [41f]   Acme shall hire Able, on the one hand, and Baker or Charlie, on the other hand.  11.93   Enumeration, as in [41a] and [41d], is the simplest way to eliminate this ambiguity. Alternatively, you could use   either  to   mark   the   beginning   of   the   first   coordinate   in   an   or - coordination, with [41b] as a variant of [41a] and [41e] as a variant of [41d]. A third solution is to use   on the one hand ... on the other hand   (see 13.623), as in [41c] and [41f], and as in this example:  any other transaction involving Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Invest Bank or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand  11.94   For   an   example   of   legislation   featuring   this   kind   of ambiguity, see California Corporations Code § 313, which refers to the effect of a document “signed by the chairman of",
  "the   board,   the   president   or   any   vice   president   and   the secretary, any assistant secretary, the chief financial officer or any assistant treasurer” of a corporation (emphasis added).  11.95   The question is, does the “or” have scope over the “and,” or is it the other way around? If the “or” has scope over the “and,” the document must be signed by (1) the chairman, (2) the president, or (3) both (A) any vice president and (B) one of the secretary, any assistant secretary, the chief financial officer, or any assistant treasurer. If the “and” has scope   over   the   “or,”   the   presumption   of   authority   is established if the document is signed by (1) the chairman, the president, or any vice president and (2) the secretary, any assistant secretary, the chief financial officer, or any assistant treasurer. California courts have held that the latter meaning is the one intended (see   Snukal v. Flightways Manufacturing, Inc. , 23 Cal. 4th 754, 3 P.3d 286 (2000)), but it would be preferable to have the statute preclude alternative meanings.  11.96   In   BL Partners Group, L.P. v. Interbroad, LLC , No. 465 EDA 2016, 2017 WL 2591473 (Pa. Super. Ct. 15 June 2017), the language at issue was “In the event that Lessor’s building is damaged by fire or other casualty   and   Lessor elects not to restore   such   building,   or   Lessor   elects   to   demolish   the building, Lessor may terminate the Lease ... .” (Emphasis added.) May the lessor terminate if it elects to demolish the building regardless of the condition of the building, or must the building have been damaged by fire or other casualty? Here’s a simplified version of the language at issue:   If A and B, or C, then D . Confusion would have been avoided if it had been expressed as   If A and B, or if C, then D   (if the first meaning had been intended) or as   If A and either B or C, then D   (if the second meaning had been intended).  USING   AND   INSTEAD OF   OR , AND VICE VERSA  11.97   Problems with   and   and   or   aren’t limited to a given   and   or   or  conveying   alternative   possible   meanings,   or   someone",
  "thinking it does. In addition, drafters sometimes use   and  when it would make sense to use   or   instead. Or they do the converse.  11.98   Just such a problem arose in 2014 in connection with a series of   transactions   that   freed   the   gambling   company   Caesars Entertainment from having to guarantee a portion of the debt of its subsidiary Caesars Entertainment Operating Co., thereby causing bondholders substantial losses.  11.99   The language at issue—in an indenture—said “the Parent Guarantee shall terminate ... upon” the operating company’s (1) no longer being a wholly owned subsidiary, (2) merging into another company,   and   (3) paying off or defeasing all its debts.   Upon   occurrence   of   the   first   of   the   three   events, Caesars Entertainment declared that the guarantee had been terminated. In litigation, the bondholders claimed that all three conditions had to be satisfied. But it would make no sense to require that all three conditions be satisfied. So this use of   and   would seem to be a mistake.  11.100   Using just   or   works when occurrence of only one of the specified alternatives is feasible or desirable. But if you want to avoid having someone argue that occurrence of more than one of the specified alternatives precludes operation of the provision in question, then put the phrase   one or more of the following   before the specified alternatives and put   and   after the next-to-last alternative.  EVERY ,   EACH ,   ALL , AND   ANY  11.101   Every   is used to refer to all the individual members of a set without   exception.   All   is   used   to   refer   to   the   totality   of members. And   each   means every one of two or more people or things, regarded and identified separately. The meaning of these words overlaps.  11.102   In certain contexts, one can use without risk of ambiguity  every   and   each   (see [42]) and also   all   (see [42a]). But if you use",
  "language of discretion,   every   and   each   become ambiguous, as in [43], and so does   all , as in [43a]. (If the noun is a mass noun, for example flour, instead of a count noun (vehicle), the   ambiguity   afflicts   equivalents   to   all ,   for   example   the entire .)  [42]   Acme shall purchase [every] [each] vehicle included in the Roe Assets. [42a]   Acme shall purchase all vehicles included in the Roe Assets. [43]   Acme may purchase [every] [each] vehicle included in the Roe Assets. [43a]   Acme may purchase all vehicles included in the Roe Assets. [43b]   Acme may purchase no fewer than all vehicles included in the Roe Assets.  [43c]   Acme may purchase one or more of the vehicles included in the Roe Assets.  11.103   Any   exhibits similar ambiguity, except that it manifests itself in language of obligation (see [44]). Analogous to using   any  in [44] to convey the meaning of [44a] is how   any   is used in the sentence   Take the name of any person who comes through the door : the speaker presumably had in mind that   any   means “every,” with the added implication that no one might come through the door. And analogous to use of   any   in [44] to convey the meaning of [44b] is how it’s used in   Pick any card  —the reasonable interpretation is that one is being invited to pick a single card. By contrast, with language of discretion (see [45]) the question is whether the drafter intended   any   to mean “one,” as in [45a], or “one or more,” as in [45b].  [44]   Acme shall purchase any vehicle included in the Roe Assets. [44a]   Acme shall purchase no fewer than all vehicles included in the Roe Assets.  [44b]   Acme shall purchase one of the vehicles included in the Roe Assets.  [45]   Acme may purchase any vehicle included in the Roe Assets. [45a]   Acme may purchase only one of the vehicles included in the Roe Assets.  [45b]   Acme may purchase one or more of the vehicles included in the Roe Assets.",
  "11.104   Every ,   each ,   all,   and   any   are also ambiguous in a sentence expressing failure or inability. Examples [46] (regarding   every ,  each , and   any ) and [46a] (regarding   all ) are examples of such a sentence; both could have the meaning of either [46b] or [46c].  [46]   “Disability” means the Employee’s inability to perform [every] [each] [any] duty under this agreement. [46a]   “Disability” means the Employee’s inability to perform all duties under this agreement. [46b]   “Disability” means the Employee’s ability to perform no duties under this agreement.  [46c]   “Disability” means the Employee’s inability to perform one or more duties under this agreement.  11.105   A dispute involving   all   used in the context of failure or inability is featured in the opinion of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales in   Dooba Developments Ltd v. McLagan Investments Ltd   [2016] EWHC 2944 (Ch).  11.106   Dooba   Developments   Ltd   and   McLagan   Investments   Ltd (referred   to   as   “Asda”   in   the   proceedings)   entered   into   a contract for purchase of land that was to be the site of an Asda Superstore. The contract was subject to satisfaction of four conditions relating to planning permission and consent to undertake highway works in developing the site.  11.107   Asda rescinded the contract because Dooba had failed to satisfy   the   four   conditions   by   the   stipulated   date   (the “Longstop Date”). Dooba sought a declaration that Asda’s notice of rescission was invalid and that the agreement had become   unconditional.   Asda   then   applied   for   summary judgment, claiming (1) that there was no real prospect of Dooba   establishing   that   one   of   the   conditions—the   one relating to highway construction—had been satisfied by the Longstop Date and (2) that for rescission, it was sufficient that   one   or   more   conditions   remained   unsatisfied   at   the Longstop Date.",
  "11.108   Here’s the language at issue (emphasis added):  Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 3   if all of the Conditions have not been discharged   in accordance with this Schedule by the Longstop Date, then either Asda or Dooba may rescind this Agreement by giving to the other not less than ten working days written notice to that effect.  11.109   The initial hearings were before a master of the Chancery Division.   Asda   prevailed   on   both   points.   Dooba   appealed against the master’s decision on the second issue. Invoking “strict Boolean logic,” the deputy High Court judge accepted Dooba’s   argument   that   the   right   arose   only   if   all   four conditions had not been satisfied by the Longstop Date.  11.110   The judge’s analysis conflicts with the analysis in   CGEL , at 359, of   All of the meat wasn’t fresh : i a. [ Not all of the meat ]   was fresh.   ≡   b. [ Some of the meat ]   wasn’t fresh.  ii a. [ All of the meat ]   wasn’t fresh.   ≡   b. [ None of the meat ]   was fresh.  In [ia]   all   is within the scope of the negation (“It is not the case that all of the meat was fresh”), while in [ib]  some   has scope over the negative (“Some of the meat had the property that it wasn’t fresh”). In abstraction from prosody, the clause   All of the meat wasn’t fresh   is ambiguous with respect to scope. In one interpretation the negative has scope over the quantifier ([ All of the meat ]   wasn’t fresh ), making it simply an alternant of [ia]; this is the kind of interpretation we have in the proverb  All that glitters is not gold . In a second interpretation, the one indicated in the notation in [iia],   all   has scope over the negative (“All of the meat had the property of not being fresh”); this is equivalent to [iib]. Examples like   All of the meat wasn’t fresh   are relatively infrequent: it is much more common to use one or other of the unambiguous equivalents, [ia] or [iib].",
  "11.111   So this case serves as a reminder that you cannot expect courts to make sense of this kind of ambiguity unaided.  A CASE STUDY  11.112   The nuances of ambiguity of the part versus the whole are sufficiently intricate that one could sympathize with anyone who would rather ignore the topic. But because this kind of ambiguity   creates   confusion   in   practitioners,   clients,   and judges, drafters ignore it at their peril.  11.113   A noteworthy example of that is the opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in   Meyer v. CUNA Mutual Insurance Society , 648 F.3d 154 (3d Cir. 2011). Because its flawed analysis caused the court to find ambiguity in an insurance   policy—a   kind   of   contract—where   a   reasonable reader would have found none, the court decided the case incorrectly. This case offers general lessons in how to handle ambiguity of the part versus the whole.  Background  11.114   Plaintiff   Meyer,   a   railroad   employee,   purchased   a   credit disability   insurance   policy   from   defendant   CUNA   Mutual Group in connection with Meyer’s purchase of a car with financing   provided   by   a   credit   union.   Under   the   policy, CUNA would make car-loan payments on Meyer’s behalf if he were deemed disabled. After Meyer injured himself on the job, CUNA made his car payments for approximately three years, then notified Meyer that it would stop the payments: Meyer no longer met the definition of “Total Disability,” as stated   in   CUNA’s   policy,   because   Meyer’s   doctors   had determined that he could return to work in some capacity.  11.115   Here’s how “Total Disability” was defined in the policy:  during the first 12 consecutive months of disability means that a member is not able to perform substantially all of the duties of his occupation on the date his disability commenced because of",
  "a medically determined sickness or accidental bodily injury. After the first 12 consecutive months of disability, the definition changes and requires the member to be unable to perform any of the duties of his occupation or any occupation for which he is reasonably qualified by education, training or experience.  11.116   Meyer responded to CUNA’s stopping payments on the car by filing a class action with the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. He argued that the policy language was   unambiguous   and   meant   that   after   the   first   12 consecutive months, he qualified as totally disabled if he could show either that (1) he was unable to perform the duties of his occupation or (2) he was unable to perform the duties   of   any   occupation   for   which   he   was   reasonably qualified by education, training, or experience. By contrast, CUNA argued that for the post-12-month period, the “any occupation” standard applied.  11.117   The   district   court   granted   Meyer’s   motion   for   partial summary judgment, holding that the definition of the term “Total Disability” was ambiguous and so should be construed in   favor   of   Meyer.   CUNA   appealed;   the   Third   Circuit affirmed.  The Third Circuit’s Analysis  11.118   In   its   opinion,   the   Third   Circuit   noted   that   contract language is ambiguous when it’s reasonably susceptible of being understood in different ways; that ambiguous language in   an   insurance   policy   should   be   construed   against   the insurance company; and that words in an insurance policy “should be construed in their natural, plain and ordinary sense.”  11.119   After considering the dictionary definition of   or   and citing two cases, the court concluded that “The commonly used and   understood   definition   of   ‘or’   suggests   an   alternative between two or more choices.” In other words, the   or   was, to use   the   court’s   terminology,   disjunctive   rather   than",
  "conjunctive. The court found unpersuasive the caselaw cited by CUNA to support its interpretation. The court noted that its conclusion that Meyer’s interpretation was reasonable was bolstered by the fact that CUNA could have avoided any ambiguity by using the word   and   instead of   or   to convey that it   indeed   intended   a   conjunctive   meaning.   The   court summarized its position as follows: “Based on our analysis of a plain reading of the language and common, disjunctive meaning of the word ‘or,’ we find that Meyer’s interpretation is not unreasonable.”  11.120   The court declined to accept arguments to the effect that CUNA’s   interpretation   was   consistent   with   the   relevant Pennsylvania statute and industry practice. It also rejected, because the “substantially all” standard of the first half of the definition differed from the “any” standard of the second half, the argument that the meaning sought by Meyer would result in the same standard applying to both the first 12 months and the following period.  11.121   But   the   court   noted   a   “potential   contextual   defect”   that arises from attributing a disjunctive meaning to the   or   in question—it   renders   meaningless   the   second   part   of   the provision relating to the period after the first 12 months. That   caused   the   court   to   conclude   that   the   definition   is ambiguous   and   that   CUNA’s   interpretation   too   was reasonable. But the court held that due to Pennsylvania’s policy of construing against the insurer any ambiguities in an insurance policy, the meaning claimed by Meyer was the one that applied.  What Are the Possible Meanings?  11.122   So the Third Circuit accepted Meyer’s argument that the definition applied to him because he could not perform any of the duties of his occupation—all that was required for him to   fall   within   the   scope   of   the   definition   was   that   his inability apply to one of the alternatives presented.",
  "11.123   But the court’s reasoning is deficient in how it determined the possible alternative meanings and which should apply. The   approach   taken   by   the   Third   Circuit   is   broadly comparable to that taken by other courts, but that doesn’t make   it   any   less   mistaken.   In   relying   on   the   dictionary definition of   or   and caselaw that was essentially irrelevant, the Third Circuit failed to consider unavoidable nuances of the English language. A broader analysis is required, one that recognizes that the ambiguity associated with   or   is a complex issue of English usage rather than a narrow legal question.  11.124   As a first step in such an analysis, let’s consider the possible alternative   meanings.   Here’s   the   relevant   portion   of   the definition (emphasis added):  [a member is] unable to perform any of the duties of his occupation   or   any occupation for which he is reasonably qualified by education, training or experience.  11.125   But by analogy with [30a], a natural interpretation of the language at issue in   Meyer   is the following:  [a member is] unable to perform any of the duties of his occupation and [a member is] unable to perform any of the duties of any occupation for which he is reasonably qualified by education, training or experience.  11.126   That is the meaning advocated by CUNA. The only other possible   meaning   is   that   advanced   by   Meyer,   which   is analogous to [30c]. (Because negation is inherent   in unable  rather than achieved by using   not , a meaning analogous to [30d] isn’t possible.)  Is CUNA’s Meaning Reasonable?  11.127   That   the   language   at   issue   gives   rise   to   two   alternative meanings isn’t enough to make it ambiguous. For that to be the   case,   each   alternative   meaning   would   have   to   be reasonable.   Given   that   CGEL   acknowledges   the   reading",
  "giving rise to the meaning advanced by CUNA (see 11.56), any court should hold that that meaning is a reasonable one.  11.128   But the Third Circuit pointed to use of “any occupation” in the language at issue rather than “any other occupation” as an argument against CUNA’s interpretation.  11.129   Reading   the   phrase   conjunctively,   one   could   argue   that inclusion of continued coverage if a member cannot perform “any   of   the   duties   of   his   occupation”   is   redundant   or unnecessary if “duties of any occupation ... for which he is reasonably   qualified”   includes   the   member’s   own occupation.  11.130   The   court   was   correct—omitting   other   does   render superfluous the reference to “his occupation,” and drafters should   aim   to   avoid   redundancy.   But   omission   of   other  doesn’t   leap   out   at   the   reader—in   everyday   English   it’s commonplace to link with   or   a reference to a member of a class and a reference to the entire class, without carving out that member—for example,   I can’t eat ice cream or any dairy products . (In speech, you would stress the   any .)  11.131   And more importantly, that overlap is benign—the meaning conveyed by the whole is unaffected. So the court had no basis for hinting that omission of   other   brings into question whether the language at issue conveys CUNA’s meaning.  Is Meyer’s Meaning Reasonable?  11.132   By contrast, Meyer’s meaning is problematic—if you assume that the   or   is disjunctive, the remainder of the definition is rendered superfluous.  11.133   Understanding how this plays out requires first considering a second   potential   ambiguity   in   the   definition   of   “Total Disability”—the alternative meanings conveyed by the word  any , which can mean one of several items, or all of them (see 11.103).",
  "11.134   The word   any   occurs twice in the language at issue. The phrase “any of the duties of his occupation” could be taken to mean   one of   the member’s duties, but the context makes it clear that the intended meaning is   all   duties—the standard for the first 12 months refers to substantially all duties, and it’s clear that the intention was to make the standard for the following period more onerous.  11.135   The   second   instance   of   any   occurs   in   the   phrase   “any occupation for which he is reasonably qualified.” This could be taken to mean “one of the occupations for which he is reasonably qualified.” But that would suggest that inability to perform the duties of a single occupation—say, truck driver— would be enough to satisfy the second part of the standard relating to the post-12-month period. The member’s ability to   perform   any   number   of   other   occupations   would   be irrelevant. But it would be nonsensical to allow the member to   meet   the   requirements   for   total   disability   simply   by finding a single occupation that the member cannot perform the duties of. Instead, the phrase makes sense only if it’s understood   as   referring   to   all   occupations   for   which   the member is qualified.  11.136   With that in mind, if you accept that the language at issue conveys Meyer’s meaning, a member who cannot perform any of the duties of his former occupation wouldn’t have to worry   about   establishing   that   no   suitable   occupation remained available to him. The court said as much: If he cannot perform any of the duties of his occupation, construing ‘or’ disjunctively, he is qualified for coverage, and there is no need to move to the second part of the clause—whether he can perform the duties of any occupation for which he is qualified—to determine coverage.  11.137   And the court noted that the second part of the language at issue is similarly superfluous if the member can perform any of the duties of his former occupation:",
  "If, on the other hand, an insured can perform one or more tasks of his former occupation, he is not qualified for coverage and there is no need to look to the second part of the clause because he has already failed to qualify for coverage—his own occupation is a subset of any occupation for which he is qualified.  11.138   So accepting Meyer’s meaning requires that you disregard the second part of the language at issue. As a matter of contract   interpretation,   that’s   deeply   problematic, particularly when compared to the benign overlap in CUNA’s meaning caused by the absence of   other . If the meaning you seek to apply to a provision renders redundant half that provision, the only possible conclusion is that the meaning doesn’t make sense—that it’s unreasonable.  11.139   The court noted that “Courts should not distort the meaning of the language or strain to find an ambiguity,” but that’s what the Third Circuit did in nevertheless endorsing Meyer’s meaning. It blithely dismissed the problem as a “potential contextual defect,” offering in support of its disregard of the redundancy   only   one   case,   one   that   has   only   the   most remote bearing on the issue.  Mixing Analyses of Different Meanings  11.140   The court capped its flawed analysis by concluding that the redundancy inherent in accepting Meyer’s meaning “does lead us to find that the phrase is capable of being understood in more than one sense and that a conjunctive interpretation is also reasonable.” That doesn’t make sense. When weighing the   reasonableness   of   alternative   possible   meanings,   you consider them independently. The defects in one possible meaning go only to its reasonableness—they don’t bolster the   reasonableness   of   the   other   possible   meaning.   The conclusion that follows from the redundancy required by Meyer’s meaning is that Meyer’s meaning is unreasonable, not that CUNA’s meaning is somehow made more palatable.",
  "11.141   Similarly, it didn’t make sense for the court to conclude that reasonableness   of   Meyer’s   meaning   was   bolstered   by   the court’s mistaken view that CUNA could have avoided any ambiguity by using the word   and   instead of   or . Again, the ostensible   weakness   of   one   alternative   meaning   doesn’t bolster the reasonableness of another alternative meaning.  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  11.142   The Third Circuit’s analysis of the provision at issue in   Meyer  has lessons to offer drafters.  The Risks  11.143   Meyer   serves as a reminder that if you draft contracts, it would be reckless of you not to be alert to ambiguity of the part versus the whole. Unless you’re attuned to it, the odds are that you’ll be oblivious to alternative possible meanings unless they cause a dispute.  11.144   And   Meyer   is one of many cases in which judges have shown themselves   ill-equipped   to   analyze   issues   relating   to ambiguity of the part versus the whole. The judge in   Meyer  instead relied on a dictionary definition, something judges are increasingly doing. See Adam Liptak,   Justices Turning More Frequently to Dictionary, and Not Just for Big Words , N.Y. Times, 13 June 2011, at A11. That’s usually a poor substitute for the semantic   acuity   required   to   rigorously   parse   confusing contract language. So don’t expect judges to be equipped to sort out in a sensible manner any part-versus-the-whole mess you create.  Whether to Eliminate Alternative Meanings  11.145   The   court’s   opinion   in   Meyer   serves   as   a   reminder   that drafters should consider how far to go in seeking to avoid ambiguity of the part versus the whole.",
  "11.146   Alternative   meanings   caused   by   or   and   and   are   virtually inescapable in contract language. Consider two components of the definition of “Total Disability” that weren’t at issue in  Meyer .   The   definition   refers   to   “a   medically   determined sickness or accidental bodily injury.” Does disability due to sickness   and   injury   not   fall   within   the   definition?   And consider the reference to “any occupation for which he is reasonably qualified by education, training or experience.” Does that mean that if the member is qualified because of some combination of education, training, and experience, it would be irrelevant for purposes of the definition?  11.147   You   could   revise   contract   language   to   eliminate   the possibility of alternative meanings, but that would make it more wordy. If any alternative meanings aren’t reasonable, you   could   elect   to   leave   the   language   as   is,   because   the limited risk of ambiguity doesn’t warrant the extra verbiage. For example, it would be outlandish to revise the definition of   “Total   Disability”   to   rule   out   the   possible   meanings suggested in the immediately preceding paragraph.  11.148   But you cannot expect courts to be equipped to determine whether the alternative meanings of a given provision are reasonable and so cause ambiguity—after all, the court in  Meyer   wasn’t. If an alternative meaning appears unreasonable but could cause mischief if misconstrued by a court, the cautious drafter should consider redrafting that provision to eliminate the alternative meaning. The meaning attributed by Meyer to the language at issue in his dispute perhaps represents just such an alternative meaning.  11.149   Examples [47] and [48] involve the sort of judgment calls required when determining whether to eliminate possible alternative meanings. Each example expresses two possible meanings, but anyone inclined to recommend that a drafter restructure them to eliminate one of those meanings should consider two factors. First, of the two possible meanings of each example, one is clearly the more natural, namely [47a] and [48a]. Second, given the extra verbiage required to avoid",
  "ambiguity, prose stylists would likely steer clear of [47a] and [48a]. Whether to eliminate a possible meaning involves a balancing—whether   conscious   or   not—of   expediency   and risk,   and   in   a   particular   contract   expediency   might   well trump risk.  [47]   The Seller has complied with all laws applicable to the Business and the Acquired Assets. [47a]   The Seller has complied with all laws applicable to the Business and all laws applicable to the Acquired Assets.  [47b]   The Seller has complied with each law applicable to both the Business and the Acquired Assets.  [48]   The Seller has complied with all laws applicable to the Business or the Acquired Assets. [48a]   The Seller has complied with each law applicable to the Business or the Acquired Assets.  [48b]   The Seller has complied with all laws applicable to the Business or all laws applicable to the Acquired Assets.  11.150   Incidentally,   note   how   [47a]   and   [48a]   convey   the   same meaning. That happens when alternative meanings arise in a provision whether you use   and   or   or   and the most likely meaning using   and   is identical to the most likely meaning using   or . This adds an ironic twist to analysis of alternative meanings associated with   and   and   or.  Drafting to Avoid Alternative Meanings  11.151   Meyer   also offers a lesson to companies seeking to put their contract process on a more efficient footing. It’s ironic that the language at issue was compiled as part of an effort by CUNA to make its policies easier to read. Besides the three sets of alternative meanings included in, and omission of the word   other   from, the second sentence of the definition, the definition as a whole isn’t a model of clarity.  11.152   The following version eliminates the alternative meanings and restores the missing   other .",
  "due to sickness or accidental bodily injury, as determined by a physician, (1) the member is unable to perform substantially all the duties of the member’s occupation (applies only during the first 12 consecutive months of that disability) and (2) the member is able to perform none of the duties of the member’s occupation and each other occupation for which the member is reasonably qualified by education, training, or experience (applies thereafter).  11.153   It’s often the case that instead of requiring just targeted adjustments of the sort discussed in this chapter, eliminating alternative part-versus-the-whole meanings becomes part of broader redrafting.",
  "SYNTACTIC AMBIGUITY  12.1   Syntactic ambiguity arises principally out of the order in which words and phrases appear and how they relate to each other grammatically. (See 3.318 for an explanation of the conventions used in the numbered example sentences in this chapter.) It features regularly in litigation—more frequently than, say, the ambiguity of the part versus the whole (see chapter 11).  MODIFIERS  12.2   A modifier is a word or phrase that changes the meaning of a word or phrase to which it is grammatically related. Modifiers can lead to ambiguity in various ways.  Modifiers Preceding or Trailing Two or More Nouns  PRECEDING   MODIFIERS  12.3   It’s often unclear whether a modifier that precedes two or more nouns modifies all the nouns or only the first. For example, in [1]   children’s   could   modify   just   apparel ,   or   it could modify all three nouns. If the former is the intended meaning, using enumeration, as in [1a], would eliminate the ambiguity. So would using semicolons, as in [1b], although that’s more subtle than using enumeration.  [1]   Acme may sell in the Stores only children’s apparel, accessories, and footwear. [1a]   Acme may sell in the Stores only (1) children’s apparel, (2) accessories, and (3) footwear.",
  "[1b]   Acme may sell in the Stores only the following: children’s apparel; accessories; and footwear.  [1c]   Acme may sell in the Stores only accessories, footwear, and children’s apparel.  [1d]   Acme may sell in the Stores only children’s apparel, children’s accessories, and children’s footwear.  [1e]   Acme may sell in the Stores only the following items for children: apparel, accessories, and footwear.  12.4   Another way to avoid ambiguity when you intend that a preceding modifier modify only one of a series of nouns would be to put that noun last, as in [1c]. If instead the modifier modifies all the nouns, you could repeat it before each   noun,   as   in   [1d],   or   perhaps   you   could   be   more economical, as in [1e].  12.5   Regency Commercial Associates, LLC v. Lopax, Inc. ,   869 N.E.2d 310 (Ill. App. Ct. 4 May 2007), provides a good example of how a preceding modifier can create ambiguity leading to a dispute. Here’s the contract provision at issue: “any fast food ...   restaurant   or   restaurant   facility   whose   principal food product is chicken on the bone, boneless chicken or chicken   sandwiches.”   The   question   was   whether   the preceding modifier, “fast food,” modified just “restaurant” or modified both “restaurant” and “restaurant facility.”  12.6   In re Mobilactive Media, LLC , No. CIV.A. 5725-VCP, 2013 WL 297950, at *1 (Del. Ch. 25 Jan. 2013), offers another example. The language at issue was “interactive video programming and advertising content.” One party wanted it interpreted to mean   interactive video programming and interactive advertising content ;   the   other   sought   the   meaning   interactive   video programming and interactive video advertising content . (A third possible meaning is   advertising content and interactive video programming , but neither party sought that meaning.)  TRAILING   MODIFIERS",
  "12.7   Similarly, it’s often unclear whether a clause that follows two or more nouns (a “trailing” modifier) modifies all the nouns or   only   the   last   one.   In   [2],   it’s   not   clear   whether   the $500,000 limit applies to just capital expenditures or to debt and capital expenditures.  [2]   Acme shall not incur any debt or make any capital expenditure in excess of $500,000. [2a]   Acme shall not do any of the following: incur any debt; or make any capital expenditure in excess of $500,000.  [2b]   Acme shall not do any of the following: (1)   incur any debt; or (2)   make any capital expenditure in excess of $500,000.  [2c]   Acme shall not make any capital expenditure in excess of $500,000 or incur any debt.  [2d]   Acme shall not incur any debt in excess of $500,000 or make any capital expenditure in excess of $500,000.  12.8   Enumeration by itself cannot rectify the ambiguity caused by a trailing modifier, since the trailing modifier would not be isolated in one enumerated clause—nothing would preclude a reader from assuming that it modifies all the enumerated clauses, not just the final one.  12.9   If a trailing modifier modifies just the last noun, you can make that clear using semicolons, as in [2a], although as with [1b], that’s not as clear as it might be. If it modifies all nouns, you’d need to add tabulation too, as in [2b]. But tabulation mainly makes clauses that are relatively lengthy and complex easier to read by breaking them out (see 4.41). Tabulating short clauses might eliminate ambiguity, but it doesn’t make them easier to read and can be a waste of space. Furthermore, if the trailing modifier modifies each of the nouns, tabulation would result in the trailing modifier being positioned flush left   underneath   the   tabulated   clauses,   as   in   [2b].   Such “dangling” text is awkward (see 4.44).",
  "12.10   If you intend that a trailing modifier modify only one of a series of nouns, another way to avoid ambiguity would be to put that noun first, as in [2c]. If instead you intend that the modifier modify all the nouns, repeating the trailing modifier after each noun, as in [2d], would make that clear.  12.11   Anderson v. Hess Corp. , 649 F.3d 891 (8th Cir. 2011), involved a dispute caused by a trailing modifier. In the mineral leases at   issue,   the   phrase   “drilling   or   reworking   operations” occurred several times. In this context, is “drilling” a noun, or is it an adjective modifying “operations”? In other words, the question posed was, according to the court, “whether the term ‘engaged in drilling or reworking operations’ included ‘drilling operations’ and ‘reworking operations,’ or ‘drilling’ and   ‘reworking   operations’.”   This   was   a   significant distinction, because to engage in drilling you would have to actually drill into the ground, whereas “drilling operations” could include activities other than drilling.  12.12   This instance of syntactic ambiguity generated a couple of years’ worth of litigation. That could have been avoided had the   drafter   referred   to   “drilling   operations   or   reworking operations” or “reworking operations or drilling,” depending on which meaning was intended.  12.13   When faced with ambiguity caused by a trailing modifier, a court might apply the “rule of the last antecedent,” which is an arbitrary rule of interpretation that states that a qualifying phrase is to be applied to the word or phrase immediately preceding it and shouldn’t be interpreted as modifying others more remote. (See 3.443.) Don’t assume that a court would apply   the   rule   of   the   last   antecedent   to   interpret   an ambiguity in your favor. The rule of the last antecedent “has little weight or value.” Joseph Kimble,   The Doctrine of the Last Antecedent, the Example in   Barnhart , Why Both Are Weak, and How Textualism Postures , 16 Scribes J. Legal Writing 5 (2015). And even if a court were to rule in your favor, winning a fight   is   a   distant   second   to   avoiding   the   fight.   Instead, eliminate the ambiguity.",
  "PRECEDING   AND   TRAILING   MODIFIERS  12.14   When sets of nouns are modified by both preceding and trailing modifiers, four meanings are possible; [3] is a simple example of this. If the intention is that the trailing modifier  qualified to do business in New York   not modify the first noun phrase   Delaware corporations , the simplest way to make that clear would be to switch the order of the noun phrases, as has been done in [3a] and [3b]; if the opposite is intended, the simplest way to avoid ambiguity on that score would be to repeat   the   trailing   modifier,   as   in   [3c]   and   [3d].   These changes   also   eliminate   the   ambiguity   caused   by   the preceding   modifier   Delaware .   In   [3a]   and   [3c]   Delaware  modifies   LLCs   and   corporations ; that’s made clear by repeating the adjective   Delaware . In [3b] and [3d] it does not; that’s made clear by switching the order of the noun phrases.  [3]   Delaware corporations and LLCs qualified to do business in New York [3a]   Delaware LLCs qualified to do business in New York and Delaware corporations  [3b]   LLCs qualified to do business in New York and Delaware corporations  [3c]   Delaware corporations qualified to do business in New York and Delaware LLCs qualified to do business in New York  [3d]   LLCs qualified to do business in New York and Delaware corporations qualified to do business in New York  12.15   Ambiguity caused by a trailing modifier was one issue raised in   United Rentals, Inc. v. RAM Holdings, Inc. , 937 A.2d 810, 813 (Del. Ch. 2007), a case about a $6.6 billion transaction that failed to close. The contract at issue contained this:  ... and in no event shall the Company seek equitable relief or seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount from [the RAM entities and related entities].  12.16   The   plaintiff,   United   Rentals,   argued   that   the   trailing modifier “in excess of such amount” modified not only the phrase “seek to recover any money damages” but also went farther back up the sentence and modified the phrase “seek",
  "equitable   relief.”   The   defendants   argued   that   that interpretation was unreasonable. From a drafting perspective, what matters is not which meaning is the more likely but that meaning was disputed at all.  Modifiers Occurring between Two or More Nouns  12.17   When a modifier follows one noun in a string of nouns, as in [4],   it   can   be   unclear   whether   the   subsequent   nouns   are incorporated in the modifier or are grammatically equivalent to the noun that precedes the modifier. This ambiguity can be remedied in various ways. You could use enumeration, as in   [4a]   and   [4b].   Or   you   could   enclose   the   modifier   in parentheses, as in [4c] and [4d] (see 13.632). Or, if the intent is to have the modifier not incorporate any of the nouns that follow,   you   could   move   the   modifier   and   the   noun   it modifies   to   the   end   of   the   string   of   nouns,   as   in   [4e], although that’s less clear than the other alternatives, given the potential for confusion inherent in trailing modifiers (see 12.7). You could also use tabulation, but as explained in 12.9, that approach isn’t recommended.  [4]   Widgetco shall sell to Acme the Roe Assets, excluding the Smith Assets, the Jones Assets, and the Doe Assets. [4a]   Widgetco shall sell to Acme (1) the Roe Assets, excluding the Smith Assets, (2) the Jones Assets, and (3) the Doe Assets.  [4b]   Widgetco shall sell to Acme the Roe Assets, excluding (1) the Smith Assets, (2) the Jones Assets, and (3) the Doe Assets.  [4c]   Widgetco shall sell to Acme the Roe Assets (excluding the Smith Assets), the Jones Assets, and the Doe Assets.  [4d]   Widgetco shall sell to Acme the Roe Assets (excluding the Smith Assets, the Jones Assets, and the Doe Assets).  [4e]   Widgetco shall sell to Acme the Jones Assets, the Doe Assets, and the Roe Assets, excluding the Smith Assets.  Squinting Modifiers",
  "12.18   A   modifier   is   described   as   “squinting”   if   it’s   not   clear whether it modifies what comes before or what comes after. In [5],   within 10 days   could refer to the time by which Acme must reject any Asset or the time by which the Seller must reimburse   Acme.   Although   placing   a   comma   before   the modifier, as in [5a], or after the modifier, as in [5b], would signal which meaning was intended, it can be risky to rely only   on   a   comma   to   avoid   ambiguity   (see   12.74–.75). It would be clearer to resolve the ambiguity by moving the modifier; in [5c], the modifier occurs twice, in revised form, to convey both possible meanings.  [5]   If Acme rejects any Asset within 10 days the Seller shall reimburse Acme that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to that Asset. [5a]   If Acme rejects any Asset within 10 days, the Seller shall reimburse Acme that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to that Asset.  [5b]   If Acme rejects any Asset, within 10 days the Seller shall reimburse Acme that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to that Asset.  [5c]   If no later than 10 days after the Closing Acme rejects any Asset, the Seller shall no later than 10 days after receiving the notice of rejection reimburse Acme that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to that Asset.  12.19   Because they require particularly clumsy drafting, squinting modifiers are rare in contracts.  Modifiers of Uncertain Length  12.20   Ambiguity   can   also   arise   when   it’s   unclear   whether   a modifier incorporates a following relative clause. In [6], the modifier   could   be   either   not   constituting   a   Product   or   not constituting a Product that   ... . The simplest way to eliminate the   ambiguity   would   be   to   place   the   modifier   in   a conditional   clause,   as   in   [6a]   and   [6b].   (The   intended meaning is that in [6a].)  [6]   Acme may sell at any Store any item of apparel not constituting a Product that Widgetco has at any time during the previous 12 months sold at any of the stores that Widgetco operates.",
  "[6a]   Acme may sell at any Store any item of apparel, on condition that it does not constitute a Product that Widgetco has at any time during the previous 12 months sold at any of the stores that Widgetco operates.  [6b]   Acme may sell at any Store any item of apparel that Widgetco has at any time during the previous 12 months sold at any of the stores that Widgetco operates, on condition that the item does not constitute a Product.  Poorly Placed Modifiers  12.21   An objective reading of [7] would suggest that the modifier  no later than five Business Days after the closing of the related sale   relates to when Galactic must designate an account. The drafter had in fact intended that the modifier indicate the timing for delivery of the Proceeds; that would have been better accomplished by moving to the front of the sentence a slightly revised version of the modifier, as in [7a].  [7]   The Sellers shall deliver the Proceeds to Galactic by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Galactic no later than five Business Days after the closing of the related sale. [7a]   No later than five Business Days after the closing of a sale, the Sellers shall deliver the Proceeds of that sale to Galactic by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Galactic.  12.22   A similar problem afflicts [8]: an objective reading would suggest that the modifier   that is in Acme’s possession   modifies  a motor vehicle included in the Assets.   The intention had in fact been   that   it   would   modify   every   certificate   of   title.  Repositioning the modifier, as in [8a], would have made that clearer.  [8]   Acme has provided Widgetco with a copy of every certificate of title relating to a motor vehicle included in the Assets that is in Acme’s possession. [8a]   Acme has provided Widgetco with a copy of every certificate of title that is in Acme’s possession relating to a motor vehicle included in the Assets.  Opening and Closing Modifiers",
  "12.23   Analogous to the ambiguity caused by modifiers that precede or trail two or more nouns (see 12.3–.16) is the ambiguity that can result when a phrase begins or ends a sentence containing two or more other elements, as in [9] and [9a]: it can be unclear whether the phrase that begins or ends the sentence modifies one or both of the other elements.  12.24   If   in   [9]   and   [9a]   the   adverbial   phrase   other   than   in   the Ordinary Course of Business   modifies both of the verb clauses in the remainder of the sentence, and if both verb clauses have   the   same   subject,   the   simplest   course   would   be   to combine the verb clauses and place the adverbial phrase in front of the resulting clause, as in [9b]. (Placing the adverbial phrase at the end would not eliminate the ambiguity.) If the adverbial phrase relates to the first verb clause but not the second, place the adverbial phrase after the first verb clause and before the second, as in [9c]. If the adverbial phrase relates to the second verb clause but not the first, reverse the order of the verb clauses and place the adverbial phrase after what had been the second verb clause and is now the first, as in [9d].  [9]   Other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, Acme shall not incur debt and Acme shall not make any capital expenditures. [9a]   Acme shall not incur debt and Acme shall not make any capital expenditures, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business. [9b]   Other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, Acme shall not incur debt or make any capital expenditures.  [9c]   Acme shall not incur debt other than in the Ordinary Course of Business or make any capital expenditures.  [9d]   Acme shall not make any capital expenditures other than in the Ordinary Course of Business or incur any debt.  12.25   To resolve ambiguity caused by a closing modifier, a court might invoke the flimsy rule of interpretation known as the rule of the last antecedent (see 12.13). In this context, the shortcomings   of   the   rule   of   the   last   antecedent   are exacerbated   by   a   related   rule   of   interpretation,   what   this manual calls “the comma test under the rule of the last",
  "antecedent.” It holds that if in a sentence a series of nouns, noun phrases, or clauses is followed by a modifier and the modifier is preceded by a comma, the modifier applies to the entire series, not just the final element in the series. This principle   conflicts   with   English   usage,   so   it   should   be abandoned. See Kenneth A. Adams,   Bamboozled by a Comma: The   Second   Circuit’s   Misdiagnosis   of   Ambiguity   in   American International   Group,   Inc.   v.   Bank   of   America   Corp.,   16 Scribes J. Legal Writing 45 (2014–15). It would be beyond reckless to rely on the rule of the last antecedent, including the comma test, as an alternative to drafting clearly. Instead, fix the ambiguity.  12.26   The   comma   test   was   apparently   invoked   in   a   dispute between two Canadian companies. In 2002, the cable unit of Rogers   Communications   Inc.,   a   telecommunications company, entered into a contract with Aliant Inc. in which Aliant agreed to string Rogers cable lines across utility poles for an annual fee per pole. In 2005, Aliant informed Rogers that it wished to terminate the contract and increase its rates. Rogers objected, on the grounds that the contract couldn’t be terminated   until   after   the   first   five-year   term.   Aliant disagreed, claiming that the agreement could be terminated at any time on one year’s notice.  12.27   The   contract   between   the   parties   had   been   drafted   by Canadian regulators. Here’s the language at issue:  Subject to the termination provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be effective from the date it is made and shall continue in force for a period of five (5) years from the date it is made, and thereafter for successive five (5) year terms, unless and until terminated by one year prior notice in writing by either party.  12.28   The dispute concerned whether the closing modifier—the phrase “unless and until terminated by one year prior notice in writing by either party”—modified both preceding clauses or just the immediately preceding clause.",
  "12.29   The dispute reached the Canadian Radio-television and Tele- communications Commission. Echoing an argument offered by Aliant, the Commission noted that based on “the rules of punctuation,” the presence of a comma immediately before the word “unless” meant that the closing modifier modified both preceding clauses. That initially led the Commission to side with Aliant in concluding that under the contract Aliant could terminate on one year’s notice during the initial five- year   term.   In   invoking   that   comma,   it’s   likely   that   the Commission was relying on the comma test under the rule of the last antecedent.  12.30   The Commission’s finding made the news, with headlines such as   The Comma That Costs 1 Million Dollars (Canadian) . The author of this manual, acting as expert witness for Rogers Communications, submitted an affidavit to the Commission stating that the presence of a comma could not reasonably be used to resolve the ambiguity created by the closing modifier. Regarding the possible significance of the two commas in the language at issue, see 12.37.  12.31   On   appeal,   the   Commission   found   in   favor   of   Rogers without revisiting the question of punctuation. Instead, it decided that the dispute should be governed by the French- language   version   of   the   contract,   which   provided   for   a markedly   different,   and   more   sensible,   arrangement   than that   in   the   English-language   version,   namely   that   the contract would automatically renew for additional five-year terms unless at least one year before renewal either party notifies   the   other   that   it   doesn’t   want   to   renew.   The arrangement   in   the   English   version   doesn’t   make   sense: being able to terminate at any time by giving one year’s notice renders illusory the notion of a fixed term. It appears that the language at issue was the result of poor translation of the French version of the contract.  Closing Modifiers with Offsetting Commas",
  "12.32   A subset of closing modifiers is a closing modifier that a drafter   seeks   to   link   with   one   or   both   of   two   preceding components by using offsetting commas. Omitting one or both   offsetting   commas   from   a   sentence   can   affect   its meaning.  12.33   For example, if the commas in [11] are included,   of the Asset that is the subject of the Claim   is semantically linked to   the Redemptive Value ; without the commas, it could be linked to  as of the Cut-off Date .  [11]   Acme shall pay Roe 100% of the Redemptive Value [,] as of the Cut-off Date [,] of the Asset that is the subject of the Claim.  12.34   In [12], the commas make it clear that the sentence addresses expenses incurred in redeeming the Excluded Assets; if you omit   the   commas,   it   could   be   read   as   addressing   only expenses incurred in redeeming any Grantor’s interest in the Excluded Assets.  [12]   Alpha shall promptly reimburse BCSC any expenses incurred by BCSC in redeeming [,] or protecting any Grantor’s interest in [,] the Excluded Assets.  12.35   If you include the comma in brackets, the security interest granted in [13] covers only the inventory that Roe sold to Acme; if you omit the comma, the security interest covers all inventory.  [13]   Acme grants Roe a security interest in all Acme inventory, including but not limited to all agricultural chemicals, fertilizers, and fertilizer materials [,] that Roe sold to Acme.  12.36   It’s best to avoid drafting a provision so that much depends on how presence or absence of a comma is interpreted— commas   are   too   easily   misunderstood   or   ignored   (see 12.74–.75). For example, in   Shelby County State Bank v. Van Diest Supply Co. , 303 F.3d 832 (7th Cir. 2002), the court, in interpreting language analogous to [13], ignored the absence of a comma and held that the security interest covered only a subset of all inventory.",
  "12.37   Furthermore, if what comes before the first comma of a pair of ostensibly offsetting commas can stand on its own, as opposed   to   requiring   what   follows   the   second   offsetting comma for completion (as with [12]), that makes it debatable whether the commas are, in fact, offsetting. The language at issue in the dispute between Rogers and Aliant (see 12.27) features two commas. They could be considered offsetting commas linking to the initial five-year period the right to terminate on giving one year’s notice. But one could equally argue that the commas are independent, with each serving its own syntactic function, so that there’s nothing to link the closing modifier to what precedes the first comma. This type of ambiguity is another reason to be wary of commas (see 12.74–.75).  ONE   WAY   TO   ELIMINATE   POTENTIAL   OFFSETTING - COMMA   CONFUSION  12.38   Consider the offsetting commas in this example:  The Vendor will not be liable to Acme or any Buyer, and neither Acme nor any Buyer will be liable to the Vendor, for any damages that are not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of breach.  12.39   The offsetting commas indicate that the closing modifier   for any damages ...   modifies both   The Vendor will not ...   and  neither Acme nor any Buyer will ... .   But someone might be willing to argue the point and claim that the Vendor isn’t liable   to   Acme   or   any   Buyer,   period.   (These   potential alternative meanings are analogous to the ambiguity noted in 12.27–.28.)  12.40   And as is, this sentence could cause a reader miscue—you might not realize that the opening phrase isn’t self-contained until   after   you   encounter   the   second   comma   and   what follows. So it would be clearer to revise this sentence to read as follows:  The Vendor will not be liable to Acme or any Buyer for, and neither Acme nor any Buyer will be liable to the Vendor for, any",
  "damages that are not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of breach.  12.41   By moving   for   before each comma—in effect subdividing a single prepositional phrase, namely   for any damages ... —you make it clear that in both instances something is yet to come. That   makes   life   easier   for   the   reader   and   eliminates   any possibility of confusion.  12.42   You could eliminate the potential confusion in other ways, for example by using two separate sentences. But depending on   the   context,   the   economy   offered   by   an   offsetting- commas structure might make it more efficient to tweak that structure   instead   of   scrapping   it   in   favor   of   a   different approach.  THAT   AND   WHICH  Background  12.43   Good   drafting,   like   good   writing,   requires   that   you distinguish   between   restrictive   clauses   and   nonrestrictive clauses.   Authorities   on   general   English   usage   recommend using   that   for   restrictive   clauses   and   comma- which   for nonrestrictive clauses.  12.44   In the sentence   The cakes that George baked were delicious , the clause   that George baked   is restrictive, because it gives essential information about the preceding noun ( cakes ) to distinguish it from similar items with which it might be confused (cakes baked by someone else).  12.45   By contrast, in the sentence   The cakes, which George baked, were delicious , the clause   which George baked   is nonrestrictive, because it gives us supplemental information that doesn’t further delimit the meaning of the preceding noun; we are being told that not only are the cakes delicious, it so happens that George baked them. Use of   which   and the offsetting commas tells us that the clause constitutes an aside.",
  "Current Usage  12.46   Many drafters don’t observe a clear distinction between   that  and   which.   In contracts,   which   is often used instead of   that   in restrictive clauses:  There is no fact known to any Credit Agreement Party or any of its Subsidiaries   which   [read   that ] has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.  12.47   Sometimes comma- which   is used instead of   that :  In the case of an assignment to a   Purchasing Lender, which   [read  Purchasing Lender that ] is an Affiliate of the assigning Lender, that assignment will be effective between that Lender and its Affiliate ... .  12.48   And sometimes   which   is used instead of   that   and is preceded by the closing comma of a subordinate clause, which makes the restrictive clause look even more like a nonrestrictive clause:  “ Pension Plan ” means any Employee Benefit Plan, other than a  Multiemployer Plan, which   [read   Multiemployer Plan, that ] is subject to the provisions of Title IV of ERISA or section 412 of the Code ... .  12.49   In   the   case   of   nonrestrictive   clauses,   the   comma   is sometimes inappropriately dropped before   which   ( that   cannot be used instead of   which   in nonrestrictive clauses):  All outstanding promissory notes issued by the Borrower to the Existing Lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement must be promptly returned to the Administrative   Agent which   [read  Agent, which ] shall forward them to the Borrower for cancellation.  12.50   Inconsistent   use   of   that   and   which   in   restrictive   and nonrestrictive clauses can cause ambiguity. In [10], the clause  which are subject to section 4.3   could be a restrictive clause using   which   instead of   that ; were that the case, the intent would not have been that the clause constitute an aside, but",
  "instead that it limit the scope of the exception. [10a] uses   that  instead of   which , to make it clear that one is dealing with a restrictive clause. If the clause were instead a nonrestrictive clause with a comma missing in front of   which,   the exception would apply to   all Assumed Contracts , and the clause would essentially serve as a cross-reference. [10b] inserts a comma in front of   which , to make it clearer that one is dealing with a nonrestrictive clause.  [10]   This section 4.7 applies to all Contracts other than Assumed Contracts which are subject to section 4.3. [10a]   This section 4.7 applies to all Contracts other than Assumed Contracts that are subject to section 4.3.  [10b]   This section 4.7 applies to all Contracts other than Assumed Contracts, which are subject to section 4.3.  12.51   And inconsistent usage also means that a court might not take a given usage at face value. For example, in   AIU Insurance Co. v. Robert Plan Corp. , 836 N.Y.S.2d 483 (Sup. Ct. 2006), the court   concluded   that   a   comma- which   in   the   contract provision at issue was restrictive, even though, as the court acknowledged, authorities recommend that comma- which   be used to introduce a nonrestrictive clause.  Recommendation  12.52   For two reasons, it’s best not to use nonrestrictive clauses in contracts.  12.53   First, the   AIU Insurance   case suggests that even if you use   that  for   restrictive   clauses   and   comma- which   for   nonrestrictive clauses,   your   drafting   wouldn’t   be   immune   from   the confusion   between   restrictive   and   nonrestrictive   clauses. That’s because any nonrestrictive clause risks being construed as   a   restrictive   clause,   as   happened   in   AIU   Insurance.   By contrast, it would seem less likely that a restrictive clause would be construed as a nonrestrictive clause.",
  "12.54   Second,   and   more   importantly,   a   nonrestrictive   clause typically   gives   supplemental,   nonessential   information. Contract prose isn’t the place for nonessential asides—either tackle an issue head-on or omit it entirely.  12.55   And use   that   rather than   which   in restrictive clauses. If you were to use   which , all that would distinguish a restrictive clause from a nonrestrictive clause is the presence or absence of a comma. That’s asking for trouble (see 12.74–.75).  12.56   But   in   some   contexts   using   that   rather   than   which   in   a restrictive clause might not be enough to avoid confusion. For example, even as revised, the definition in 12.48 could cause   confusion   over   whether   that   modifies   any   Employee Benefit Plan   or   a Multiemployer Plan , because all that points to  that   modifying   any Employee Benefit Plan   is the comma before  that . The simplest way to make it clearer that that is the intended meaning would be to put parentheses around   other than a Multiemployer Plan   (see 13.632).  THE SERIAL COMMA  12.57   When the last two elements in a series of three or more are joined   by   a   conjunction   ( and   or   or ),   a   comma   used immediately   before   the   conjunction   is   known   as   a   serial comma or Oxford comma.  12.58   In American English, use of the serial comma is standard except in journalistic writing;   The Chicago Manual of Style , at 6.19, strongly recommends using the serial comma. But in British English it’s standard to do without the serial comma. This manual recommends using the serial comma to avoid the ambiguity described in this section.  Inadvertent Combined Elements  12.59   One kind of ambiguity that can result from omitting the serial comma is that the reader might be uncertain whether the last two elements in the series constitute a combined",
  "element. Consider this sentence:   John ordered the following flavors of ice cream: chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, chocolate chip  [ , ]   and cherry . Without the serial comma, the reader might wonder whether chocolate chip and cherry were two separate flavors   or   one   mixed   flavor.   If   it   were   a   mixed   flavor, normally you would expect an   and   before   chocolate , but its omission could be due to the rhetorical device known as  asyndeton . A serial comma makes it clear that they’re separate flavors.  12.60   And consider this sentence:   John ordered the following flavors of   ice   cream:   chocolate,   vanilla,   strawberry,   raspberry   and chocolate chip   [ , ]   and cherry.   Without the serial comma, the reader   might   wonder   whether   the   combined   flavor   is raspberry and chocolate chip or is chocolate chip and cherry; the serial comma makes it clear that it’s the former.  Inadvertent Apposition  12.61   Omitting   the   serial   comma   can   also   result   in   the   reader seeing apposition—two noun phrases side by side, with one defining the other—where no apposition had been intended.  12.62   Consider this book dedication:   To my parents, Ayn Rand   [ , ]  and God.   With the serial comma, the dedication tells the reader that the book is dedicated three ways. Without the serial comma, the reader could think either that the book is dedicated three ways or that the book is dedicated to the writer’s parents, who happen to be Ayn Rand and God. The latter   meaning   is   obviously   ludicrous,   but   change   the elements and real confusion could result.  12.63   But the serial comma can also create ambiguity. Consider this adjusted version of the dedication:   To my mother, Ayn Rand   [ , ]   and God.   With the serial comma, the reader could understand the dedication as meaning either that the book is dedicated three ways or that the book is dedicated to the writer’s mother, who happens to be Ayn Rand, and to God. Omitting the serial comma makes the latter meaning less",
  "likely. That’s why   Garner’s Modern English Usage , at 748, is mistaken   in   saying   that   “omitting   the   final   comma   may cause ambiguities, whereas including it never will.”  12.64   The confusion discussed in 12.62 features in   Telenor Mobile Communications AS v. Storm LLC , 587 F. Supp. 2d 594, 605–08 (S.D.N.Y.   2008).   At   issue   was   the   following   definition   of “control” in a shareholders agreement:  [C]ontrol (including, with its correlative meanings, “controlled by” and “under common control with”) shall mean, with respect to any Person, the possession, directly or indirectly, of power to direct or cause the direction of management or policies ( whether through ownership of securities or partnership or other ownership interests, by contract or otherwise ) of a Person.  12.65   The litigants offered alternative meanings for what’s in the second set of parentheses (in italics). One argued that “by contract or otherwise” referred to the sources of ownership rights. The other argued that what’s in the parentheses listed the three sources of “power to direct or cause the direction of management or policies.”  12.66   The language at issue is ambiguous because the “or” before “otherwise” can link either two or three alternatives. In the first interpretation, these are the two alternatives:  [1]   by contract [2]   otherwise  12.67   In the second interpretation, these are the three alternatives:  [1]   through ownership of securities or partnership or other ownership interests [2]   by contract [3]   otherwise  12.68   The   court   held   that   the   latter   meaning   was   the   more reasonable one, but it noted that including a serial comma before “or otherwise” would have made that clearer.",
  "Inadvertent Object of Preposition  12.69   O’Connor v. Oakhurst Dairy , No. 16-1901, 2017 WL 957195 (1st   Cir.   13   Mar.   2017),   involved   yet   another   kind   of confusion that can be caused by absence of a serial comma.  12.70   The dispute was over whether truck drivers were entitled to overtime pay. The statute at issue specified that overtime pay doesn’t apply to the following: The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of: (1) Agricultural produce; (2) Meat and fish products; and (3) Perishable foods.  12.71   Here   are   the   alternative   interpretations   offered   by   the litigants: The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment [,] or distribution of ... . The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, [or] packing for shipment or distribution of ... .  12.72   Under the first interpretation, “distribution” is exempt from overtime; the dairy isn’t required to pay the truck drivers extra. Under the second interpretation, only “packing for distribution” is exempt; the dairy must pay. Use of a serial comma would have made it clearer that the first meaning was the one intended. As it was, absence of a serial comma allowed   one   side   to   argue   that   both   “shipment”   and “packing” were objects of the preposition “for”. Absence of an   or   before   “packing”   was   attributed   to   asyndeton   (see 12.59).  Staying Out of Trouble  12.73   For the drafter, it might appear that the simplest way to stay out of trouble would be to always use the serial comma in a",
  "list of three or more items, while watching for circumstances in   which   a   serial   comma   creates   ambiguity   rather   than resolves it. If using a serial comma is inconsistent with the intended   meaning,   then   make   whatever   adjustments   are required to express that meaning.  12.74   But   O’Connor   demonstrates that that isn’t necessarily the safest choice. Litigants can’t be counted on to understand commas. It’s easy to imagine a disgruntled contract party thinking   that   if   all   that   stands   between   them   and   a satisfactory   outcome   is   something   as   insubstantial   as   a comma,   it   could   be   argued   out   of   existence,   just   as   in  O’Connor   one   side   argued   that   absence   of   an   or   was insignificant.  12.75   Judges can’t be counted on to understand commas either. For   example,   in   Medfusion,   Inc.   v.   Allscripts   Healthcare Solutions, Inc. , No. 14 CVS 5192, 2015 WL 1455680 (N.C. Super.   31   Mar.   2015),   the   court   misunderstood   the significance of a serial comma. See Kenneth A. Adams,   The North Carolina Business Court and the Serial Comma: It’s Not Pretty ,   Adams   on   Contract   Drafting   (1   June   2015), http://www.adamsdrafting.com/the-north-carolina-business- court-and-the-serial-comma/. For other instances of judicial understanding   of   commas   being   called   into   question,   see 12.25, 12.36, 12.51.  12.76   So don’t rely on a comma. It would be safer instead or in addition to use some other way to eliminate ambiguity. What technique you use depends on which meaning is intended and what the context permits. For example, in the language at   issue   in   O’Connor ,   putting   parentheses   around   “for shipment” would have made it clear that “packing” wasn’t an object of the preposition “for” (see 13.632). Or reordering the   elements   might   have   worked   (see   12.3).   With   the  O’Connor   language,   it   would   have   been   awkward   to   use semicolons or enumeration (see 12.3) or tabulation (see 12.7), but those techniques might work in other contexts.",
  "AVOIDING SYNTACTIC AMBIGUITY BY RESTRUCTURING  12.77   In   each   of   the   previous   examples   in   this   chapter,   the ambiguous example is followed by examples that incorporate the   minimum   changes   necessary   to   avoid   ambiguity.   But sometimes   instead   of   making   the   best   of   an   awkward structure, it would be best to start afresh.  12.78   Consider this example:  Upon occurrence of a Change in Law or a Force Majeure Event that adversely affects the Seller’s performance under this agreement, the Buyer and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith whether to issue a change order addressing the effect of those circumstances and the terms of any such change order.  12.79   It raises the question whether the obligation is triggered by “occurrence of a Change in Law” or by “occurrence of a Change   in   Law   ...   that   adversely   affects   the   Seller’s performance   under   this   agreement.”   Assume   that   the intended   meaning   is   the   latter.   If   you   aim   to   retain   the current wording, the only way to eliminate the ambiguity would   be   to   repeat   “that   adversely   affects   the   Seller’s performance   under   this   agreement,”   which   would   be awkward.  12.80   Instead, eliminate the abstract noun “occurrence”:  If a Change in Law or a Force Majeure Event adversely affects the Seller’s performance under this agreement, the Buyer and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith whether to issue a change order addressing the effect of those circumstances and the terms of any such change order.  12.81   That way, you avoid syntactic ambiguity and as a bonus end up with a sentence that is three words shorter instead of nine words longer.",
  "SELECTED USAGES  ACTION OR PROCEEDING  13.1   It’s commonplace for drafters to use the phrase   action or proceeding , as in   any legal action or proceeding arising out of this agreement .  13.2   But   proceeding   encompasses   action .   For example,   Black’s Law Dictionary , quoting an 1899 source, notes that   proceeding   “is more comprehensive than the word ‘action,’” and 1A   Corpus Juris Secundum   Actions § 22 says “The term ‘proceeding’ is broader than the word ‘action.’”  13.3   So nothing is gained by using   action or proceeding   rather than simply   proceeding .  ACTIVELY  13.4   Actively   is the opposite of   passively . As such,   actively   would seem   redundant   when   used   with   a   verb   structure   that connotes activity:  Liens for taxes not yet delinquent or which are being   actively  contested in good faith ... . The Company ... is   actively   taking steps to ensure that it will be in compliance with other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ... .  13.5   If   by   using   actively   you’re   trying   to   distinguish   between different levels of activity, instead be explicit. For example, if you want a provision not to apply to an employee if the employee is on some kind of leave, make that explicit instead of relying on the phrase   while actively employed .",
  "ACTUAL ,   ACTUALLY  13.6   The word   actual   has a role to play in contracts when it’s used to draw a contrast with some other attribute, as in   any actual or alleged damage   and   their actual or potential adverse impact . Or when a word arguably has some other, non-actual meaning.  13.7   But   actual   can serve as padding, in which case you eliminate it:  permits in Seller’s   actual   physical possession a copy of the   actual   proposed Lease once   actual   statements for the month of Closing become available before the   actual   taxes and special assessments payable during such year are known in each case for the   actual   number of days elapsed  13.8   As for   actually , in everyday English it means   in fact   and signals   difference   of   opinion   or   disagreement   over   facts. Contracts aren’t for debating, so generally   actually   has no place   in   contract   prose.   Eliminate   it   from   each   of   these examples:  The Company shall pay or reimburse all Expenses   actually   and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with that subrogation. ... equal to the product of (1) the amount of cash dividends per share   actually   paid by the Company on the outstanding Common Stock ... . ... had the increase with respect to issuance of such rights, options, or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock   actually   delivered. ... if that Person has the right to then acquire or obtain from the Company any Registrable Securities, whether or not that acquisition has   actually   been effected.",
  "AFFIRMATIVELY ,   AFFIRMATIVE  13.9   Contracts   would   be   better   off   without   affirmatively   and  affirmative .  unless the Employee   affirmatively   elects otherwise; ... . ... the Company’s board of directors has   affirmatively   publicly recommended to the Company’s shareholders that ... . The Recipient hereby   affirmatively   consents to ... .  13.10   As for   affirmative , it’s mostly used with   vote :  The Fund may act by the   affirmative   vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund.  13.11   Presumably the function of   affirmative   is to make it clear that it’s not sufficient that the combined votes for and against constitute a majority of the outstanding shares—that instead the votes in favor must constitute a majority of outstanding shares. But if that’s the case, it would be clearer to say so, like this:  The Fund may act by vote of the shareholders in which a majority of the outstanding shares vote in favor of the action.  13.12   Affirmative   is also redundant in the phrase   affirmative action , unless you’re referring to employment or higher-education admissions policies:  The Company will not be required to take any   affirmative   action to cause delivery of Restricted Shares to comply with any such law.  13.13   And you can always do better than   Affirmative Covenants   as a heading, particularly because   covenant   is archaic (see 3.166).  Certain Obligations   would be an improvement.  ALLONGE  13.14   Don’t use the term of art   allonge .",
  "13.15   According to   Black’s Law Dictionary ,   allonge   means “A slip of paper sometimes attached to a negotiable instrument for the purpose of receiving further indorsements when the original paper is filled with indorsements.” (An indorsement transfers or   guarantees   a   negotiable   instrument   or   acknowledges payment.)   Black’s Law Dictionary   gives 1859 as the date of earliest usage, so   allonge   is a relative newcomer. It’s obscure and studiously foppish;   indorsement supplement ,   indorsement addendum,   or   indorsement certificate   are clearer alternatives.  13.16   A further problem with   allonge   is that it has come to have another meaning: you see it used instead of   amendment   in promissory   notes,   as   in   the   title   FIRST   ALLONGE   TO PROMISSORY NOTE . Use   amendment   instead. (This other use is an example of how the meaning of obscure terms of art can drift. Another example of that is   attorn ; see 13.93.)  ALSO ,   IN ADDITION  13.17   Be   restrained   in   using   also   and   in   addition .   Contract provisions on discrete topics should be able to stand on their own.  AMONG OTHER THINGS  13.18   The phrase   among other things   is benign when it’s used to refer to something treated fully elsewhere—for example, in the same contract (see the first example below) or in another contract (see the example under it).  Attached as appendix A is an amended and restated schedule B to the Subadvisory Agreement stating,   among other things , the fee that the Adviser will pay the Subadviser with respect to ... . The Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders have agreed to enter into the Floorplan Credit Agreement, subject to,  among other things , a condition that the parties amend and restate the Existing Guaranty Agreement as provided in this agreement; and ... .",
  "13.19   But   among other things   can also be used in an open-ended way,   leaving   the   reader   to   wonder   what   it   adds   to   the contract.  13.20   Sometimes it’s equivalent to   includes   or   including . In that case, in the interest of consistent terminology (see 1.63), use instead   whichever   word   applies.   For   example,   instead   of  “Reasonable   Efforts”   means ,   among   other   things,   ...   ,   say  “Reasonable Efforts” includes   ... . (But see 6.40 regarding the risks of using   includes   as the definitional verb.)  13.21   Among other things   is also used to signal that only the items specified are relevant. If that’s the case, you don’t need to allude to unspecified other items:  Each Letter of Credit must,   among other things , (1) provide for payment of ... and (2) have an expiration date of not later than ... .  13.22   There’s no good reason to use the Latinism equivalent of  among other things ,   inter alia   (see 13.492).  AMONGST ,   WHILST  13.23   Pick the simplest and clearest usages and stick with them, even with everyday words. So use   among   instead of   amongst .  13.24   Garner’s Modern English Usage   says that in American English,  amongst   is an archaism and is “pretentious at best,” but that it’s “more common and more tolerable in [British English], where it doesn’t suggest affectation.” But a Google Ngram of use of   among   and   amongst   in two hundred years’ of digitized British-English   books   shows   that   in   England,   among   has consistently been more popular than   amongst .   So   it   even makes   sense   for   English   drafters   to   use   among   and   not  amongst .  13.25   The same analysis applies to use of   whilst —use   while   instead.  ANNIVERSARY",
  "13.26   Anniversary   means a day that marks occurrence of an event on that date in a previous year, but it’s also used informally to mark a milestone in months or even weeks. The latter use of   anniversary   is   routine   in   contracts,   and   eliminating   it results in prose that’s not only more logical but also more concise. Here’s an example:  The Company shall redeem this debenture in 24 equal installments of principal and accrued interest monthly beginning  on the one-month anniversary following   [ read   one month after] the First Closing Date.  13.27   Silly but nonetheless commonplace is   12-month anniversary , as in   ending on the 12-month anniversary of the Termination Date . Because 12 months make a year, the phrase   12-month   is  superfluous.  ANNUAL MEETING  13.28   It’s generally accepted that an annual meeting doesn’t have to take place on the same day every year. So what does  annual meeting   mean? The notion that   annual meeting   should mean roughly 365 days apart is vague: how many days can you add or subtract before your meeting no longer qualifies as annual? The meaning of   annual meeting   was at issue in  Airgas ,   Inc. v. Air Products & Chemicals ,   Inc. , 8 A.3d 1182 (Del. 2010).  13.29   Avoiding this uncertainty would require being more specific. You could, for example, specify that a meeting qualifies as the annual meeting for a given year if it’s held anytime in that year.  ANYONE  13.30   If a provision encompasses anyone, consider using that word — anyone , as in   If anyone commences an involuntary case against the Company . It’s more concise than always using instead   any",
  "person or entity   or   any Person . But don’t use it in a sensitive context, as there’s little relevant caselaw.  APPLICABLE  13.31   The adjective   applicable   is used in contracts in three ways.  Applicable   Plus Noun  13.32   Sometimes   applicable   is used before a noun; in this context, it means “whichever is relevant.” It’s possible to use   applicable  appropriately in this manner:  The Company shall provide the Employee with pension and welfare benefits and group employee benefits such as sick leave, vacation, group disability, and health, life, and accident insurance, and any similar indirect compensation offered generally to the Company’s executive personnel, subject in each case to the terms of the   applicable   benefit plan or program.  13.33   But often, as in the three examples that follow,   applicable  should be omitted. That’s because it inappropriately suggests that the provision applies to a subset of a whole, whereas in fact it applies to the whole. In particular, the   applicable   in  applicable law   is redundant: if a law doesn’t apply to you, then you’re not violating it.  Recipient shall pay all   applicable   taxes incurred in connection with the Consultant’s performance of services under this agreement. Conveyance of the Mortgage Notes and the Mortgages by the Company under this agreement is not subject to the bulk transfer laws of any   applicable   jurisdiction. Acme’s execution and delivery of this agreement and performance of its obligations under this agreement do not violate any   applicable   law.  13.34   And often   applicable   is used where greater precision is called for:",
  "The Company shall pay the Employee a bonus of $33,000 not later than 30 days after each of the first three anniversaries of the Commencement Date,   on condition that the Employee is employed by the Company on the applicable anniversary   [read  except that the Company will not be required to make a payment with respect to a given anniversary if the Employee is then no longer employed by the Company ].  The Verb   To Be   Plus   Applicable  13.35   Applicable   is also used with the verb   to be . Generally, you would be better off instead using the verb   apply , as in the following examples. If you have a choice, it’s better to use verbs rather than adjectives or abstract nouns (see 17.7).  The provisions of this section 7.2 will   be applicable   [read   apply ] solely to work that the Tenant performs, or causes to be performed, before the Commencement Date. Any such modification or revocation ... will not   be applicable  [read   apply ] to investment transactions to which the Advisor has committed the Company before the date the Advisor receives that notice.  As Applicable  13.36   The phrase   as applicable   is unobjectionable. It’s equivalent to, but a little more succinct than, the phrase   as the case may be  (see 13.74):  The terms of this warrant will apply to the shares of stock and other securities and property received on exercise of this warrant after consummation of that reorganization, consolidation, or merger or the effective date of dissolution following any such transfer,   as applicable .  ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO  Implications",
  "13.37   The phrase   arising out of or relating to   is a fixture of contracts, but there’s a better alternative.  13.38   The phrase appears in dispute-resolution provisions (notably governing-law   provisions,   forum-selection   provisions,   and arbitration provisions), which often state that they cover all matters   arising out of or relating to   the contract in question. For example, the American Arbitration Association’s standard arbitration clause refers to “Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract.” The phrase also features in provisions that seek to limit liability.  13.39   Here’s the concern that use of the phrase is intended to address:  13.40   If the parties to a transaction get into a dispute, they might bring   against   each   other   claims   based   on   the   contract between   them   or,   instead   or   in   addition,   other   kinds   of claim: a tort claim, such as a claim for misrepresentation; a claim challenging a patent; or a claim authorized by statute.  13.41   Contracts   offer   predictability   in   business   transactions.   It follows   that   drafters   would   likely   be   inclined   to   arrange matters so a contract’s provisions cover all possible disputes, not just those grounded in contract. (Whether that’s in fact a good idea would depend on the circumstances.) And it’s not surprising that drafters should avail themselves of   arising out of or relating to , as   arising out of   expresses a narrower meaning than does   relating to . Think of how one arises out of one’s parents but is related to a broader group of people.  13.42   But is   arising out of or relating to   the best way to articulate this intended   meaning?   In   a   passage   relating   to   drafting arbitration provisions, Morton Moskin,   Commercial Contracts: Strategies   for   Drafting   and   Negotiating   §   5.04[D][1]   (2012) (citations omitted), summarizes the entrenched conventional wisdom regarding   arising out of or relating to : It is essential that an arbitration clause cover precisely the subject matter that the parties intend to be",
  "submitted to arbitration. In most contracts that provide for arbitration, the parties intend that all disputes arising out of or relating to the contract be subject to arbitration, and in the United States the phrase “arising out or relating to” has become the model for broad arbitration clauses. Also effective is the phrase “in connection with.” By using a more limited description— e.g., one which covers only disputes “arising out of” the contract, and not those “relating to” the contract—the parties create the risk that a court will conclude that the parties did not intend the clause to be broad and, in particular, intended to exclude tort claims, which may be considered to “relate to” the contract but not to “arise out of” the contract.  13.43   It would indeed be a good idea to state precisely the types of claims that are to be submitted to arbitration. But instead of precision,   arising out of or relating to   uses two vague standards that offer little predictability regarding what falls within the scope of the provision.  13.44   In particular, invoking the broader   relating to   standard could result   in   a   party   being   unpleasantly   surprised   by   the consequences of something unexpectedly falling within the scope of a provision. Imagine that in drafting a contract you provide that California law will govern all disputes   arising out of   it, since you know that from your perspective, California law   would   treat   more   favorably   a   key   issue   under   the contract.   But   you   also   provided   that   California   law   will govern all disputes   relating to   the contract. Thereafter, you find yourself embroiled in a tangential dispute you hadn’t anticipated, and you certainly didn’t check the pros and cons of having that dispute governed by California law. In such a context,   relating to   could represent a roll of the dice.  13.45   For a case in which a party unsuccessfully argued that a dispute   didn’t   fall   within   the   scope   of   an   arbitration provision that used   related to , see   In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel)",
  "Antitrust Litigation ,   No.   M   07-1827   SI,   2011   WL   2650689 (N.D. Cal. 6 July 2011).  An Alternative Approach  13.46   If you want to bring a broad but predictable set of claims within the scope of a provision, it would make sense to focus not on the contract but instead on the activities that the parties   will   be   engaging   in   as   part   of   the   transaction contemplated   by   the   contract.   That   would   allow   you   to dispense with   or relating to , as you wouldn’t need to make the leap   from   contract   claims   to   other   claims—any   claim, whatever its nature, would have to arise out of activities the parties engage in under the contract.  13.47   You could articulate this meaning by using   arising out of the subject matter of this agreement , but you would be trading one kind   of   vagueness   for   another—there’s   no   shortage   of litigation regarding what   the subject matter of this agreement  means in a given contract. You would be better off instead saying what the subject matter of the contract is.  13.48   For   example,   if   you’re   dealing   with   a   confidentiality agreement,   you   could   say   any   disputes   arising   out   of   this agreement or the Recipient’s handling ,   disclosure ,   or use of any Confidential Information .  13.49   And if you want to make sure that a fee-shifting provision in a limited-liability-company operating agreement would apply to proceedings seeking dissolution, then instead of referring to   “any   action   or   proceeding   brought   to   enforce   any provision of this Agreement,” say   any dispute arising out of this agreement ,   ownership   of   any   Interest ,   or   management   or operations of the Company . Regarding the dispute over the scope of the narrower alternative, see   Henderson v. Henderson Investment Properties ,   L.L.C. , 148 Idaho 638, 227 P.3d 568 (2010).",
  "13.50   This approach allows you to articulate clearly the intended meaning. Instead of establishing an overly narrow set—the contract—and relying on a vague standard to reach beyond it,   you   establish   the   relevant   set—activities   under   the contract.  13.51   Plenty of courts have assessed the meaning of   arising out of or relating to , but that hasn’t served to make it any less vague. You can count on it continuing to blindside contract parties and their lawyers.  13.52   Some courts don’t require broad language to hold that tort claims fall within a contract’s dispute-resolution provisions. See, e.g.,   Maynard v. BTI Group ,   Inc. , 157 Cal. Rptr. 3d 148, 154 (Ct. App. 2013) (holding that a contract reference to “any dispute” included tort claims). But it’s far better to be explicit than to rely on confusing contract language and hope that your dispute lands in front of a court with an expansive view of what claims are covered.  13.53   If in fact you want to limit the scope of a dispute-resolution provision to claims arising under the contract, it would be reckless   to   assume   that   using   only   arising   out   of   would accomplish   that.   Instead,   include   a   provision   excluding extracontractual liability.  AS AMENDED  13.54   The phrase   as amended   can be used in a contract to modify references to statutes or to other contracts, as in   Acme shall comply with the Securities Act . It’s standard practice for drafters to tack on   as amended   after each such reference, the idea being to ensure that at any time compliance is measured against the statute or contract as it is then in effect.  13.55   But adding   as amended   serves no purpose: compliance with a statute or contract could be measured against the statute or contract only as it is then in effect, even without   as amended .",
  "13.56   If in a contract dated 3 November 2017 you say that since 1 January 2015 Acme has complied with the Securities Act, it would   be   unreasonable   to   interpret   that   to   mean   that throughout that period Acme complied with the Securities Act not as then in effect but as in effect in 1933 or on the date of the contract. You can’t comply with a version of a statute that no longer exists or a version that has yet to exist.  13.57   And if in that same contract you say “Acme shall comply with   the   Securities   Act,”   it   would   be   unreasonable   to interpret that to mean that thereafter complying with the Securities Act as in effect in 1933 or on the date of the contract,   regardless   of   any   later   amendments,   would constitute compliance with that obligation. Again, you can’t comply with a version of a statute that no longer exists.  13.58   But   a   contract   might   also   refer   to   a   statute   or   another contract not regarding compliance but instead regarding an element of that statute or contract.  13.59   For example, a contract might refer to a term as it is defined in a statute or other contract. If the intent is to freeze the definition as it is on the date of the agreement, then refer to the statute or the other agreement   as in effect on the date of this   agreement .   If   the   intent   is   to   incorporate   any   future amendments to the definition, then refer to the statute or the other agreement   as then in effect . If that leaves room for confusion,   be   more   specific;   for   example,   as   in   effect   on exercise of the Option . (Simply saying   as amended   wouldn’t specify what point in time you’re referring to. And if the statute   or   contract   hadn’t   been   amended   at   the   time   in question,   as amended   wouldn’t make sense.)  13.60   So when in a contract you’re referring to an element of a statute or another contract, make it clear whether you’re referring to the statute or the other contract as in effect on the   date   of   the   contract   you’re   drafting   or   as   in   effect whenever   that   provision   applies.   But   when   referring   to",
  "compliance with a statute or another contract, don’t tack on  as amended .  AS CONSIDERATION  13.61   In   addition   to   featuring   in   the   traditional   recital   of consideration (see 2.166), the word   consideration   is used in the body of the contract, particularly in language effecting a release. There are better alternatives.  13.62   Here are examples of   consideration   used in release language:  As additional   consideration   for the assignment made under this agreement, the Assignee hereby releases the Assignor ... . In   consideration   of the payments made and benefits provided under this agreement, and except for any claims the Executive has under this agreement, the Executive (on behalf of himself and his personal representatives) hereby releases the Company ... . As further   consideration   for the amendments, consents, and waivers in this agreement, each Borrower hereby releases the Agent and each Lender ... . In exchange for the above-referenced   consideration , the Employee hereby releases ... .  13.63   Consideration references in the body of the contract raise two   issues.   First,   whether   a   contract   calls   something consideration is unrelated to whether as a matter of law it actually is consideration (see 2.173). So saying in the body of the contract that something is consideration accomplishes nothing other than adding a pointless legalism.  13.64   And   second,   the   bargained-for   exchange   that   constitutes consideration usually consists of more than single tit-for-tat promises. Instead, one party exchanges a parcel of promises in exchange for the other party’s parcel of promises. Why single   out   one   promise   in   particular   as   being   supported by consideration?",
  "13.65   It’s   likely   that   drafters   allude   to   consideration   in   release language because often it’s an add-on to the deal. Because releases   can   seem   free-standing,   drafters   are   inclined   to reiterate the notion of consideration to tie the release to the deal. To accomplish that using the word   consideration , the simplest   alternative   would   be   the   phrase   in   consideration , which   is   used   colloquially;   it   expresses   the   notion   of exchange. But it would be even simpler and clearer to say that the release is   in exchange for   a specified action or promise by   the   party   being   released,   omitting   any   mention of consideration.  AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND NOT AS A PENALTY  13.66   The phrase   as liquidated damages and not as a penalty   occurs in provisions in which the parties, instead of having actual damages determined in a dispute, specify what damages a party is to pay on breach of a particular obligation. But it’s formulaic—it would be better to address the underlying issue more clearly.  13.67   24   Williston on Contracts   § 65:1 (footnotes omitted) provides some background: Under the fundamental principle of freedom of contract, the parties to a contract have a broad right to stipulate in their agreement the amount of damages recoverable in the event of a breach, and the courts will generally enforce such an agreement, so long as the amount agreed upon is not unconscionable, is not determined to be an illegal penalty, and is not otherwise violative of public policy.  13.68   But   if   the   parties   say   that   a   given   payment   constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty, doesn’t that settle it? Apparently   not.   According   to   the   Restatement   (Second)   of Contracts   § 356 cmt. c (1981), “Neither the parties’ actual intention as to its validity nor their characterization of the",
  "term as one for liquidated damages or a penalty is significant in determining whether the term is valid.”  13.69   But it doesn’t follow that instead of saying “Acme shall pay Widgetco $3 million, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty,”   you   might   as   well   just   say   “Acme   shall   pay Widgetco   $3   million.”   That’s   because   courts   have   given varying weight to the language used by the parties. See, e.g.,  Ludlow Valve Manufacturing Co. v. City of Chicago , 181 Ill. App. 388 (1913), in which the court said, “The fact that parties fix a sum to be paid in case of a breach of the contract and call that sum ‘liquidated damages’ is not conclusive, but is one of the circumstances tending to prove the actual intent of the parties.” (Recent Illinois cases have cited   Ludlow , so it’s still good law.)  13.70   Because at least some courts pay attention to how a contract characterizes   a   payment   to   be   made   on   breach   of   an obligation,   include   that   sort   of   characterization   when providing for liquidated damages in a contract.  13.71   But do more than just trot out   as liquidated damages and not as a penalty . It’s sufficiently rote and terse as to be jargon. Because drafters and their clients don’t give it much thought, courts would be entitled not to pay much attention to it either.  13.72   Here’s   a   more   meaningful   way   of   saying   that   liquidated damages don’t constitute a penalty:  Acme acknowledges that the actual damages likely to result from breach by Acme of its obligations under this section X are difficult to estimate on the date of this agreement and would be difficult for Widgetco to prove. The parties intend that Acme’s payment of the Liquidated Damages Amount would compensate Widgetco for any such breach. They do not intend for it be a penalty for any such breach.  13.73   It would also be helpful to explain why actual damages are difficult to estimate.",
  "AS THE CASE MAY BE  13.74   When   in   a   contract   a   sentence   provides   for   alternative courses of action, often one or more sentences that follow address the consequences. When the contract is signed, it won’t be known which of the alternative courses of action will be relevant, so those sentences must track the alternative scenarios. But they must make it clear that whichever choice is made regarding the initial sentence, that choice will flow through to the sentences that follow. That’s the function of  as applicable   (see 13.36) and   whichever applies , and it’s also the function of   as the case may be :  Able shall transfer the Shares to Baker or Charlie no later than 31 March 2018. No later than five days after that transfer, Baker or Charlie,   as the case may be,   shall enter into a noncompetition agreement with Widgetco in the form of exhibit A.  13.75   But generally you can convey the required meaning more economically than by using   as the case may be . For example, in the above example one could refer to   the transferee   instead of   Baker or Charlie ,   as the case may be .  13.76   And often   as the case may be   is misused, in that it’s tacked on to an expression of simple alternatives:  “Date of Termination” means the date on which a Covered Change in Control Termination or Covered Termination Prior to a Change in Control occurs , as the case may be .  AT LEAST ONE OF X AND Y  13.77   Use only   at least one of X and Y . Don’t use   or . Or you could say   instead   one   or   more   of   X   and   Y .   Unfortunately,   that recommendation requires detailed explication. That’s because in a well-known case,   SuperGuide Corp. v. DirecTV Enterprises ,  Inc. , 358 F.3d 870 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the only appellate-level court with the jurisdiction   to   hear   appeals   in   patent   cases)   botched   its analysis of   at least one of X and Y .",
  "The Court’s Analysis  13.78   Here’s part of the language at issue, from a patent claim:  An online television program schedule system comprising: first means for storing at least one of a desired program start time, a desired program end time, a desired program service, and a desired program type; ... .  13.79   Does this refer to storing at least one unit within each of the four categories, or storing at least one category?  13.80   Here’s what the court said (footnotes and citations omitted): In interpreting this phrase, the district court concluded that the term “a desired,” which precedes “at least one of,” is repeated for each category and because the final category in the criteria list is introduced by “and a desired,” the list is conjunctive. The court also concluded that accepting SuperGuide’s position that “at least one of” refers only to one category of the criteria would contradict the purpose of the invention as described in the written description, as depicted in Figure 4a and recited in claim 1. Thus, the court construed the phrase “at least one of ... and” as meaning “at least one of each desired criterion; that is, at least one of a desired program start time, a desired program end time, a desired program service and a desired program type. The phrase does not mean one or more of the desired criteria but at a minimum one category thereof.” On appeal, SuperGuide contends that the claim phrase “at least one of” unambiguously requires the selection and storage of one or more of the four listed criteria (start time, end time, service channel, or type) and does not require storing all four criteria. ... DirecTV counters that the district court’s construction is supported by the patentee’s use of the conjunctive word",
  "“and” and by the grammatical rule requiring that the phrase “at least one of” be applied to each category in the list. ... ... We agree with DirecTV. The phrase “at least one of” precedes a series of categories of criteria, and the patentee used the term “and” to separate the categories of criteria, which connotes a conjunctive list. A common treatise on grammar teaches that “an article of [sic] a preposition applying to all the members of the series must either be used only before the first term or else be repeated before each term.” William Strunk, Jr. & E.B. White,   The Elements of Style   27 (4th ed. 2000). Thus, “[i]n spring, summer, or winter” means “in spring, in summer, or in winter.” Applying this grammatical principle here, the phrase “at least one of” modifies each member of the list, i.e., each category in the list. Therefore, the district court correctly interpreted this phrase as requiring that the user select at least one value for each category; that is, at least one of a desired program start time, a desired program end time, a desired program service, and a desired program type.  13.81   The court also suggested that the outcome would have been different if the language at issue had used as a conjunction   or  instead of   and . Specifically, in footnote 10 the court said, “SuperGuide does not articulate its argument that ‘at least one of’ means ‘one or more of the four listed criteria’ without using the term ‘or’ to separate the four listed categories.” It then   noted   that   an   earlier   Federal   Circuit   decision   had interpreted a claim constructed as “at least one of A, B, or C” as covering only A, only B, only C, or any combination of the three.  Critique",
  "13.82   The court’s analysis makes no sense. First, the passage from  The Elements of Style   is irrelevant. It simply states that as a matter of writing style it would be awkward to say   in spring ,  summer ,   or in winter   instead of one of the two alternatives the court   quoted.   It   has   nothing   to   do   with   identifying ambiguity.  13.83   And second, there’s no question that the phrase “at least one of” modifies each member of the list, as the court says. That’s not the issue. Instead, the issue is whether “one of” refers to an item within a category or to the category itself.  13.84   So   the   “Therefore”   that   begins   the   final   sentence   of   the extract above is unearned—nothing has been demonstrated.  13.85   The meaning suggested by SuperGuide is the more natural reading, but it’s conceivable that a not-particularly-skilled drafter   might   have   worded   it   that   way   even   if   they   had intended   to   express   the   DirecTV   meaning.   So   one   could imagine a court holding that the language at issue conveys the SuperGuide meaning or holding that it’s ambiguous. The one conclusion that’s implausible is the one the court arrived at—that the language at issue conveys unambiguously the meaning sought by DirecTV.  13.86   Also problematic is the court’s suggestion that the outcome would have been different if the language at issue had used   or  instead of   and . That too makes no sense. For one thing, as described   above,   the   possible   alternative   meanings   of   the language at issue don’t arise from use of   and .  13.87   Furthermore,   and   is actually the logical choice. Consider the following simple examples, in which   at least one of X and Y   is used with just units not categories:  [1]   at least one of Tom, Dick, and Harry [1a]   *at least one of Tom, Dick, or Harry  13.88   The reference is to at least one of a group, making   and   the appropriate choice, as in [1]. Using   or   instead would suggest that one is referring to at least one out of one of the three.",
  "That doesn’t make sense. Option 1[a] is ungrammatical— hence the asterisk. (For discussion of this issue regarding an analogous usage,   the earlier of X and Y , see 13.809.)  Recommendation  13.89   Beyond   the   ramifications   for   the   litigants,   the   court’s opinion in   SuperGuide   is unfortunate. Specifically, it has set an   unhelpful   precedent   by   suggesting   that   the   outcome would have been different if the language at issue had used as a conjunction   or   instead of   and .  13.90   Although it’s a patent case, it wouldn’t be surprising if a court considering the phrase in the context of a contract dispute were to consult   SuperGuide , given that the   SuperGuide  court claimed that its holding was based on “the plain and ordinary meaning of the disputed language.” And anecdotal evidence indicates that some drafters have concluded, based on   SuperGuide , that one should always use   or   after   at least one of .  13.91   Instead, courts and those who work with contracts should ignore   SuperGuide   and do as follows: Use only   at least one of X and Y . Don’t use   or . To avoid problems, pay attention to how you use this phrase. If you’re referring to units, as in [1], there’s   nothing   to   consider—the   meaning   is   clear,   and furthermore   SuperGuide   doesn’t apply. If you use it in relation to   categories,   make   it   explicit   that   you’re   referring   to categories, as in [2] (the meaning sought by SuperGuide). If you use it in relation to units within categories, make it explicit that you’re referring to units, and furthermore make it clear whether you’re referring to units in all the categories, as in [3] (the meaning sought by DirecTV), or fewer than all, as in [4].  [2]   at least one of the following categories: nuts, bolts, and screws [3]   at least one unit in each of the following categories: nuts, bolts, and screws",
  "[4]   at least one unit in [at least] one of the following categories: nuts, bolts, and screws  13.92   You can convey the same meaning as   at least one of X and Y  by saying   one or more of X and Y . The same analysis applies to both formulations, but the latter has the advantage of being simpler.  ATTORN  13.93   Attorn   is   a   term   of   art,   but   it’s   unnecessary.   Here’s   how  Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 95, defines the related noun:  attornment   has two analogous senses, the first relating to personal property and the second relating to land. It may mean either (1) “an act by a bailee in possession of goods on behalf of one person acknowledging that he will hold the goods on behalf of someone else” ... ; or (2) a person’s agreement to hold land as the tenant of someone other than the original landlord; a tenant’s act of recognizing that rent is to be paid to a different person. Both senses are used in [British English] and [American English].  13.94   Although in the United States real-estate lawyers are familiar with   attorn , it’s likely to befuddle anyone else. Some terms of art   add   unnecessary   complexity   (see   1.7).   Attorn   is   an example of such a term of art—in a provision effecting an attornment, the word   attorn   simply expresses consent. Use that word instead:  Tenant shall   attorn   [read   consent ] to any party’s succeeding to the Landlord’s interest in the Premises, whether by purchase, foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, power of sale, or otherwise, at that party’s request, and shall execute any agreements confirming   that attornment   [read   the Tenant’s consent ] as that party reasonably requests.",
  "13.95   If nevertheless you feel you must refer to attornment, use  Attornment   as a section heading.  13.96   Interestingly,   in   Canada   the   word   attorn   is   also   used   in connection   with   consent   to   a   court   having   personal jurisdiction. In addition to occurring in legislation and court opinions, it appears in contracts:  The parties to this agreement hereby   attorn   to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Quebec. Lender hereby irrevocably   attorns   to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Provinces of Ontario regarding all matters arising out of this power of attorney.  13.97   As with other uses of   attorn , the problem with this use of  attorn   is that the meaning sought to be conveyed has nothing to do with the doctrinal connotations of   attorn . Here too, all that’s being conveyed is consent.  13.98   Canadian   use   of   attorn   in   this   context   highlights   two additional   problems.   First,   some   Canadian   commentary suggests that consenting by contract to the jurisdiction of specified courts doesn’t constitute attornment. A term of art can be used inadvertently in contexts that are inconsistent with doctrinal subtleties attached to the word, and this use of  attorn   might be an example of that.  13.99   Second, Canadians use   attorn   in a way that drafters in no other jurisdiction do. The result is pointless inconsistency that might create confusion in cross-border transactions.  AUTOMATICALLY  13.100   For contract drafting,   automatically   is often dispensable.  13.101   For   example,   eliminating   automatically   from   each   of   the following examples wouldn’t affect its meaning, as it would nevertheless be clear that the example doesn’t involve action by the parties. (A drafter might be inclined to use instead  immediately   in   the   second   and   third   examples,   but   even",
  "without   immediately , the reasonable reader would conclude that the result in question would occur all at once.)  ... and restrictions on any such awards will   automatically   lapse at midnight at the beginning of the Date of Termination ... . ... when that restriction is lifted, that property will   automatically  become part of the Collateral ... . On occurrence of a Change of Control, all unvested SARs will  automatically   vest ...  13.102   But   in   other   contexts   automatically   has   a   role   to   play. Consider this example:  ... and each 1 January thereafter, this agreement will be [automatically] extended for one additional year unless not later than ... .  13.103   This example is in the passive voice, and the most likely candidate for the missing   by -agent (see 3.12) is   the parties . Without   automatically ,   this   example   could   conceivably   be understood as suggesting that action by the parties would be required   for   the   term   of   the   agreement   to   be   extended. Adding   automatically   would make it clear that’s not the case.  13.104   Sometimes   automatically   is inappropriate because it suggests that action will take place, whereas a legal fiction is being established. Legal fictions are best expressed using   deem   (see 13.216):  ... the distribution terms and Acme’s other rights to that payment or benefit   will be automatically   [read   will be deemed to have been ] modified to conform to the tax law requirements to ensure that constructive receipt does not occur.  BASIS   (INCLUDING   TIMELY )  13.105   Be careful how you use the word   basis . As noted in   Garner’s Modern English Usage , it “often signals verbosity in adverbial constructions.”",
  "13.106   So instead of   on a daily basis , try   daily , as in “Interest will accrue   on a daily basis   [read   daily ].” In other words, use   daily  as an adverb rather than as an adjective. Analogous fixes would take care of   on a weekly basis ,   on a regular basis , and other   such   phrases.   And   if   you   can’t   simply   omit   on an ongoing basis , address timing specifically.  13.107   The same applies to   on a pro-rata basis , as in “Those shares will be allocated   on a pro-rata basis   [read   pro rata ] to the Remaining Holders.”  13.108   In   on a timely basis ,   in a timely manner , and   in a timely fashion , the word   timely   is   an   adjective.   But   in   American   English  timely   can also be an adverb, so in the interest of concision, you would be better off replacing those phrases with   timely , as in “a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to  perform on a timely basis   [read   timely perform ] its obligations under   any   Transaction   Document.”   ( Garner’s   Dictionary   of Legal Usage , at 895, notes that “This adverbial use of   timely   is archaic in [British English].”)  13.109   Sometimes eliminating   basis   requires a bigger fix, as in this example: “Acme shall not enter into any transaction with any Affiliate   unless that transaction is made on an arm’s-length basis and   [read   other than an arm’s-length transaction that ] has been approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Company.”  BECAUSE  13.110   Contracts regulate conduct rather than explicate, so drafters should have little need for the word   because   in the body of the contract (see 1.57). But   because   does occur in conditional clauses, to express the concept   If X because of Y ,   then Z . That raises the possibility of a dispute: does Y have to be the sole cause of X, or is it enough that Y was one of several factors contributing to X?",
  "13.111   That’s an issue that the U.S. Supreme Court addressed in  Gross   v.   FBL   Financial   Services ,   Inc. ,   557   U.S.   167   (2009), holding   that   a   statute’s   requirement   that   an   adverse employment action be taken “because of” age meant that a plaintiff must prove that age was the “but-for” cause of the employer’s adverse decision.  13.112   So whenever you use   because   in a contract, consider being specific regarding the type of causation required.  BELIEF  13.113   It doesn’t make sense to state categorically in a contract the legal implications of facts as they exist on the date of the agreement. Instead, it would be up to a court to decide what those implications are—the best a party could do is give its opinion.   In   such   contexts,   it’s   preferable   to   use   belief   to qualify that statement of fact, as in   The parties believe this agreement complies with the requirements of section 409A of the IRS Code .  13.114   But   it’s   routine   for   drafters   to   present   legal   opinions   as statements of fact. Examples include statements regarding topics also covered by standard legal opinions delivered at closing—formation, existence, enforceability of obligations, no violations of law, and other matters.  13.115   Such statements don’t assert facts within the knowledge of the party making the statement. Instead, they allocate risk. Although   often   it   would   go   against   long-established convention, it would be clearer, but not necessarily more convenient, to qualify those statements of fact using belief, supplemented   by   provisions   addressing   indemnification, termination fees, or another risk-allocation mechanism.  BETWEEN OR AMONG  13.116   Some contracts refer to agreements or some other activity  between or among   the parties, as in   all prior understandings and",
  "agreements ,   whether oral or written ,   between or among the parties .  13.117   This   usage   is   presumably   prompted   by   the   conventional wisdom that one speaks of a contract as being   between   the parties if there are only two parties and   among   the parties if there are more than two. As noted in 2.49 in connection with the introductory clause, there’s no basis in English usage for this   distinction.   If   the   concern   is   that   using   between   in referring to agreements of the three or more parties to a contract would cover only agreements between any two of the   parties,   that   could   be   resolved   by   saying   agreements between two or more of the parties .  13.118   But thanks to copy-and-paste, be prepared to find   between or among   in contracts between only two parties, where it would be irrelevant.  BOOKS AND RECORDS  13.119   In the standard phrase   books and records , the word   books   is redundant.  13.120   Books   could   mean   corporate   books,   which   Black’s   Law Dictionary   defines   as   “Written   records   of   a   corporation’s activities and business transactions.” Or it could mean books of account, also known as shop books, which   Black’s   defines as “Records of original entry maintained in the usual course of business by a shopkeeper, trader, or other businessperson.”  13.121   Black’s   doesn’t   offer   a   definition   of   records .   But   for   our purposes, all that matters is that the   Black’s   definitions in the previous paragraph lead with the word   records —books are an example   of   records.   That’s   why   in   the   phrase   books   and records , the word   books   is redundant.  13.122   If   you   want   to   capture   the   narrower,   accounting-related meaning of   books , you could use   accounting records   (the term used in the UK Companies Act 2006) or   financial records . Using   a   narrower   term   might   spare   a   contract   party   an",
  "unpleasant surprise when the other party asks to audit many types of records.  13.123   Some drafters might be inclined to leave the phrase   books and records   as is, because it features in the Delaware General Corporation   Law   (particularly   in   section   220,   which addresses the rights of a shareholder to inspect the “books and records” of the corporation), as well as in other statutes. But the vast majority of contract references to “books and records” are unrelated to use of the phrase in statutes. And even if a statute reference to “books and records” were related to a contract, that’s no reason to parrot the statute’s mushy terminology. If an explicit link to the statute is required, you would be better off saying something like “in accordance with” the statute in question.  BUY, PURCHASE  13.124   The verb   purchase   is used in contracts more often than the verb   buy . Given that simpler words generally are better, why not use   buy   instead of   purchase ? Here’s what that would look like:  Acme hereby   purchases   [read   buys ] the Shares ... .  13.125   But aside from ingrained habit, an obstacle to making this change might be the noun form of   buy :  The buying   of the Shares ... .  13.126   The   gerund   buying   is   awkward.   By   contrast,   the   noun  purchase   doesn’t pose this problem. And the past participle  bought   is more awkward than   purchased .  13.127   References to a fundamental concept in a contract are easier to read if you use related verb and noun forms to express that concept. It follows that the brevity of the verb   buy   is more than offset by the awkwardness of   bought   and the noun form of   buy . Use the verb   purchase . (For a similar analysis regarding the verb   end , see 13.257.)",
  "BYLAWS  13.128   Bylaws   is   spelled   both   with   and   without   a   hyphen.   For example,   Black’s Law Dictionary   gives a definition for   bylaw  but notes that it’s sometimes spelled   by-law .  13.129   It   appears   that   bylaws   is   gaining   the   upper   hand.   For example, the 1915 edition of   Robert’s Rules of Order Revised  uses   by-laws , but the current edition of   Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised   uses   bylaws . And although its predecessor used  by-laws ,   the   Massachusetts   Business   Corporation   Act, effective 2004, uses   bylaws . So use   bylaws .  13.130   But   according   to   Garner’s   Modern   English   Usage , both the spelling and the sense of   bylaw   differ on the two sides of the Atlantic: In [American English],   bylaws   are most commonly a corporation’s administrative provisions that are either attached to the articles of incorporation or kept privately. In [British English],   bylaws   are regulations made by a local authority or corporation, such as a town or a railway. The spelling without the - e - is preferred in [American English]. Though etymologically inferior,   byelaw  (sometimes hyphenated) is common in [British English].  CERTAIN  13.131   In addition to featuring in the archaism   that certain   (see 13.808), the word   certain —meaning “not named or described, though   definite   and   perhaps   known”—is   sometimes   used inappropriately to refer to a subset of a whole. Here’s one example:   certain assets   [read   the assets ]   listed in schedule B . Here’s   another:   Executive   may   provide   certain   services   [read  provide   services ]   to   Acme ,   if   provision   of   those   services   does not ... .",
  "CERTIFY  13.132   The   verb   certify   is   commonplace   in   contracts,   as   in   this sentence:   At the Seller’s request ,   the Customer shall certify in writing to the Seller that the Customer has complied with these requirements.  13.133   But in such contexts,   certify   isn’t the best choice.   Black’s Law Dictionary   gives as a definition of   certify   “To attest as being true or as meeting certain criteria.” That certainly fits, but  certify   implies a level of formality that isn’t necessary in this context—it suggests use of a certificate, which   Black’s Law Dictionary   defines as “A document in which a fact is formally attested.”  13.134   In   the   example   above,   the   Customer   should   be   able   to comply with the obligation in question by sending a one- sentence   letter   stating   that   it   has   done   whatever   was required. That could be expressed by saying   the Customer shall notify the Seller that   ... . And if the agreement has a notices provision   that   says   that   notices   must   be   in   writing,   you wouldn’t need to specify that this particular notice must be in writing.  CHANGE IN CONTROL ,   CHANGE OF CONTROL  13.135   The phrases   change in control   and   change of control   are equally acceptable, and searches on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR system and on Google suggest that they’re used with similar frequency. But to facilitate copying and pasting between contracts, pick one phrase and stick with it.  CLOSING  13.136   Drafters get to make small decisions as well as big ones. One such small decision is whether to use the definite article   the  with the word   closing , as in this example:",
  "... under a contract to take effect on or before [the] Closing.  13.137   Although many drafters would omit   the   from this example, it would be better to retain it. To explain why, this section considers use of the word   closing   in contracts.  Gerundial Noun  13.138   A gerund is a noun formed by taking a verb and adding the suffix - ing . A gerund can act like a noun—in which case it’s known as a gerundial noun—or it can act more like a verb.  13.139   The word   closing   can mean the moment a transaction is consummated. That’s how it’s used in this example:  The financial statements of Company to be prepared after the Agreement Date and prior to the Closing (A) will be true, accurate, and complete in all material respects ... .  13.140   In this context,   Closing   acts like a noun in three respects. First, it begins with the definite article   the . Definite articles usually come before nouns. Second, in this context   Closing  could be modified by an adjective, for example   first , instead of by an adverb. Adjectives usually modify nouns. And third, because   Closing   is a defined term meaning the closing of the transaction contemplated by the agreement in question, the object of   the Closing   in effect is the prepositional phrase   of the transaction   contemplated   by   this   agreement .   The   phrase   is headed by the preposition   of ; prepositional phrases that start with   of   usually follow nouns.  Other Forms  13.141   In the sentence   Closing deals is hard work , the word   closing   is part of the gerund phrase   closing deals . (This use of   closing  isn’t one you would expect to find in contracts.)  13.142   In this context,   closing   refers to a process, not a moment dividing the time before the deal and the time after the deal. As   such,   it   differs   from   the   gerundial-noun   example   in",
  "13.139, in that in this example   closing   acts as verb in two respects. First, in this example,   closing   could be modified by an adverb, for example   quickly , not an adjective. And the object,   deals , comes right after the gerund, just like it would after an ordinary verb, not inside a prepositional phrase like the one starting with   of   in the previous example.  13.143   In contracts,   closing   is also used as a present participle (as in,  if the Qualified Preferred Equity Investment is closing concurrently with the Permitted Direct Assumption ) and as an attributive noun (as in,   the average closing price for a single Share ).  Making the Right Choice  13.144   What   drafters   should   take   away   from   this   is   that   when  closing   is   used   to   mean   the   moment   a   transaction   is consummated, it’s acting as a gerundial noun—use it with the definite article   the . That’s the case with use of   closing   in the example in 13.139.  13.145   Omitting   the   from that example would suggest that   closing   is being   used   as   a   verb   and   refers   to   the   process   of consummating   a   transaction.   That   doesn’t   make   sense.   It would also raise the question, Closing what?  13.146   Omitting   the   in   this   context   makes   the   prose   a   tiny   bit awkward, although it wouldn’t result in confusion. But if you’re the one doing the drafting, you might as well get this use of   closing   right.  COGNIZANT  13.147   Cognizant   is   a   formal   word   meaning   knowledgeable   of something,   especially   through   personal   experience.   It’s sometimes used in contracts, but you can usually dispense with it, as in this example:  The Contributor acknowledges that an investment in the Securities involves substantial risk and the Contributor is   fully cognizant of and understands   [read   aware of ] all of the risk",
  "factors related to the Securities.  13.148   Cognizant   is also used in an inelegant term of art in federal contracting:   cognizant agency . It’s defined by statute, so it’s the   appropriate   term   to   use   if   you   want   to   invoke   the arrangement provided for by statute. But be on the lookout for the phrase   cognizant agency   used inappropriately when the intended meaning is simply   relevant .  COMPETITIVE  13.149   The word   competitive   is routinely misused in contracts. That’s not surprising, given that it’s routinely misused in legal and business writing generally.  13.150   Competitive   means   (1)   “of,   involving,   or   based   on competition” and (2) “likely to succeed in competition.” In the following provision,   competitive   is used to express the first meaning:  The Executive acknowledges the highly   competitive   nature of the Company’s business.  13.151   And in this provision, it’s used, albeit awkwardly, to express the second meaning:  The Customer shall give VEM every opportunity to be included on Approved Vendor Lists for materials and components that VEM can supply, and if VEM is   competitive   with other suppliers with respect to reasonable and unbiased criteria for acceptance established by the Customer, the Customer shall include VEM on those Approved Vendor Lists.  13.152   But   competitive   is also used in contexts where the adjective  competing   or the verb   to compete   would be a better fit:  In this agreement, the term “ Competitive   [read   Competing ]  Business ” means any business that is similar to or   competitive  [read   competes ] with the business of the Company for which Executive has had direct responsibility.",
  "COMPLETE AND ACCURATE  13.153   Generally, you should be able to do without some or all of  complete and accurate .  13.154   For purposes of an obligation to compile data, it’s hard to imagine that data could be accurate without being complete —that, for example, a court might accept the argument that a database containing names of only half of Acme’s customers is   accurate   because   the   information   provided   for   each   of those customers is accurate.  13.155   So you should be able to dispense with   complete :  Excelsior shall maintain   complete and   accurate books of account. The Servicer shall maintain   complete and   accurate records pertaining to each Contract to enable it to comply with this agreement.  13.156   But if possible, dispense with both   accurate   and   complete . For example, instead of saying   Acme shall maintain an accurate database   containing   the   following   customer   information ,   say  Acme shall maintain a database that lists for all customers the following   information .   Inherent   in   that   obligation   is   the requirement that the information be accurate, even if you don’t use the word   accurate .  13.157   Accurate   wouldn’t encompass   complete   in a provision that seeks   to   confirm   that   the   data   in   question   satisfy   some requirement stated in the agreement:  All information that Acme has furnished to Widgetco under section 5 is   complete and accurate .  13.158   But   more   to   the   point,   the   section   5   referred   to   in   the previous example presumably states that Acme must provide Widgetco   with   certain   information.   It   would   be   more economical   to   address   adequacy   of   that   information   by referring to Acme’s compliance with section 5:  Acme has complied with its obligations under section 5.",
  "13.159   When you’re referring to copies of something, you could safely do without both elements of   accurate   and   complete . After all,   copy   means “a full reproduction.” If Acme gives you a photocopy of its certificate of incorporation but omits page 6, Acme would be hard pressed to claim it had given you a copy. If that makes you nervous, it would make more sense to retain   complete   and dispense with   accurate .  13.160   But it would be unproductive to eliminate one element from  complete and accurate   and then find yourself in a fight over whether the remainder is in fact as comprehensive as you think   it   is.   So   first   determine   whether   you   can   dispense entirely with   complete and accurate . If you decide it would be prudent to retain at least one element, consider retaining the entire phrase. Unlike some other redundant synonyms, the only drawback to   complete and accurate   is two superfluous words. That’s a small price to pay for not risking a fight.  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES  13.161   Here’s   a   representative   example   of   a   provision   excluding certain types of damages:  Neither party will be responsible or held liable for any consequential, special, or incidental losses or damages.  13.162   Sellers   routinely   ask   for   such   provisions,   and   buyers routinely accept including them. But many lawyers and their clients have an uncertain grasp of what such provisions are meant to accomplish. As explained in this section, there are better alternatives.  Terminology  13.163   Even   absent   any   limitation,   for   a   nonbreaching   party   to recover damages for losses caused by breach of a contract, generally   those   losses   must   be   a   reasonably   foreseeable consequence   of   the   breach.   Contract   damages   aren’t intended to compensate parties for remote losses.",
  "13.164   Understanding the implications of excluding certain types of damages by reference to that baseline is challenging. The terms of art used are, to varying degrees, difficult to define clearly, given that each term expresses a vague standard and given the inconsistent guidance provided by the wealth of related   caselaw   in   different   jurisdictions.   Here’s   a   rough guide:  13.165   Direct damages . These are damages that one would reasonably expect   to   arise   from   the   breach   in   question,   without considering any special circumstances of the nonbreaching party; also known as “general” damages.  13.166   Incidental damages . These are expenses incurred by a buyer on rejection of nonconforming goods delivered by the seller in breach of contract, or by a seller on wrongful rejection by a buyer of conforming goods delivered by the seller to the buyer.  13.167   Consequential   damages .   These   are   losses   sustained   by   the nonbreaching   party   that   are   attributable   to   any   special circumstances   of   the   nonbreaching   party   that   the   parties knew of when they entered into the contract; in other words, consequential   damages   encompass   all   contractually recoverable damages that are neither direct nor incidental damages; also known as “special” damages.  13.168   It’s clear what consequential damages don’t do: they don’t compensate a buyer for remote or speculative losses, which shouldn’t   even   constitute   losses.   But   many   people   are unaware of that. Here’s what Glenn D. West & Sara G. Duran,  Reassessing   the   “Consequences”   of   Consequential   Damage Waivers in Acquisition Agreements , 63 Business Lawyer 777, 783–84 (2008) [referred to below as   West & Duran ], says on that subject (footnotes omitted): [T]o define “consequential damages” as those losses that are so remote that they were beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into the contract is to define consequential damages as losses for which",
  "the law does not allow recovery in contract, regardless of any provision excluding such damages. Yet, many sellers purport to require waivers of consequential damages because they believe consequential damages relate to losses beyond those that the breaching party would have ordinarily and reasonably foreseen or contemplated. The rules limiting all contractual damages to those that are “natural, probable, and reasonably foreseeable” impose a judicially created “rule of reasonableness” that generally limits the extent to which any damages, including consequential damages, may be awarded for breach of contract. As a result, even in the absence of a contractual waiver of consequential damages, this standard of reasonableness creates limits on the extent of the non-breaching party’s recovery for losses that the breaching party did not otherwise specifically agree to bear.  Problems  13.169   Given that background, excluding certain types of damages can   be   unhelpful   for   five   reasons.   First,   many   of   those seeking   to   exclude   certain   types   of   damages   assume incorrectly   that   otherwise   the   nonbreaching   party   could recover remote damages.  13.170   Second,   the   terms   of   art   used   in   language   excluding consequential   damages   are   ill-understood   and   so   are conducive to dispute.  13.171   Third, it can be arbitrary to exclude certain types of damages recoverable under the contract but not others.  13.172   Fourth, some provisions pile on the exclusions in a way that makes no sense. For example, one product offered in October 2011   by   Rocket   Lawyer,   a   mass-market   seller   of   contract templates, was a confidentiality agreement that included a",
  "provision excluding liability for “direct, indirect, special, or consequential damages.” But “special” and “consequential” are generally treated as synonyms by courts. And if a contract excludes both “direct” and “indirect” damages, that could lead to a fight over whether all damages are excluded or whether   the   contract   is   void.   See   Innovate   Technology Solutions ,   L.P. v. Youngsoft ,   Inc. , 418 S.W.3d 148, 151 (Tex. App. 2013).  13.173   And fifth, if the recipient discloses confidential information other than as provided in a confidentiality agreement, any damages that the disclosing party suffers would likely consist of   consequential   damages,   so   excluding   consequential damages would deprive the disclosing party of a meaningful remedy.  Alternatives  13.174   As   stated   in   West   &   Duran ,   at   781,   “While   sellers   have legitimate concerns over their potential liability for breach ... , there are other means of addressing those concerns without the use of terms that have such uncertain meanings.” Given the   problems   with   conventional   provisions   excluding damages,   drafters   should   consider   instead   addressing   the seller’s concerns directly. Here’s an example:  Neither party will be liable for breach-of-contract damages that the breaching party could not reasonably have foreseen at the time of breach.  13.175   West   &   Duran ,   at   806,   in   effect   endorses   this   approach: “Instead of waiving ‘consequential’ damages, buyers should seek   waivers   of   ‘remote’   or   ‘speculative’   damages.”   This provision simply states what a court would likely conclude anyway, but it serves a purpose, because many sellers don’t understand that a buyer is entitled to only those damages that are foreseeable.",
  "13.176   If that doesn’t satisfy the seller—it wants to exclude some otherwise recoverable damages—you could put an absolute cap on damages as an alternative to engaging in the arbitrary and uncertain exercise of excluding certain types of damages.  13.177   If nevertheless you want to limit certain types of damages, consider that it would be simpler to describe what damages are included rather than those that are excluded. In the case of sale of goods, presumably you would articulate, without using those terms of art, expectancy damages (the value of the thing promised less the value of the thing delivered) and the   difference   between   the   cost   of   cover   (purchase   of substitute goods) and the contract price, with perhaps a cap built in.  13.178   If you also, or instead, want to exclude certain types of damages, it would be best not to use the phrase   consequential damages , given the widespread confusion regarding what it actually means. And from the seller’s perspective, it’s risky to rely on excluding consequential damages, as courts are prone to holding that elements of damages that the seller might have   intended   to   exclude   are   in   fact   direct   rather   than consequential. See, for example, two English cases,   GB Gas Holdings Ltd v. Accenture (UK) Ltd   [2009] EWHC 2734 (Comm) and   McCain   Foods   (GB)   Ltd   v.   Eco-Tec   (Europe)   Ltd   [2011] EWHC 66.  13.179   So   consider   being   specific   about   what   you’re   excluding. Don’t use legal terms of art; instead, refer to whatever types of   damages   are   of   concern.   (But   see   13.181   regarding problems   with   excluding   lost   profits.)   Whatever   types   of damages you include, think through the implications. To get a sense of what that might involve,   West & Duran , at 795– 804, explores two hypothetical situations and the different types of damages involved.  13.180   Finally, a buyer might be more willing to live with a limited range of damages if it’s entitled to liquidated damages.",
  "Lost Profits  13.181   Excluding lost profits can be problematic. For example, in  Biotronik A.G. v. Conor Medsystems Ireland ,   Ltd. , 11 N.E.3d 676 (N.Y. 2014), the court held that the lost profits sought by a distributor constituted general damages (also known as direct damages) that were recoverable under the liability-limiting provision at issue; they weren’t consequential damages. One judge   dissented,   with   two   others   concurring.   See   also  Luminara Worldwide ,   LLC v. Liown Electronics Co. , No. 14-cv- 03103-SRN-FLN, 2017 WL 1064887, at *5 (D. Minn. 27 Feb. 2017) (holding that because of the nature of the transaction, lost   profits   arising   during   the   term   of   the   contract   were properly considered direct damages).  13.182   So even   lost profits , which would seem less slippery than  consequential damages , is still tricky. Here are the implications for the contract drafter:  13.183   If   your   liability-limiting   provision   refers   to   consequential damages and doesn’t mention lost profits, whether a court would   conclude   that   lost   profits   constitute   consequential damages would depend on the context, and different judges might reach different conclusions.  13.184   If your liability-limiting provision says that consequential damages   include   lost   profits,   in   a   dispute   a   court   might decide that the lost profits at issue are general damages and so don’t constitute lost profits that fall within the scope of the liability-limiting provision.  13.185   If   your   liability-limiting   provision   refers   to   lost   profits without   mentioning   consequential   damages,   that   seems arbitrary—it doesn’t reflect that lost profits have different implications in different contexts.  13.186   So disputes over lost profits always have the potential to create confusion, however you address, or don’t address, the issue. That’s one more reason for considering alternatives to the traditional liability-limiting provision.",
  "CONTINUOUSLY ,   CONTINUOUS  13.187   Generally, the word   continuously   is redundant. That’s because unless   you   specify   otherwise,   a   provision   will   apply continuously:  The Company ... shall use reasonable efforts to keep the Registration Statement, with respect to each Holder,  continuously   effective under the Securities Act until the earlier to occur of ... . The Borrower (and each applicable Credit Party) shall ... diligently  and continuously   enforce the material obligations of the ground lessor or other obligor thereunder; ... .  13.188   In some contexts, the fix might be alternative wording:  “Cash Equivalents” means ... (5) shares of any money market mutual fund that (A)   has   [read   keeps ] substantially all of its assets invested   continuously   in the types of investments referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above, ... .  13.189   Another   drawback   with   continuously   is   that   it   could   be understood as suggesting nonstop, every-minute-of-the-day activity.   That   usually   doesn’t   make   sense,   as   in   these examples:  ... then the Issuer will have an additional 90 days to cure that default, on condition that the Issuer diligently and   continuously  pursues that cure; ... . ... the Advisor shall ... supervise   continuously   the investment program of the Trust and the composition of its investment portfolio; ... .  13.190   But one can find examples where circumstances make it appropriate to emphasize that something is nonstop, as in  made available to both parties electronically via a continuously “on”   data   link .   Even   in   this   context,   constant   or,   indeed,  nonstop   would be a better choice.",
  "13.191   The adjective   continuous   shares the same shortcomings as  continuously :  ... including a requirement that the Participant remain  continuously   employed or provide   continuous   services for a specified period of time ... .  13.192   One exception is use of   continuous   in the securities term of art   continuous offering :  On or before the Filing Date, the Company shall prepare and file with the Commission the Initial Registration Statement covering resale of all Registrable Securities for a resale offering to be made on a   continuous   basis.  CONTRACTUAL  13.193   The   adjective   contractual ,   meaning   “of,   pertaining   to,   or secured   by   a   contract,”   is   an   awkward   mouthful.   It’s nevertheless routine to see it in contracts.  13.194   Instead   of,   for   example,   contractual   terms   and   contractual obligations , say   contract terms   and   contract obligations .  13.195   And   rather   than   referring   to   contractual   instruments   or  contractual arrangements , just say   contracts .  COSTS AND EXPENSES  13.196   The couplet   costs and expenses   occurs routinely in contracts, as in the following example:  If an action is instituted to collect this Note, the Company shall pay all   costs and expenses , including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, incurred in connection with that action.  13.197   Black’s   Law   Dictionary   says   that   expense   means   “An expenditure   of   money,   time,   labor,   or   resources   to accomplish a result; esp., a business expenditure chargeable against revenue for a specific period.” By contrast, it defines  costs   more narrowly as “The charges or fees taxed by the",
  "court,   such   as   filing   fees,   jury   fees,   courthouse   fees,   and reporter fees.”  13.198   In other words, costs are a type of expense. The couplet   costs and   expenses   is   analogous,   semantically,   to   trousers   and clothing— you   can do without one of the two elements. Refer instead   to   court   costs ,   other   litigation   costs ,   and   any   other expenses   (or   some   variant),   or   drop   costs   and   use   only  expenses .  COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST  13.199   It’s commonplace for a power of attorney to use the phase  coupled with an interest   to describe the nature of that power. Often   coupled with an interest   is used with   irrevocable , as in  This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable for the term of this agreement and thereafter as long as any of the Obligations remain outstanding .  13.200   It’s likely that many drafters who use   coupled with an interest  don’t know what it means. This section offers an explanation and suggests how to help readers understand what it means.  13.201   According to 3   Am. Jur.   2d   Agency § 56 (2017), “Where the authority or power of an agent is coupled with an interest, it is   not   revocable   by   the   act,   condition,   or   death   of   the principal before the expiration of the interest unless there is some agreement to the contrary between the parties.”  13.202   But “[i]n order for a power to be irrevocable because it is coupled with an interest, the interest must be in the subject matter of the power and not in the proceeds which will arise from the exercise of the power.” 3   Am. Jur.   2d   Agency § 58. For example, in one case the court held that death of the principal terminated the authority of a real-estate agent to sell on commission, because the authority wasn’t a power coupled with an interest in the property on which the power was to operate. See   Crowe v. Trickey ,   204 U.S. 228, 240 (1907). (For further such cases, see M.T. Brunner, Annotation,   What",
  "Constitutes   Power   Coupled   with   Interest   Within   Rule   as   to Termination of Agency , 28 A.L.R.2d 1243 § 2 (1953).)  13.203   In many powers of attorney, the drafter might well have given no thought whether the agent had an interest in the subject matter.  13.204   Furthermore, to determine whether an interest exists that makes a power irrevocable, courts look at the parties’ entire agreement and the circumstances of their relationship. The terminology used by the parties isn’t controlling—just saying that a power is coupled with an interest doesn’t make it so. 3  Am. Jur.   2d   Agency § 58; 28 A.L.R.2d 1243 § 2[c].  13.205   It isn’t a viable alternative simply to say that the power will survive the death of the principal. Unless a power is coupled with   an   interest,   as   a   matter   of   law   it   will   cease   at   the principal’s   death,   even   if   the   power   contains   a   specific provision to the contrary. 3   Am. Jur.   2d   Agency § 49.  13.206   So before saying that a power of attorney is coupled with an interest, ask yourself whether you want the power to last beyond the death or incompetence of the principal. If you don’t, dispense with   coupled with an interest —simply saying that the power is irrevocable would serve your purpose.  13.207   If you do want the power to survive beyond the death or incompetence   of   the   principal,   ask   yourself   whether   the agent has an interest in the subject matter of the power. If the agent does not,   coupled with an interest   likely won’t do you any good.  13.208   If the agent does have an interest in the subject matter of the power, consider making the power of attorney clearer by adding this instead of one of the standard formulas:  [The principal] acknowledges that this power of attorney is coupled with an interest, in that the agent has an interest in [refer to whatever is the subject of the power]. As a result, in addition to any other consequences under law, this power is irrevocable and will survive [the principal’s] death",
  "or incompetence.  13.209   By   adding   explication   to   the   term   of   art,   this   provision makes it clear that whether the power is coupled with an interest is a matter of law rather than something that can be agreed to by the parties. It would also ensure that the parties understand the implications of the power’s being coupled with an interest. This approach is at odds with the principle that you should never say the same thing twice in a contract (see 1.62), but the benefits outweigh that concern.  CURING BREACH Generally  13.210   Contracts   often   allow   parties   to   cure   their   breach   of   an obligation. (UK contracts use the term   remediable breach .) But the concept of curing breach is overused.  13.211   Here’s   an   example   of   a   provision—it’s   an   element   of   a definition of “Seller Default”—that provides for cure:  the Seller breaches any obligation under this agreement and, if that breach is capable of being cured, fails to cure that breach in the 30 days after the Buyer notifies the Seller of that breach, except that if that breach is amenable to cure but not within 30 days and the Seller is using reasonable efforts to cure that breach promptly, that breach will not constitute a Seller Default if the Seller continues to use reasonable efforts to cure it and cures it no later than 90 days after the Buyer notifies the Seller of that breach; ... .  13.212   What does it mean to cure a breach? And when is a breach amendable to cure? Here are three scenarios: Alpha is under an obligation to deliver artwork by 1 May. The artwork is destroyed in a fire while in Alpha’s possession. Bravo is under an obligation not to transfer certain shares. Bravo nevertheless transfers the shares. Bravo buys back the",
  "shares. Charlie is under an obligation to deliver certain equipment by 1 September. Charlie fails to meet that deadline.  13.213   The   first   and   second   scenarios   aren’t   amenable   to   cure, because   the   artwork   was   destroyed   and   the   shares   were transferred—you can’t unbreak an egg. Provisions allowing for cure can explicitly exclude such scenarios by covering only   breaches   capable   of   being   cured.   That’s   what   the example in 13.211 does.  13.214   The third scenario would presumably be amenable to cure— you would give Charlie more time. But it’s not as if curing the default makes things better, in the original sense of the word   cure . Instead, you would simply be changing the rules. More   to   the   point,   the   parties   to   a   contract   commit   to perform. Why give a party across-the-board permission to breach? The example in 13.211 seems particularly indulgent. It’s also relevant that in at least some jurisdictions, the law provides a measure of protection against claims for what constitutes minimal breach. Consider providing for cure only in contexts where it seems appropriate. One such context might   be   payment:   if   Acme   fails   to   make   a   payment, Widgetco might not be risking much by giving Acme a few days to get its act together and make the payment.  Amenable to Cure  13.215   The example in 13.211 uses the phrase   amenable to cure . Breaches are also described using the phrase   capable of being cured , but that seems as awkward as saying that a mountain is capable of being climbed. Use instead   amenable to cure .  DEEM  13.216   In contracts,   deem   means to treat a thing as that which it is not or might not be, or as possessing certain qualities it does",
  "not or might not possess. In other words, it’s used to create a legal fiction.  13.217   In contracts,   deem   is generally used in the passive and almost always with   shall , as in   Any notice shall be deemed to have been received on delivery.   Because no duty is being imposed, it’s inappropriate to use   shall   with   deem —it fails the   has a duty  test (see 3.74) .   Instead,   deem   is used with language of policy. Because   deem   applies to future events, use   deem   with   will   (see 3.307):   Any   notice   will   be   deemed   to   have   been   received   on delivery.  13.218   You could use   deem   in the active rather than passive voice — The   parties   will   deem   any   notice   to   have   been   received   on delivery . But that would be inconsistent with how language of policy works: it operates automatically, without the parties being involved.  13.219   It muddies the waters to use   deem   in a provision that doesn’t establish a legal fiction:  Any violation of the restrictions stated in this section 4.2 by any officer or director of Acme or any investment banker, attorney, or other advisor or representative of Acme will be   deemed to be  a breach by Acme of this section 4.2. The date of exercise will be   deemed to be   the date on which the Company receives notice of exercise.  Making a Release Automatic  13.220   You can make a release automatic by using   deem   instead of language of obligation: instead of saying   If X ,   Acme shall release Widgetco , say   If X ,   Acme will be deemed to have released Widgetco . The release happens automatically, without Acme’s being requiring to do anything.  13.221   Making   a   release   automatic   can   simplify   matters   for   the released party. Consider   Management Strategies ,   Inc. v. Housing Authority of City of New Haven , No. X06 CV 07 5007102 S, 2009   WL   1958170   (Conn.   Super.   Ct.   2   June   2009):   The",
  "plaintiff and the defendant were party to a contract under which   the   plaintiff   had   to   release   the   defendant   from liability. The plaintiff never issued the release, even though the   defendant   had   satisfied   the   conditions.   The   plaintiff objected to the defendant’s motion for summary judgment, claiming   that   because   the   plaintiff   hadn’t   released   the defendant,   the   defendant   wasn’t   entitled   to   summary judgment. Sensibly enough, the court held that the plaintiff couldn’t base its claim on its own failure to issue a release it had   been   required   to   issue   under   the   contract.   From   a drafting perspective, if the release had been automatic, the plaintiff   would   have   been   precluded   from   making   its argument.  13.222   And more generally, making a release automatic would spare the released party having to follow up with the releasing party to obtain a copy of the document effecting the release.  DEFAULT  13.223   Provisions regarding default can be awkward in two respects. This   section   recommends   two   fixes:   First,   in   the   paired defined terms   Default   and   Event of Default , replace   Default  with   Potential Default . And second, instead of describing an event of default as   continuing , consider referring to   cure .  Default or Event of Default  13.224   The phrase   default or event of default   is a fixture of loan agreements   and   other   contracts   for   financial   transactions. Usually   default   and   event of default   are used as defined terms.  Event of Default   is straightforward enough—it’s defined to mean anything a bank wouldn’t want to have happen to its borrowers.  13.225   A   problem   might   not   become   an   event   of   default   until notice has been given or a cure period has run. It’s standard for loan agreements to use for such latent events of default",
  "the defined term   Default , with the following definition, or a variant:  “ Default ” means any event that with notice or passage of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default.  13.226   A default might trigger lesser remedies. For example, the lender might have the right to refuse to make additional advances.  13.227   But a defined term should give the reader some sense of the definition. Considering the defined terms   Default   and   Event of Default   without   consulting   the   definitions,   one   might wonder whether they mean the same thing.  13.228   That’s presumably why instead of   Default   some contracts use the defined term   Potential Event of Default —it   reflects   the definition better. To simplify matters further, shorten   Event of Default   to   Default   and   Potential Event of Default   to   Potential Default .  13.229   Another possible alternative to   Default   is   Incipient Event of Default ,   but   incipient ,   meaning   “beginning   to   develop,” suggests   a   gradual   process   toward   becoming   an   event   of default, whereas something either is or is not an event of default.  Has Occurred and Is Continuing  13.230   A contract might refer to remedies that are triggered by an event   of   default.   It   might   also   make   it   a   condition   to performance   by   one   party   that   an   event   of   default   (and potential   event   of   default)   of   the   other   party   not   have occurred. In the latter context, contracts often use the phrase  has occurred and is continuing :  The obligation of Lenders to make any Loan is subject to the further satisfaction or waiver of each of the following conditions: ... (c) no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default   has occurred and is continuing   as of the date that Loan is made.",
  "13.231   Use of   is   continuing   poses two problems. First, as a matter of semantics,   is   continuing   makes sense regarding a status but not regarding an event. If a lawsuit is pending against Acme, it would be appropriate to say that pendency of that lawsuit “is continuing.” By contrast, it would be odd to say that the fact   that   someone   has   filed   a   lawsuit   against   Acme   “is continuing”—an event happens, then it’s over. To avoid that awkwardness,   phrase   events   of   default   in   terms   of   status rather than events. But that won’t always be possible. For example, if equipment is destroyed, it wouldn’t make sense to describe destruction of that equipment as “continuing.”  13.232   And   second,   if   a   statement   of   fact   is   inaccurate,   it’s inaccurate at signing or closing; it doesn’t make sense to say that   the   inaccuracy   “is   continuing”   (see   3.434).   So   is continuing   doesn’t work with an event of default triggered by an inaccurate statement of fact.  13.233   For conditions to performance, it would make sense to refer to events of default in a way that takes these distinctions into account. In this regard, the notion of curing defaults is more versatile   than   the   phrase   is   continuing :   you   can   refer   to whether something is amenable to cure, whereas there’s no equally convenient way to express that something is capable of continuing. Here’s the extract in 13.230, revised to use  cure :  The obligation of Lenders to make any Loan is subject to the further satisfaction or waiver of each of the following conditions: ... (c) no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default   has occurred and, if it is amenable to cure, has not been cured   as of the date that Loan is made.  13.234   But that formulation leaves open to discussion whether a given event of default is amenable to cure. Regarding   cure  generally, see 13.210.  DIRECTLY",
  "13.235   The word   directly   is used in contracts to say that a party may do   something,   or   is   prohibited   from   doing   something, directly or indirectly. But usually there’s a clearer alternative:  To facilitate redemption of Shares by shareholders   directly   [read  through the Company ] or through dealers ... . ... and are owned by the Company , directly or through   [read   or its ] subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance or claim.  13.236   And   directly   on its own can be redundant. That’s because unless the context suggests otherwise, a direct connection is implicit:  Acme shall pay   directly   to the landlord all rent due under this lease ... . In her capacity as chief executive officer of the Company, Ms. Lopez shall report   directly   to the board of directors. ... to deliver the certificates for the purchased Shares   directly   to that broker or dealer to complete the sale; ... . The Company shall reimburse Maxim   directly   out of the proceeds of the Placement.  13.237   Furthermore, in everyday English   directly   can also connote urgency, as in   In an emergency ,   go directly to the assembly point . To avoid confusion regarding which meaning is intended, use   promptly   or perhaps   immediately   instead of   directly   if you wish to express urgency (see 10.108).  DISCLAIM  13.238   A disclaimer is a renunciation of one’s legal right or claim or a   repudiation   of   another’s   right   or   claim.   And   the   verb  disclaim   has the corresponding meaning.  13.239   But when a party disclaims something (usually warranties), generally a simpler and clearer alternative is available:  The Agent Parties   expressly disclaim liability   [ read   will not be",
  "liable] for errors or omissions in the Communications. The Seller   disclaims   [ read   is not making] any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose in connection with the Buyer’s purchase of units of any Product under this agreement.  13.240   It’s relevant that section 2-316 of the Uniform Commercial Code   refers   to   what’s   required   to   “exclude   or   modify” warranties. It doesn’t use   disclaim   or   disclaimer .  DUE OR TO BECOME DUE  13.241   The phrase   due or to become due   is standard, but it’s also awkwardly archaic. Make it clearer:  ... any payments   due or to become due   [ read   that are then due or that become due] in respect of that Collateral ... .  DULY  13.242   According   to   Black’s   Law   Dictionary ,   duly   is   an   adverb meaning   “In   a   proper   manner;   in   accordance   with   legal requirements.” But usually the verb or verb phrase that   duly  modifies   itself   incorporates   the   notion   of   “in   a   proper manner,” making   duly   redundant.  13.243   Consider this example, which features two sentences, each using   duly :  The execution, delivery, and performance by that party of this agreement have been   duly   and validly authorized by all necessary corporate or similar proceedings (including approval by the board of directors and, if necessary, shareholders). This agreement has been   duly   executed and delivered by that party and constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of that party enforceable against that party in accordance with its terms.  13.244   If something has been authorized, then necessarily it was properly   authorized.   If   the   appropriate   procedures   hadn’t",
  "been   followed,   then   no   authorization   would   have   been granted. Similarly, if, say, an imposter signs on behalf of a party, it follows that the contract won’t have been signed by that party.  13.245   That’s why   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 301, says, regarding   duly   authorized ,   “Because   authorize   denotes   the giving of actual or official power,   duly   (i.e.,   ‘properly’)   is usually   unnecessary.   Likewise,   duly   is   almost   always redundant in phrases such as   duly signed .”  13.246   Here’s another example:  Notices and all other communications provided for in this agreement ... will be deemed to have been   duly   given when delivered or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the respective addresses set forth below: ... .  13.247   The   duly   is   redundant—because   the   provision   specifies what’s required to give notice under the contract, it follows that any notice that complies with those requirements will have been properly given.  13.248   But   duly   can also be used to allude to a broader range of concerns. For example, “An opinion that a company has been   ‘duly   incorporated’   means   that   the   incorporators complied   with   all   requirements   in   effect   at   the   time   of incorporation for the company to be incorporated under the applicable corporation statute and that government officials took the steps required by that statute to bring the company into existence as a corporation.” Scott T. FitzGibbon, Donald W. Glazer & Steven O. Weise,   Glazer & FitzGibbon on Legal Opinions   § 6.2 (3d ed. 2008 & Supp. 2012). Because in this context   duly incorporated   constitutes shorthand for a parcel of issues, the word   incorporated   can’t by itself express the notion of “in a proper manner,” so the word   duly   isn’t redundant.  13.249   The same applies to the phrase   duly organized . Both   duly incorporated   and   duly organized   feature in contracts as well as",
  "in legal opinions.  13.250   So if   duly   occurs in a term of art with broader substantive implications, leave   duly   alone. But outside of those contexts,  duly   is usually redundant.  13.251   As in the first example above,   duly   is often paired with the equally unnecessary   validly . In contracts, redundancy loves company.  DURING ... EMPLOYMENT  13.252   In   Mattel ,   Inc. v. MGA Entertainment ,   Inc. , 616 F.3d 904, 912 (9th Cir. 2010), the court considered the ambiguity inherent in   having   a   provision   in   an   employment   contract   apply during the “employment” of that employee: The phrase “at any time during my employment” is ambiguous. It could easily refer to the entire calendar period Bryant worked for Mattel, including nights and weekends. But it can also be read more narrowly to encompass only those inventions created during work hours (“during my employment”), possibly including lunch and coffee breaks (“at any time”).  13.253   So   instead   of   saying   during   Roe’s   employment ,   be   more specific.  DURING THE TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT  13.254   During the term of this agreement   is usually redundant. The default rule is that contract provisions that address party actions apply only during the term of the contract. So if you use   during the term of this agreement   to modify language of obligation,   discretion,   or   prohibition,   you’re   stating   the obvious. In the interest of concision, you would be better off omitting it:  During the term of this agreement, the   [read   The ] Company shall pay Jones an automobile expense allowance of $1,000 per",
  "month, grossed up for income tax purposes, and shall reimburse Jones for all gasoline and maintenance expenses that he incurs in operating his automobile.  13.255   But if you’re deviating from the default rule,   during the term of this agreement   might be necessary for specifying duration:  During the term of this agreement and for five years thereafter , the Recipient shall not, and shall cause each of its Representatives not to, disclose any Confidential Information except as contemplated in this agreement.  13.256   Some   drafters   use   the   phrase   during   continuance   of   this agreement   instead   of   during   the   term   of   this   agreement .   In general   usage,   the   meanings   of   continuance   include “duration,”   so   the   word   is   apt.   But   it’s   also   awkward. Furthermore, when used as a legal term, its usual meaning is “postponement; the adjournment or deferring of a trial or other   proceeding   until   a   future   date.”   So   don’t   use  continuance   in contracts to convey the meaning “duration.”  END  13.257   The verb   terminate   is used in contracts more often than the verb   end . Given that simpler words are generally better, why not use   end   instead of   terminate ? Here’s what that would look like:  This agreement will   terminate   [read   end ] on 29 October 2019. Acme may   terminate   [read   end ] this agreement if ... .  13.258   But aside from ingrained habit, an obstacle to making this change might be the noun forms of   end :  [ At the end of ] [ At the ending of ] this agreement ... .  13.259   A reader might initially think that   at the end of this agreement  refers to the back of the contract. And the gerund   ending   is awkward. By contrast,   termination   poses no such problem.",
  "13.260   References to a fundamental concept in a contract are easier to read if you use related verb and noun forms to express that concept. So the brevity of the verb   end   is more than offset by the awkwardness of the noun forms of   end . Use the verb  terminate . (For a similar analysis regarding the verb   buy , see 13.124.)  13.261   Regarding   termination   and   expiration , see 13.783.  ESPECIALLY ,   PARTICULARLY ,   IN PARTICULAR  13.262   It’s best not to use the word   especially   in contracts:  If the scope of work of a Work Order changes,   especially   the estimated timelines, then the applicable Work Order may be amended as provided in this section 5.3(a). Executive’s obligations under article 3 and article 4 of this agreement ( especially   those relating to confidentiality, noncompetition, and nonsolicitation) will continue after his employment with the Company is ended, regardless of the nature or reason for his termination. The Sellers acknowledge that disclosure of confidential information to others,   especially   the Company’s existing and potential competitors, would cause substantial harm to the Company.  13.263   The problem with   especially   is that it’s used to indicate that something   is   particularly   important.   Necessarily,   that suggests that everything else is less important. That could effect   how   a   contract   is   interpreted.   The   same   goes   for  particularly   and   in particular .  13.264   If you want to make sure that something falls within the scope of a provision, you could accomplish that in ways that are more neutral than by using   especially ,   particularly , or   in particular —for example, through disciplined use of   including  (see 13.354).",
  "13.265   Drafters also use   especially   to mean “specifically,” as in   a separate   committee   created   especially   for   this   purpose .   Using instead   specifically   would be a better choice.  ETC.  13.266   Etc.   is casual, so it’s unsuited to the limited and stylized world of contract prose. But more to the point,   etc.   is either redundant, in which case you should delete it, or it’s not redundant, in which case it’s potentially hazardous and you should delete it.  13.267   Etc.   is redundant when it’s tacked on to a list of items already identified as examples. We know that the list isn’t exclusive, so the   etc.   adds nothing. An example:  ... tangible property (including computers, laptops, pagers,   etc . ) ... .  13.268   But   in   the   following   examples,   the   items   listed   aren’t examples of a class, so   etc . indicates that the provision applies to more than the items listed:  Tenant acknowledges that portions of the Project may be under construction following Tenant’s occupancy of the Premises, and that such construction may result in levels of noise, dust, obstruction of access,   etc .   that are in excess of that present in a fully constructed project. The Bank shall follow the established procedures and controls to identify exceptions, tolerance breaches,   etc .   and to research and resolve or escalate any pricing inaccuracies; ... .  13.269   Presumably   a   court   would   rely   on   a   judicial   rule   of interpretation to limit any additional items to ones that are comparable to the listed items. But a drafter should be alert to that. Ideally, you would specify a class and nothing else or you would make the list exhaustive. If neither is possible, then use   including   instead (see 13.354).",
  "ET SEQ.  13.270   If a contract refers to a statute, don’t use   et seq . when stating the   first   section   of   the   relevant   enacted   legislation.   Even better, don’t state the section at all—the name of the statute is sufficient.  13.271   Here’s how   Black’s Law Dictionary   defines   et seq .  et seq.   (et   sek )   abbr   [Latin   et sequens   “and the following one,”   et sequentes   (masc.) “and the following ones,” or   et sequentia   (neuter) “and the following ones”] (18c) And those (pages or sections) that follow <11 USCA §§ 101 et seq.>.  13.272   Not only is   et seq . old-fashioned, it also contributes to adding indigestible text—sometimes a lot of it—to a contract. Here’s an example (with   et seq.   in bold and italics to make it stand out, although some drafters like to acknowledge its Latin roots by stating it italics in contracts):  ... including but not limited to any claims under (1) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 621   et seq. , Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e   et seq. , the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101   et seq. , the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2601   et seq. , the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (“WARN”), 29 U.S.C. § 2101   et seq. , the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practices Act, M.G.L. c.151B, § 1   et seq.   (or any equivalent in the State of New York), the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, M.G.L. c.12, §§ 11H and 11I, the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, M.G.L. c.93, § 102 and M.G.L. c.214, § 1C, the Massachusetts Labor and Industries Act, M.G.L. c.149, § 1   et seq. , and the Massachusetts Privacy Act, M.G.L. c.214, § 1B (or any equivalents in the State of New York), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681   et seq.   and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1001   et seq. , all as amended (“ Claims ”).",
  "13.273   Instead   just   say,   for   example,   the   Worker   Adjustment   and Retraining Notification Act , without saying where it’s codified. It’s not as if there are two WARN Acts.  EXECUTE AND DELIVER  13.274   The phrase   execute and deliver   (and   execution and delivery ) is a fixture in contracts, as in   The Borrower shall from time to time execute and deliver to the Bank ,   at the request of the Bank ,   all Financing Statements and other documents that the Bank requests . (Regarding use of   execute   and   deliver   in the concluding clause, see   5.9–.14.)   And   an   opinion   regarding   execution   and delivery is a standard element of legal opinions.  13.275   But it’s not clear what one accomplishes by using   execute  rather   than   sign ,   particularly   as   different   authorities   offer differing definitions of   execute   (see 5.10–.11).  13.276   Deliver   is also problematic. Scott T. FitzGibbon, Donald W. Glazer & Steven O. Weise,   Glazer and FitzGibbon on Legal Opinions   § 9.5 (3d ed. 2008 & Supp. 2012), says as follows: Historically, delivery by one party to an agreement to the other has been effected by its physically handing over a signed counterpart of the agreement to a representative of the other party. Today, transactions often are closed electronically, and, when they are, few, if any, documents are physically delivered. Whatever form delivery takes, an opinion that the company has “duly delivered” the agreement means that the company, having duly authorized and executed the agreement, delivered the agreement in a manner that under applicable law ... had the effect of making the agreement a binding obligation of the company.  13.277   This would suggest that delivery is required for an effective contract. But although one of the requirements of a contract under seal is delivery, that’s not the case with other kinds of contracts.   Here’s   what   1-2   Corbin   on   Contracts   §   2.11",
  "(footnotes omitted) says regarding “informal” contracts, in other words contracts not under seal: All that is necessary to the creation of an informal contract, however, whether reduced to writing or not, is an expression of assent in any form. The writing itself is not necessary, if put in writing, a signature is not necessary. Even if in writing and signed, a delivery is not necessary. It is an expression of assent that is required. Delivery of a writing may be sufficient evidence of such an assent. Words of assent are sufficient, and conduct other than delivery may also be sufficient.  13.278   Given that signing a contract and handing the signed copy to the other party isn’t the only way to indicate assent, in certain contexts it would seem simpler just to refer to entry into the agreement in question:  The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to  execute and deliver   [read   enter into ] this agreement.  13.279   On the other hand, if Acme is under an obligation to enter into a given contract or sign some ancillary document, or if its entry into a given contract constitutes a condition, the surest way to verify that it has performed that obligation, or to verify that the condition has been satisfied, would be to have   Acme   sign   the   contract   or   document   and   deliver   a signed copy. So in that context, it would make sense to refer to   signature   and   delivery.   (Be   prepared   to   have   someone insist on using   execute   rather than   sign .)  FAILS TO  13.280   The phrase   fails to   (and its variants) is standard in contracts, but often it’s used in a context that doesn’t involve failure. And it’s never necessary to invoke failure. So usually it’s best to use   does not   or some other alternative.  13.281   Some examples:",
  "... and CRISPR   fails to   [read   does not ] bring any such action or proceeding with respect to infringement in the Tracr Field within ... . If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or   fails to   [read   does not ] perfect or otherwise loses or waives its right of appraisal ... . ... or inducing others   to fail to   [read   not to ] cooperate ... . The Indemnifying Party will not be relieved of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to that claim   if the Indemnified Party fails to timely deliver   [read   unless the Indemnified Party timely delivers ] the Indemnity Notice ... .  FAITHFULLY  13.282   No point is served in using   faithfully   and comparable adverbs in provisions stating the standard of performance expected of an employee.  13.283   An employment agreement for a high-level employee will usually say that the employee is obligated to perform duties specified by the chief executive officer (or, in the case of the chief executive officer, by the board of directors), is obligated to work full-time, and can be fired for specific transgressions. Beyond that, whether the employee is a success will depend on   the   employee’s   expertise,   judgment,   imagination,   and experience. Unless you come up with quantifiable targets, you can’t capture those intangibles in a contract.  13.284   But drafters can’t resist trying. That’s why they use   faithfully , usually along with comparable adverbs ( diligently ,   competently ,  industriously , and others):  Executive shall devote her best efforts and sufficient business time and attention to the business and affairs of the Company and shall diligently,   faithfully , and competently perform her duties and responsibilities hereunder; ... . During the Employment Term, Executive shall ... (2) use",
  "Executive’s best efforts to perform   faithfully   and efficiently Executive’s duties hereunder ... . Executive shall be a loyal executive and shall at all times  faithfully , industriously, and to the best of his ability, experience, and talents perform all duties required of him ... .  13.285   But it’s unlikely that a court would consider that working hard   but   not   having   that   reflected   in   the   company’s performance   would   constitute   breach   of   a   standard   of performance that uses one or more of those adverbs. And whether an employer can bring a claim against an employee for failing to be faithful in performing their duties would depend on the law of agency, not on whether the word  faithfully   is used in the employee’s contract.  13.286   So instead of the empty gesture of using   faithfully   and the like to express the standard of performance expected of an employee, be as specific as possible regarding an employee’s duties.  FAX  13.287   As between   fax ,   facsimile ,   telefacsimile , and   telecopier , your best   bet   is   fax ,   for   both   the   machine   and   that   which   it transmits.  13.288   Garner’s Modern English Usage   says that   fax   “is now all but universal, in the face of which   facsimile transmission   is an instant archaism—and a trifle pompous at that,” and that   fax  “is now perfectly appropriate even in formal contexts.”  13.289   Telecopier   is a brand name, so don’t use it to refer to all makes of machine. And don’t write   fax   in all capitals—it’s not an acronym.  13.290   The fax machine is heading toward obsolescence, but you can expect that contracts will continue to refer to faxing for a good long while. After all, Telex appears to be all but dead as",
  "a means of communication, but plenty of contracts still refer to giving notice by Telex.  FIXED FEE  13.291   When in a contract you want to specify the amount of a fee to be paid, it’s redundant to use the phrase   flat fee   or   fixed fee :  The Bank shall pay AZ Financial   a fixed fee of   $37,500, plus reimbursable expenses, preparing and delivering the original appraisal report. DigitalGlobe shall pay the Consultant   a fixed fee of   $10,000 per month for up to 15 hours per month of the Consultant’s time.  13.292   Those phrases make sense only if you’re referring generally to a kind of payment, rather than a specific fee:  At the Landlord’s option, the Tenant shall pay that fee as either a fixed fee or an hourly fee that takes into account the time expended by the Landlord’s agents and representatives in supervising the Tenant’s construction.  FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON  13.293   The phrase   for any reason or no reason   is commonly used in employment contracts between a company and an at-will employee. Even though the point of at-will employment is to allow the company to terminate the employee whenever it wants, a company might want to enter into an employment contract with an at-will employee to address matters such as confidentiality,   severance,   and   ownership   of   intellectual property. In such a contract, it would make sense also to address employment status, and language relating to at-will employment   is   routinely   supplemented   to   state   that   the company may terminate the employee “for any reason or no reason.”  13.294   But terminating a contract for no reason doesn’t make sense —when   someone   terminates   a   contract,   there’s   always   a",
  "reason. If Acme fires Roe, it might be because Roe has proved ineffectual;   because   Roe   behaved   inappropriately   at   the Christmas party; because Acme’s chief executive officer wants to hire the chief executive officer’s cousin instead; because Acme’s chief executive officer doesn’t like Roe’s hairstyle.  13.295   Furthermore,   any reason   doesn’t imply that the company must   have   a   good   reason,   so   any   reason   on   its   own   is sufficiently comprehensive.  13.296   In referring to termination for no reason, the drafter might be   attempting   to   avoid   having   to   explain   why   it   had terminated the employee. It would be better to address that issue directly by having the contract state that the company won’t be required to provide an explanation. (A company might in fact be required by law to provide an explanation.)  13.297   Don’t assume that using either or both of   for any reason   and  for no reason   in referring to termination would mean that the employee has in effect waived the benefit of the implied duty of good faith (see 3.225). A more promising approach would be   to   have   the   employee   acknowledge   factors   that   the company wouldn’t be required to consider if it decides to terminate   the   employee.   (For   a   different   example   of   this approach, see 3.248.)  13.298   More generally,   for   any reason or no reason   is used in other kinds of contracts instead of   at its sole discretion   (see 3.224) as a way to attempt, unhelpfully, to circumvent the implied duty of good faith.  13.299   Regarding use of   for any reason or no reason   as an alternative to the phrase   termination for convenience , see 13.805.  FORCE AND EFFECT  13.300   The phrase   force and effect   is widely used in contracts, in   no force and   [or   or ]   effect   and   the same force and effect   but mostly in   full force and effect :",
  "If Doe does not sign and return this agreement by 15 February 2018, the offer of Severance Benefits will be deemed withdrawn and this agreement will be of   no force and effect . ... each of the obligations in the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents is hereby reaffirmed with   the same force and effect   as if each were separately stated herein and made as of the date hereof; ... the obligations of the Borrower under this section 3 will remain in   full force and effect   until ... .  13.301   But   force   is redundant—omit it from the phrase.  13.302   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 370, suggests that “the emphasis gained by   force and effect   may justify use of the phrase, more likely in drafting (contracts and statutes) than in judicial opinions.” But that misconstrues the nature of contract   language—it   doesn’t   aim   to   persuade   anyone   of anything (see 1.57), so that sort of emphasis has no place in a contract.  FORMAL ,   FORMALLY  13.303   In these examples, the world   formal   is redundant:  Unless   formal   pleadings are waived by agreement among the parties and the referee ... . ... without the necessity of commencing a foreclosure action with respect to this Mortgage, making   formal   demand for the Rents, obtaining the appointment of a receiver, or taking any other affirmative action ... . All arbitrators ... must have a   formal   financial/accounting, engineering, or legal education.  13.304   The same goes for the word   formally in these examples :  Lender may conclusively rely on that certificate until   formally  advised by a like certificate of any changes therein. ... under valid contracts of license, sale, or service that have been",
  "formally   awarded to a Borrower ... . ... nothing herein will require the Purchaser, in connection with the receipt of any regulatory approval, to agree to ... litigate or  formally   contest any proceedings relating to any regulatory approval process in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.  13.305   Such uses of   formal   and   formally   are puzzling—they suggest that what matters isn’t just the thing involved or the action taken   but   also   unspecified   procedures.   If   you   have   such procedures in mind, make them explicit.  FORM AND SUBSTANCE  13.306   In   contracts,   the   phrase   form   and   substance   refers   to documents to be delivered, as in   an opinion of counsel in form and substance satisfactory to the Buyer . As with most couplets, it adds nothing more than a rhetorical flourish.  13.307   Form   arguably   relates   solely   to   the   appearance   of   a document. If that’s the case,   form   should be omitted. And if  form   means something more than that, then it would tread on the toes of   substance   and, as such, should be omitted.  13.308   One could say   in substance satisfactory to the Buyer , but why not   omit   in   substance ,   too?   Saying   an   opinion   of   counsel satisfactory   to   the   Buyer   is   sufficiently   all-encompassing. (Regarding   satisfactory   generally, see 13.722.)  13.309   If you want to avoid any preclosing haggling, it would be best to attach the document in question as an exhibit. The contract would say that the document delivered has to be in the form of that exhibit or, if you want to build in some flexibility, in a form substantially similar to that exhibit. But if the document relates to some future transaction the terms of which are as yet unknown, it might not be feasible to attach the document as an exhibit.",
  "FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT  13.310   Don’t use   for the avoidance of doubt .  13.311   Drafters use this phrase to introduce language that ostensibly clarifies the preceding language, usually by indicating that something either falls within or is excluded from the scope of the preceding language.  13.312   But used in that manner,   for the avoidance of doubt   is merely a filler—what follows has to be able to stand on its own, as in this example:  This arbitration agreement applies to all matters relating to this agreement, the RSU Agreement, and the Executive’s employment with the Company, including disputes about the validity, interpretation, or effect of this agreement, or alleged violations of it, any payments due hereunder or thereunder, and all claims arising out of any alleged discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.   For the avoidance of doubt, this   [read   This ] arbitration agreement does not apply to any dispute under the Indemnification Agreement.  13.313   When   for the avoidance of doubt   is used in this manner in a definition, restructure the definition as a single sentence, as in this example:  “Insider Shares” means all shares of Company common stock owned by an Insider immediately before the Company’s   IPO. For the avoidance of doubt, Insider Shares will not include   [read   IPO and excludes ] any IPO Shares purchased by Insiders in connection with or after the Company’s IPO.  13.314   But   for the avoidance of doubt   is sometimes used, unhelpfully, to state the blindingly obvious. The immediately preceding example is an example of that—it might be best to strike the second sentence.  13.315   Sometimes   for the avoidance of doubt   is doubly pointless, in that the language that follows doesn’t refer to something that",
  "comes within or is excluded from the scope of the preceding language:  Nothing in this agreement gives to any Person other than the parties and their successors, the Owner Trustee, any separate trustee or co-trustee appointed under section 6.10 of the Indenture, the Note Insurer, the Swap Counterparty, and the Noteholders any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under this agreement.   For the avoidance of doubt, the  [read   The ] Owner Trustee, the Note Insurer, and the Swap Counterparty are third-party beneficiaries of this agreement and are entitled to the rights and benefits under this agreement and may enforce the provisions of this agreement as if they were a party to it.  13.316   Drafters also use   for the avoidance of doubt   as   an   inferior alternative to having a party acknowledge a fact:  For the avoidance of doubt,   [read   The Seller acknowledges that ] Invest Bank has implemented reasonable policies and procedures, taking into consideration the nature of its business, to ensure that individuals making investment decisions would not violate laws prohibiting trading on the basis of material nonpublic information.  13.317   And   for the avoidance of doubt   is   also   used   as   a   form   of rhetorical emphasis (see 1.58). Just as rhetorical emphasis generally is unhelpful, so is this use of   for the avoidance of doubt :  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing   [read   Nothing ] in this agreement gives Acme any rights to any of Pharmaco’s compounds or methods of compound synthesis, including the Pharmaco Product, the Pharmaco Technology, any Patent Rights owned, licensed, or controlled by Pharmaco, or any Pharmaco Confidential Information. The Executive will be responsible for paying any tax and employee’s national insurance contributions imposed by any taxation authority in respect of any of the payments and benefits",
  "provided under this agreement (other than   for the avoidance of doubt   any tax or employee’s national insurance contributions deducted or withheld by the Company in paying the sums to the Executive).  13.318   But even without the benefit of these examples, it’s clear enough from the awkward buried verb   avoidance   (see 17.7) that   for the avoidance of doubt   is problematic.  13.319   The phrase   for clarity   raises the same issues.  FRAUD AND INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION  13.320   It’s commonplace in mergers-and-acquisitions contracts for claims   of   fraud   or   intentional   misrepresentation   to   be included in exceptions to limits on indemnification. But how does fraud relate to intentional misrepresentation?  13.321   26   Williston on Contracts   § 69:2 (footnotes omitted) defines fraud   as   “a   deception   deliberately   practiced   in   order   to unfairly secure gain or advantage, the hallmarks of which are misrepresentation   and   deceit,   though   affirmative misrepresentation is not required, as concealment or even silence can under certain circumstances constitute fraud.”  13.322   Because   intentional   misrepresentation   would   seem equivalent   to   “misrepresentation   and   deceit,”   intentional misrepresentation   would   seem   to   constitute   fraud.   That much is confirmed by the   Restatement (Second) of Torts   § 526, which   states   that   “misrepresentation   is   fraudulent   if   the maker (a) knows or believes that the matter is not as he represents it to be, (b) does not have the confidence in the accuracy of his representation that he states or implies, or (c)   knows   that   he   does   not   have   the   basis   for   his representation that he states or implies.”  13.323   But given the cases cited in   Williston   to the effect that fraud can   arise   not   only   through   misrepresentation   but   also concealment,   it   would   seem   that   intentional misrepresentation is only one kind of fraud. That suggests",
  "that for contracts, it would be more economical and less confusing simply to refer to fraud and omit any reference to intentional misrepresentation, unless for some reason you wish to convey the narrower meaning.  13.324   On   the   other   hand,   the   elements   of   a   claim   for misrepresentation are different from the elements of a claim for fraud. That might lead a court to treat a reference to fraud not as an umbrella term that covers various kinds of claims but instead as a reference to a kind of claim, one distinct from a claim for intentional misrepresentation. So referring to both fraud and intentional misrepresentation would seem the safer approach.  13.325   But   as   with   terms   of   art   generally   (see   1.7),   the   exact meaning attributed to the terms “fraud” and “intentional misrepresentation” would likely be unclear to many readers. And   that   meaning   would   likely   vary   depending   on   the jurisdiction.  13.326   So rather than using terms of art, it would be clearer to focus on the underlying conduct: an alternative to “any claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation” would be “any claim that the Indemnifying Party intentionally supplied one or more   Indemnified   Parties   with   information   that   the Indemnifying   Party   knew   [or   should   have   known]   was inaccurate   or   any   claim   that   the   Indemnifying   Party intentionally   withheld   information   from   one   or   more Indemnified Parties.”  13.327   This language uses more words, and it’s novel. But a drafter might conclude that that’s a modest price to pay for greater clarity.  FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME  13.328   A picturesque fixture of release language is   from the beginning of time , as in   Jones hereby releases Acme from any claims ...",
  "arising from the beginning of time to the date of this agreement.   A comparable phrase is   from the beginning of the world .  13.329   Besides being quaint, this language is redundant. If you agree to release all claims against Acme, that indeed means all claims, as opposed to just those claims that arose in the past year, or the past century, or some other limited period.  13.330   See 13.398 regarding   until / to the end of time   and   until / to the end of the world .  FULL-TIME  13.331   Using in a contract the adjective   full-time   regarding work is an invitation to uncertainty. See, e.g.,   In re C.P.Y. , 364 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2012) (considering the meaning of a provision in a divorce decree requiring payment of alimony until the ex-wife “returns to work on a full time basis”). It raises three issues:  13.332   First, what is the minimum amount of work, in hours per day and days per week, required for work to be full-time work?  13.333   Second, for how long must that level of work be maintained for that work to be full-time work? One day? One week? More?  13.334   And third, must someone be employed to be engaged in full- time work? What about volunteer work? What if the person is an independent contractor?  13.335   So to avoid confusion, be more specific than   full-time .  GUARANTEE ,   GUARANTY  13.336   Here’s what   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 399, says regarding the difference between   guaranty   and   guarantee , both pertaining to a promise to answer for payment of a debt or performance of a duty on failure of another:",
  "The distinction in [British English] was formerly that  guarantee   is the verb,   guaranty   the noun. Yet   guarantee   is now commonly used as both noun and verb in both [American English] and [British English] ... . In practice,   guarantee , n., is the usual term, seen often, for example, in the context of consumer warranties or other assurances of quality or performance.   Guaranty , by contrast, is now used primarily in financial and banking contexts in the sense “a promise to answer for the debt of another.”   Guaranty   is now rarely seen in nonlegal writing, whether in [British English] or [American English]. Some legal writers prefer   guaranty   in all noun senses.  Guaranty   was formerly used as a verb but is now obsolete as a variant of   guarantee , vb.  13.337   The New Fowler’s Modern English Usage   343 (R. W. Burchfield ed., 3d revised ed. 2004) offers what appears to be a simple rule:  guarantee, guaranty.   ‘Fears of choosing the wrong one of these two forms are natural, but needless. As things now are,   -ee   is never wrong where either is possible’ (Fowler, 1926). The advice is still sound.  13.338   Review   of   a   small   sample   of   contracts   filed   on   the   U.S. Securities   and   Exchange   Commission’s   EDGAR   system suggests that there’s a roughly even split between   guaranty  and   guarantee   used as nouns, but that in a finance context— namely   in   credit   agreements— guaranty   is   indeed   the preferred form of the noun. But even in a finance context  guarantee   is used as a noun roughly a quarter of the time, so if in all contexts you use   guarantee   as both noun and verb, you would   have   plenty   of   company.   And   it   would   have   the advantage of simplicity—to insist on a distinction between the noun forms   guaranty   and   guarantee   is to invite continued confusion.",
  "13.339   So in all circumstances use   guarantee   as a verb and noun.  13.340   Don’t use   guarantee   as a counterpart of   guarantor —in other words, to mean a person to whom a guarantee is given. That’s asking for confusion, given the primary meaning of  guarantee .  GUARANTEE   (THE VERB) AS TERM OF ART  13.341   Here’s how   Black’s Law Dictionary   defines the verb   guarantee :  guarantee,   vb . (18c)   1.   To assume a suretyship obligation; to agree to answer for a debt or default.   2.   To promise that a contract or legal act will be duly carried out.   3.   To give security to.  13.342   When   the   verb   guarantee   is   used   in   a   contract   (and   is followed not by a   that -clause but by a noun, which is usually the case; see 13.346), its complete meaning derives not from the word itself but from the context—in other words, exactly what the party in question is guaranteeing.  13.343   Consider this example:  The New Borrower hereby guarantees payment and performance when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise, of all Obligations.  13.344   If   you   consider   hereby   guarantees   in   isolation,   it   simply conveys the meaning “will be liable for,” as does   indemnifies  (see 13.439). What the New Borrower is liable for is spelled out in the rest of the sentence.  13.345   So the verb   guarantee   is an example of an unnecessary term of art (see 1.11) that could be replaced by a much simpler phrase. Whether that’s feasible is a function of inertia and expediency, not semantics.  GUARANTEES THAT  13.346   Here are two ways to create a guarantee:",
  "Acme   guarantees that   Widgetco will comply with its obligations under this agreement. Acme   guarantees   Widgetco’s compliance with its obligations under this agreement.  13.347   The   first   alternative— guarantees   that —is   seldom   used, perhaps because in everyday English it can express exuberant wishful thinking:   I guarantee that Accrington Stanley will defeat Spennymoor United!   But consider using it to create a guarantee —whereas in the second alternative   guarantees   is followed by an abstract noun ( compliance ),   guarantees that   is followed by a verb, resulting in prose that’s clearer and more concise (see 17.7).  13.348   Guarantees that   is also used in throat-clearing (see 3.25).  HERE - AND   THERE - WORDS  13.349   Use of   here-   words (such as   hereby ,   herein , and   hereof ) and their   there-   counterparts   is   a   hallmark   of   legalese.   One problem is that   here - words cause ambiguity (see 7.23–.24, 7.26). Beyond that,   here - and   there - words add an archaic and legalistic tone to prose.  13.350   So never use   here - words, except for   hereby   in language of performance (see 3.35). For example, instead of   herein , use   in this agreement.   Use   there - words only to avoid awkward or long-winded   repetition,   as   in   “the   first   supplemental indenture dated 25 October 2016 between Acme and Big Bancorp   and   any   amendments   thereto. ”   Even   in   that example,   you   could   say   instead   “any   amendments   to   it ,” although for most drafters that would take some getting used to. (Regarding use of   hereof   in cross-references, see 4.105; regarding   therefor , see 13.817. Regarding a related internal rule of interpretation, see 15.15.)  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ,   ACCORDING TO",
  "13.351   Garner’s Modern English Usage   says that   according to   “means (1)   ‘depending   on’;   (2)   ‘as   explained   or   reported   by   (a person)’; or (3) ‘in accordance with.’” It’s used in contracts to convey the last of these meanings, as in   Any dispute must be resolved by arbitration according to the procedures stated in this section 12.10.  13.352   By   contrast,   in   accordance   with   doesn’t   have   alternative meanings, so it’s preferable to use   in accordance with   rather than   according to   to convey that meaning—that would spare readers   from   having   to   select   from   among   alternative meanings. But don’t use either phrase if   under   would do.  INCLUDING ,   INCLUDES  13.353   It’s standard practice to add   without limitation   or   but   not limited to   after   including , and   without limitation   or   but is not limited to   after   includes . (You also see wordier variants, two being   including without limiting the generality of the foregoing  (see 13.898) and   including without implication of limitation .) But these additions are more trouble than they’re worth, and they   can’t   be   counted   on   to   accomplish   the   intended purpose. What’s required is a more nuanced approach to use of   including   and   includes .  A Source of Uncertainty  13.354   Here’s   how   Black’s   Law   Dictionary   defines   include :   “To contain   as   a   part   of   something.   The   participle   including  typically indicates a partial list <the plaintiff asserted five tort claims,   including   slander   and   libel>.”   In   interpreting contracts   and   statutes,   courts   have   routinely   held   that  including   or   includes   introduces an illustrative list. See, e.g.,  Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co ., 314 U.S. 95, 99–100 (U.S. 1941) (“[T]he term ‘including’ is not one of all-embracing definition, but connotes simply an illustrative application   of   the   general   principle.”).   Texas   has   even",
  "adopted   this   meaning   in   the   context   of   statutory construction. Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 311.005(13).  13.355   But a drafter might ill-advisedly use   including   or   includes   to introduce what could only be an exhaustive list, or might use an overbroad noun before   includes   or   including , so that the list that follows better expresses the intent of the parties.  13.356   That’s   presumably   why   many   courts   have   accepted   that  including   and   includes   can also introduce an exhaustive list, or a list that limits the scope of the preceding general noun or noun   phrase—in   other   words,   that   they   can   convey   a restrictive   meaning.   Some   courts   have   explicitly acknowledged that possibility. See, e.g.,   Muller v. Automobile Club of Southern California , 61 Cal. App. 4th 431, 444 (1998) (noting   that   the   word   includes   “creates   an   ambiguity”). Others do so by saying that   including   or   includes   ordinarily conveys the illustrative meaning, the implication being that a restrictive meaning is possible. See, e.g.,   DIRECTV ,   Inc. v. Crespin , 224 F. App’x 741, 748 (10th Cir. 2007) (referring to “the normal use of ‘include’ as introducing an illustrative— and non-exclusive—list”);   Auer v. Commonwealth , 621 S.E.2d 140, 144 (Va. Ct. App. 2005) (“Generally speaking, the word ‘include’   implies   that   the   provided   list   of   parts   or components is not exhaustive and, thus, not exclusive.”). The “typically” in the   Black’s Law Dictionary   definition (see 13.354) serves the same function.  13.357   Furthermore, courts have been willing to hold that   including  or   includes   is restrictive. See, e.g.,   Frame v. Nehls , 550 N.W.2d 739, 742 (Mich. 1996) (holding that a statute that provides that definition of child custody dispute “includes” two types of proceedings limits child custody disputes to those two types of proceedings).  13.358   Some   courts   have   even   suggested   that   the   restrictive meaning   is   the   principal   or   only   meaning.   See,   e.g.,  Department of Treasury of Indiana v. Muessel , 32 N.E.2d 596, 598   (Ind.   1941)   (stating   that   ordinary   use   of   the   word",
  "including   “is as a term of limitation”);   Application of Central Airlines , 185 P.2d 919 (Okla. 1947) (holding, regarding use of the word   including , that “if the lawmakers had intended the general words to be used in their unrestricted sense they would have made no mention of the particular classes”).  An Unhelpful Fix  13.359   Due to this uncertainty regarding the meaning of   including  and   includes , regrettably it’s now standard practice for drafters to use the phrases   including without limitation   and   including but not limited to   (and their equivalents using   includes ) with the aim of making it clear that the unrestricted meaning applies.  13.360   Caselaw offers a measure of support. See, e.g.,   Jackson v. O’Leary , 689 F. Supp. 846, 849 (N.D. Ill. 1988) (describing “including, but not limited to” as “the classic language of totally   unrestricted   (and   hence   totally   discretionary) standards”);   Coast Oyster Co. v. Perluss , 32 Cal. Rptr. 740, 746 (Ct. App. 1963) (noting use of the phrases “includes, but is not   limited   to”   and   “including,   but   not   limited   to,”   as opposed to “includes,” to make it clear that the intent was to enlarge and not to limit);   Matter of Estate of Meyer , 668 N.E.2d 263, 265 (Ind. Ct. App. 1996) (“If he had intended to use the word ‘including’ as a term of enlargement rather than a term of limitation, [the testator] could have modified ‘including’ with the phrase ‘but not in limitation of the foregoing.’”)  13.361   But there are two problems with using this approach to make it clear that the unrestricted meaning applies.  13.362   First, given that the illustrative meaning of   including   and  includes   is the primary meaning, usually the extra verbiage would   be   redundant.   That’s   presumably   why   Black’s   Law Dictionary   states that   including without limitation   and   including but not limited to   “mean the same thing” as   including . And at least one court has noted this potential for redundancy. See  St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co. v. Lexington Insurance Co. , 78",
  "F.3d   202,   206–07   (5th   Cir.   1996)   (stating   that   the   word “including” “is generally given an expansive reading, even without the additional if not redundant language of ‘without limitation’”). So for drafters, it’s a nuisance to have to tack on the extra verbiage every time you use   including   or   includes , and for the reader it’s annoying to encounter at every turn. Using an internal rule of interpretation (see 15.18) would allow you to eliminate much of the clutter, but in effect you would still be applying by rote extra language that would be redundant in most contexts.  13.363   And   second,   courts   are   willing   to   hold   that   including   or  includes   is restrictive even when so modified, so you can’t assume that the extra verbiage would ensure that a court attributes an illustrative meaning to   including   or   includes .  13.364   For example, in   Shelby County State Bank v. Van Diest Supply Co ., 303 F.3d 832 (7th Cir. 2002), the court disregarded the phrase   but not limited to   in holding that an item falls within the scope of the preceding noun only if it falls within one of the items in the list following   including : [I]t would be bizarre as a commercial matter to claim a lien in everything, and then to describe in detail only a smaller part of that whole. This is not to say that there is no use for descriptive clauses of inclusion, so as to make clear the kind of entities that ought to be included. But if all goods of any kind are to be included, why mention only a few? A court required to give “reasonable and effective meaning to all terms” must shy away from finding that a significant phrase (like the lengthy description of chemicals and fertilizers we have here) is nothing but surplusage. [Citations omitted.]  13.365   And in   Horse Cave State Bank v. Nolin Production Credit Ass’n , 672 S.W.2d 66 (Ky. Ct. App. 1984), the court held that a list following “including but not limited to” limited the scope of the preceding noun phrase: [Appellee’s] description does not merely state that it",
  "covers ‘all farm machinery’ without more. Rather, the description includes the qualifying language ‘including but not limited to tractor, plow, and disc.’ The qualifying language gave appellant and other persons notice that [appellee’s] financing statement was intended to cover any tractor, plow, and disc owned by the debtor as well as all   similar   farm machinery.” [Emphasis added.]  13.366   See also   In re Clark , 910 A.2d 1198, 1200 (N.H. 2006) (“When the legislature uses the phrase ‘including, but not limited to’ in a statute, the application of that statute is limited to the types of items therein particularized.”);   Holy Angels Academy v. Hartford Insurance Group , 487 N.Y.S.2d 1005 (Sup. Ct. 1985) (holding   that   use   of   including   but   not   limited   to   did   not preclude application of the rule of interpretation known as  ejusdem   generis ,   which   has   it   that   general   words,   when combined with specific items or examples, apply only to things of the same kind or class as the specific things).  13.367   That some courts disregard   but not limited to   shouldn’t come as a surprise. A court handling a contract dispute will want to determine   the   meaning   intended   by   the   drafter.   In   the process, it might elect to disregard any language unrelated to that. Given that it’s routine for drafters reflexively to add  without limitation   or   but not limited to   to each instance of  including   (and   without limitation   or   but is not limited to   to each instance   of   includes ),   a   court   could   conclude   that   such phrases are essentially meaningless.  Avoiding Uncertainty  13.368   How to avoid having a court give a restrictive meaning to an  including   or   includes   that you had intended to be illustrative depends,   first,   on   the   nature   of   the   general   word   that precedes   including   or   includes .  13.369   If you’re relying on the general word to convey its everyday meaning, don’t follow it with a list of obvious examples of",
  "that noun or noun phrase—by saying   fruit ,   including oranges ,  lemons ,   and grapefruit , you invite a court to conclude that   fruit  consists of only citrus fruits, and not melons or bananas. Eliminating such lists shouldn’t pose a problem. Everyone knows that oranges, lemons, and grapefruit are fruit.  13.370   Instead, if you’re relying on the general word to convey its everyday meaning, use   includes   or   including   only to make it clear that the preceding noun in fact includes something that otherwise   might   not   fall   within   its   scope— fruit ,   including tomatoes . (Are tomatoes a fruit or a vegetable? Your answer might depend on whether you’re a botanist or a cook.) Doing so leaves little possibility for mischief—because   tomatoes   lurks at the margins of   fruit , a court couldn’t reasonably conclude that   fruit   in   fact   means   only   tomatoes   or   tomato-like produce. (This manual refers to this as using an enlarging item after   including ; see 13.385.)  13.371   You   might   nevertheless   feel   compelled   to   include   as   an example   an   obvious   member   of   the   general   word— fruit ,  including   oranges .   (Perhaps   oranges   play   a   particular important role in a client’s business.) Although it would look rather odd, given that oranges are so obviously fruit, a court might have a hard time restricting the meaning of   fruit   if only a single specific item is named. (For a better way to convey this meaning, see 13.377.) But the more items you add, the greater the risk of a court applying a restrictive meaning to   including   or   includes .  13.372   Instead of relying on the general word that precedes   including  or   includes   to convey its everyday meaning, you might be relying on it to convey a specialized meaning. Perhaps it’s a meaning   that   differs   from   the   everyday   meaning   of   that noun. Or perhaps the noun is a creation of the contract (such as   excluded liabilities ) and so has no everyday meaning. Either way, your best bet would be not to use   including   or   includes , as the meaning of the noun wouldn’t be clear enough for a court to assess whether an illustrative or restrictive meaning of   including   or   includes   had been intended. Instead, provide",
  "an exhaustive list, perhaps in the form of a definition, with the noun constituting the defined term.  13.373   In any event, the first step to avoiding uncertainty over  including   or   includes   is to select your general word with care. The more specific you make it, the less mischief   including   or  includes   can cause. And you might be able to do without them entirely.  Putting the General Word at the End  13.374   You   could   reverse   the   order—instead   of   a   general   word followed by specific items, with   including   as the link, you could have the specific items lead, with the general word bringing up the rear. In other words, instead of   fruit ,   including oranges ,   lemons ,   and grapefruit , you could say   oranges ,   lemons ,  grapefruit ,   and other fruit . But generally, doing so wouldn’t serve any useful purpose.  13.375   That’s   because   if   you   want   fruit   to   include   melons   and bananas, putting the general word last would likely increase the risk of a court holding that   fruit   does not express that meaning. Most courts are willing to apply to a list of items followed by a catchall phrase (as opposed to a general word followed by specific items) the rule of interpretation known as   ejusdem generis .   It   holds   that   when   a   general   word   or phrase follows a list of specifics, the general word or phrase includes only items of the same class as those listed.  13.376   More to the point, it’s best to avoid the uncertainty that comes   with   using   with   a   general   word   a   limited   list   of obvious members of the general word, regardless of where the list is placed in relation to the general word. Such a list can be understood as an invitation to limit the scope of the general word.  13.377   But if the client’s needs leave you with no choice but to include a list of obvious members of the class, putting the general word last can provide a more convenient way to do",
  "so. To block any implication that the specific items limit the general word, you can adjust the general word, as in   oranges ,  lemons ,   grapefruit ,   and other fruit ,   whether or not citrus . If you were trying to convey the same meaning using   including   (see 13.371), a comparable adjustment would be clumsier— citrus and noncitrus fruit ,   including oranges ,   lemons ,   and grapefruit . And if oranges, lemons, and grapefruit loom so large for your client, it’s appropriate to lead with them.  Commentary in Favor of   But Not Limited To  13.378   Bryan   Garner,   the   lexicographer   and   authority   on   legal writing, has been vocal about the merits of supplementing  including .   On   Twitter   and   on   his   blog,   Garner   has recommended that to ensure that   including   isn’t interpreted as introducing an exhaustive list,   including   should be defined to mean   including but not limited to . See Bryan A. Garner (@BryanAGarner),   Twitter   (20   Aug.   2015), https://twitter.com/bryanagarner/status/634425867372879872 Bryan A. Garner,   LawProse Lesson #226: “including but not limited   to” ,   LawProse   Blog   (2   Sept.   2015), http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-226-including-but- not-limited-to/.  13.379   According to Garner, such an internal rule of interpretation would in effect preclude the phrase   fruit ,   including oranges ,  lemons ,   and grapefruit   from   being   interpreted   so   that   fruit  means   only   oranges,   lemons,   and   grapefruit.   Using   the internal principle also allows you to “rigorously avoid the cumbersome   phrasing   each   time   you   want   to   introduce examples.”  13.380   But elsewhere, Garner says that the phrases   including but not limited to ,   including without limitation , and   including without limiting the generality of the foregoing   serve a different function: they’re   “intended   to   defeat   three   canons   of   construction:  expressio unius est exclusion alterius   (‘to express one thing is to exclude   the   other’),   noscitur   a   sociis   (‘it   is   known   by   its",
  "associates’),   and   ejusdem   generis   (‘of   the   same   class   or nature’).”   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 439–40.  13.381   Without considering whether, and how, each of those three judicial rules of interpretation relates to this issue, it’s clear that Garner has in mind avoiding, for example, having the phrase   fruit ,   including   oranges ,   lemons ,   and   grapefruit  interpreted so that   fruit   means only fruit similar to those listed, namely citrus fruit.  13.382   It’s   easy   to   reconcile   Garner’s   conflicting   rationales:   the internal rule of interpretation could logically be intended to preclude attributing any limiting effect to items following  including , whether that limiting effect consists of interpreting those items to be an exhaustive list or requiring the class in question to consist only of items similar to the listed items.  13.383   But   courts   have   been   willing   to   ignore   including   but   not limited to   (see 13.364–.367), so it follows that they would be willing to ignore the related internal principle. In the blog post   mentioned   in   13.378,   Garner   seems   to   reject   this, saying,   “Will   judges   take   such   a   definition   seriously? Generally, yes. I defy anyone to produce a case in which this definition hasn’t worked, so that   including   defined in this way has nevertheless been held to introduce an exhaustive listing.”  13.384   This manual won’t take Garner up on his challenge, as it seems unlikely that a court would deem a list exhaustive even if it’s introduced as not being limited. More relevant are those cases in which courts endorse the notion that a group followed by a list of items introduced by   including but not limited to   is limited to items similar to the listed items. That interpretation   is   less   limiting   than   holding   that   a   list   is exhaustive, but it’s nevertheless limiting, and in a way that drafters   relying   on   including   but   not   limited   to   might   not expect.   So   because   it   ignores   the   real   threat,   Garner’s challenge is too narrow to be meaningful. He offers no reason for this manual to change its recommendation that instead",
  "of adding to   including   and   includes , you use them in a more targeted way.  Related Problematic Usages  13.385   Use of   for example   to introduce a specific list after a general word raises the same issues as does use of   including , except that it wouldn’t work to use an enlarging item (see 13.370) after   for example . In other words, it would be a little odd to say   fruit ,   for   example   tomatoes .   Because   this   manual recommends not using   including   in contracts to list obvious examples of a general word (see 13.369), it follows that it also recommends not using   for example   before a list of items. That applies also to the abbreviated Latinism   e.g.   ( exempli gratia ). But   for example   can introduce illustrative scenarios. It could, for   instance,   be   used   to   introduce   an   example   of   how   a formula might operate.  13.386   The phrase   including with limitation   occurs just often enough to make one wonder whether instead of being a mistake, it’s a misguided attempt to say “consisting of.” Either way, don’t use it.  13.387   A related oddity is   excluding without limitation . It suggests that not only is a specified item being excluded from a class, so is other unspecified stuff. It has the potential to be pointless ( fruit ,   excluding without limitation bicycles ) or perplexing ( fruit ,  excluding   without   limitation   apples ),   but   never   useful.   It features in particularly bloated traditional drafting, so it’s likely that while blundering around in the fog, the drafters never   noticed   that   excluding   without   limitation   makes   no sense.  INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE  13.388   Because the concept of incorporation by reference is often misapplied   in   contracts,   and   because   on   those   occasions when   it   is   used   appropriately   there   are   clearer   ways   of",
  "expressing the concept, don’t use the phrase   incorporated by reference   in a contract.  13.389   Sometimes a contract will provide, in referring to a particular exhibit   or   schedule,   that   the   exhibit   or   schedule   is  incorporated herein by reference.   (A wordier take:   is incorporated by this reference and made a part of this agreement. ) Or it might state,   All of the schedules and exhibits attached to this agreement are   deemed   incorporated   herein   by   reference.   But   if   under   a contract Acme is required to send notices to the stockholders at the addresses in schedule 3.1, that reference is enough to bring   schedule   3.1   within   the   scope   of   the   contract. Incorporation by reference accomplishes nothing.  13.390   Comparable to this usage is stating in one contract that another contract is being incorporated into it when the only reason for so stating is that both contracts represent separate components of one transaction. For example:   This note is entered into in accordance with a pledge and security agreement between   the   Borrower   and   the   Lender   dated   the   date   of   this agreement ,   which pledge and security agreement is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.   The interplay between the constituent components of a transaction would be spelled out   in   the   contracts,   rendering   redundant   the   notion   of incorporation by reference.  13.391   Just because one contract is subject to a provision in another contract   doesn’t   mean   that   the   provision   must   be incorporated by reference:  Recourse to and the liability of any past, present, or future partner of the Borrower is limited as provided in section 9.12 of the Credit Agreement   and the provisions of that section are hereby incorporated by reference .  13.392   And don’t incorporate recitals by reference into the body of the contract (see 2.154).  13.393   But incorporation by reference is appropriate to describe the act of importing into an agreement, without repeating them,",
  "provisions from a separate agreement. For example, if Baker is purchasing assets from Able and reselling them to Charlie, the purchase agreement between Baker and Charlie might incorporate by reference, as if Baker were making them in that agreement, all statements of fact made by Able in the purchase agreement between Able and Baker. But instead of using the jargon   incorporated by reference,   it would be simpler and more concise to describe what is actually happening:  Baker hereby makes to Charlie ,   as if they were in this agreement ,  all statements of fact made by Able to Baker in the Able–Baker Purchase Agreement .   (In   that   regard,   see   the   discussion   of  mutatis mutandis   at 13.546.)  INDEFINITELY ,   PERPETUALLY  13.394   In contracts, the word   indefinitely   is used to convey two different   meanings.   One   meaning   is   “without   limit,”   the implication being that although a limit hasn’t been specified, one could be specified at some point.  Acme may terminate this agreement upon giving 30 days’ notice to Widgetco if Acme discontinues or   indefinitely   suspends development of the Product.  13.395   But   indefinitely   is   also   used   to   convey   the   meaning “perpetually.”   The   word   perpetually   itself   conveys   that meaning   more   clearly,   in   that   there’s   nothing   that   isn’t definite about forever:  During the term of this agreement and   indefinitely   [read  perpetually ] thereafter ... .  13.396   If   the   notion   of   “perpetually,”   however   articulated,   is followed   by   until ,   you   can   dispense   with   the   notion   of “perpetually”:  Participant acknowledges that the Securities must be held  indefinitely   until they are registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available.",
  "13.397   And it doesn’t make sense to perpetually (or forever) release someone.   You   release   someone   once—you   don’t   keep   on releasing them. (Regarding using   irrevocably   in a release, see 3.43.)  13.398   As alternatives to   perpetually ,   forever   has an unfortunate fairy- tale quality to it,   until/to the end of time   and   until / to the end of the world   even more so.  INDEMNIFY  Function  13.399   If a party makes an inaccurate statement of fact in a contract or breaches a contract obligation, the counterparty will have remedies available. In common-law jurisdictions, it can bring a claim for damages under the contract or in tort.  13.400   But   it   might   benefit   contract   parties   to   address   in   their contract how specified claims are to be handled. That’s the function served by indemnification provisions. The potential benefits are described below.  INDEMNIFICATION   CAN   BENEFIT   A   PARTY   BRINGING   A   CLAIM  13.401   Bring In Deep Pockets . A party with limited resources wouldn’t be   a   promising   target   for   a   lawsuit   seeking   common-law remedies.   In   an   indemnification   provision,   a   party   could arrange   for   someone   more   substantial—typically   a   parent company—to be responsible for any liabilities of the other party.  13.402   Recover   for   Disclosed   Liabilities .   If   a   party   has   disclosed   a problem—for   example,   environmental   contamination—the other party couldn’t base a common-law cause of action on that   problem,   given   that   it   had   been   disclosed.   An indemnification   provision   would   allow   the   nondisclosing party to arrange for the disclosing party to compensate it if the disclosed problem causes the nondisclosing party to incur losses or liabilities.",
  "13.403   Recover for External Events or Circumstances . Indemnification provides   one   way   to   allocate   risk   for   occurrence   or nonoccurrence of an event or circumstance that isn’t entirely under the control of the indemnifying party, for example whether a government agency issues a permit.  13.404   Recover for Losses Caused by Nonparties . If Acme incurs losses or liabilities due to a claim by a nonparty that’s related to the subject matter of the contract—for example, purchased assets —but that isn’t due to the counterparty’s having breached an obligation or having made an inaccurate statement of fact, Acme couldn’t bring a claim against the other party to the contract   unless   the   other   party   had   agreed   to   provide indemnification for any such losses or liabilities.  13.405   Ensure Losses Aren’t Covered by a Provision Excluding Certain Types   of   Damages .   Seeking   to   be   indemnified   for   losses incurred due to nonparty claims constitutes a claim under the   contract.   That   would   make   it   difficult   for   the indemnifying   party   to   argue   that   those   losses   constitute consequential   damages   or   some   other   kind   of   excluded damages (see 13.161).  13.406   Recover   Attorneys’   Fees   and   Expenses .   In   litigation   in   the United States seeking common-law remedies, it’s the norm that the plaintiff isn’t entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses.   Indemnification   provisions   could   specify otherwise. (That could also be achieved by a separate contract provision outside of indemnification.)  INDEMNIFICATION   CAN   BENEFIT   A   PARTY   SUBJECT   TO   A   CLAIM  13.407   Can Provide for a Cap . Common-law remedies aren’t subject to   a   cap   on   liability.   In   indemnification   provisions,   the parties can agree to cap indemnification liability.  13.408   Can Provide for Shorter Time Limits . A plaintiff could seek common-law remedies until the statute of limitations expires. In   indemnification   provisions,   the   parties   could   agree   to shorter time limits for bringing claims. (Depending on that",
  "jurisdiction,   that   could   also   be   achieved   by   a   separate contract provision outside of indemnification.)  13.409   Can Provide for a Basket . A plaintiff could bring a common- law claim for a relatively trifling amount. In indemnification provisions, the parties could agree on a minimum that would have to be reached before indemnification kicks in—in other words, a “basket,” whether of the “threshold” or “deductible” variety.  INDEMNIFICATION   ADDS   PREDICTABILITY  13.410   In   indemnification   provisions,   the   parties   can   specify procedures   to   be   followed   if   a   party   brings   a   claim   for indemnification. That makes for greater predictability than simply leaving such matters to litigation. But predictability is assured only if indemnification is the exclusive remedy for such claims.  WHEN   YOU   CAN   DO   WITHOUT   INDEMNIFICATION  13.411   If you’re not worried about gaining access to deeper pockets; if you don’t need to address the consequences of disclosed liabilities; or if your being subject to nonparty claims isn’t a major concern (either because they’re a remote possibility or because any claims would likely be for modest amounts), then indemnification would probably be more trouble than it’s worth. Remedies otherwise available would likely address your needs, so including indemnification provisions in your contract would add a lot of words for little benefit.  13.412   And if your main concern is allowing the prevailing party in a dispute to recover attorneys’ fees (see 13.652), you could address that issue outside of indemnification provisions.  13.413   So before you provide for indemnification in a contract, ask yourself   whether   the   claims   that   might   arise   justify lumbering   the   contract   with   full-blown   indemnification provisions.",
  "WHAT   KINDS   OF   CLAIMS  13.414   The   discussion   above   anticipates   that   indemnification provisions can—but don’t have to—cover claims between the parties as well as nonparty claims against one or other party. Many   practitioners   think   that   indemnification   provisions serve primarily, or exclusively, to address nonparty claims.  13.415   Whatever the historical practice, it’s now unexceptional to have indemnification cover claims between the parties. In fact, it’s standard in mergers-and-acquisitions transactions. And in defining   indemnify ,   Black’s Law Dictionary   refers to reimbursing another for “a loss suffered because of a third party’s or   one’s own   act or default” (emphasis added).  13.416   But if you want indemnification to cover claims between the parties, make that clear in the indemnification provisions themselves or risk getting into a fight over it. For an example of   a   court   holding,   for   debatable   reasons,   that   an indemnification provision covered just nonparty claims, see the   opinion   of   the   Alberta   Supreme   Court,   Appellate Division, in   Mobil Oil Canada Ltd. v. Beta Well Service Ltd.  (1974), 43 D.L.R. (3d) 745 (A.B.C.A.). For an example of a court   holding   that   an   indemnification   provision   covered claims between the parties, see   Hot Rods ,   LLC v. Northrop Grumman Systems Corp. , 242 Cal. App. 4th 1166, 1179 (2015). See also   NevadaCare ,   Inc. v. Department of Human Services , 783 N.W.2d 459, 470 (Iowa 2010), reh’g denied (22 June 2010) (“Currently, there is a split of authority as to whether an indemnification   provision   applies   to   claims   between   the parties to the agreement or only to third-party claims.”).  Say   Shall Indemnify , Not   Hereby Indemnifies  13.417   Black’s Law Dictionary   says that   indemnify   means both “To reimburse (another) for a loss suffered because of a third party’s or one’s own act or default” and “To promise to reimburse (another) for such a loss.” So   indemnify   can be used in   both   language   of   obligation   ( Acme   shall   indemnify",
  "Widgetco )   and   language   of   performance   ( Acme   hereby indemnifies   Widgetco ).   Review   of   an   informal   sample   of contracts filed by public companies on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR system suggests that drafters greatly prefer   indemnify   as language of obligation rather than language of performance.  13.418   Although   both   usages   are   adequate   to   accomplish   the intended purpose, there’s value to uniformity, so hasten the demise of   hereby indemnifies   by using only   shall indemnify . What   doesn’t   make   sense   is   combining   the   two— hereby indemnifies and shall keep indemnified .  Don’t Use   Indemnify and Hold Harmless  13.419   It’s commonplace for drafters to use the phrase   indemnify and hold harmless   (or   save harmless ). Use instead just   indemnify—  it’s clearer and more concise.  MEANING  13.420   Black’s Law Dictionary   treats   indemnify   and   hold harmless   as synonyms. It defines   hold harmless   as follows: “To absolve (another party) from any responsibility for damage or other liability   arising   from   the   transaction;   INDEMNIFY .”   (For   the  Black’s Law Dictionary   definition of   indemnify , see 13.417.)  Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 443–44, collects other dictionary definitions to the same effect, concluding that “The   evidence   is   overwhelming   that   indemnify   and   hold harmless   are perfectly synonymous.”  13.421   Some courts have come to the same conclusion, notably the Delaware   Court   of   Chancery.   In   Majkowski   v.   American Imaging Management ,   LLC , 913 A.2d 572, 588–89 (Del. Ch. 2006),   then-Vice   Chancellor   Strine   suggested   that   many transactional lawyers would be quite surprised to learn that by adding   hold harmless   to   indemnify   they had been creating additional rights. He continued, “As a result of traditional usage,   the   phrase   ‘indemnify   and   hold   harmless’   just",
  "naturally rolls off the tongue (and out of the word processors) of   American   commercial   lawyers.   The   two   terms   almost always go together. Indeed, modern authorities confirm that ‘hold harmless’ has little, if any, different meaning than the word ‘indemnify.’” See also   Paniaguas v. Aldon Companies ,  Inc. ,   No.   2:04-CV-468-PRC,   2006   WL   2788585   (N.D.   Ind. 26 Sept. 2006) (holding that   hold harmless   is synonymous with   indemnify );   Consult Urban Renewal Development Corp. v. T.R. Arnold & Associates ,   Inc. , No. CIV A 06-1684 WJM, 2007 WL 1175742 (D.N.J. 19 Apr. 2007) (same);   In re Marriage of Ginsberg , 750 N.W.2d 520, 522 (Iowa 2008) (same);   Loscher v. Hudson , 182 P.3d 25, 33 (Kan. Ct. App. 2008) (“[A] hold harmless provision in a separation agreement is the same as an indemnity agreement.”).  13.422   But   some   commentators   have   seen   fit   to   endorse   a distinction   between   indemnify   and   hold   harmless .   For example, David Mellinkoff,   Mellinkoff’s Dictionary of American Legal Usage   286 (1992), says that “ hold harmless   is understood to protect another against the risk of loss as well as actual loss.” It goes on to say that   indemnify   is sometimes used as a synonym of   hold harmless , but that   indemnify   can also mean “reimburse for any damage,” a narrower meaning than that of   hold harmless .  13.423   Some courts have done likewise. For example, in   United States v. Contract Management ,   Inc ., 912 F.2d 1045, 1048 (9th Cir. 1990), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals noted in dicta that “the terms ‘indemnify’ and ‘hold harmless’ refer to slightly different legal remedies.” And in   Queen Villas Homeowners Ass’n v. TCB Property Management,   56 Cal. Rptr. 3d 528, 534 (Ct.   App.   2007),   the   court   fabricated   a   distinction—that  indemnify   is an “offensive” right allowing an indemnified party   to   seek   indemnification   whereas   hold   harmless   is   a “defensive” right allowing an indemnified party not to be bothered by the other party’s seeking indemnification itself.  13.424   And in the Canadian case   Stewart Title Guarantee Company v. Zeppieri , [2009] O.J. No. 322 (S.C.J.), the Ontario Superior",
  "Court of Justice held, without providing any support, that “the contractual obligation to save harmless, in my view, is broader   than   that   of   indemnification,”   in   that   someone having the benefit of a   hold harmless   provision “should never have to put his hand in his pocket in respect of a claim” covered by that provision.  ELIMINATING   RISK  13.425   So the redundancy in the phrase   indemnify and hold harmless  is risky, in that a disgruntled contract party might seek to have unintended meaning attributed to   hold harmless . And relying on the rule of interpretation that every word in a contract   is   to   be   given   effect,   a   court   might   decide   that  indemnify   and   hold harmless   express different meanings.  13.426   To stay out of trouble, never use   hold harmless . Using just  indemnify   is no obstacle to saying whatever you want to say.  13.427   The   basic   issue   regarding   the   coverage   provided   by indemnification is whether you’re indemnified just for those losses you’ve paid for, or whether the indemnifying party must also step in when you’ve incurred a liability that you’re being asked to pay. That distinction is what Mellinkoff (see 13.422) and the court in   Stewart Title   (see 13.424) allude to in attributing a broad meaning to   hold harmless . But relying on  hold harmless   to ensure that an indemnified party is covered in   both   contexts   is   to   shirk   a   drafter’s   responsibility   to articulate meaning clearly.  13.428   To ensure that indemnification covers both contexts, impose on Acme the obligation to indemnify Widgetco against both losses and liabilities.   Black’s Law Dictionary   defines   loss   in part as “the disappearance or diminution of value, usu. in an unexpected or relatively unpredictable way,” and it defines  liability   in part as “A financial or pecuniary obligation.” If you   address   both   those   concepts,   Acme   would   be indemnifying Widgetco against both actual loss and risk of",
  "loss. It would be redundant to have Acme also hold Widgetco harmless, whatever that might mean.  13.429   But   instead   of   simply   alluding   to   losses   and   liabilities, indemnification   provisions   should   be   more   explicit.   A defined   term—“Indemnifiable   Losses”   or   some   variant— should be used to specify exactly what losses and liabilities are   covered.   For   example,   including   judgments   as   one element would help make it clear that an indemnified party isn’t   required   to   pay   a   court   judgment   before   having   it covered   by   indemnification.   And   provisions   specifying indemnification   procedures   (see   13.431)   should   address, among other things, payment of litigation expenses.  Don’t Use   Shall Indemnify and Keep Indemnified  13.430   A   variant   of   shall   indemnify   is   shall   indemnify   and   keep indemnified . Don’t use it—it serves no discernable purpose. For a similar hybrid, see 13.418.  Defend   Is Inadequate  13.431   Drafters routinely add   defend   to   indemnify and hold harmless , but that doesn’t begin to address how defense of nonparty claims is to be handled. See, e.g.,   Fillip v. Centerstone Linen Services , LLC, No. CIV.A. 8712-ML, 2014 WL 793123, at *4 (Del.   Ch.   27   Feb.   2014)   (holding   that   “an   obligation   to defend is not the equivalent of an obligation to advance defense costs”). To avoid uncertainty and the possibility of dispute,   address   that   explicitly   in   provisions   governing indemnification procedures. How to do that is beyond the scope of this manual, but one resource is Kenneth A. Adams,  My   Indemnification   Language ,   Adams   on   Contract   Drafting (13   Aug.   2013),   http://www.adamsdrafting.com/my- indemnification-language/.  Prepositions",
  "USE   A   SINGLE   PREPOSITION  13.432   You could use   indemnify   with   for ,   from , or   against . Which you choose depends in part on what follows the preposition.  13.433   Courts   have   relied   on   prepositions   in   holding   that   an indemnification provision doesn’t cover claims between the parties. See   Jacobson v. Crown Zellerbach Corp. , 539 P.2d 641 (Or.   1975)   (holding   that   if   the   parties   had   intended indemnification   to   cover   claims   between   the   parties,   the provision in question would have read “For any claim,” not “From any claim”); see also   Cecil Lawter Real Estate School ,   Inc. v. Town & Country Shopping Center Co. , 694 P.2d 815 (Ariz. Ct. App.   1984)   (citing   Jacobson   in   holding   that   because   the provision in question read “from and against all loss,” it covered only nonparty claims).  13.434   But that sort of mischief happens only when the drafter fails to express key indemnification issues. Address them clearly and your choice of preposition becomes irrelevant.  DON ’ T   USE   MULTIPLE   PREPOSITIONS  13.435   The triplet   for ,   from ,   and against   occurs in indemnification language.   Perhaps   the   three   prepositions   were   originally linked to   indemnify ,   hold harmless ,   and defend   (in whatever order):  The New Operators shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Owners for, from, and against any liability ... .  13.436   That   linking   of   triplets   would   appear   to   owe   as   much rhetorical   grandeur   as   to   semantics.   For   example,   against ,  from ,   and against   would be a legitimate alternative, but it doesn’t have had the same flair as   for ,   from ,   and against .  13.437   That use of   for ,   from ,   and against   was driven by rhetorical appeal rather than substance would explain why nowadays there’s no clear link between a specific verb and a specific preposition.   Instead,   the   number   of   verbs   is   routinely different from the number of prepositions:",
  "... defend, save, indemnify, and hold CIG Financial harmless for, from, and against any and all liabilities ... [ four verbs, three prepositions ] ... hold Seller harmless from and indemnify Seller for, from, and against any and all claims ... [ two verbs, three prepositions ] ... indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party and its affiliates, parent companies, subsidiaries, and their respective directors, officers, and employees, from any and all claims ... [ three verbs, one preposition ]  13.438   This manual recommends using just   indemnify   (see 13.419), thereby rendering multiple prepositions redundant.  Indemnify   as a Term of Art  13.439   Many   contracts   professionals   are   skittish   about   assuming indemnification   obligations,   particularly   in   commercial contracts. The concern is that a claim for indemnification provides the claimant advantages not available to a breach- of-contract claimant.  13.440   More   specifically,   some   courts   and   commentators   believe that   whereas   in   a   breach-of-contract   claim   the   court determines how much to compensate a nonbreaching party for nonperformance by the breaching party, an obligation to indemnify (particularly if unrelated to an underlying breach of a contract) actually constitutes an obligation to pay an amount of money if certain specified events occur and as such isn’t subject to the rule-of-reasonableness standards to which breach-of-contract claims are subject. See Glenn D. West   &   Sara   G.   Duran,   Reassessing   the   “Consequences”   of Consequential Damage Waivers in Acquisition Agreements , 63 Business Lawyer 777, 785–88 (2008).  13.441   It’s not clear how much of an issue this is, and whether it can be drafted around. But the aversion to indemnification is real, and any drafter who encounters it should consider using terminology that’s less loaded than   indemnify . The likeliest",
  "candidate is the formulation   Acme will be liable to Widgetco for . You can make that switch because   indemnify   is a term of art fraught with doctrinal implications that are irrelevant for establishing contract relations (see 1.7).  INDENTURE  13.442   Here’s how   Black’s Law Dictionary   defines   indenture : “A formal written   instrument   made   by   two   or   more   parties   with different interests, traditionally having the edges serrated, or indented, in a zigzag fashion to reduce the possibility of forgery and to distinguish it from a deed poll.”  13.443   Contracts are no longer given serrated edges, but the word  indenture   has survived in the terms   bond indenture ,   debenture indenture , and   trust indenture .  13.444   So   indenture   is simply a synonym of   contract   now used to refer to a limited group of contracts. One could just as well refer to a   bond agreement   or   trust agreement , and such a change would be unobjectionable. All that   indenture   has going for it is tradition. It doesn’t create any problems, but don’t attach any significance to it.  IN OTHER WORDS  13.445   If you use the phrase   in other words   in a contract, you’re acknowledging   that   you   failed   to   state   the   concept   in question clearly enough the first time around. Get it right the first time and you won’t need   in other words .  13.446   The   abbreviated   Latinism   i.e.   ( id   est ,   meaning   that   is )   is roughly equivalent to   in other words , so don’t use   i.e.   or   that is  either. The same goes for   namely   and the archaic   to wit .  INURE  13.447   Obscure wording is often a reliable sign that a provision is expendable. An example of that is use of the word   inure . (The",
  "variant spelling   enure   is popular in Canada.) It means to take effect, to come into use. It features in the phrase   inures to the benefit , which is a fixture in contracts.  13.448   It’s used as a wordy alternative to the verb   benefits . Here’s an example from a credit agreement:  The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries   inures to the benefit of  [read   benefits ] the Borrower ... .  13.449   But apart from this general use of   inures to the benefit , the phrase occurs primarily in two contexts. You find it in the pointless “successors and assigns” provision. See Kenneth A. Adams,   It’s Time to Get Rid of the “Successors and Assigns” Provision , The Advocate, June/July 2013, at 30. It’s also used in trademark license agreements, as well as in other kinds of contracts that include the grant of a trademark license. Here’s an example:  The parties intend that any and all goodwill in the Mark arising from the Licensee’s use of the Fund Names will   inure solely to the benefit   of the Licensor.  13.450   Although some trademark lawyers are convinced that in this context the phrase serves a valuable function, in fact it’s either   redundant   or   an   inferior   alternative   to   directly addressing   the   issue   in   question.   See   Kenneth   A.   Adams, Inures to the Benefit   and Trademark Licensing , 105 Trademark Reporter 944 (2015).  IT BEING UNDERSTOOD  13.451   Don’t   use   it   being   understood .   There’s   always   a   better alternative.  13.452   Usually   it being understood   serves the same function as   for the avoidance of doubt   (see 13.310), in that it introduces language that seeks to clarify or supplement preceding language. The appropriate fix depends on the context. It might involve",
  "deleting   it   being   understood   and   performing   whatever additional   minor   surgery   is   required   to   carve   out   what follows as a separate sentence:  Except to the extent that Advances are deemed to be loans, no Seller has any material outstanding loan to any Person Related to the   Business, it being understood that   [read   Business. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, ] obligations to reimburse employees for relocation, business, travel, entertainment, or similar expenses incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business do not constitute loans.  13.453   In the following example, the entire parenthetical beginning  it being understood   can safely be deleted, because the   If   that begins the sentence is all that’s required to convey discretion.  If the Company maintains employee benefit plans (including pension, profit-sharing, disability, accident, medical, life insurance, and hospitalization plans)   (it being understood that the Company may but shall not be obligated to do so) , the Executive will be entitled to participate therein in accordance with the Company’s regular practices with respect to similarly situated senior executives.  13.454   Sometimes   it   being   understood   is   used   to   insert,   in parentheses, one provision in the middle of another. That makes for a particularly disjointed provision:  If all of the Equity Interests of any Pledgor owned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries are sold to a Person other than a Credit Party in a transaction permitted under the Credit Agreement, then that Pledgor will be released as a Pledgor under this agreement without any further action hereunder ( it being understood   that the sale of all of the Equity Interests in any Person that owns, directly or indirectly, all of the Equity Interests in any Pledgor will be deemed to be a sale of all of the Equity Interests in that Pledgor for purposes of this section), and the Pledgee is authorized and directed to execute and deliver such instruments of release as are reasonably satisfactory to it.",
  "13.455   The phrase   it being understood   can also be used to express the same meaning as   acknowledge   (see 3.436)—that the party in question doesn’t have first-hand knowledge of a fact but instead   is   accepting   as   accurate   that   fact   as   asserted   by another   party.   If   that’s   the   intended   meaning,   then   use  acknowledge , as it’s the simpler and clearer alternative:  If any of the Collateral is in the possession of a warehouseman or bailee, the Borrowing Agent shall promptly notify the Bank and, upon request of the Bank, the Borrowers shall use reasonable efforts to obtain promptly a Collateral Access Agreement , it being understood and agreed, however,   [read.   The Borrower acknowledges ] that failure to obtain a Collateral Access Agreement might (in accordance with clause (c) of the definition of Eligible Inventory) result in decreased availability under the Borrowing Base.  JOINDER  13.456   In lending and corporate transactions,   joinder   has come to mean a document by which someone becomes party to an existing contract:  ... the Company shall cause each such Permitted Subsidiary to become party to the Guaranty by signing a   joinder   to the Guaranty reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders.  13.457   Or you could use   joinder agreement :  ... will become a Holder under this agreement by signing a joinder agreement in which it agrees to become subject to the terms of this agreement.  13.458   This use of   joinder   represents an extension of the original meaning.   ( Black’s   Law   Dictionary   defines   joinder   as   “The uniting of parties or claims in a single lawsuit.”) There’s no reason not to coin a new meaning for a word if it serves a purpose, but it seems unnecessarily legalistic to repurpose an unrelated legal term of art instead of coming up with simpler, clearer terminology.",
  "13.459   An alternative term used to convey the same meaning is  accession agreement . But that too uses borrowed terminology:  Black’s Law Dictionary   defines   accession   in part as “A method by which a country that is not among a treaty’s original signatories becomes a party to it.”  13.460   The contract in question is in effect an   amendment , so it would be simplest to call it that. And the extract in 13.457 could be adjusted to read as follows:  ... will become a Holder under this agreement by signing an amendment to this agreement to that effect.  JOINT AND SEVERAL  13.461   The implications of the phrase   joint and several   are different from   what   the   conventional   wisdom   suggests.   There   are clearer ways to address the related issues.  Theory  13.462   The   concepts   joint   and   several   refer   to   liability,   but   for contracts, authorities refer to such liability as arising out of promises. For example, here’s what 12   Williston on Contracts  § 36:1 (footnotes omitted) says: Copromisors are liable jointly if all of them have promised the entire performance of the contract. The effect of a joint obligation is that each joint promisor is liable for the whole performance jointly assumed ... . ... A several obligation, by contrast, has the effect of creating two separate liabilities on a single contract. Thus, when a several obligation is entered into by two or more parties in one instrument, it is the same as though each has executed separate instruments. Under these circumstances, each party is bound separately for the performance which it promises and is not bound jointly with anyone else.",
  "Finally, a joint and several contract is a contract made by the promisee with each promisor and a joint contract made with all the promisors, so that parties having a joint and several obligation are bound jointly as one party, and also severally as separate parties at the same time.  13.463   Here’s an example of a joint obligation:   A and B shall pay C $100 . And here’s an example of several obligations:   A shall pay C $50 ,   and B shall pay C $50 . You don’t have to use the word   joint   to create joint obligations or the word   several   to create several obligations.  13.464   As regards a joint and several obligation, the   Restatement (Second) of Contracts   § 289 (1981) says, “The standard modern form to create duties which are both joint and several is ‘We jointly and severally promise,’ but any equivalent words will do as well.”  13.465   But making an obligation joint and several doesn’t affect what   can   be   recovered.   Regarding   joint   obligations,   the  Restatement   says, “A and B owe $100 to C jointly, and C obtains a judgment against A and B for $100. Execution may be levied wholly on the property of either A or B, or partially on the property of each.” That wouldn’t change if you made the obligation joint and several.  13.466   Furthermore,   the   Restatement   says,   “A   and   B   severally promise to pay C the same $100. C may obtain separate judgments against each for $100, and may levy execution under   either   judgment   until   $100   is   collected.”   So   C   is covered to the same extent, whether the obligation is joint or several.  Practice  13.467   Transactional lawyers use the terms   joint ,   several , and   joint and several   primarily regarding liability, not obligations. That makes sense—if those terms ultimately relate to liability, why",
  "not couch them in those terms, rather than in terms of obligations?  13.468   But the substantive redundancy inherent in   joint and several  and in   several   is equally manifest when you speak in terms of liability,   with   one   important   exception:   several   liability   is sometimes given a meaning that’s narrower than the usual meaning, in that it’s used, by means of the phrase   several but not joint , to refer to apportioning liability among holders of ownership   interests   in   an   entity   in   proportion   to   their respective   ownership   interests.   But   given   the   broader meaning of   several , it risks confusion to use it also to convey that narrower meaning.  Procedural Implications  13.469   The literature acknowledges the substantive irrelevance of any   distinction   between   joint   and   several :   the   Restatement (Second) of Contracts   § 288 says that “the distinction between ‘joint’   and   ‘several’   duties   is   primarily   remedial   and procedural.”  13.470   The procedural distinction is that if A and B are only jointly liable and not severally liable, failure to join both A and B in a suit for recovery might subject you to dismissal, or at least protracted argument over the issue. If A and B are severally liable, you can proceed against one without the other.  What Should the Drafter Do?  13.471   So the word   joint   is subsumed by   several —if you’re able to go after each obligor separately, you can also go after them all. So nothing is accomplished by using the phrase   joint and several . And one can improve on the archaic   several   (meaning “separate”).  13.472   It   follows   that   although   the   phrase   joint and several   is   a fixture in contracts and is accepted without question by, for",
  "example,   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 493, it’s a mess. Here’s a clearer way to express the concept:  Acme may elect to recover from any one or more Widgetco Entities the full amount of any collective liability of the Widgetco Entities under this agreement, and Acme may bring one or more separate actions against any one or more Widgetco Entities regarding any such liability.  13.473   And instead of using   several   but   not   joint ,   here’s   how   to convey more clearly that liability is to be shared pro rata among holders of ownership interests and that the claimant may proceed against the holders separately:  Acme may recover from each Shareholder a proportion of any collective liability of the Shareholders under this agreement equal to the proportion of all Shares then outstanding represented by the Shares then owned by that Shareholder. Acme may bring one or more separate actions against any one or more Shareholders regarding any such liability.  Relevance of Statutes  13.474   An added wrinkle is that, as noted in the   Restatement (Second) of   Contracts   §   289,   “statutes   in   a   sizable   number   of jurisdictions provide that joint promises have the effect of creating joint and several duties, and statutes in others create a presumption of joint and several duties either in all cases or where   all   promisors   receive   a   benefit   from   the consideration.” So those statutes would allow you to capture the   concept   of   several   without   having   to   articulate   any liability, or any obligation, as several, whether by using that word or otherwise.  13.475   But   drafters   might   not   be   inclined   to   explore   the implications   of   such   statutes.   And   it   can   sometimes   be helpful to make clear to the parties what the law provides. So expressing   the   several   concept   as   proposed   in   13.473 wouldn’t hurt, even if   several   would be read into a contract by statute.",
  "KNOWLEDGE  13.476   This section considers why one would want to qualify a statement   of   fact   to   reflect   a   party’s   knowledge.   It   also contains   the   components   for   creating   a   definition   of  knowledge .  The Function of Knowledge Qualifications  13.477   A party making a statement of fact (known in traditional contract language as a representation, or a warranty, or both; see 3.374) can “qualify” it regarding knowledge:   To the Seller’s knowledge ,   the Seller is not in violation of any Environmental Laws . The effect of such a qualification is that the party making   the   statement   isn’t   claiming   that   it’s   accurate. Instead, the party is stating that it isn’t aware of anything suggesting that the statement is inaccurate.  13.478   A party should consider including a knowledge qualification in a statement of fact if that party is not in a position to determine whether the statement is accurate, usually because the statement refers to matters that might be hidden (such as environmental contamination) or are under the control of others (such as threatened litigation).  13.479   Who bears the risk of unknown problems is a function of risk allocation. The party making the statement would likely argue   that   it   would   be   unfair   to   insist   that   it   make   a statement of fact if it has no way of knowing whether the statement is accurate. By contrast, the other party would likely argue that as between the parties, the party making the statement should bear the risk of the unknown.  13.480   Certain   statements   of   fact—such   as   statements   regarding threatened litigation—almost invariably include a knowledge limitation. Others—such as a company’s statement regarding its capitalization—never do, because they relate to matters over which the party making the statement has control. In the   case   of   yet   others—such   as   statements   regarding violations of environmental laws—there is no fixed practice.",
  "If including a knowledge qualification in a given statement would not be standard practice, getting the other party to accept that qualification might require that the party making the statement either have superior bargaining power or be willing to make concessions elsewhere in the contract.  13.481   In phrasing a knowledge qualification, don’t refer to   the best of   someone’s   knowledge.   For   one   thing,   it   adds   nothing, because   to the best of Acme’s knowledge   means exactly the same thing as   to Acme’s knowledge . In this context, the word  best   adds nothing more than a rhetorical flourish (see 8.21), and using   the best of   could lead a reader to assume incorrectly that it implies an obligation to investigate (see 13.488) or some sort of heightened level of knowledge.  13.482   And   don’t   use   the   couplet   knowledge   and   belief .   It’s   a meaningless   exercise   in   redundancy   (see   1.37)   that   a disgruntled   contract   party   might   seek   to   invest   with meaning.  Defining   Knowledge  13.483   Consider using   knowledge   as a defined term. Doing so would allow you to address two issues that otherwise would be subject to uncertainty: whose knowledge would be relevant and whether those one or more persons are under a duty to investigate.  13.484   If the term is to be used regarding a single party that is a legal   entity,   you   would   use   the   form   of   autonomous definition in [1]. If it is to be used regarding more than one party,   you   would   define   the   term   using   the   form   of autonomous   definition   in   [1a],   which   should   be   revised appropriately if the parties are all individuals or all entities.  [1]   “ Acme’s Knowledge ” refers to what [ specify whose knowledge applies; see   [2]   and its variants ] [ insert level of knowledge; see   [3]   and its variants ]. [1a]   “ Knowledge ” refers, regarding any Person, to (1) what that Person (if that Person is an individual) [ insert level of knowledge; see   [3]   and its",
  "variants ] or (2) what [ specify whose knowledge applies; see   [2]   and its variants ] (if that Person is not an individual) [ insert level of knowledge; see   [3]   and its variants ]. [2]   John Doe [2a]   [Acme’s] [that Person’s] executive officers [(as defined in rule 405 of the Securities Act)] [2b]   [Acme’s] [that Person’s] directors and executive officers [2c]   [Acme’s] [that Person’s] directors, officers, and any other persons having supervisory or management responsibilities regarding [Acme’s] [that Person’s] operations [2d]   directors and officers of [Acme and any Acme Subsidiary] [that Person and any of its Subsidiaries] and any other person having supervisory or management responsibilities regarding the operations of [Acme or any Acme Subsidiary] [that Person or any of its Subsidiaries] [2e]   [Acme’s] [that Person’s] shareholders, directors, officers, and other employees [2f]   the shareholders, directors, officers, and other employees of [Acme and any Acme subsidiary] [that Person and any of its Subsidiaries] [3]   know[s], with no requirement to investigate [3a]   know[s] or should have known, after inquiring with [Acme’s employees] [that Person’s employees] [employees of the Acme Plant] [3b]   know[s] or should have known, after reasonable investigation  13.485   If the party making the statement of fact is an entity and not an   individual,   whose   knowledge   would   be   relevant   for determining   the   accuracy   of   a   statement   containing   a knowledge qualification? The party making the statement would want to limit the number of people whose knowledge would be relevant, whereas the other party would want to specify as broad a group as possible. Example [2] and its variants   demonstrate   some   possibilities,   from   limited   to broader.  13.486   The reference in [2a] to rule 405 would reduce the likelihood of disagreement regarding who is an executive officer, but it",
  "should be used in a contract only if the party benefiting from the knowledge qualification is a U.S. public company.  13.487   A company selling a subsidiary or division would face the question   of   whose   knowledge   is   relevant   for   statements regarding the business being sold. Managers of the business being sold would be the most knowledgeable, but the seller could be concerned that if the managers remain with the business   being   sold,   they   might   be   pressured   into determining   that   they   had,   in   fact,   known   that   a   given statement was inaccurate, or might come to that conclusion themselves in their eagerness to ingratiate themselves with their new employer. So the seller might prefer to omit from the definition of   Knowledge   officers involved in the business being sold, something the buyer would resist.  13.488   In addition to the question of whose knowledge is relevant, a definition   of   Knowledge   should   address   whether   it   means actual knowledge (as [3]) or knowledge after some level of investigation. A more limited alternative to the reasonable- investigation standard stated in [3b] is a standard based on inquiry of a specified group of employees, as in [3a]. Both [3a] and [3b] use   know [ s ]   or should have known   to make it clear that if no investigation takes place, the standard will be one of   constructive   knowledge.   (Avoid,   as   being   unclear, references to   reasonable knowledge .)  Don’t Use   Is Unaware Of  13.489   Consider this example using   is unaware of , followed by a version using   knowledge :  ... the Company   is unaware of   any facts that would form a reasonable basis for any such claim. ... to the Company’s   knowledge , no facts exist that would form a reasonable basis for any such claim.  13.490   It would be reckless to assume that one could create in a contract   a   meaningful   distinction   between   absence   of",
  "knowledge and knowledge of absence. Use   knowledge —it’s widely used, unlike   is unaware of , and the different ways it can be defined make it more versatile.  LATINISMS  13.491   Many   contracts   filed   by   public   companies   on   the   U.S. Securities   and   Exchange   Commission’s   EDGAR   system contain one or more of these words and phrases derived from Latin: ab initio allocatur bona fide contra proferentem de facto de jure de minimis de novo ejusdem generis ex gratia ex parte in personam in rem inter alia (see 13.22) ipso facto mala fides mutatis mutandis (see 13.546) nunc pro tunc pacta sunt servanda",
  "parens patriae pari passu per diem prima facie pro tanto qui tam res judicata sui generis ultra vires  13.492   Some Latinisms have become so ingrained that they can now be accepted as English—for example,   pro rata ,   status quo , and  vice   versa .   Contracts   would   be   clearer   if   all   remaining Latinisms, including those in the above list, were omitted. Instead, express the intended meaning in standard English. (See 13.266 regarding   etc .; see 13.270–.273 regarding   et seq .)  LEGAL FEES   INSTEAD OF   ATTORNEYS’ FEES  13.493   The problem with the phrase   attorneys’ fees   isn’t where to put the apostrophe. (Yes, it’s best to place it after the   s , to spare one getting into fights over whether it refers to fees of just one   attorney.)   Instead,   the   problem   is   the   word   attorney , which   in   the   United   States   is   an   unnecessarily   formal alternative to   lawyer .  13.494   What to use instead? The obvious alternative is   lawyers’ fees , but   legal fees   is preferable—it doesn’t require an apostrophe, it would cover paralegal fees too, and it should be acceptable outside   the   United   States,   regardless   of   how   legal professionals are referred to in a given jurisdiction.  LIKELY",
  "13.495   The word   likely   is used routinely in contracts:   As used herein ,  the term “Disability” means a physical or mental incapacity or disability that has rendered ,   or is likely to render ,   the Executive unable to perform ... .   But   likely   is a slippery word. In certain contexts one can’t avoid using   likely , but you should be aware of the uncertainties.  13.496   First, consider what   likely   isn’t—it isn’t vague. Vague words such   as   promptly   and   material   require   that   you   assess circumstances from the perspective of a reasonable person (see 7.42). By contrast,   likely   is an expression of the degree of probability that something will occur. As such, likelihood isn’t a function of reasonableness.  13.497   But it’s not clear what   likely   means. Here’s what   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 545, says:  likely   has different shades of meaning. Most often it indicates a degree of probability greater than five on a scale of one to ten... . But it may also refer to a degree of possibility that is less than five on that same scale.  13.498   One indication that   likely   doesn’t have a set meaning is how  likely   relates   to   probable ,   a   word   that   exhibits   the   same characteristics. Consider the following: “Although the term ‘likely’ connotes something more than a mere possibility, it also connotes something less than a probability or reasonable certainty.”   State v. Green , 18 Ohio App. 3d 69, 72, 480 N.E.2d 1128, 1132 (1984). “Probable and likely are synonyms.”   Anderson v. Bell , 303 S.W.2d 93, 98 (Mo. 1957).  13.499   If two courts can reach different conclusions regarding how  likely   relates to   probable , that suggests that you can’t rely on any court to have a clear idea what one or the other word means. You could get around that by instead referring to a percentage   probability:   a   physical   or   mental   incapacity   or disability that has rendered ,   or is likely to render   [read   has a",
  "probability of greater than 50% of rendering ],   the Executive unable to perform.  13.500   Even if you assume that it’s clear what   likely   means, a further problem is that although referring to a mathematical degree of   probability   is   appropriate   when   you’re   rolling   dice   or playing cards, it’s hard to see how it would be relevant for contract   provisions.   Arguments   over   likelihood   quickly become meaningless once you move from one or other end of the spectrum of probability into the middle. For example, it’s hard to see how one could have a meaningful debate over whether an event has a 49% or a 51% chance of occurring.  13.501   And don’t say   reasonably likely —nothing is accomplished by adding vagueness to a degree of probability.  LOOK TO  13.502   Consider use of   look to   in these examples:  The Tenant shall   look to   the provider of the Tenant’s insurance for coverage for loss of the Tenant’s use of the Premises and any other related losses or damages incurred by the Tenant during any reconstruction period. ... and those Holders will thereafter be entitled to   look to   the Issuer only as general creditors for payment thereof (unless otherwise provided by law); ... .  13.503   Look to   seems oddly colloquial, but the bigger issue is what’s really at stake. Consider   The Holder shall look to only the Issuer for payment on this note . It’s phrased as language of obligation, but presumably whoever this provision is intended to benefit —let’s assume it’s the issuer’s parent—doesn’t actually care whether the holder looks to anyone for payment. A clearer way to express what underlies this provision would be to use language of policy— Only the Issuer will be liable for payment on this note . But it would be even clearer to say   Parent will not be liable for payment on this note .",
  "13.504   So instead of saying   A shall look to only B for X , consider saying instead   C will not be liable for X . But if the set of C consists of more than one member, consider saying   Only B will be liable for X .  LUMP SUM  13.505   In construction and some other fields, the term   lump sum  can have a specialized meaning. But   lump-sum payment   is also used generally as a clumsy alternative to   single payment . In that case, if a contract specifies when a payment is to be made, the benefits of specifying that the payment should be a   lump-sum   (or   single)   payment   are   marginal.   Consider this example:  No later than 60 days after the Company has Sufficient Funds, it shall pay all Deferred Portions to the Executive [ in a single lump- sum payment ], subject to the usual withholding.  13.506   Given that the company could wait 60 days to pay what it owes   the   executive,   it   wouldn’t   benefit   the   executive   to prevent   the   company   from   paying   the   executive   in installments over the course of the 60 days, in the unlikely event it wished to do so.  13.507   And if a contract specifies the day that a payment is to be made,   no   purpose   would   be   served   by   specifying   that   it should be made in a single payment, unless you wish to protect against the possibility of the payment being made in installments on that one day:  ... the Company shall pay the Executive an additional amount equal to 12 times the monthly rate of the Executive’s Base Salary on the Date of Termination, which amount the Company shall pay   in one lump-sum payment   on the 30th day after the Date of Termination (or the first business day thereafter if the 30th day is not a business day).  MERELY ,   MERE",
  "13.508   The   word   merely   has   a   dismissive   quality   that   makes   it unsuited to contract language.  13.509   Depending on the context, the fix for   merely   in contracts might be simply to delete it or to use   just   or   only   instead:  ... and any advice given by any Purchaser or any of their respective representatives or agents in connection with the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby is   merely   incidental to the Purchasers’ purchase of the Securities. ... as if those limitations applied to the Participant’s entire Vested Interest and not   merely   [read   only to ] amounts contributed under Code Section 401(k).  13.510   And the same applies to the adjective   mere :  ... except that the term “Participate In” does not include   mere  ownership of less than 5% of the stock of a publicly held corporation ... . ... and the Plan constitutes   a mere   [read   only a ] promise by the Company to make benefit payments in the future.  13.511   Regarding use of   mere   and   merely   in referring to categories of contract language, see 3.3.  MONEY—STATING AMOUNTS OF  13.512   Stating amounts of money in a contract raises several issues.  Use Only Digits  13.513   This manual recommends generally using words for numbers up to ten and digits thereafter (see 14.13–.15), but to state amounts of money use only digits: in a contract it would be odd to use a mix of words ( nine dollars ) and digits ( $12 ).  13.514   For the same reason that they use words and digits in stating numbers generally (see 14.1), it’s commonplace for drafters to use words and digits when stating amounts of money:   Acme",
  "shall pay Widgetco One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) . Don’t do that.  Decimal Fractions  13.515   The Chicago Manual of Style , at 9.20, says that when stating amounts of money you should use zeros after a decimal point only when fractional amounts appear in the same context. In other words, say   $2   rather than   $2.00 , unless the provision in question also refers to, for example,   $3.78   and   $12.93 . And it’s redundant to add   and 00/100 dollars   after an even number of dollars.  13.516   If you’re stating less than a whole unit of currency, put a zero   before   the   decimal   point,   as   in   $0.32 .   You   could conceivably say instead   32¢ , but it would be a nuisance to have the convention you use depend on whether the amount is less than a dollar.  13.517   Some countries use a comma rather than a decimal point to express fractional amounts. And whereas in the United States and the United Kingdom a comma is used as a thousands separator,   as   in   1,234,567 ,   other   countries   follow   other conventions.   Pick   the   conventions   you   think   most appropriate and apply them consistently.  Very Large Amounts  13.518   It’s commonplace for drafters to use a mixture of words and digits to express large amounts of money:   $4.4 billion ;   $3 million . This approach can make amounts of money easier to read,   particularly   if   a   provision   includes   several   large amounts. But don’t switch to a mixture of words and digits if other numbers in the same context use all digits. And don’t go beyond two decimal points to express fractional amounts.  13.519   In   the   United   States,   billion   means   1,000,000,000   (one thousand millions), but in Germany and many other non- English-speaking regions,   billion   means one million millions;",
  "the U.S.   trillion   equals the German   billion . Great Britain has been shifting from the German system to the U.S. system. If in   an   international   transaction   confusion   might   arise regarding the meaning of   billion ,   use   only   digits   to   state amounts   of   one   thousand   million   units   or   more   of   the currency in question.  Currencies  13.520   A reference to an amount of money would have to specify the currency. You can accomplish that by using a currency sign or by using the three-letter currency code specified for that   currency   in   ISO   4217,   the   list   established   by   the International Organization for Standardization. For example, the currency sign for the Euro is   € ; the currency code is   EUR . And the currency sign for the Norwegian Kroner is   Kr ; the currency code is   NOK . Which choice is preferable is a matter of custom. Don’t use both a currency sign and a currency code when stating a given amount of money.  13.521   Some currency signs are shared by many currencies, and you can   make   it   clear   which   currency   you’re   referring   to   by supplementing the currency sign. For example, the dollar sign ( $ ) is used for currencies in many countries other than the   United   States,   principally   those   using   currencies denominated   in   dollars   (including   Australia,   Brunei,   and Canada) or pesos (including Argentina, Chile, and Mexico). If a contract between parties from different countries refers to a currency that uses the dollar sign, using a currency code or a suitably modified currency sign, such as   A$   for Australian dollars and   Mex$   for Mexican pesos, would make it clear which currency is being referred to.  13.522   Always   put   a   space   between   the   currency   code   and   the number:   EUR 2,400,000 . If a currency sign consists of one or more letters, put a space between the currency sign (in this case, Swiss francs) and the number:   SFr. 334,583 . But if the currency sign consists of a symbol, don’t use a space, even if",
  "you   add   one   or   more   letters   in   front   of   the   symbol:  C$655,000 .  13.523   In many countries, especially those in the English-speaking world, the practice is to place the currency sign before the amount. In other countries, it’s placed after the amount. Pick the   convention   you   think   most   appropriate   and   apply   it consistently.  13.524   Another way to make it clear what currency is being referred to is to use an autonomous definition such as   “Dollars” and “$”   mean   United   States   dollars   and   “A$”   means   Australian dollars . You would define the word   dollars   only if you use both   words   and   digits   to   express   a   dollar   amount.   This manual recommends that you not do so (see 13.513).  13.525   You could conceivably use an autonomous definition as an excuse not to supplement a multicurrency sign. You could, for example, use a simple dollar sign in referring to Australian dollars   and   use   the   autonomous   definition   “$”   means Australian dollars . But it would be preferable to use   A$   every time you state an amount of money, as that by itself should be enough to inform most readers what currency is being referred to.  MORAL TURPITUDE  13.526   The phrase   moral turpitude   is insufficiently specific (see 7.28), so   don’t   use   it.   This   section   explains   the   nature   of   the problem and suggests an alternative approach.  Background  13.527   Black’s   Law   Dictionary   defines   moral   turpitude   in   part   as “Conduct that is contrary to justice, honesty, or morality.” It also quotes 50   Am. Jur.   2d   Libel and Slander § 165, at 454 (1995): Moral turpitude means, in general, shameful wickedness —so extreme a departure from ordinary standards of",
  "honest, good morals, justice, or ethics as to be shocking to the moral sense of the community. It has also been defined as an act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the private and social duties which one person owes to another, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between people.  13.528   For all its heavy-breathing pomposity, this definition is no more   enlightening   than   the   more   succinct   Black’s   Law Dictionary   definition.  13.529   That explains how in   Marmolejo-Campos v. Gonzales , 503 F.3d 922 (9th Cir. 2007), the court concluded that driving drunk isn’t an act of moral turpitude, but driving drunk without a license is. It also explains why one judge felt the need to offer a lengthy dissenting opinion.  13.530   Despite   its   shortcomings,   the   phrase   moral   turpitude   is   a fixture   in   contracts—such   as   employment   agreements, consulting agreements, and employee benefit plans—where it routinely features as one of the grounds for termination for cause:  the Executive’s admission or conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to, a felony or of any crime involving   moral turpitude , fraud, embezzlement, theft or misrepresentation; ... .  13.531   It   also   serves   other   functions.   For   example,   in   a   loan agreement the lender might require the borrower to state that no person associated with the borrower has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.  13.532   Coming up with an alternative for termination provisions requires   that   one   consider   more   generally   termination provisions that feature   moral turpitude . This manual calls such provisions “termination-for-crime provisions.”  13.533   Termination-for-crime provisions allow a party to terminate if   another   party   has   been   involved   in   a   crime.   But   they feature   several   possible   elements,   each   of   which   can   be",
  "structured   in   different   ways.   Each   element   is   considered below.  What Crime?  13.534   The   crime   triggering   the   right   to   terminate   might   be expressed in one or more of the following ways:  crime   (preferable to the bureaucratic “criminal offense”)  felony   or the equivalent   crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year   (includes murder, rape, kidnapping, grand theft, arson, fraud, and other major crimes; but the term   felony   isn’t recognized in civil-law jurisdictions, most non-U.S. common-law jurisdictions, and even some U.S. states, for example New Jersey, and in those states where it is recognized, its meaning might vary from state to state)  misdemeanor   (more serious misdemeanors include theft, prostitution, public intoxication, simple assault, disorderly conduct, trespass, vandalism; less serious ones involve only fines and no social stigma and include parking and minor traffic offenses, late payment of fees, and building code violations; the term   misdemeanor   poses the same problem as  felony )  Involving What Offense?  13.535   Sometimes the kind of crime is modified by an adjectival phrase providing further information regarding the nature of the offense. This is where   moral turpitude   comes in, along with several other labels that drafters are fond of stringing together: moral turpitude dishonesty deceit misrepresentation",
  "theft fraud embezzlement  13.536   Alternatively, in an employment or similar agreement you could refer to the crime as being   related to the Employee’s employment .  Other Criteria?  13.537   It can help to tack one or more other criteria on to the kind of crime. Here are three examples of carve-outs to crimes that would trigger the right to terminate: a crime for which a fine or other noncustodial penalty is imposed a crime that does not relate to driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence a crime that does not relate to services performed under the agreement  At What Stage?  13.538   At   what   point   in   the   criminal   process   does   the   right   to terminate kick in? Here’s the spectrum, from earlier in the crime to later:  when Doe commits the crime   (but before any proceedings, it wouldn’t be known whether Doe had committed a crime)  when Doe is arrested for the crime   (but only with more serious crimes is the suspect arrested)  when Doe is indicted for the crime   (but only with more serious crimes is the suspect indicted, and in many jurisdictions indictment is not the only way of charging a suspect)  when Doe is charged with the crime   (this would apply to all",
  "crimes)  when Doe is convicted of the crime or pleads guilty or no contest to the crime   (given the often protracted nature of criminal proceedings when anything other than a minor crime is involved, using this standard might, from the terminating party’s perspective, unduly delay the right to terminate)  Which Jurisdiction?  13.539   If you use terminology that might vary by jurisdiction, you would need to refer to a particular jurisdiction, to avoid any argument   about   what,   for   example,   felony   means.   For example, you might say   constituting a felony in the jurisdiction in which the crime is committed .  Doubling Up?  13.540   A drafter might want to refer to two or more kinds of crime in a termination-for-crime provision. For example, the right to   terminate   could   arise   on   conviction   of   a   felony   or conviction of a crime involving dishonesty.  13.541   One   could   complicate   matters   further   by   referring   to   a different   procedural   posture   for   each   crime—for   example, conviction for a felony and indictment for a felony involving dishonesty or fraud.  Recommendation  13.542   One could cobble together a truly complicated termination- for-crime   provision   out   of   the   above   parameters.   Keep   it simple,   unless   you   have   a   good   reason   to   make   it   more complicated. Here’s a reasonable pro-employer termination- for-crime provision to use in an employment agreement (but see 11.81 for an issue regarding how it’s worded):  ... the Employee is charged with a crime that (1) is punishable by a custodial penalty, instead of or in addition to a fine or other noncustodial penalty, or (2) is related to the Employee’s",
  "employment; ... .  13.543   For the reasons noted above, it would be best to avoid formal labels in referring to the kind of crime. And if the offense doesn’t merit jail time, it shouldn’t be of undue concern, unless the conduct relates directly to the employee’s job. Furthermore, a company wouldn’t want to be compelled to keep someone as an employee until they had been convicted or pleaded guilty. It’s possible that the charges might be dismissed, but that eventuality could be addressed elsewhere in the contract.  13.544   An   employment   agreement   might   also   include   a   broader provision allowing the company to terminate if the employee engages   in   conduct   that   the   employee   knew,   or   that   a reasonable person in the position of the employee would have known, would have or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business or reputation of the company or any of its directors, officers, employees, or affiliates.  13.545   But whatever language you use, omit   moral turpitude .  MUTATIS MUTANDIS  13.546   When a drafter incorporates into a contract, by reference, provisions   from   a   separate   agreement   (see   13.393),   it’s sometimes necessary to adjust those provisions to reflect that, for example, the parties to one contract are different from the parties   to   the   other   contract.   Such   adjustments   can   be explicit:  The terms of the Master Lease are hereby made part of this agreement, as if they were in this agreement, except that (1) each reference to “Lease” will be deemed a reference to “Sublease” and (2) each reference to “Landlord” and “Tenant” will be deemed a reference to “Sublandlord” and “Subtenant,” respectively.",
  "13.547   But sometimes incorporating by reference can require, in addition   to   any   explicit   major   adjustments,   minor adjustments   to   individual   provisions.   For   example,   if   a guarantor, a Delaware limited-liability company, is required to   make   in   a   guaranty   the   statements   of   fact   that   the borrower, a New York corporation, is making in a credit agreement, the statements of fact regarding organization and authority   would   have   to   be   adjusted   to   reflect,   at   a minimum, the difference in jurisdiction and form of entity. Since   it   would   be   time-consuming   to   note   each   such adjustment, it’s conventional to accomplish this instead in one   fell   swoop   with   the   Latin   phrase   mutatis   mutandis , meaning literally “with those things having been changed that need to be changed”:  Each Guarantor hereby makes to the Lender, as if they were in this agreement,   mutatis mutandis , each of the statements of fact made by the Borrower in the Loan Agreement.  13.548   But a phrase such as   together with any necessary conforming changes   would   convey   the   same   meaning   more   clearly. Generally, it’s best to keep contracts free of Latinisms (see 13.492).  MUTUAL ,   MUTUALLY  13.549   In   contracts   as   in   general   usage,   the   words   mutual   and  mutually   are prone to misuse.  13.550   The principal meaning of the adjective   mutual   is “reciprocal” or “directed by each toward the other or others,” as in   Their relationship was characterized by   mutual mistrust.   When in a contract   mutual   is used to convey this meaning, it often modifies   agreement , as in “ Product” means any product whose promotion and detailing is assigned to Acme by mutual agreement with   Pharmaco.   In   this   context   mutual   is   redundant,   as reciprocity is inherent in the notion of agreement.",
  "13.551   Also commonplace are references to   mutual consent , as in  This agreement may be amended at any time by mutual consent of the   parties .   It   would   be   preferable   to   use   by   the   mutual exchange of written consents , but better yet would be simply stating that to be effective, an amendment must be in writing and signed by both parties (see 3.467).  13.552   Another meaning of   mutual   is “pertaining to both parties.” Stating in a set of recitals that the parties want to take a given action   for their mutual benefit   is an example of appropriate use of   mutual —a wordy alternative would be   for the benefit of each of them.   Combining the two, as in   for the mutual benefit of each of them , would result in redundancy.  13.553   Like   mutual ,   the   adverb   mutually   can   be   used   to   convey reciprocity. Here’s an example of appropriate use of   mutually  in a contract to express that meaning:   Merger Sub and the Company   shall   issue   mutually   acceptable   press   releases announcing the signing of this agreement.  13.554   Often   mutually   is used with the verb   agree , as in   such other date as the parties mutually agree . It is also used to modify the adjective   agreeable , as in   Any public announcement must be in a form mutually agreeable to the Company and Parent . In both cases,   mutually   is redundant, for the same reason that   mutual  is superfluous in   mutual agreement   (see 13.550).  13.555   Mutually   is sometimes mistakenly used instead of   jointly , as in   a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm mutually   [read   jointly ]   selected   by   the   Stockholders’ Representatives and Acme .  NEGLIGENCE ,   GROSS NEGLIGENCE  13.556   The way   negligence ,   gross negligence , and related terminology is used in contracts is confusing. This section explains why and offers recommendations.  How the Terms Are Used",
  "13.557   The terms   negligence   and   gross negligence   appear frequently in contracts. They’re used in two ways.  13.558   First, provisions featuring gross negligence or featuring both negligence and gross negligence can be used as a sword—to terminate a contract, as grounds for being indemnified by the other party, or to circumvent a waiver of liability or cap on indemnification benefiting the other party.  13.559   And second, such provisions can be used as a shield—in a provision   releasing   a   party   from   liability   for   its   own negligence or for its own negligence and gross negligence.  13.560   Courts in many jurisdictions have held that advance releases of liability in cases of gross negligence are unenforceable as against public policy. See, e.g.,   City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court ,   161   P.3d   1095   (Cal.   2007)   (California);   Sommer   v. Federal   Signal   Corp. ,   79   N.Y.2d   540   (1992)   (New   York). Releases of liability that use a negligence standard, as well as the   other   kinds   of   provisions   (whether   featuring   just negligence   or   both   negligence   and   gross   negligence),   are presumably enforceable.  Confused Terminology  13.561   In   general   usage,   negligence   means   “carelessness.”   But   it’s likely a court interpreting a contract provision that uses the term   negligence   will   treat   it   as   referring   to   the   tort   of negligence, which is grounded in, to use the   Black’s Law Dictionary   definition, “The failure to exercise the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in a similar situation.”  13.562   Gross negligence   is a tort term of art. Like   negligence , it’s vague, so determining whether a party’s conduct has been negligent or grossly negligent depends on the circumstances (see 7.42). But beyond that,   gross negligence   has no settled meaning.  13.563   For example, in   Sommer , 79 N.Y.2d at 554, the New York Court of Appeals held that gross negligence must “smack of",
  "intentional wrongdoing” and that it is conduct that “evinces a reckless indifference to the rights of others.” By contrast, in  City   of   Santa   Barbara ,   161   P.3d   at   1099,   the   California Supreme   Court,   quoting   a   1941   case,   held   that   gross negligence “long has been defined in California and other jurisdictions   as   either   a   ‘want   of   even   scant   care’   or   ‘an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of conduct.’”  13.564   The   Sommer   and   City of Santa Barbara   standards might seem broadly compatible, but in   City of Santa Barbara , 161 P.3d at 1099 n.4, the court said, “By contrast, ‘wanton’ or ‘reckless’ misconduct (or ‘willful and wanton negligence’) describes conduct by a person who may have no intent to cause harm, but who intentionally performs an act so unreasonable and dangerous that he or she knows or should know it is highly probable that harm will result.” Because the   Sommer   standard invokes recklessness, the   Sommer   standard seems to require greater   misconduct   than   does   the   City   of   Santa   Barbara  standard. So courts from two states have given a different meaning to the term   gross negligence .  13.565   Considering the caselaw more generally,   gross negligence   “is a nebulous   term   that   is   defined   in   a   multitude   of   ways, depending on the legal context and the jurisdiction.” 57A  Am. Jur. 2d   Negligence § 227 (2017). Consistent with the distinction between the   Sommer   and   City of Santa Barbara  definitions,   some   jurisdictions   distinguish   between   gross negligence and willful, wanton, or reckless conduct, whereas other jurisdictions treat those terms as being the same or substantially the same. See 57A   Am. Jur. 2d   Negligence § 231, § 232.  13.566   Confusing matters still further is the notion that “the word  wanton   usually denotes a greater degree of culpability than  reckless .”   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 936.  13.567   This chaos is in part the result of attempts by courts to demarcate distinct levels of misconduct on what is a slippery slope   of   vagueness,   with   differences   measured   in   degrees",
  "rather than absolutes (see 7.50).   One   gets   the   sense   that courts resort to an affected vocabulary, such as “smack of” ( Sommer ) and “scant” ( City   of   Santa   Barbara ),   to   help   cut through that slipperiness, but to no avail.  13.568   Given   this   state   of   affairs,   it’s   not   surprising   that   many jurisdictions,   among   them   Pennsylvania,   don’t   recognize degrees of negligence. “The view taken is that negligence, whatever epithet is given to characterize it, is the failure to exercise the care and skill which the situation demands, and that it is more accurate to call it simply ‘negligence’ than to attempt expressions of degrees of negligence.” 57A   Am. Jur. 2d   Negligence § 219.  13.569   The   law   of   a   non-U.S.   jurisdiction   might   recognize negligence and—less likely—gross negligence, or it might use a different analytical framework.  Recommendations  13.570   Given   the   confusion   described   above,   here   are   eight recommendations   regarding   how   to   express   degrees   of misconduct in a contract. First, the meaning of negligence is relatively consistent across U.S. jurisdictions, so using it in contracts doesn’t involve undue uncertainty.  13.571   Second, unless you’re in a position to research the tort law of each   jurisdiction   relevant   to   contracts   you   draft   and negotiate,   it   would   be   safer   not   to   use   the   term   gross negligence ,   as   its   meaning   changes   from   jurisdiction   to jurisdiction.  13.572   Third, if you want to use a term for misconduct that goes beyond negligence, use   recklessness , or the adjective   reckless , or the adverb   recklessly , instead of   gross negligence   and related forms. Given that assessing misconduct depends entirely on the   circumstances   and   involves   differences   of   degree,   it would   be   pointless   to   agonize   over   whether   to   choose another standard more or less exacting than   recklessness . In",
  "particular, it’s unrealistic to think that in contracts one could usefully   distinguish   between   reckless   conduct   and   wanton conduct . It’s a safe bet that many contract readers don’t know what   wanton   means and that the remainder would assume, sensibly enough, that   wanton   is an annoying legalism that means pretty much the same thing as   reckless . But if you use  reckless , bear in mind that in those jurisdictions that don’t recognize degrees of negligence, a negligence standard might apply.  13.573   Fourth, use   intentional   (and   intentionally ) instead of   willful  (and   willfully ) (see 13.896).  13.574   Fifth, make it clear that whatever one or more labels you use, they relate not to the party’s action but to the consequences of the party’s action—that makes more sense. It’s possible to act intentionally without intending to cause damages. If Fred throws   a   ball—an   intentional   act—and   unintentionally breaks   a   window,   it   would   be   illogical   to   accuse   him   of intentional misconduct, as opposed to acting negligently or recklessly.  13.575   Sixth, adjust to reflect the governing law. If it’s the law of a jurisdiction   that   doesn’t   recognize   concepts   used   in   the United States, don’t insist on incorporating those concepts in the contract.  13.576   Seventh, don’t define   recklessness   or any other form of the word. It means ... recklessness. Defining it would just clog up the   contract   with   verbiage   without   adding   certainty.  Recklessness   is a vague standard—if you invoke vagueness, you   have   to   accept   that   it   comes   with   a   measure of uncertainty.  13.577   And eighth, consider not using tort-based standards in a contract   in   connection   with   performance   under   that contract. Acme decides that some aspect of its contract with Widgetco no longer makes business sense, so it elects not to perform. Widgetco has a remedy under the contract for that nonperformance—why   add   a   tort-based   remedy?   In",
  "particular, if a cap on indemnification contains a carve-out for   recklessness   or   intentional   misconduct   and   the indemnification   covers   Widgetco   for   Acme’s   failure   to comply with obligations under the contract, the carve-out could interfere with the limit on indemnification. Such a carve-out would make more sense in the case of, for example, indemnification of Widgetco for losses relating to Acme’s relations with nonparties.  A Sample Provision  13.578   How do these recommendations play out in practice? Here are “before” and “after” versions of a sample provision:  Before  The Processor shall not be liable to any party hereto or any other person for any action or failure to act under or in connection with this Agreement except to the extent such conduct constitutes its own willful misconduct or gross negligence.  After  The Processor will not be liable to any party or nonparty for damages arising from an act or failure to act on its part in connection with its performance under this agreement, except to the extent that as a result of its reckless disregard for the consequences of that act or failure to act, or its intentionally causing those consequences, the Processor causes the party or nonparty to suffer damages.  NO LATER   [OR   EARLIER ,   MORE , OR   LESS ]   THAN  13.579   To be consistent in your contract usages, you have to make decisions big and small. Here’s a small one: which to use,   no later than   or   not later than ?  13.580   Here’s what the “Ask the Editor” feature of the website for Merriam-Webster’s   Learner’s Dictionary   had to say: [T]here are differences in the way these two expressions",
  "are used.   No later than   is used more often than   not later than , and it is less formal.   Not later than   is used mostly in formal documents, such as rulebooks, government laws, and academic papers.  13.581   So use only   no later than . Given the choice between more- formal and less-formal, it makes sense to choose less-formal— contracts are formal enough as it is without adding formality unnecessarily. An unscientific sample of contracts filed on the   U.S.   Securities   and   Exchange   Commission’s   EDGAR system during a 60-day period found that contracts using   no later than   were half again as numerous as contracts using   not later than , so this recommendation would seem already to reflect the majority usage.  13.582   Likewise, say   no earlier than   and   no more than .   Garner’s Modern English Usage , at 628, says that   no more than   “is the more natural idiom—and historically by far the more common one.”   Not more than   occurs in three times as many contracts filed   on   EDGAR   during   the   60-day   period   referred   to   in 13.581 than does   no more than , but that’s no reason to favor  not more than .  13.583   But it doesn’t follow that one should also use   no less than  instead of   not less than . Here’s what   Garner’s Modern English Usage , at 628, says:  No less   connotes surprise <he weighs no less than 300 pounds>. The phrasing in the example expresses astonishment that he weighs so much.   Not less   is more clinical and dispassionate <he weighs not less than 300 pounds>. That example states matter-of-factly that he weighs at least that much and maybe more.  13.584   That perhaps explains why on EDGAR during the 60-day period referred to in 13.581, contracts using   not less than   were more than three times as numerous as contracts using   no less than . Make an exception in this context and use   not less than .",
  "NOTICE Notice   and   Prior Notice  13.585   The noun   notice   is ambiguous; consider using the verb   notify  instead. This section explains why.  13.586   The Oxford English Dictionary   gives as one definition of   notice  “an intimation by one of the parties to an agreement that it is to terminate at a specified time,   esp.   with reference to quitting   a   house,   lodgings,   or   employment.”   So   you   can announce,   “I’ve   given   notice   at   work!”   and   have   it   be understood as meaning that you told your boss that in ten days   (or   some   other   interval)   you   would   no   longer   be working there.  13.587   But   The   Oxford English Dictionary   says that the phrase   to give notice   also simply means to convey information. So   to give notice   can   convey   two   contrasting   meanings—in   one, information is given before the event in question, whereas in the other information is given afterward.  13.588   So the sentence   Acme shall provide Doe with notice of any change of address   is ambiguous. One reading is that if Acme were to change its address and then inform Doe of the new address, it would have complied with the obligation. In other words,   to provide notice   can mean   to notify . You could make this clear by modifying the verb   provide   with an adverb or adverbial phrase, such as   promptly   or   in no later than ten days , or by modifying the noun   notice   with the adjective   prompt .  13.589   But if instead you modify the noun   notice   with the adjectival phrase   ten days’ , the natural reading becomes that Acme is required to inform Doe in advance that it will subsequently be changing its address. In other words, in this context   to provide notice   conveys the meaning of the first   Oxford English Dictionary   definition   mentioned   above.   It   wouldn’t   be reasonable to conclude that Acme would be complying with its obligation if it were to notify Doe of the change of address after it had occurred.",
  "13.590   That being the case, nothing would be served by referring to  ten days’ prior   (or   advance ) notice rather than   ten days’ notice . But given the two possible meanings of   to give notice   and the subtleties   involved   in   distinguishing   them,   it’s understandable that for contracts, drafters should want to tack on   prior   to reinforce that information is to be given before the event in question.  13.591   But   when   considering   alternative   usages,   often   you   can sidestep debate, and that’s the case here.   Notice   is an abstract noun—a   “buried   verb”   (see   17.7).   Replacing   buried   verbs with verbs results in prose that’s more concise, and in this case   doing   so   would   allow   you   to   avoid   the   ambiguity inherent in   to provide notice .  13.592   Consider   the   following   alternative   versions—one   using  notice ,   the   other   notify —of   two   sentences   conveying   the different meanings of   to provide notice . The versions using  notify   represent an improvement.  1.   Using Buried Verb  Acme shall provide Doe with prompt notice of any change of address.  Using Strong Verb  Acme shall promptly notify Doe if it changes its address.  2.   Using Buried Verb  Acme shall provide Doe with at least ten days’ prior notice of any change of address.  Using Strong Verb  Acme shall notify Doe at least ten days in advance if Acme changes its address.  Termination with Prior Notice  13.593   A   contract   might   require   that   a   party   give   notice   when terminating. For example:",
  "Acme may terminate this agreement [upon] [by giving] [with] 60 days’ prior notice to Widgetco.  13.594   It would make sense for the contract to terminate 60 days after Acme notifies Widgetco. But   upon   and   by giving   suggest that termination happens when you give notice, not after the notice period elapses. And   with   isn’t clear either way.  13.595   Another issue arises if a party may give prior notice after a given date or event:  After X, Acme may terminate this agreement [upon] [with] [by giving] 60 days’ prior notice to Widgetco.  13.596   Even if you assume that termination occurs after the period elapses, it’s unclear whether the date restriction applies just to termination or also to giving notice. May Acme give notice before the specified date?  13.597   Neither issue arises if you express termination with prior notice as follows:  If [after Y] Acme notifies Widgetco that Acme is terminating this agreement in accordance with this section 4, this agreement will terminate 60 days after the day Widgetco receives that notice.  Notice —Using an Apostrophe with Periods of Time  13.598   When   referring   to   someone’s   giving   prior   notice   (see 13.590),   follow   the   recommended   usage   and   use   an apostrophe   with   the   associated   period   of   time,   as   in   one week’s   notice and   five days’   notice.  NOTWITHSTANDING ,   SUBJECT TO ,   EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN Notwithstanding  13.599   In the sentence “Notwithstanding section 3.2, Acme may own   1%   or   less   of   a   publicly   traded   company,”  notwithstanding   means “in spite of” or “despite” and indicates that although the subject matter of section 3.2 overlaps with",
  "that of the quoted sentence, the quoted sentence should be read and interpreted as if section 3.2 did not exist.  13.600   In addition, drafters begin a provision with   notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary   if they want that provision   to   prevail   over   any   other   provision   in   the agreement that might overlap with it.   Notwithstanding the foregoing   serves the same function, but only regarding text that precedes the provision in question.  13.601   There are good reasons not to use   notwithstanding.   For one thing,   notwithstanding   operates remotely on the provisions it prevails   over;   readers   could   accept   at   face   value   a   given contract   provision,   unaware   that   it   is   undercut   by   a  notwithstanding   in a different provision.  13.602   Furthermore, although a   notwithstanding   clause that refers to a   particular   section   at   least   warns   readers   what   is   being undercut, one that encompasses the entire agreement leaves to the reader the often awkward task of determining which provisions are affected. The answer might be none: some drafters throw in   notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary   just in case, to inoculate particularly significant provisions   against   the   possibility   of   conflict   with   other provisions.  13.603   And   although   notwithstanding   the   foregoing   might   seem relatively benign, in that the provision that’s undercut would seem to be close at hand,   the foregoing   could conceivably refer to the previous sentence, to the entirety of the preceding part of the body of the contract, or to something in between (see 7.25).  13.604   Aside from these shortcomings, you can create even greater confusion   with   notwithstanding   if   a   contract   contains conflicting   provisions   and   each   of   the   provisions   is accompanied by a   notwithstanding   clause to the effect that that   provision   prevails   over   all   other   provisions   in   the contract. For an example of that, see   Schepisi v. Roberts , 111 A.D.3d 506, 974 N.Y.S.2d 446 (2013).",
  "13.605   A usage note: some think that   notwithstanding   should come at   the   end   of   the   phrase   in   question,   not   at   the   front. According to   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 615, that’s not so: The question that literalist drafters ask is, What doesn’t withstand what else? Are the limitations of § 3.5 “not withstanding” (i.e., subordinated to) the present section or is the present section “not withstanding” (subordinated to) § 3.5? Because the former is the correct reading, some believe that   notwithstanding  should be sent to the end of the phrase in which it appears:   The limitations contained in § 3.5 notwithstanding , as opposed to   Notwithstanding the limitations contained in § 3.5 . But that literalist argument is very much in vain, as the  OED   attests with a 14th-century example of  notwithstanding   as a prepositional sentence-starter. This usage has been constant from the 1300s to the present day. In fact, the construction with   notwithstanding   after the noun first appeared more than a century later, and has never been as frequent.  Subject To  13.606   There’s   an   alternative   to   notwithstanding.   Section   4   of   a contract requires that Acme pay the purchase price to Jones, whereas section 5 requires that Acme pay $10,000 of the purchase price to a nonparty, Smith, if the closing occurs after a specified date. Instead of prefacing the latter provision with   Notwithstanding section 4 , it would be much clearer to qualify the former provision with   Subject to section 5.   Using  subject to   allows you to signal to the reader that a provision is undercut by another provision, and the reader doesn’t have the burden of spotting a   notwithstanding   elsewhere in the contract. And if you use   subject to , nothing would be gained by also using   notwithstanding .",
  "13.607   But even drafters who normally use   subject to   sometimes have   use   for   notwithstanding.   When   you’re   proposing   a change to the other side’s draft that would undercut one or more   other   provisions,   using   notwithstanding   rather   than  subject to   would allow you to make only one change, instead of adding the undercutting provision and adding a cross- reference to it, using   subject to , in the one or more provisions being   undercut.   That   might   prove   useful,   particularly   if you’re making a last-minute change.  13.608   Key language of performance ( Acme hereby grants Pharmaco a license ) and key language of obligation ( the parties shall cause Cyberco to merge into Dynamix Corp. ) is often preceded by  Subject   to   the   terms   of   this   agreement .   This   phrase   can   be superfluous, as the rights and obligations of the parties to a contract are determined by considering the contract as a whole   rather   than   each   provision   in   isolation.   If,   for example, a party grants an option in one section and states in one or more other sections the exercise price and the exercise period,   it   doesn’t   follow   that   the   grant   should   be   made “subject   to   the   terms”   of   that   contract.   It   would   be inconceivable for the party granted the option to claim that there is no exercise price or that the option is exercisable indefinitely.  13.609   When   using   subject   to ,   generally   it’s   best   to   be   specific regarding which provision is doing the undercutting. But when a key obligation—for example, the obligation to cause Cyberco   to   merge   into   Dynamix   Corp.—is   subject   to satisfaction of certain conditions and the right of one or more   parties   to   terminate   the   agreement   in   certain circumstances, it’s generally simpler to state at the outset that the obligation is   Subject to the terms of this agreement   rather than specify at greater length the sections containing those conditions and termination rights.  Except as Provided In",
  "13.610   An alternative to stating that a provision is   subject to   a given section is to say   except as provided in   that section.   Except as provided in   is the narrower of the two phrases: it indicates that the other provision is an exception, whereas if section 8 is subject to section 9, that could mean that section 9 is an exception to what is provided in section 8, but it could also mean that section 9 supplements section 8 in any number of ways. For example, section 9 could impose a condition to a right   provided   for   in   section   8.   By   extension,   except   as otherwise provided in this agreement   is narrower than   subject to the terms of this agreement .  Confusing Interplay  13.611   Besides the issue of how to express most clearly that one provision prevails over one or more other provisions, you also   have   to   express   clearly   the   nature   of   the   interplay between the provisions. For an example of a dispute caused by failure to do just that, see   BDC Finance L.L.C. v. Barclays Bank PLC , 974 N.Y.S.2d 39 (App. Div. 2013); see also Kenneth A. Adams,   A New Case Involving “Notwithstanding” , Adams on Contract   Drafting   (28   Oct.   2013), http://www.adamsdrafting.com/a-new-case-involving- notwithstanding/ (discussing   BDC Finance L.L.C. ).  Eliminating Nullified Provisions  13.612   It’s evidently common practice in negotiating mergers-and- acquisitions contracts that when you add new language that nullifies   language   in   the   previous   draft,   you   retain   the nullified language and signal its relationship to the new by means   of   subject   to   (in   the   nullified   language)   or  notwithstanding   (in   the   new   language).   Or   you   tack   on provisos   (see   13.663).   Presumably   that’s   felt   to   be   more diplomatic than proposing to delete language offered by the other side.",
  "13.613   That approach might help you get the deal done, but leaving in nullified language can result in a party claiming that the ostensibly nullified language still has life in it. That’s what led   to   litigation   over   the   abortive   acquisition   of   United Rentals, Inc., by acquisition vehicles controlled by funds and accounts affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., the private-equity buyout firm. See   United Rentals ,   Inc. v. RAM Holdings ,   Inc ., 937 A.2d 810 (Del. Ch. 2007); see also Kenneth A. Adams,   Merger Pacts: Contract Drafting ,   Cerberus Litigation , New York Law Journal, 19 Feb. 2008.  NOVATION  13.614   It’s   standard   for   an   amendment   to   a   loan   agreement   to contain a provision stating that entry into the amendment “does not effect a novation” of the obligations under the loan agreement.  13.615   Novation   is a term of art (see 1.7), and many readers of contracts won’t know what it means. Here’s how   novation   is defined in   Black’s Law Dictionary : “The act of substituting for an old obligation a new one that either replaces an existing obligation with a new obligation or replaces an original party with a new party.”  13.616   Instead of saying that an amendment “does not effect a novation,” it would be clearer to say it “will not result in any of the Obligations being replaced.” Or if you think that it’s important to retain the word   novation , you could combine the   two   approaches:   “does   not   effect   a   novation   of   the Obligations,   in   that   it   will   not   result   in   any   of   the Obligations being replaced.”  ONLY  13.617   Here’s what   Garner’s Modern English Usage   says about   only :  Only   is perhaps the most frequently misplaced of all English words. Its best placement is precisely before the",
  "words intended to be limited. The more words separating   only   from its correct position, the more awkward the sentence; and such a separation can lead to ambiguities ... . Yet the strong tendency in [American English] is to stick   only   right before the verb or verb phrase regardless of the illogic ... .  13.618   This   is   the   case   in   contracts.   Consider   this   example (emphasis added):  The Tenant may   only   move furniture, fixtures, and equipment into and out of the Premises during nonbusiness hours unless Landlord gives approval otherwise.  13.619   So the tenant may only to move furniture, fixtures, and equipment in the specified manner. That’s all the tenant is allowed to do—the tenant is precluded from also making breakfast,   going   to   work,   taking   a   shower   ...   .   That’s obviously a ludicrously literal reading, but one can imagine contexts in which that sort of reading might be less ludicrous but equally unintended.  13.620   So move   only   farther back in the sentence:  The Tenant may move furniture, fixtures, and equipment into and out of the Premises   only   during nonbusiness hours unless Landlord gives approval otherwise.  13.621   Here’s another example:  When a Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Seller shall   only   exercise its rights and remedies under the Purchase Agreement [read   only ] in accordance with the instructions of the Agent.  ON THE ONE HAND   ...   ON THE OTHER HAND  13.622   The   construction   on   the   one   hand   ...   on   the   other   hand  bifurcates a list of three or more items. And it does so in two ways.",
  "To Indicate Which Conjunction Has Scope Over the Other  13.623   When in a string of three nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs the first and second are separated by   and   and the second and third are separated by   or , or vice versa, the meaning varies depending on which conjunction “has scope over” the other. One way to clarify that ambiguity is to use   on the one hand ... on the other hand . That’s discussed at 11.92–.93.  To Divide a List into Two Categories  13.624   On the one hand ... on the other hand   is also used to divide between two categories a list of three or more items using   and  as the only conjunction. In sample [1] below, it’s not clear to which category B belongs—debtor or creditor? That’s made clear   in   samples   [1a]   and   [1b].   You   could   instead   use enumeration to remedy the confusion, as in sample [1c], but  on the one hand ... on the other hand   seems the simpler option.  [1]   the relationship between A and B and C is that of debtor and creditor [1a]   the relationship between A, on the one hand, and B and C, on the other hand, is that of debtor and creditor  [1b]   the relationship between A and B, on the one hand, and C, on the other hand, is that of debtor and creditor  [1c]   the relationship between (1) A and B and (2) C is that of debtor and creditor  Used Unnecessarily  13.625   But more often than not   on the one hand ... on the other hand  is used when it’s not needed—in other words, it’s used even when a list doesn’t need to be bifurcated.  13.626   For example, it’s sometimes used with a list containing only two items, as in the following examples. As there’s no risk of confusion, it should be omitted.  The relative fault of the indemnifying party   on the one hand   and the indemnified party   on the other hand   is to be determined by",
  "reference to ... . Each of Parent , on the one hand,   and the Stockholders’ Representative,   on the other hand,   shall cooperate with each other in preparing the 2017 Income Statement.  13.627   But what if one of the two items is plural? Here are two examples:  The Sellers,   on the one hand , and the Purchaser,   on the other hand,   are each responsible for paying half the Transfer Taxes arising out of the transactions contemplated by this agreement. ... in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits and the relative fault of the Company,   on the one hand,  and the Placement Agents,   on the other hand,   in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in those losses, damages, or liabilities.  13.628   In   this   context,   on   the   one   hand   ...   on   the   other   hand   is presumably used to indicate that the members of the plural item   are   acting   together.   It   would   be   clearer   and   more economical to say as much (making sure to place the plural item first, to avoid any syntactic ambiguity):  The Sellers (considered collectively) and the Purchaser are each responsible for paying half the Transfer Taxes arising out of the transactions contemplated by this agreement. ... in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits and the relative fault of the Placement Agents (considered collectively) and the Company in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in those losses, damages, or liabilities.  13.629   And   on the one hand ... on the other hand   is sometimes used with a list of three or more items even though there’s no need to bifurcate those items. For example:  The Corporate Taxpayer and the Partnerships, on the one hand, and the applicable Limited Partner, on the other hand,   [read   The Corporate Taxpayer, the Partnerships, and the applicable Limited",
  "Partner ] acknowledge that, as a result of an Exchange, the Corporate Taxpayer’s basis in the applicable Original Assets will be increased by the excess, if any, of ... .  13.630   Similarly, one sometimes sees   on the one hand ... on the other hand   used to group three or more parties to a transaction, just as drafters used to use   party of the first part ... party of the second part   (see 2.115). But this practice is unnecessary:  This asset purchase agreement is dated 6 August 2017 and is between ABLE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the “ Buyer ”),   on the one hand, and   BAKER MERCHANDISING LLC, an Ohio limited liability company (the “ Seller ”), CHARLIE ENTERTAINMENT, INC., a Florida corporation (“ Charlie ”), and DAVID DELTA, as trustee of the David Delta Trust (the “ Trustee ”; together with Charlie, the “ Members ”) , on the other hand .  13.631   It’s preferable not to indicate in the introductory clause who is performing what role—that’s what the recitals are for (see 2.84).  PARENTHESES Function  13.632   In   regular   prose,   parentheses   (round   brackets,   like   those enclosing these words) are used to offset text that constitutes an explanation or aside. The limited and stylized prose of contracts   isn’t   the   place   for   explanations   and   asides,   so drafters should have no reason to use parentheses to serve that   function.   But   parentheses   represent   one   way   to eliminate   syntactic   ambiguity   (see   12.17,   12.56,   12.76). They’re also used with enumeration (see 4.28, 4.45) and to create a defined term after an integrated definition (see 6.62).  13.633   And if you need to express that two different arrangements apply in different circumstances, maybe the most convenient way   to   express   those   different   circumstances   is   by   using paired sets of parentheses. (For an example of that, see the proposed language in 11.152.)",
  "Parentheses Within Words  13.634   Don’t use parentheses within a single word. For example, don’t tack   (s)   onto the singular form of a noun to convey that a situation might involve one or more than one of the item   in   question.   (A   particularly   awkward   variant   is  beneficiar(y/ies) .) Instead, say   one or more   (see 11.6, 11.13):  Parent shall cause to be filed   a registration statement(s)   [read  one or more registration statements ] on Form S-3 ... upon the surrender of   the certificate(s)   [read   one or more certificates ] previously representing those shares ... .  13.635   More   elaborate   are   (sub)licensee ,   (sub)contractor ,   and  (self)insured . Whatever they offer in economy is more than offset by their awkwardness.  13.636   And there are better ways to achieve gender-neutral drafting than   (s)he   (see 17.11).  PARTY   AS AN ADJECTIVE  13.637   Party   is often used in a noun phrase, as in “Acme is   a party   to a confidentiality agreement with Widgetco” and “Acme and Widgetco are   parties   to a confidentiality agreement.” Be more concise and use it as an adjective, as in “Acme is   party   to a confidentiality agreement with Widgetco” and “Acme and Widgetco are   party   to a confidentiality agreement.”  PERCENTAGES  13.638   Some drafters use   100%   when it would be simpler to omit it or use   all   or some other alternative:  The Guarantor proposes to distribute to its shareholders   100% of the   [ read   all] outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. ... a Series A Warrant registered in the name of that Purchaser to purchase up to a number of Ordinary Shares equal to   100% of",
  "the   [read   the number of ] Shares issuable to the Purchaser on the Closing Date. The XYZ Shareholders own 100 shares of common stock, no par value,   being 100% of the presently   [read   and those are the only XYZ Shares currently ] issued and outstanding SKM Shares. ... the Loans are secured by Cash and Cash Equivalents in an amount not less than   100% of   the principal amount of the Loans plus interest to accrue through the Special Arrangement Period ... . ... an Issuing Bank will not be required to issue, amend, or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be   100%   [read   fully ] covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders ... .  13.639   Similarly, simplicity favors using   half   rather than   50% , as in “ 50% of   [read   half ] the shares” and “ 50% of   [read   half ] the members of the Company’s board of directors.” If you can, do without the preposition   of —don’t say   half of the shares .  13.640   But   it   makes   sense   to   use   100%   and   50%   to   refer   to   a numerical value in a provision that includes one or more other percentages:   ... with a target award-date value of 100% of the Base Salary and a maximum award value of 150% of the Base Salary ,   subject to ... .  13.641   Fractions other than half (for example,   one-quarter ,   one-fifth ) offer   no   advantage   over   percentages,   as   they’re   more cumbersome. The exception is fractions that would require a recurring decimal to be expressed in percentages, for example  one-third   and   two-sevenths .  PERSONAL DELIVERY  13.642   It’s confusing to use   personal delivery   in a notices provision in a   contract.   Does   personal   relate   to   the   person   doing   the delivering?   If   so,   does   it   mean   that   the   party   giving   the notice has to be the one to deliver it, rather than, say, FedEx?",
  "After all, one says, “I delivered it personally,” meaning that the speaker was the one who delivered the item.  13.643   Or does   personal   relate to the recipient? If so, does complying with   the   provision   require   that   notice   be   handed   to   the recipient? What if it’s placed before the recipient? What if the recipient is in the next room? And so on.  13.644   The meaning of “deliver it personally” was at issue in the English case   Ener-G Holdings plc v. Hormell   [2012] EWCA Civ 1059   (31   July   2012).   The   court   decided   that   the   best interpretation was that “personally” referred to the recipient, so that complying with the provision required that notice be handed to the recipient.  13.645   To   avoid   this   sort   of   confusion,   don’t   use   in   a   contract  personal delivery   or   deliver   ...   personally . Instead, provide for delivery to a person at a specified address by specified means (by national transportation company, by registered mail, by hand, or otherwise) and specify when notice will be deemed to have been received.  PERSONNEL  13.646   Some use personnel as a synonym for employees. Others use it   to   include   others,   perhaps   even   companies.   Here’s   a definition that does that:  “ Personnel ” means the Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors, consultants, vendors, invitees, and representatives of a party and that party’s Affiliates.  13.647   The   broader   definition   isn’t   necessarily   anomalous.   For example,   Black’s   Law   Dictionary   gives   as   a   definition   of  personnel , “Collectively, the people who work in a company, organization, or military force.” One can work in a company without being an employee.  13.648   If   some   contracts   define   personnel   to   mean   more   than employees, it’s conceivable that in other contracts drafters",
  "use   personnel   to convey that broader meaning but without using it as a defined term. You have the potential for a fight over the meaning of   personnel . That’s not an unlikely notion, given that people have litigated whether a court-appointed receiver qualifies as court personnel.  13.649   And   personnel   has another strike against it—it’s a plural noun with no singular form, and there’s no other singular noun applying to an individual member of the set it denotes.  13.650   So   if   you   mean   employees,   use   employees .   If   you   mean employees   and   other   representatives,   create   and   use   the defined term   Representative . If the group in question includes more than employees and representatives, you could use the defined term   Personnel , but consider whether you need such an unwieldy group.  PREVAILING PARTY  13.651   A standard piece of boilerplate is a provision stating that the “prevailing party” (or “successful party”) in a dispute may recover costs.  13.652   In   the   United   States,   generally   attorneys’   fees   aren’t recoverable in a commercial contract dispute unless provided for by statute or contract. So if in a transaction you want to recover attorneys’ fees and other expenses, say so in the contract.  13.653   But one problem with such provisions is that the meaning of  prevailing   party   has   “spawned   a   great   deal   of   litigation.” Robert L. Rossi, 1   Attorneys’ Fees   § 6:8 (3d ed. 2012). If the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses its action, has the defendant prevailed? If a party’s case has been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, has the other party prevailed? What if both a complaint and a counterclaim have been dismissed? If the plaintiff has recovered on its complaint against the defendant and the defendant has recovered on its counterclaim against the plaintiff, is the prevailing party the one in whose favor a",
  "net judgment was entered, or are both parties entitled to recover?   Is   a   decision   required,   or   can   you   prevail   in   a settlement or consent decree? Is a money judgment required, or do equitable remedies qualify? And to be the prevailing party in a dispute, do you have to succeed on all issues, or just some? Those are only a few of the uncertainties.  13.654   You could attempt to be specific regarding what determines whether a party has prevailed. There are three main ways to do so. First, a party is the prevailing party if it secures a judgment or any kind of dismissal. That has the benefit of being clear-cut, but it would allow a party to recover fees even after failing to prevail on most of its claims.  13.655   Second, a party is the prevailing party if it gets substantially what it had sought. That has fairness in its favor, but given its vagueness, a court would likely have to decide this.  13.656   And   third,   a   party   is   the   prevailing   party   if   it’s   the   net winner, regardless of what it had sought. So if Party A wins one claim out of 20 and recovers $10 and Party B wins its one claim and gets $9, Party A is the net winner. It’s not clear whether that’s fair.  13.657   Given all the potential issues, and given that determining the prevailing party is such a fact-specific inquiry, the risks of setting   rules   in   advance   might   outweigh   the   potential benefits.  13.658   Cal.   Civil   Code   §   1717(b)(1)   contains   a   definition   of  prevailing party   for claims under a contract. That definition is mandatory and cannot be altered or avoided by contract. See, e.g.,   Exxess Electronixx v. Heger Realty Corp. , 75 Cal. Rptr. 2d 376, 383 (Ct. App. 1998).  PRODUCT, UNITS OF THE PRODUCT  13.659   The word   product   is ambiguous—it can mean either a product line   or   individual   samples   of   a   product   line.   Using   the defined term   Product   for the former meaning and referring to",
  "units   of   the   Product   for   the   latter   would   eliminate   any confusion.  PROPRIETARY  13.660   The word   proprietary   is overused in contracts. In particular, it’s   unhelpful   to   use   proprietary   in   defining   the   term  Confidential Information .  13.661   Black’s Law Dictionary   defines   proprietary   in part as follows: “1. Of, relating to, or involving a proprietor <the licensee’s proprietary rights>. 2. Of, relating to, or holding as property <the   software   designer   sought   to   protect   its   proprietary data>.”   So   information   can   be   proprietary   but not confidential.  13.662   It follows that if   Confidential Information   is defined to mean proprietary information, or is defined to mean information that   is   proprietary   or   confidential,   information   that   isn’t confidential would, unhelpfully, fall within the scope of the definition.   If   Confidential   Information   is   defined   to   mean information that is both proprietary   and   confidential, that would   exclude   information   that   isn’t   proprietary   but   is nevertheless information that a disclosing party might want to keep confidential, for example information disclosed to it by someone else under a confidentiality agreement.  PROVIDED THAT  13.663   A traditional component of legal drafting is the proviso, which consists of a provision introduced by   provided that   and set off from the preceding clause by a comma or semicolon. In contracts, provisos are often introduced with a semicolon and   provided ,   however ,   that ,   with   provided   and   however  underlined   for   emphasis.   In   the   case   of   a   proviso   that immediately follows another proviso, the formula used is  provided further ,   however ,   that   or something similar.",
  "13.664   The   problems   with   provided   that   go   beyond   the   archaic trappings of the traditional proviso. In this context,   provided that   is a truncation of the “term of enactment”   it is provided that .   Into   the   19th   century,   provided   that   was   used   to introduce   statutory   provisions.   But   provided   is   also   a conjunction meaning   if   or   on condition that —“I’ll let you go to the party, provided you take a taxi home.” Maybe this everyday use of   provided   dulls modern drafters to the fact that as   currently   used   in   contracts,   provided   that   essentially continues to serve its original function: it’s used to introduce not only conditions to the main clause but also limitations and exceptions to the main clause, as well as new provisions that can be considered independently of the main clause. In other words, using   provided that   is an imprecise way to signal the relationship between two conjoined contract provisions.  13.665   For an example of how using   provided that   in a contract can lead to dispute, see   Jacobsen v. Katzer , 535 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2008). This case involved a copyright license that granted users the right to use software, “provided that [the user] insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when [the user] changed that file, and provided that [the user] do at least ONE of the following: ... .” The defendants took   none   of   the   actions   specified   in   the   provided   that  language, so the licensor sued. The question was whether that failure meant that the defendants’ use of the software fell outside the scope of the license or whether it represented breach of the license. The lower court held that the   provided that   language   didn’t   limit   the   license   grant.   The   Federal Circuit   disagreed,   holding   that   the   provided that   language stated conditions to effectiveness of the license. The wrong lesson to take from this case is that you should use   provided that   to state a condition. Instead, it would be best to avoid confusion, with the attendant risk of litigation, by steering clear of   provided that .  13.666   A more precise alternative to   provided that   is always available. Below are sample provisos, one for each category of meaning",
  "drafters seek to convey with provisos. In each, the clearer alternative to the italicized text incorporating   provided that   is noted in italics in the brackets that immediately follow.  Exception  When issued in accordance with this agreement, the Warrant Shares will be validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable, and will be free of any   Liens; provided, however, that   [read   Liens, except that ] the Warrant Shares may be subject to restrictions on transfer under state and federal securities laws.  Limitation  The Closing must take place at the offices of the Purchaser’s counsel promptly after the date of this   agreement; provided, however, that the Closing must occur   [read   agreement, and in any event ] no later than 1 December 2017, at 5:00 p.m. New York time, unless the parties agree to another date.  Condition  Acme shall reimburse the Consultant all reasonable expenses the Consultant incurs in performing services under this   agreement; provided, however, that the Consultant shall obtain   [read  agreement, on condition that the Consultant obtain ] Acme’s written consent before incurring any such expense in excess of $200.  Addition  “ Purchase Period ” means the ten-day period following the end of each calendar   quarter; provided, however, that the Purchase Period shall include any other periods   [read   quarter and any other periods ] the Committee designates.  PROVISION  13.667   The   word   provision   is   used   to   describe   something   in   a contract, but without being specific. You can use   provision   in a contract, usually in the plural. Here are two examples:",
  "... any additional shares of Common Stock issued and issuable in connection with any antidilution   provisions   in the Notes or the Warrants ... . ... or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver of compliance with certain   provisions   of this Indenture ... .  13.668   But usually it’s redundant:  ... in accordance with   the provisions of   this section 4.1.1 ... . ... if the Borrower timely complies with   each of the provisions in  section 4.2. ... as amended in accordance with   the provisions of   the Deposit Agreement ... .  13.669   The redundant   provision   also occurs in the silly   terms and provisions , which is presumably used by those enamored of  terms and conditions   (see 13.807):  ... be bound by   the terms and provisions of   the Intercreditor Agreement ... .  All terms and provisions of the   [read   The ] Purchase Agreement and the other Transaction Documents will remain in effect.  13.670   Provisions   used   in   section   and   article   headings?   You   can always do better:  Other Interpretive Provisions   [ read   Interpretation] Definitions   and Other Definitional Provisions Patent Provisions   [ read   Patents]  Certain Provisions Relating to   Limited Liability Company and Limited Partnership Interests.  REASONABLE ,   REASONABLY  13.671   Reasonableness is expressed in contracts by means of the adjective   reasonable   and the adverb   reasonably . How they’re used can raise some subtle issues.",
  "13.672   Black’s   Law   Dictionary   defines   reasonable   in   part   as   “Fair, proper,   or   moderate   under   the   circumstances.”   So determining whether someone has acted reasonably requires an objective inquiry—you consider the circumstances, not the actor’s intent.  13.673   That’s the meaning of   reasonable   as it’s used in, for example,  a reasonable fee   and   in   reasonable   detail .   But   it   conveys   a different   meaning   in,   for   example,   to   the   reasonable satisfaction   of   Acme ,   in   that   reasonable   doesn’t   refer   to reasonableness of the satisfaction. Instead,   to the reasonable satisfaction   of   Acme   means   to   the   satisfaction   of   Acme ,  determined from the perspective of a reasonable person in Acme’s position . It would be clearer to say it that way.  13.674   When   reasonably   modifies a verb, as in   reasonably requests  and   reasonably   determines ,   the   word   reasonably   can   be paraphrased   as   “in   a   reasonable   manner.”   But   when  reasonably   modifies a verb it can be redundant, depending on the verb. For example,   reasonably   is redundant in   Acme shall cooperate   reasonably   with   Widgetco ,   as   reasonableness   is inherent in the notion of parties cooperating.  13.675   When   it’s   used   to   modify   anything   other   than   a   verb,  reasonably   is problematic.  13.676   It’s redundant when used to modify the adverb   promptly , in that promptness is determined based on what is reasonable considering the circumstances (see 10.110). The same applies to using   reasonably   to modify other adverbs.  13.677   As   regards   using   reasonably   to   modify   adjectives,   it’s redundant in the phrase   reasonably likely —reasonableness has nothing to do with an expression of likelihood.  13.678   When   reasonably   is   used   to   modify   other   adjectives,   for example   satisfactory   or   necessary , the word   reasonably   doesn’t refer to reasonableness of the satisfaction, or of the necessity. Instead, as with   reasonable satisfaction   (see 13.673),   reasonably satisfactory   means   satisfactory ,   as   determined   from   the",
  "perspective of a reasonable person in Acme’s position . And it would   be   clearer   to   say   it   that   way.   Courts   would   likely attribute that meaning to   satisfactory   regardless (see 13.722), but making that explicit would eliminate a potential source of dispute.  REASONABLENESS AND GOOD FAITH  13.679   When should you use a reasonableness standard and when should you use a good-faith standard? And does it make sense to use both in a provision?  Whether to Use a Reasonableness Standard or a Good-Faith Standard  13.680   Generally,   it   would   benefit   a   contract   party   to   have   a reasonableness standard rather than a good-faith standard apply to a counterparty’s conduct. A reasonableness standard can be imposed not only by using   reasonable   and   reasonably  but also by using words such as   appropriate .  13.681   A   reasonableness   standard   is   objective—what   would   a reasonable   person   have   done   in   the   circumstances?   By contrast, a good-faith standard is subjective—did the party in question think it was acting reasonably, regardless of whether it was when viewed from the perspective of a reasonable person? It wouldn’t be in a party’s interest to give the other party room to act unreasonably but in good faith. That’s why, for example, it makes sense to refer to   reasonable efforts  rather than   good-faith efforts . But if your client is the one subject to a given provision, you might prefer a good-faith standard.  13.682   But a good-faith standard is the appropriate choice if a party is   taking   a   position—for   example,   contesting   something ( taxes that are being contested in good faith ), claiming that something happened, or filing a complaint. Using   good faith",
  "confirms that the party’s public position matches its actual state of mind.  13.683   And use   good faith   to qualify an obligation to negotiate—you can’t   be   forced   to   agree   to   something   just   because   a reasonable person in your position would have done so (see 8.55).  13.684   When you’re referring to a party’s actual state of mind,   good faith   is redundant. For example, the phrase   good-faith belief  doesn’t make sense—if you believe something, necessarily you   believe   it   in   good   faith.   But   when   a   reasonableness standard is used with   believes   and   satisfactory   and other words usually associated with a state of mind, what is being referred to is not the state of mind of a party but the state of mind of a   reasonable   person   in   the   position   of   that   party   (see 13.722–.723).  13.685   In jurisdictions that recognize the implied duty of good faith (see 3.225), it wouldn’t be necessary to make it explicit that a good-faith   standard   applies   in   a   given   context—it’s   what would apply by default in the absence of another standard. But it can be helpful to remind the parties that that’s the case, and doing so might eliminate a potential source of dispute.  13.686   The   difference   between   a   reasonableness   standard   and   a good-faith standard can be more apparent than real. Often it’s   impossible   to   determine   what   a   contract   party   was thinking in taking an action—either you have no evidence on that score, or the evidence you have is self-serving. So courts often decide whether a party acted in good faith by considering   how   others   have   behaved   in   similar circumstances—by   in   effect   applying   a   reasonableness standard. That might be relevant if the other side balks at being subject to a reasonableness standard.  Using Both Standards Together",
  "13.687   What   about   using   both   a   reasonableness   standard   and   a good-faith standard in one provision? Usually that wouldn’t make   sense—if   a   party   meets   the   more   exacting reasonableness   standard,   what   would   be   the   point   of invoking good faith? It follows that drafters using phrases such as   reasonable good-faith efforts   and   reasonable good-faith judgment   are indulging in redundancy.  13.688   But in a given context you might want to be sure not just that a party is conducting itself reasonably but also that it’s not   acting   under   a   pretext.   For   example,   if   a   party   is contesting taxes (see 13.682), one issue is whether it’s taking appropriate steps to do so; another is whether it’s using the process as a pretext to create delay. You could address both concerns by referring to taxes being contested “in good faith by appropriate proceedings.”  REGARD SHALL BE HAD TO  13.689   The   phrase   regard   shall   be   had   to   doesn’t   occur   often   in contracts, but it’s clumsy enough—passive voice,   shall   that fails the   has a duty   test (see 3.74)—to be worth pointing out. Two examples:  In computing the majority when a poll is demanded,   regard shall be had to   the number of votes to which each Member is entitled by the Articles. In determining the rights of the US$ Note Trustee to additional remuneration following an Event of Default,   regard   shall be had to   any amounts paid to the US$ Note Trustee following an event described in section 12.3(b).  13.690   It’s not amenable to a quick fix. One approach would be to use the active voice and   take into account ,   consider , or   include .  REMEDIATE",
  "13.691   In contracts and elsewhere, it’s standard to use the word  remediation   in   connection   with   cleanup   or   treatment   of environmental contamination. It’s also standard to use the verb   remediate   to refer to the act of remediation.  13.692   According   to   Garner’s   Modern   English   Usage ,   “ remediate ,   a back-formation from   remediation , is either a needless variant of   remedy   or a piece of gobbledygook.” But in environmental circles,   remediation   has acquired a specialized meaning, and the verb   remediate   evokes that specialized meaning. To insist that   drafters   instead   use   the   verb   remedy   to   convey   that meaning is to fight an uphill battle.  13.693   Furthermore, the remedy for environmental contamination could   consist   of   cleanup,   a   monetary   award,   a   civil   or criminal penalty, or injunctive relief. Using   remediate   instead of   remedy   in connection with cleanup or treatment makes it clear which meaning is intended.  REMIT ,   REMITTANCE  13.694   Black’s Law Dictionary   gives as one definition of   remit   “To transmit (as money) <upon receiving the demand letter, she promptly remitted the amount due>.” And here’s how it defines   remittance : “1. A sum of money sent to another as payment for goods or services. 2. An instrument (such as a check) used for sending money. 3. The action or process of sending money to another person or place.”  13.695   Remit   and   remittance   are   old-fashioned   choices   to   express these meanings in a contract. More straightforward are   pay  and   payment , as in these examples:  Upon Substantial Completion of each System, Owner shall   remit to   [read   pay ] Contractor half the amount retained with respect to that System. ... an amount as that Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, determines to be the proportion of the refunded amount as will leave it, after that   remittance   [read   payment ], in",
  "no better or worse position than it would have been if ... .  13.696   Some contexts might require using instead   transfer   or   refund  (in both cases, the verb or the noun).  13.697   And if you can replace the abstract noun   remittance   with the verb   pay   (see 17.7), so much the better:  If legal restrictions prevent the prompt remittance of   [read   If by law Acme is prevented from paying promptly ] any royalties with respect to any country in the Territory where the Product is sold ... .  RESPECTIVE ,   RESPECTIVELY  13.698   More often than not,   respective   and   respectively   are misused when used in contracts. Such misuse is unlikely to result in any dispute, but it doesn’t do the reader any favors.  Respective  13.699   Respective   means “as relates individually to each of two or more persons or things,” as in   George and Hannah drove their respective cars home . It indicates that the components of one group are to be considered separately in pairing them with one or more components of another group.  13.700   Here’s   an   example   of   respective   used   appropriately   in   a contract:  “ Eligible Party ” means a party other than Acme, Widgetco, or any of their   respective   Affiliates.  13.701   But it’s easy to find examples of the extraneous   respective . Sometimes   in question   would work better:  Each employee’s election to participate made in accordance with the provisions of section 4.2 will remain in effect for the one- year period that begins on the first day of the   respective   Class Year [read   in question ] and ends on the last day of that Class Year.",
  "13.702   At   other   times,   respective   is   inappropriately   used   with   a construction in the singular:  Each of the Trustee and the Company states that it has the full right and power and has been duly authorized to enter into this agreement and to perform its   respective   obligations as contemplated hereunder. On or before the Effective Date, each of the Private Investors shall deliver to the Escrow Agent certificates representing that Private Investor’s   respective   Escrow Founder Units. All selling security holders and the Company shall bear the expenses of the underwriter pro rata in proportion to the  respective   dollar amount of securities each is selling in such offering.  13.703   Sometimes   any   should   have   been   used   rather   than   the respective , in that no pairing is involved:  “ Release Date ” means   the respective dates   [read   any date ] on which the Founder Units, Sponsor Warrants, Co-Investment Units, and Aftermarket Shares are disbursed from escrow in accordance with section 3 of the Securities Escrow Agreement.  13.704   And you might be able to eliminate   respective   by making the groups singular:  All capitalized terms that are   [read   Each capitalized term ] used but not defined in this SOW   have the respective meanings given to them   [read   has the meaning given to it ] in the Purchase Agreement.  13.705   Even if   respective   works, you might have choices. The first of the following alternatives uses   respective . The second, also using   respective , is slightly more concise than the first, and significantly more concise than the third, which doesn’t use  respective . If the tenant were an individual and the landlord an entity, the pronoun “its” in the second version wouldn’t work, making the first version the best option.  The Tenant and the Landlord shall cause their respective casualty",
  "policies to contain a provision allowing the foregoing waiver of claims. The Tenant and the Landlord shall each cause its casualty policies to contain ... . The Tenant shall cause the Tenant’s, and the Landlord shall cause the Landlord’s, casualty policies to contain ... .  Respectively  13.706   Respectively   means “in regard to each of two or more, in the order named.” It indicates that each item in a list earlier in a sentence is to be paired with its counterpart in a list that follows and contains an equal number of items, as in   The first and second prizes went to Marie and Frank ,   respectively . (The list earlier in the sentence and the list associated with   respectively  should both use   and   rather than   or .)  13.707   Here are two examples of appropriate use of   respectively   in a contract:  Each Newco1 Director and Newco2 Director will have one vote on all matters requiring the approval or action of the Newco1 Board and the Newco2 Board,   respectively . Smith and Jones will be responsible for paying one-third and two-thirds,   respectively , of any Additional Tax.  13.708   But   respectively   is redundant if there’s no preceding list to echo, as in these examples:  ... if Tenant fails to provide Landlord with the financial statements or the estoppel certificates within the time periods referenced in sections 23.16 and 23.17 , respectively .  Company and Put Grantor, respectively, state that each party has been represented by that party’s   [read The   Company and the Put Grantor each states that it has been represented by ] legal counsel regarding all aspects of this agreement. The Executive is employed by [read   each of ] XYZ, the Company,",
  "and the Bank   in senior executive capacities, respectively   [read   in a senior executive capacity ]. Owner and Tenant are   respectively   signing this agreement on the date stated in the introductory clause.  RIGHTFULLY ,   RIGHTFUL  13.709   The word   rightfully   occurs routinely in contracts, most often in   one   of   the   standard   exceptions   to   the   definition   of  Confidential Information   in   a   confidentiality   agreement:   ... information that the Licensee rightfully obtains from any person that has the right to transfer or disclose that information . The word   rightful   is used less often.  13.710   The   problem   with   rightfully   and   rightful   is   that   they’re imprecise.   Rightful   means “having a just or legally established claim; held by right or just claim.” But neither   rightfully   nor  rightful   gives   the   reader   any   sense   of   the   basis   for   the entitlement.  13.711   For example, regarding use of   rightfully   in the exclusion from the   definition   of   Confidential   Information ,   it’s   not   clear whether   rightfully   means that the recipient must not have received the information in question from someone who is under an obligation of confidentiality not to disclose that information, or whether it means that the recipient must not have somehow broken the law to get that information, or whether it’s meant to convey both of those meanings.  13.712   So consider whether you can replace   rightfully   and   rightful  with a clearer alternative. The same applies to   wrongfully   and  wrongful .  RIGHT, TITLE, AND INTEREST  13.713   Right ,   title ,   and interest   is a bloated legalism, with the three nouns   serving   primarily   to   make   legal   prose   suitably",
  "sonorous. That the three elements are invariably kept in the same order is a sign that they serve as incantation.  13.714   Garner’s   Dictionary   of   Legal   Usage ,   at   788–89,   offers   this analysis:  right, title, and interest.   This phrase, one of the classic triplets of the legal idiom, is the traditional language for conveying a quitclaim interest. ... Technically, only one of the three words is necessary, as the broad meaning of  interest   includes the others: though you can have an  interest   without having   title   and perhaps without a given  right , you cannot have   title   or a   right   without having an  interest .  13.715   It’s easy enough to find caselaw to that effect. Here are two examples: In common parlance the word “interest” is broader and more comprehensive than the word “title,” and its definition in a narrowed sense by lexicographers as any right in the nature of property less than title indicates that the terms are not considered synonymous.   In re Baldwin’s Estate , 134 P.2d 259, 263 (Cal. 1943). In the context of property law, a “right” is a “legally enforceable claim of one person against another, that the other shall do a given act or shall not do a given act,” and an interest “generically ... include[s] varying aggregates of rights, privileges, powers and immunities and distributively ... mean[s] any one of them.”  Dennison v. North Dakota Department of Human Services , 640 N.W.2d 447, 453 (N.D. 2002).  13.716   You might think that there’s no point in being adventurous and tinkering with   right ,   title ,   and interest . But if you take that deferential approach with   right ,   title ,   and interest , you’ll likely do the same with other usages, and your contracts will suffer.  13.717   Furthermore, the phrase might have its roots in conveying a quitclaim interest, but it can now be found in all sorts of",
  "contracts.   It   has   gotten   annoying.   Right ,   title ,   and   interest  occurs in enough different contexts that this manual won’t offer a blanket rule. Instead, consider using only   interest ; if you decided that   interest   alone is inadequate, then add only whatever is necessary address to whatever you think   interest  alone doesn’t cover.  13.718   If your concern is that having Acme transfer its interest in an asset might leave Acme with something, you could address that by having Acme acknowledge that after the transfer, Acme would be left with nothing relating to the asset.  SAID   USED AS A POINTING WORD  13.719   It remains commonplace for drafters to use   said   instead of one of the “pointing words”   this ,   that ,   these , and   those . An example:   If the Executive contests in good faith whether he was properly terminated for “Cause,” the Executive and the Company shall immediately refer said   [read   that ]   dispute to arbitration in accordance with section 15 . This usage is one of the hallmarks of legalese, and it contributes nothing to drafting other than an annoyingly legalistic tone.  13.720   This use of   said   is related to misuse of   such   (see 13.767). In the following extract, the drafter could have used   said   instead of   such,   and vice versa, but it would have been best to use  that   instead:   if for a period of 12 consecutive months a majority of the board of Borrower or any Guarantor is no longer composed of individuals who were members of said   [read   that ]   board on the first day of such   [read   that ]   period.  SAME   USED AS A PRONOUN  13.721   To use   same   as a pronoun is to pontificate. Often one can simply   use   instead   a   more   conventional   pronoun— it ,   its ,  them ,   they ,   their —or repeat the noun in question, perhaps with a suitable “pointing word” (see 13.719). At other times more extensive revisions are required. Some examples follow;",
  "in each, the recommended alternative to the italicized text incorporating   same   is noted in brackets.  The Company shall furnish to the Lender promptly after   the same   [read   they ] become publicly available copies of all periodic and other reports, proxy statements, and other materials filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company shall pay its Indebtedness and other obligations, including Tax liabilities, before   the same   [read   they ] become delinquent or in default. Regarding any Loans made by it under this agreement, each Agent in its individual capacity and not as Agent will have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise  the same   [read   those rights and powers ] as though it were not an Agent. Any notice given under this agreement that is delivered by mail will be deemed received   upon the depositing of the same in the U.S. mail   [read   when it is deposited in the U.S. mail ].  SATISFACTORY  13.722   If you say that something has to be   satisfactory to Acme , the standard might be an objective one, in that it would be met if a reasonable person in Acme’s position would be satisfied. Alternatively, it could mean that Acme actually has to be satisfied, subject only to the implied duty of good faith—the standard is a subjective one. The result is ambiguity. Courts prefer the former meaning; see 2-5   Corbin on Contracts   § 5.33; 13   Williston on Contracts   § 38:22.  13.723   Saying instead   reasonably satisfactory to Acme   is a succinct way of making it clear to the parties, and to any court, that the objective meaning is intended. To make it clear that the subjective   meaning   is   intended,   drafters   customarily   say  satisfactory   to   Acme   at   its   discretion   (or   a   variant;   see 3.228–.232).   But   strictly   speaking,   that   doesn’t   go   to   the meaning of   satisfactory . The following formula is wordier but",
  "explicit:   satisfactory to Acme ,   with Acme’s satisfaction in this instance being a function of whether Acme is actually satisfied (subject to any implied duty of good faith) ,   rather than whether a reasonable person in Acme’s position would be satisfied . It’s hard to imagine any counterparty accepting such a standard.  SHAREHOLDER   OR   STOCKHOLDER ?  13.724   Many   lawyers   think   that   it’s   necessary   to   use   stockholder  rather than   shareholder —in contracts and elsewhere—if the corporation   in   question   was   formed   under   Delaware   law. Insisting   on   this   distinction   would   seem   odd,   in   that  stockholder   and   shareholder   are synonyms meaning, of course, a holder of shares of stock of a corporation.  13.725   Presumably no one is under any illusion that which term you use in a contract could affect a party’s rights. More likely, the distinction derives from wanting to show good manners by conforming to local custom. But in this case, local custom is far from clear-cut, as both terms are used in the Delaware General   Corporation   Law   and   in   Delaware   caselaw.   And treatises   on   Delaware   corporate   law   use   the   terms interchangeably.   So   for   all   purposes,   including   contract drafting,   you   may   with   a   clear   conscience   use   either  stockholder   or   shareholder   when referring to a holder of shares of stock of a Delaware corporation.  SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT  13.726   What should you call an agreement between shareholders? This manual recommends using   shareholders agreement , but each of the three following alternatives is defensible:  shareholders’ agreement   (plural plus apostrophe)  shareholder agreement   (singular, no apostrophe- s )  shareholders agreement   (plural without the apostrophe)",
  "13.727   Shareholders’ agreement , conveying the meaning “agreement of the shareholders,” is perhaps the most traditional option. It would be unobjectionable but for the apostrophe—because an apostrophe in a contract title is a rarity, it’s always at risk of being dropped.  13.728   Shareholder   agreement   is   analogous   to   shareholder   meeting , which is a standard alternative to   shareholders’ meeting . But judging   by   contracts   filed   on   the   U.S.   Securities   and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR system, this alternative is used about half as often as alternatives featuring the plural  shareholders , with or without the apostrophe.  13.729   In   shareholders   agreement ,   the   word   shareholders   is   an attributive noun, answering the question “What kind of?” as opposed to “Whose is it?”   Shareholders agreement   is analogous to   carpenters union   and   homeowners   association .   It   has   the advantage of using the plural—it’s better to choose the more popular option if there’s no drawback to doing so—without the nuisance of the apostrophe.  13.730   Obviously the same alternatives apply if you use the word  stockholder   instead of   shareholder ; see 13.724.  SIGNATORY  13.731   The   word   signatory   is   ambiguous.   Black’s   Law   Dictionary  defines   signatory   as   “A   person   or   entity   that   signs   a document,   personally   or   through   an   agent,   and   thereby becomes a party to an agreement.” But it’s also used to mean someone who physically signs a contract, whether as a party or on behalf of a party.  13.732   To avoid reader miscues, use instead   party   to convey the former meaning and   individual signing this agreement for Acme  to convey the latter meaning. Don’t say instead   on behalf of Acme , as that could be understood as referring to only an agent, not an Acme officer.",
  "13.733   But when it’s used in a signature block (see 5.34), it’s clear that   signatory   refers to the individual signing. In that context, this   manual   suggests   as   an   alternative   the   word   signer . Throughout   this   manual   signer   is   used   to   convey   that meaning, because it’s the simpler word.  SILENT ON  13.734   The phrase   silent on   is sometimes used in contracts to state that the contract doesn’t address a given topic, as in   This agreement is silent on the law that governs disputes arising out of this agreement .  13.735   There can be value, for both negotiation and interpretation, to being explicit that the parties have elected not to address a given issue. But it would be simpler to say   This agreement does not address   the issue in question.  SOLE ,   EXCLUSIVE Sole, Exclusive   in Licensing  13.736   In licensing circles, it’s widely accepted that a   sole   license is different   from   an   exclusive   license.   In   a   sole   license,   the licensor is obligated not to grant any additional licenses but retains the right to practice the licensed subject matter; in an exclusive license, only the licensee has the right to practice the licensed subject matter. See   Drafting License Agreements  § 1.02 (Michael A. Epstein and Frank L. Politano eds., 4th ed. 2012).  13.737   But in using   sole   and   exclusive   to convey those meanings, drafters are using jargon that isn’t comprehensible to the uninitiated. That likely includes some clients.  13.738   Furthermore, for two reasons the distinction isn’t as clear as it seems. First, a sole license could also be understood to mean not that the licensor retains the right to practice the licensed subject matter, but that prior licenses granted are",
  "preserved. See Roger M. Milgrim,   Milgrim on Licensing   § 15.33 (2012). And second, the confusing phrase   sole and exclusive  (see 13.741) is used widely in contracts generally, and one sees instances of   sole and exclusive   used in granting language in different kinds of licenses. That muddies the notion of distinct meanings for   sole   and   exclusive .  13.739   Another way to express the meaning of   sole   described in 13.736 is   exclusive (except as to the Licensor) . But it would be clearer still to state in a separate sentence that the licensor retains the right to practice the licensed subject matter. See Robert   A.   Matthews,   Jr.,   1   Annotated   Patent   Digest   §   9:59 (2015).  13.740   The term   coexclusive   is used by some as an alternative to   sole . See, e.g., R. Gwen Peterson,   Patent Licensing Considerations , Ass’n of Corp. Counsel (27 Aug. 2013). But that could cause confusion over whether the licensor may name an additional licensee.  Sole and Exclusive  13.741   Drafters can always do better than use the phrase   sole and exclusive , with its inherent redundancy.  13.742   Instead of   sole and exclusive remedy , you could say   sole remedy  or   only remedy . In a forum-selection provision, say   exclusive jurisdiction   rather than   sole and exclusive jurisdiction . Or more significant surgery might be required: Instead of saying that all interests in something are   the sole and exclusive property   of Acme, say that Acme   owns   all those interests. And saying that Widgetco may do something   at its sole and exclusive option  raises issues similar to those raised by   at its sole discretion   (see 3.224) and   from time to time   (see 10.131).  13.743   For granting a license, the problem with   sole and exclusive  goes beyond redundancy (see 13.736).  SOLICIT",
  "13.744   The word   solicit , meaning “to entice,” can be used awkwardly in no-solicit provisions in confidentiality agreements.  13.745   Here’s one way it’s used:   The Recipient shall not hire or solicit any   of   the   Disclosing   Party’s   employees.   But   that   raises   the question, solicit them for what? Usually referring to soliciting without specifying a purpose suggests prostitution, or going door to door for contributions. Obviously, that’s not the meaning intended in no-solicit provisions.  13.746   That explains use of the phrase   solicit to employ . But usually when   solicit   is followed by a verb, the verb pertains to an activity to be undertaken by the person being solicited— I solicited him to be our sponsor . So   solicit to employ   is awkward.  13.747   For optimal clarity, you would have to say something like  The Recipient shall not solicit employees of the Disclosing Party to accept employment with the Recipient . That’s wordy. Use instead  solicit to be hired . It too is rather awkward, but at least it’s concise and is consistent with how   solicit   is usually used.  SPECIFIC  13.748   When it occurs in contracts (besides its use in the phrase  specific performance ), more often than not the word   specific  serves no purpose. The drafter would have done well to omit  specific   from   each   of   these   examples,   making   other adjustments as necessary:  The written decision must (1) state   specific   reasons for such decision, (2) provide   specific   reference [read   refer ] to the   specific  Plan provisions on which the decision is based, ... . If any one or more provisions of this section is for any reason held invalid or unenforceable,   it is the specific intent of the parties   [read   the parties intend ] that those provisions will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make them or their application valid and enforceable. The Company and the Purchasers acknowledge that irreparable",
  "damage would occur if any of the provisions of this agreement or the other Transaction Documents are not performed in accordance with their   specific   terms or are otherwise breached. No such employees shall admit any person (Tenant or otherwise) to any office without   specific   instructions from Landlord.  13.749   In   the   following   examples   it   would   have   been   better   to replace   specific   with a different word:  ... but the Company may provide such indemnification or advancement of Expenses in   specific   [read   individual ] cases if the Company’s board of directors finds it to be appropriate; ... . ... other than those statements of fact that expressly relate solely to a   specific   [read   specified ] earlier date, ... .  13.750   So if you’re tempted to use   specific , try omitting it. If that doesn’t work, consider whether a different word would work better.  SPOUSE  13.751   Instead of referring to the wife or husband of a contract party, it simplifies drafting to use   spouse . It works whether the party in question is a woman or a man, and it works whether the individual to whom that party is married is a woman or a man.  SUBROGATION  13.752   The noun   subrogation   and the verb   subrogate   are terms of art. In   contract   provisions   that   relate   to   just   the   parties,   use instead simpler alternatives. (Regarding unnecessary terms of art generally, see 1.11–.15.)  13.753   Here’s the   Black’s Law Dictionary   definition of   subrogation :  subrogation   (s ə b-r ə - gay -sh ə n)   n . (15c)   1.   The substitution of one party for another whose debt the party pays, entitling the paying party to rights,",
  "remedies, or securities that would otherwise belong to the debtor. ...   2.   The equitable remedy by which such a substitution takes place.   3.   The principle under which an insurer that has paid a loss under an insurance policy is entitled to all the rights and remedies belonging to the insured against a third party with respect to any loss covered by the policy.  13.754   And here’s an example of how to eliminate a reference to subrogation contained in a provision that addresses an aspect of   the   relations   between   the   parties   and   doesn’t   involve nonparties:  ... Acme   will not be entitled to be subrogated to   [read   hereby waives ] any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Bank against Capitalco or any guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Bank for payment of the Capitalco Obligations ... .  13.755   Changing subrogation terminology in provisions specifying requirements   for   insurance   is   more   challenging.   It   would involve   presenting   an   insurance   company   with   novel terminology. That might cause delay and uncertainty—the insurance industry has its own way of doing things and relies on   specialized   terminology.   Even   techniques   suggested elsewhere in this manual for combining terms of art with clearer   alternatives   (see   13.208,   13.890)   risk   complicating matters. It might be best to leave well enough alone.  SUCH AS  13.756   Such   as   is   ambiguous—it   might   be   unclear   whether   the clause it introduces reduces the scope of the class represented by the preceding noun. This can cause contract disputes.  13.757   Consider this sentence:  Richard collects books about painters such as Botticelli and Donatello.",
  "13.758   Given   the   general   nature   of   this   class   ( painters )   and   the narrowness of the items in the   such as   phrase (two Italian painters   of   the   early   Renaissance),   the   reasonable   reader would assume that Richard doesn’t collect books about all painters but instead collects books about painters comparable to those listed. So the   such as   phrase reduces the scope of the noun painters—it’s acting like a restrictive clause. (For more about restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses, see 12.43–.45.)  13.759   The alternative would be for the nouns in the   such as   phrase simply   to   be   examples   of   the   class   represented   by   the preceding noun. That would result in the   such as   phrase acting   like   a   nonrestrictive   clause.   Regarding   the   sample sentence   above,   that   could   be   accomplished   either   by narrowing the class represented by the preceding noun (see the first example below) or by including a broader range of nouns in the   such as   phrase (see the second example below):  Richard collects books about Renaissance painters, such as Botticelli and Donatello. Richard collects books about painters, such as Botticelli, Gustav Klimt, J.M.W. Turner, and Andy Warhol.  13.760   Placing a comma before the   such as   phrase, as in the two preceding   examples,   would   make   the   such   as   phrase nonrestrictive.  13.761   Nonrestrictive use of a   such as   phrase makes sense only if the meaning or scope of the class represented by the preceding noun might otherwise be unclear to the reader. That’s why the   last   of   the   above   examples   is   rather   odd—the   class represented by the noun   painters   is so vast as to make the examples provided unnecessary.  13.762   But a bigger problem is that a reader might be uncertain whether a given   such as   phrase is intended to be restrictive or nonrestrictive. For example, it might have been intended that the   such as   phrase in the second of the three above examples be restrictive—maybe the meaning sought to be",
  "conveyed   is   not   that   Richard   collects   books   about   all Renaissance painters but instead that he collects books about Italian painters of the early Renaissance. It would be rash to rely on a comma to ensure that a given   such as   phrase is read as being nonrestrictive.  13.763   Lawler Manufacturing Co. v. Bradley Corp. , 280 F. App’x 951 (Fed. Cir. 2008), provides an example of a contract dispute caused by confusion regarding a   such as   phrase. The contract provided that a specified patent royalty rate would apply “[i]f a Licensed Unit is invoiced or shipped in combination in another product such as an emergency shower or eyewash.” The question before the court was whether the   such as   phrase reduced the scope of the noun in question, “product”—in other words, whether the   such as   phrase was restrictive or nonrestrictive. The court reversed the lower court, holding that the   such as   phrase was restrictive—that the royalty rate in question didn’t apply to all products but only to products similar to those included in the   such as   phrase.  13.764   Given   the   general   nature   of   the   preceding   noun (“products”), the narrowness of the nouns included in the  such as   phrase, and the absence of a comma before   such as , the court’s holding was a reasonable one—the language at issue resembles the first of the three examples above.  13.765   But the contract language was sufficiently confusing that it not   only   caused   protracted   litigation,   it   also   prompted   a dissent by one judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, who thought that the   such as   phrase was nonrestrictive.  13.766   Given the potential for confusion, don’t use   such as . Instead, be precise in describing the class in question. If there’s any risk   of   uncertainty   regarding   the   boundaries   of   the   class, resolve that uncertainty by using   including   in the manner recommended in 13.368–.373.  SUCH   USED AS A POINTING WORD",
  "13.767   It’s   appropriate   to   use   such   in   conjunction   with   a   noun phrase echoing an antecedent noun phrase if   such   conveys the meaning “of this kind.” In this context,   such   is often prefaced by   any   or   no , as in “The Escrow Agent shall give written notice of any   such   deposit to the Purchaser and the Sellers” and “No   such   default or breach now exists.”  13.768   But drafters often use   such   instead of the “pointing words”  this ,   that ,   these ,   and   those.   This   usage   goes   against   the principle that in drafting you shouldn’t use one word to convey different meanings (see 1.64), and it also alienates nonlawyers.   Below   are   examples   of   this   usage,   with   the recommended alternatives to   such   noted in brackets.  “ Affiliate ” means, regarding any Person, any other Person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with   such  [read   that ] Person. Widgetco shall complete its review within ten days. If Widgetco does not within   such   [read   that ] ten-day period notify the Licensee, in writing, of its disapproval and the reasons for   such  [read   its ] disapproval, the Licensee may publish the Licensed Work. Acme has purchased all shares of Widgetco common stock held by the Widgetco stockholders listed in schedule A and has received from each of   such   [read   those ] stockholders a certificate representing its shares of Widgetco common stock.  13.769   Sometimes the pointing word   that   is preceded by the   that   of a   that- clause. If   that that   seems awkward, you can replace the pointing word   that   with   the , as there would be no risk of confusion:  The Manager will not be liable to the Company or to any Member for any loss or damage sustained by the Company or any Member except to the extent   that that   [read   that the ] loss or damage is the result of the Manager’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this agreement.",
  "SUFFER  13.770   In contracts, the verb   suffer   can be used intransitively and transitively. The former is silly, the latter annoying.  Intransitive  13.771   First, the intransitive use of   suffer . When used to mean “to submit to or be forced to endure,”   suffer   is unobjectionable:   I suffer from chronic insomnia . But it’s a bit much when used in contracts   to   mean   “undergo,   experience.”   Usually   the simplest fix is to use   incur   instead. But because   suffer   is used with abstract nouns (for examples,   losses ), sometimes your best bet is to use an adjective instead:  The Executive acknowledges that if he were to divert this information and the relationships to a competitor,   the Company would suffer irreparable harm to its business and goodwill   [read  the Company’s business and goodwill would be irreparably harmed ] in an amount that cannot be readily quantified.  Transitive  13.772   Suffer   is used transitively to mean “to allow, especially by reason of indifference.” It’s pompous and archaic. Usually the simplest fix is using   permit   instead:  The Borrower Representative shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume, or   suffer   [read  permit ] to exist any Lien on any of its assets.  SURVIVAL  13.773   The concept of “survival” crops up in contracts in three ways, and in each of those contexts it’s either unnecessary or inferior to an alternative approach. Each context is discussed below.  Survival of Claims",
  "13.774   A contract might specify that any claims that arise before termination will survive termination. Here’s an example:  Survival of Claims . Termination of this agreement will not relieve either party of any claims against it that arise under this agreement before the agreement is terminated.  13.775   Such provisions state the obvious—terminating a contract because of breach doesn’t preclude the injured party from filing a claim for damages. See, e.g., 2 E. Allan Farnsworth,  Farnsworth on Contracts   § 8.15 (3d ed. 2012) (“If the injured party chooses to terminate the contract, it is said to treat the breach as total. The injured party’s claim for damages for total   breach   takes   the   place   of   its   remaining   substantive rights under the contract.”).  13.776   Reflecting settled law in a contract can be helpful, because the parties won’t necessarily know what the law is. But in drafting business contracts, it’s appropriate to assume that the reader understands basic principles of contract law, as it would be a nuisance to have to restate them in each contract. That claims survive is one such principle.  Survival of Provisions  13.777   The default rule is that performance under a contract ends with the contract. That’s why it’s unnecessary to tack onto contract provisions the phrase   during the term of this agreement  (see 13.254).  13.778   But what if you want an obligation—for example, Acme’s obligation   to   keep   certain   information   confidential—to continue after the contract terminates? You could state in the contract   that   the   provision   in   question   will   survive termination of the contract, but it’s clearer and simpler to build duration into obligation, for example by saying   during the   term   of   this   agreement   and   for   five   years   thereafter   (see 13.255).",
  "13.779   Sometimes a contract will state that the dispute-resolution provisions and other boilerplate survive termination. That’s unnecessary—after the agreement terminates, a party may bring a claim in accordance with the boilerplate, subject to whatever limits the law provides.  Survival of Statements of Fact  13.780   Invariably,   the   principal   language   of   obligation   used   in indemnification provisions (such as   The Seller shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees against all Indemnifiable Losses arising out of   ...) doesn’t specify a time frame for that obligation. As such, it’s an exception to the notion, described in 13.778, that you should be explicit if you want an obligation to continue after an agreement terminates.  13.781   One can do without a time frame in this context because when you can bring a claim for indemnification should be addressed elsewhere in indemnification provisions. Usually, an   agreement   will   speak   in   terms   of   how   long   the indemnifying   party’s   statements   of   fact   survive.   It’s commonplace for most statements of fact in a contract to survive for a limited time (often one year), whereas others survive until the applicable statutes of limitations expire and still others survive indefinitely.  13.782   Although it’s standard to refer in this manner to survival of statements of fact (traditionally known as   representations and warranties ; see 3.374), it’s unhelpful to do so. You should resort to such legal jargon in a contract only if no clearer alternative   presents   itself.   And   referring   to   survival   of statements of fact addresses only one of the potential bases of a claim for indemnification—for example, it doesn’t put time limits on when you can bring a claim for indemnification for breach by the indemnifying party of any of its obligations. That’s   why   it’s   preferable   instead   to   address   this   topic directly,   and   more   broadly,   in   a   section   entitled   Time Limitations . See   GRT ,   Inc. v. Marathon GTF Technology ,   Ltd. ,",
  "No. CIV.A. 5571-CS, 2011 WL 2682898, at *14 n.79 (Del. Ch. 11   July   2011)   (noting   that   the   approach   to   survival   of statements of fact recommended in this manual is different from the traditional approach).  TERMINATION ,   EXPIRATION  What to Use in Termination Provisions  13.783   Some might take issue with this sentence:   This agreement terminates   on   23   August   2019 .   They   might   argue   that termination entails one or more parties’ ending a contract sooner than it otherwise would have ended, and that in this case the correct word to use is   expires .  13.784   It’s certainly easy to find contract language suggesting that expiration   ( expiry   in   British   English)   isn’t   a   form   of termination. For example:   All such charges and expenses shall be promptly settled between the parties at the Closing or upon termination   or   expiration   of   further   proceedings   under   this agreement . If expiration is a form of termination, logic would require omitting “or expiration.”  13.785   But just because drafters are partial to a distinction between  termination   and   expiration   (and between the verbs   terminate  and   expire ) doesn’t mean that a distinction is necessary, or even helpful.  13.786   One can readily find in legal reference works instances of  terminate   and   termination   used to refer to different means by which a contract comes to an end. For example, compare 17A  Am.   Jur.   2d   Contracts   §   519   (2017)   (“Where   a   contract specifies   the   period   of   its   duration,   it   terminates   on   the expiration of such period.”) and 17A   Am. Jur. 2d   Contracts § 527 (2017) (“An oral contract may be modified or terminated orally.”)  13.787   This understanding of the relationship between termination and expiration can be found outside the realm of contracts. For example, the heading of 4   N.Y. Jur.   2d   Appellate Review §",
  "651   (2017)   is   “Expiration   or   other   termination   of   order appealed   from.”   Again,   expiration   is   just   one   form   of termination. The definitions of   termination   and   terminate   in  Black’s   Law   Dictionary   are   consistent   with   termination including expiration.   Termination   is defined as “The act of ending something” and “The end of something in time or existence.” In other words, termination is both something you do and something that can simply happen. To the same effect,   terminate   is defined as meaning “To put an end to; to bring to an end” and “To end; to conclude.”  13.788   Furthermore,   using   terminates   in   termination   provisions instead   of   expires   is   unobjectionable,   in   that   there’s   no possible confusion regarding the meaning of   This agreement terminates on 23 August 2019 .  13.789   But why not use   expires   in termination provisions instead of  terminates ? Because not only would it be unnecessary to do so, it would also lumber you with having to use elsewhere in the contract more ponderous constructions, such as   When this agreement expires or is terminated   [or   otherwise terminates ] rather than just   When this agreement terminates . If you don’t do so, the result can be confusion leading to a dispute. See  Hamden v. Total Car Franchising Corp. , No. 7:12-CV-00003, 2012 WL 3255598 (W.D. Va. 7 Aug. 2012). The same can happen if in one contract you don’t track the references to “expiration” and “termination” in another contract. See, e.g.,  Holtzman   Interests   23 ,   L.L.C.   v.   FFC   Sugarloaf ,   L.L.C. ,   No. 298430, 2012 WL 468257 (Mich. Ct. App. 14 Feb. 2012).  13.790   And don’t use   terminates and expires , as in   This agreement will terminate and expire upon cessation of commercial operation of the   Plant .   It   exhibits   either   inconsistency   or   redundancy, depending on the meaning attributed to   terminates .  Referring to Termination Provisions  13.791   But if you use   terminates   to refer to any means by which a contract comes to an end, you have to be careful how you",
  "refer to the termination provisions.  13.792   If you refer in a contract to   termination of this agreement   and the contract uses the verb   terminate   in referring to both the end of the term and a party bringing the contract to an end, a reasonable reader would conclude that you’re referring to any form of termination. But if the term of a contract is stated using the noun   term , as in   The term of this agreement is three years from the date of this agreement , the fact that the contract doesn’t use the verb   terminate   in stating the term would give a disgruntled contract party room to argue that end of the term represents expiration of the contract rather than termination. So if the contract doesn’t use the verb  terminate   in stating the term, refer explicitly to both the end of the term and the parties bringing the contract to an end if you   intend   the   provision   to   encompass   both   kinds   of termination; also referring to any relevant sections of the contract would be clearer still. Being explicit in that manner would be beneficial even if the contract does use the verb  terminate   to express the end of the term—the reader wouldn’t have   to   check   the   terminology   used   in   the   termination provisions to understand what   termination   means.  13.793   If   you   say   if   this   agreement   terminates ,   that   could   be understood as applying only to termination by operation of the contract without party action. If that’s what you intend, make that clear by referring to the one or more sections that provide for termination without party action.  13.794   If   you   say   if   this   agreement   is   terminated ,   that   could   be understood as applying only to termination by one or more parties. If that’s what you intend, it would be clearer to use the active voice ( if either party terminates this agreement ) rather than the passive voice with missing   by -agent (see 3.12). The same   meaning   would   be   conveyed   by   termination   of   this agreement   by   either   party .   Also   referring   to   any   relevant sections would be clearer still.",
  "TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE  The Implications of   Termination for Convenience  13.795   The   phrase   termination   for   convenience   is   somewhat misleading. It occurs in different types of agreements that provide for ongoing performance. Here’s an example from a services agreement:  Termination by PhoneCo for Convenience.   Commencing one year after the Effective Date, PhoneCo may terminate for convenience this agreement, the Services performed at any Site, and any one or more Statements of Work by giving at least 90 days’ prior written notice to the Provider.  13.796   Termination for convenience   would seem to be a euphemism for termination for any reason at all. The phrase originates in government contracts and refers to the government’s right to terminate   a   contract   without   breaching   the   contract,   on condition that the decision to terminate isn’t an abuse of discretion and wasn’t made in bad faith. But the phrase has come into more general use, perhaps because it sounds less threatening than   termination for any reason   and rolls off the tongue more readily.  13.797   You can see this in the way some drafters use it as a section heading but lay out the harsh reality in the body of the section:  Termination for Convenience . Either party may terminate this agreement, for any reason or for no reason, upon not less than 45 days’ prior written notice to the other party delivered in accordance with section 11.1 stating that party’s intention to terminate this agreement.  13.798   But   Acme   might   want   to   terminate   its   agreement   with Widgetco for any number of reasons. Maybe it found it could get better terms elsewhere. Maybe it decided to stop selling widgets.   Maybe   it   became   embroiled   in   litigation   with",
  "Widgetco.   Convenience   seems   a   pallid   word   to   capture   all those reasons.  13.799   And   more   to   the   point,   an   imaginative   (or   desperate) litigator   might   argue   that   Acme   could   terminate   for convenience only if its agreement with Widgetco imposed some sort of burden, and that the prospect of a better deal elsewhere wasn’t a sufficient reason.  13.800   So   termination for convenience   is problematic. For what it’s worth,   an   informal   survey   of   contracts   filed   on   the   U.S. Securities   and   Exchange   Commission’s   EDGAR   system suggests   that   contracts   using   the   phrase   termination   [or  terminate ]   for any reason   outnumber by a wide margin those that use the phrase   termination   [or   terminate ]   for convenience .  Alternative Language  13.801   The   following   provision   demonstrates   the   full   range   of language you could use instead of   termination for convenience :  Acme may terminate this agreement [at any time] [for any reason] [or for no reason] by giving the Vendor at least 30 days’ prior notice.  13.802   What about the first two bracketed elements? If you say that Acme may terminate at any time, that carries with it the implication that Acme may terminate for any reason. If you say that Acme may terminate for any reason, that carries with it the implication that Acme may terminate at any time. Is the implication strong enough that you can use one of these two elements and not the other? What about dispensing with both of them?  13.803   It would be best to use   for any reason , as that’s the most important   concept.   The   associated   implication   that   Acme may terminate whenever it wants is sufficiently strong to allow   one   to   dispense   with   at   any   time .   In   language   of discretion,   a   party   should   be   free   to   take   the   action   in question whenever it wishes, absent any indication to the",
  "contrary, so generally   at any time   should be redundant; see 10.128. And dispensing with both elements would be rash, even though one could readily make the argument that if a provision   doesn’t   impose   any   limitations   on   reasons   for termination,   one   wouldn’t   need   any   reason.   Three   extra words is a small price to pay for being categorical.  13.804   But   if   you’re   drafting   an   agreement   that   provides   for termination for cause, instead of   termination for any reason  you could use   termination without cause , in the interest of symmetry.  13.805   You shouldn’t have any qualms about eliminating   or for no reason   (see 13.294). Businesses act rationally or irrationally, prudently   or   imprudently,   competently   or   incompetently. What they don’t do is act entirely at random.  13.806   As for a section heading, if   Termination for Any Reason   seems too   stark,   you   could   try   Unrestricted   Termination . Alternatively,   you   could   avoid   trumpeting   the   issue   in   a section heading by instead grouping termination provisions according to who has the right to terminate—for example, by using   the   section   headings   Buyer   Termination ,   Seller Termination , and   Buyer or Seller   Termination .  TERMS AND CONDITIONS  13.807   The phrase   terms and conditions   is a fixture in commercial contracts. Sometimes   exceptions   is tacked on the end. But a condition is a kind of term, as is an exception. It would be more concise just to say   terms .  THAT CERTAIN  13.808   Using   that   certain   when   referring   to   an   agreement   is   an archaism. Use   a   (or   an ) instead:   Acme and Big Bancorp are party to that certain   [read   a ]   credit agreement dated 12 August 2017 .",
  "THE EARLIER   [OR   LATER ,   GREATER , OR   LESSER ]   OF X AND Y  13.809   It’s commonplace for a contract to provide for selection of the earlier or later, or greater or lesser, of two alternatives. (When three or more items are involved, refer to the earliest or latest, or greatest or least, of those alternatives.) Which conjunction should you use between the alternatives? The following example uses   and :  Acme shall retain any records of the Business transferred to Acme under this agreement until the later of (1) expiration of the applicable tax statute of limitations, including any extensions, and (2) the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date.  13.810   Many drafters would use   or , presumably because when you select one item from a group,   or   is usually the appropriate conjunction to use, as in   You may select A ,   B ,   or C.   But the logical choice is   and , in that one is selecting one item from a group of two or more. Using   or   would require that one select, say, the greater of each item considered individually, which wouldn’t make sense.  13.811   Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage , at 517, reaches a different conclusion:  later of [date] or [date]; later of [date] and [date].  Drafters frequently debate whether the proper conjunction in this phrase is   or   or   and . The better idiomatic choice is   or —nine of every ten lawyers believing it is the proper choice. True,   and   has logic on its side. ... But the wording with  and   sounds as pedantic—and as wrong—as   a number of people was there .  13.812   This   assessment   is   problematic   in   several   respects.   First, selecting   contract   usages   by   following   the   herd   is   deeply unpromising. Second, it seems unlikely that “nine of every ten lawyers” is a real statistic. Third, the comparison with   a number of people was there   is comparing apples and oranges and as such is unhelpful. Fourth, this manual thinks that   and",
  "sounds just fine. And fifth—and most importantly—contracts are not the place to sacrifice logic for flimsy notions of what sounds right. Contract parties have gotten into costly and embarrassing disputes over   and   and   or   (see 11.98). If you find yourself on the wrong side of logic in such a dispute, you’ll likely regret it.  13.813   To   use   or   appropriately   in   the   preceding   examples,   you would need to rephrase them using   whichever is . The first example so rephrased:  Acme shall retain any business records of the Business transferred to Acme under this agreement until (1) expiration of the applicable tax statute of limitations, including any extensions, or (2) the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, whichever is later.  13.814   Because it places at the end of the sentence the basis for selecting between the items being compared, the formula  whichever is   is best reserved for when the description of those items is relatively succinct.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT  13.815   The phrase   there can be no assurance that   has made its way from securities offerings into contracts:  There can be no assurance that   the Owner will receive that notice in time to enable the Owner to instruct the Depositary before the Instruction Cutoff Date.  13.816   Beginning a sentence with   there   plus verb inflicts on the sentence a fake subject and fake verb (see 17.24). And the notion   of   one   party   giving   the   other   no   assurances   that something will happen doesn’t fit in any of the categories of contract   language.   Instead,   have   whoever   would   benefit acknowledge that whatever it is might not come to pass:  The Owner   acknowledges that   the Owner might not receive that notice in time to enable the Owner to instruct the Depositary",
  "before the Instruction Cutoff Date.  THEREFOR  13.817   Unless using a   here - or   there - word affords economy, it’s best to be explicit regarding what’s being referred to (see 13.349). But in the case of   therefor , you can simply delete the word if it’s clear from the context what’s being referred to:  A Participant required to sell any Depositary Receipts in accordance with this section 6(b) will be entitled to receive in exchange   therefor   the purchase price per Depositary Receipt received by the Majority Institutional Investors with respect to their Depositary Receipts in that transaction ... .  13.818   If   you   elect   to   use   therefor ,   don’t   be   surprised   if   people attempt to change it to   therefore .  THING  13.819   A drafter who uses in a contract   any thing   or   all things   is presumably referring to either one or more acts or pieces of property. It would be preferable to refer to them as such rather than using, instead or in addition, the word   thing .  THIRD PARTY  13.820   Don’t use   third party . This section explains why.  13.821   Parties   entering   into   a   contract   were   once   divided   into classes, or “parts.” Generally the owner or seller was referred to as   the party of the first part   and the buyer was referred to as  the party of the second part.   This cumbersome and confusing usage has become a rarity (see 2.115–.116).  13.822   More common is a usage that it gave rise to—using the term  third party   in a contract to denote any individual or entity that is not a party to that contract. It would be for the best if this usage, too, were dropped: because the word   party   is now used   as   a   general   term   for   one   who   has   entered   into   a",
  "contract (see 2.111), it’s anomalous to use that word as part of a term meaning just the opposite. Also, the designation  third   makes no particular sense, given that contracts often have more than two parties.  13.823   Person   (defined to mean an individual or an entity) is a suitable alternative to   third party   when there’s no need to exclude   the   parties   to   the   contract   from   the   scope   of   a provision:   “Lien” means ,   in the case of securities ,   any purchase option ,   call ,   or similar right of a third party   [read   any Person ]  regarding those securities.  13.824   You can use   any Person other than a party   when you need an alternative to   third party   that excludes parties:   Confidential Information   does   not   include   any   information   that   ...   was subsequently lawfully disclosed to the receiving party by a third party   [read   by a Person other than a party ,   on condition that that Person   was ]   not   under   a   duty   to   keep   that   information confidential.   Even simpler would be   nonparty .  13.825   Third party   is sometimes used as a defined term or as part of a defined term such as   Third-Party Claims.   A clearer alternative would be   Nonparty.  13.826   But in contract drafting you can’t dispense entirely with the term   third party , given that it features in terms of art such as  third-party beneficiary   and in legislation.  THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE  13.827   The phrase   throughout the universe   is used in rights-granting language:  Client shall have the sole and exclusive right   throughout the universe   in perpetuity to use and exploit all or any part of the Properties and all or any part of any material contained therein or prepared therefor, whether or not used therein, in any format or version, by any means and in any media, whether now known or hereafter developed.",
  "13.828   If whoever’s being granted rights has no prospect of using them in space (in satellites or otherwise),   worldwide   would be a more sober alternative.  TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE  13.829   A fixture of contract language is the phrase   time is of the essence . But it’s formulaic; you can express any underlying issue more clearly.  13.830   According to   Black’s Law Dictionary ,   of the essence   means “so important that if the requirement is not met, the promisor will be held to have breached the contract and a rescission by the promisee will be justified.”  13.831   It’s used in provisions such as this:   Tenant’s surrender of the Surrender Premises on the Surrender Date is of the essence . But that doesn’t mean that it’s a good idea to use   of the essence . Because   of the essence   is jargon, you can’t expect readers to know what you’re trying to say when you use   of the essence . It would be clearer to use instead a termination provision to express   the   intended   meaning.   If   appropriate,   you   could supplement it by having the parties acknowledge that breach of specified sections constitute material breach.  13.832   But   of the essence   occurs mostly in the phrase   time is of the essence . The meaning attributed to   time is of the essence   in  Garner’s   Dictionary   of   Legal   Usage ,   at   895,   reflects   the conventional   wisdom   among   practitioners:   “When   a contractual stipulation relating to the time of performance is ‘of the essence’ of a contract, a party’s failure to meet that stipulation automatically justifies the other party’s rescinding the contract—no matter how trivial the failure.”  13.833   Drafters use the phrase because courts tend to hold that late performance isn’t grounds for termination unless the purpose of the contract or the circumstances surrounding it indicate that the parties intended for that to be the case. See   Am. Jur.",
  "2d . Contracts § 594 (2017). But for various reasons,   time is of the essence   isn’t up to the task.  13.834   First, the phrase is generally used in a provision stating—the exact   wording   varies—that   Time   is   of   the   essence   of   this agreement .   This   formula   is   too   general:   “A   contract   may contain many promises for sundry performances, varying in amount and importance. A general provision that ‘time is of the   essence’   should   not   apply   to   all   of   the   promises   for performance.” 8-37   Corbin on Contracts   § 37.3.  13.835   Second, even if it happens to be clear what performance the phrase   applies   to,   the   phrase   is   silent   regarding   the consequences of untimely performance.  13.836   Third,   you   see   time   is   of   the   essence   provisions   even   in contracts that use liquidated-damages provisions and express termination provisions to specify the consequences of delay. As 8-37   Corbin on Contracts   § 37.3 says, “The provision ‘time is of the essence’ may be inserted in a contract without any realization of its significance. Other terms contained in the agreement, interpreted in the light of the conduct of the parties, may show that the provision has no legal effect.”  13.837   And   fourth,   although   termination   for   any   tardiness   may make   sense   in   some   contexts,   in   other   contexts—for example, in a construction project—a missed deadline might occur after substantial performance, and allowing the other party   to   terminate   could   result   in   unjust   enrichment.   A common-law judge might or might not be troubled by that unfairness, but it would likely create problems in civil-law jurisdictions, which frown on rescinding a contract based on trivial nonperformance.  13.838   So it’s unsurprising that courts have proved willing to ignore  time is of the essence   provisions because you can’t assume that the   parties   to   a   contract   understood   and   agreed   on   the ostensible meaning of the phrase.",
  "13.839   For   example,   the   Restatement   (Second)   of   Contracts   §   242, comment d. (1981), says that “stock phrases such as ‘time is of the essence’” do not necessarily have the effect of making failure to timely perform grounds for discharge, although such   phrases   “are   to   be   considered   along   with   other circumstances in determining the effect of delay.”  13.840   To make it clearer that a deadline is important and what the consequences are of failing to meet the deadline, it would be best to address the issue explicitly. Assume that you represent the   buyer   in   an   acquisition   and   the   draft   acquisition agreement specifies that either party can terminate if the transaction hasn’t closed by a specified date—the “drop-dead date.” You want to make sure that a court wouldn’t grant the seller   any   leeway   if   the   buyer   terminates   because   the transaction hasn’t closed by the drop-dead date and the seller sues, claiming that a missing consent in fact materialized a day later and that the buyer should have been willing to close.   A   clearer   alternative   to   saying   that   time   is   of   the essence regarding the drop-dead-date provision would be to include this:  The parties acknowledge that due to [describe time constraints on the parties], if a party wishes to terminate this contract in accordance with section X [the drop-dead-date provision], that party will not be required to give the other party any time beyond the Drop-Dead Date to allow that party to satisfy any condition or perform any obligation under this agreement.  TOGETHER WITH ,   AS WELL AS  13.841   Outside of its use in “boosting” defined terms (see 6.79), the phrase   together with   can sometimes be replaced with a single word. That word might be   and :  “Hotel” means the Site   together with   [read   and ] the Buildings.  13.842   In other contexts, it’s   with :  The Advisor shall send the Report to the Stockholders   together",
  "with an explanation of ... .  13.843   Or it might be   plus :  If the Advisor is found not to be entitled to indemnification, the Advisor shall repay the Company the advanced funds   together with   [read   plus ] interest].  13.844   The   same   range   of   fixes   can   be   applied   to   as   well   as . Economy in contract drafting resides in small adjustments as well as large.  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW  13.845   If conduct contemplated in a contract might, depending on the circumstances, result in a party’s breaking the law, make that clear by using the phrase   to the extent permitted by law , as in   To the extent permitted by law ,   Acme   [ shall ]   [ may ]   incinerate the Excess Materials . If Acme were to break the law, including that phrase would make it difficult for Acme to argue that its unlawful activity doesn’t provide Widgetco with grounds for terminating the contract or bringing against Acme a claim for damages   under   the   contract.   It   would   also   signal   to nonparties, particularly government agencies, that the parties were   aware   that   Acme’s   conduct   was   subject   to   legal restrictions.  13.846   But the phrase serves a different function in language of performance. Consider this example:   To the extent permitted by law ,   each party hereby waives its right to a trial by jury . It has been recommended that you use   to the extent permitted by law  in this context because “there are instances when jury trial waivers are not enforceable as a matter of law. This clause would preserve the effectiveness of the jury trial waiver as between the parties in instances where the law does not prohibit waiver.”   Negotiating and Drafting Contract Boilerplate  155 (Tina L. Stark ed., 2003). But if the governing law doesn’t prohibit waiver, you would have no need for   to the extent permitted by law . And if it does prohibit waiver, the phrase",
  "would be equally irrelevant. Instead, in this context   to the extent permitted by law   simply tells the parties that depending on the law of the forum in any dispute, the waiver might or might not be enforceable.  13.847   If the phrase is used with the intent that it signal to a court that   the   parties   are   willing   to   have   an   unenforceable provision   modified   to   the   extent   necessary   to   make   it enforceable, it would be clearer and more standard to use a severability provision to convey that meaning.  TRADEMARKS—REFERENCES TO  13.848   Sometimes in commercial agreements, each reference to a registered trademark is stated in all capital letters, with the registration   symbol   “ ® ”   appended,   as   in   PLAXICOL ® .   But using all capitals and the registration symbol at every turn distracts readers and doesn’t help protect trademark rights. To make your contracts more readable, drop the registration symbol.   And   in   trademark   license   agreements   or   other agreements relating to rights in a trademark, use all capitals when referring to that trademark by name. But if a trademark simply   identifies   particular   goods   or   services,   use   initial capitals.  13.849   If your client has strict rules about how its trademarks are to be referred to, you’ll need to follow those rules, even to the detriment of readability. But judicious use of defined terms might allow you to minimize the effect on readability.  13.850   The remainder of this section explains what underlies these recommendations.  All Capitals or Initial Capitals?  13.851   Treatises on trademark law recommend that when using a trademark, you distinguish it from the surrounding text so that the public will recognize it as a trademark. In this regard, Anne LaLonde & Jerome Gilson, 1-2   Gilson on Trademarks",
  "§ 2.02 (2017), states as part of a “Checklist for Preventing Loss of Distinctiveness” that “the mark owner should display the mark prominently and use a distinctive type face, solid capital letters or, at the very least, capitalization of the first letter.” Similarly, Siegrun D. Kane,   Kane on Trademark Law  §   5:2.1   (2016)   says   that   to   distinguish   trademarks   from ordinary descriptive or generic terms, they should be set off from surrounding text, and that this can be accomplished, among other ways, by using all caps or initial caps.  13.852   In   so   recommending,   those   treatises   don’t   distinguish between types of use, but it makes sense to do so. When considering how trademarks should be shown in contract text,   bear   in   mind   that   any   public   dissemination   of commercial agreements is purely incidental. Compared with text   on   pill   bottles,   in   promotional   materials,   or   in advertising, contract text couldn’t reasonably be considered a potential source of loss of distinctiveness. So the typographic convention you use in a contract to refer to a trademark wouldn’t jeopardize rights in that trademark. As a matter of trademark law, nothing is gained by stating in all capitals contract references to a trademark.  13.853   But that doesn’t mean that it’s always pointless to use all capitals in contract references to trademarks. In trademark license   agreements   and   other   agreements   relating   to trademark rights, trademarks are referred to purely in their capacity as trademarks. By contrast, other kinds of contracts refer to trademarks in their capacity as labels for particular goods or services. For example, in an agreement providing for purchase of vials of Tamiflu vaccine, the trademark “Tamiflu” simply   identifies   the   vaccine—that   it’s   a   trademark   is incidental.  13.854   So in trademark license agreements and other agreements relating to trademark rights, the extra emphasis provided by all   capitals   helps   distinguish   references   to   trademarks   as trademarks   from   the   descriptive   function   of   trademark references   in   other   kinds   of   agreements.   And   when   a",
  "trademark reference doesn’t relate to rights in that trademark, nothing is gained by using all capitals, so you can give it the initial capital befitting a proper noun.  Registration Symbol or No Registration Symbol?  13.855   The owner of a registered trademark doesn’t have to use with its   trademark   the   registration   symbol   “ ® ”   or   some   other statutory notice (such as the words “Registered in U.S. Patent and   Trademark   Office”)   to   be   entitled   to   protect   that trademark from unauthorized use. But to recover damages and profits in a suit for infringement under the Lanham Act, a trademark owner must be able to show either that it had used the registration symbol or other statutory notice or that the   defendant   had   actual   notice   that   the   owner   had registered the mark. (See 15 U.S.C. § 1111.) And using a statutory notice is another way to protect against loss of distinctiveness.  13.856   So Anne Lalonde & Jerome Gilson, 1   Gilson on Trademarks   § 2.02 (2017), states, in the checklist mentioned in 13.851, that “the trademark owner should indicate the legal status of the mark wherever it appears.” Other authorities acknowledge, however, that doing so can drive a reader batty. For example, the International Trademark Association says, “Generally, it is not necessary to mark every occurrence of a trademark in an advertisement or other promotional materials but, at a minimum, this identification should occur at least once in each piece of printed matter, either the first time the mark is used or with the most prominent use of the mark.”  13.857   But if trademark protection were the only concern, drafters could, for two reasons, drop from their contracts registration symbols and other statutory notices.  13.858   First, as mentioned in 13.852, commercial agreements aren’t disseminated   publicly,   so   there’s   no   risk   of   loss   of distinctiveness.",
  "13.859   And second, it’s unlikely that a contract party would need to rely on its use of statutory notice in a contract to be entitled to recovery under the Lanham Act. Any trademark license agreement or other agreement relating to trademark rights would state explicitly that the one or more trademarks in question are indeed trademarks, so appending a statutory notice to each trademark reference would be redundant. And regarding other kinds of agreements, if Acme enters into a contract with a drug company to buy quantities of a drug, Acme couldn’t rationally argue that because the registration symbol   isn’t   appended   to   references   to   the   drug   in   the contract, it didn’t know that the drug’s name was a registered trademark. A court should find that Acme had actual notice, given   that   the   registration   symbol   had   been   prominently displayed in all public materials relating to the drug.  13.860   And   if   a   trademark   owner   were   concerned   about unauthorized use of its trademarks by a party to one of its contracts, it should address that explicitly in the contract instead of relying on appending statutory notice to references to its trademarks.  13.861   Given   these   considerations,   it’s   not   surprising   that   the registration symbol is rarely used in contracts.  Relationship to Trademark Guidelines  13.862   It’s   commonplace   for   company   trademark   guidelines   to mandate that all capitals and the registration symbol be used in every reference to one of the company’s trademarks. Such rules couldn’t coexist with this manual’s recommendation that   in   contract   references   to   trademarks   you   use   initial capitals and drop the registration symbol.  13.863   One   way   around   this,   short   of   making   the   trademark guidelines less rigid, would be to use a defined term instead of repeatedly using all capitals and a registration symbol in referring   to   a   given   trademark.   In   a   trademark   license agreement, you might use the defined term   the Licensed Mark ;",
  "in a commercial agreement, you might use the defined term  the Product .  UNLESS AND UNTIL  13.864   Unless   and   until   is   an   expression   that   weakens   the expectation (conveyed by   until   alone) that the condition in the clause will be realized. In everyday English, you use   unless and until   if you expect or hope that the condition will be satisfied (as suggested by   until ) but want to signal to the reader or listener, by means of   unless , that it might not be.  13.865   That   sort   of   rhetorical   nuance   is   useful   in   speech   or   in narrative or persuasive writing, but not in the more rigid world of contract drafting—use instead   unless   by itself.  UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES  13.866   The phrase   unless the context otherwise requires   (a variant uses  requires otherwise ) is used in provisions such as these:  Unless the context otherwise requires , capitalized terms used in this agreement have the following meanings.  Unless the context otherwise requires , references to the “Company” will be deemed to refer to the Company and its Subsidiaries. Each of the statements of fact of the Loan Parties contained in this agreement (and all corresponding definitions) are made after giving effect to the Transactions,   unless the context otherwise requires .  13.867   It   would   be   best   to   eliminate   unless   the   context   otherwise requires , as it adds uncertainty that a litigator might be able to take advantage of. If in a contract you want to deviate from some across-the-board convention, be specific about it.  UNLESS THE PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE",
  "13.868   Generally,   the   phrase   unless   the   parties   agree   otherwise   is redundant. As a matter of contract law, the parties could agree to waive, amend, or delete any provision in a contract, regardless of whether that contract says that they may. But it would be appropriate to use   unless the parties agree otherwise   if a party thinks that it would facilitate negotiation of a given provision if everyone were reminded that the parties might at some later point agree on a different arrangement.  UTMOST  13.869   In a phrase such as   with the utmost dispatch , the adjective  utmost   is used as an idiosyncratic alternative to   reasonable efforts   (see 8.9). But it’s also used to qualify standards of care — utmost good faith ,   utmost care ,   utmost diligence . Because those standards are based on what would be reasonable in the circumstances,   utmost   adds   nothing   other   than   rhetorical emphasis (see 1.59). If you have something specific in mind, express it clearly. Otherwise, omit   utmost , in this context and everywhere else.  VERY  13.870   The word   very   occurs infrequently in contracts. That’s not surprising,   since   for   contracts,   very   isn’t   a   meaningful indication of magnitude—the reader has no way of knowing where   very   falls on the spectrum from nothing to everything. The same applies to   extremely   and   highly .  VIRGULE, ALSO KNOWN AS THE FORWARD SLASH  13.871   Here’s what   Garner’s Modern English Usage , at 754, has to say about the virgule, also known as the forward slash: Some writers use [the virgule] to mean “per” <50 words/minute>. Others use it to mean “or” <and/or> or “and” <every employee/independent contractor must complete form XJ42A>. Still others use it to indicate a",
  "vague disjunction, in which it’s not quite an   or   <the novel/novella distinction>... . In all these uses, there’s almost always a better choice than the virgule. Use it as a last resort.  13.872   So   the   virgule   isn’t   conducive   to   clarity—don’t   use   it   in contracts other than to state a fraction. (See 11.86 regarding  and/or .)  VOLUNTARILY ,   INVOLUNTARILY  13.873   Depending   on   the   context,   the   words   voluntarily   and  involuntarily   might not make sense. Some examples:  ... until that employee’s employment with the Company has been voluntarily or involuntarily terminated for at least six months ... [The notion of voluntary termination is unorthodox. If this applies whether the employee quits or was fired, say that instead. Or   ceases to be an employee for any reason .] ... Restricted Shares may not be ... encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily, until the restrictions have lapsed and the rights to the Shares have vested. [It doesn’t make sense to prohibit someone from involuntarily encumbering shares, because that person wouldn’t be the one doing the encumbering. If   involuntarily   is intended to address a legitimate issue, address it some other way. And deleting   involuntarily  renders   voluntarily   redundant.] ... and hereby voluntarily releases and forever discharges Lender ... [The word   voluntarily   is redundant, as there’s no such thing as an involuntary release.] The Borrower may ... voluntarily prepay Revolving Loans ... [The word   voluntarily   is redundant, as there’s no such thing as involuntarily prepaying a debt.]  13.874   Similarly, the word   freely   is usually redundant:   The Landlord may freely lease ... .",
  "WARRANT ,   WARRANT CERTIFICATE ,   WARRANT AGREEMENT  13.875   A   warrant   is an instrument granting the holder a long-term option   to   buy   shares   at   a   fixed   price.   (See   13.879–.893 regarding the unrelated verb   to warrant   and noun   warranty .)  13.876   A warrant is an intangible right, but it’s evidenced by a document. Many drafters don’t distinguish the two: contracts refer to   exercise of this warrant   (that is, the intangible right) and   surrender of this warrant   (in other words, the document evidencing   that   right).   It   would   be   clearer   to   observe the distinction.  13.877   What you call the piece of paper depends on who signs it. If it’s signed by the issuer and the holder, call it a warrant agreement; if it’s signed by the issuer only, call it a warrant certificate.   Often   you’ll   have   a   warrant   agreement   that provides for issuance of warrant certificates.  WARRANTY , THE VERB   WARRANT  Background  13.878   As explained in 3.374–.411, it’s pointless and confusing to use the phrase   represents and warrants   (and   representations and warranties ) in a contract. But in sales contracts it’s standard to use   warrants   (and the noun   warranty ) on its own, without  represents   (and   representation ). But clearer and more concise choices are available.  Definition of   Warranty   and the Verb   Warrant  13.879   Warranty   is a term of art. Under common law, an express warranty is a seller’s affirmation of fact to the buyer, as an inducement   to   sale,   regarding   the   quality   or   quantity   of goods,   title,   or   restrictive   covenants   to   real   property.   See Howard O. Hunter,   Modern Law of Contracts   § 9.5 (2017).  13.880   But section 2-303 of the Uniform Commercial Code says, “Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the",
  "buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.” So under the UCC, a statement of fact can be a warranty (as is the case under common law) but so too can an obligation.  13.881   As for the verb   warrant ,   Black’s Law Dictionary   simply says in part that it means “to promise or guarantee.”  Using the Verb   Warrant   to Introduce a Statement of Fact  13.882   Considering definitions in isolation isn’t helpful. Instead, to understand   the   role   of   the   verb   warrant ,   one   needs   to consider it in context.  13.883   In   contracts,   one   function   of   warrants   is   to   introduce statements of fact, either present facts ( The Vendor warrants that the Software conforms to the Specifications ) or future facts ( The Vendor warrants that during the six months following the date   of   this   agreement ,   the   Software   will   conform   to the Specifications ).  13.884   Given that a statement doesn’t need to be called a warranty to be a warranty (see 3.392), it follows that one doesn’t need to use   warrants   with a statement of fact for that statement to be a warranty. So when used with a statement of fact, the sole function of   warrants   is the same as the function of   states  —to identify who is making the statement (see 3.371).  13.885   This manual recommends using   states   instead of   represents   to introduce a statement of fact (see 3.416). Consistency would seem to favor using   states   instead of   warrants , too, when introducing a statement of fact. But before considering that, one must first address another issue relating to the kinds of statement of fact that are introduced using   warrants .  13.886   More specifically, anyone making a statement of future facts couldn’t be aware of those facts, because those facts wouldn’t yet   exist.   Instead,   a   statement   of   future   facts   sets   a benchmark   against   which   warranty   obligations   will   be",
  "measured. That’s why statements of future facts introduced by   warrants   would   logically   be   followed,   although   not necessarily immediately, by a statement of the remedy that applies if the statement of fact is inaccurate. It would be more logical, and more efficient, to combine the statement of fact and remedy into a single sentence, turning the statement of future facts into a conditional clause and the remedy into the matrix clause (see 3.317).  13.887   Here’s an example:  Statement of Fact Followed by Remedy  The Vendor warrants that during the six months after the date of this agreement, the Equipment will conform to the Specifications. In the event of breach of the foregoing warranty, the Vendor shall modify or replace the Equipment.  Conditional Clause and Matrix Clause  If during the six months after the date of this agreement the Equipment fails to conform to the Specifications, the Vendor shall modify or replace the Equipment.  13.888   By contrast, statements of present facts (for example,   the Equipment is in good working order ) don’t share the illogic of statements of future facts, so you could retain them. If you do, introduce them using the verb you use to introduce other statements of fact—the manual recommends using   states   (see 3.416). But as with statements of future facts, you could combine statement of fact and remedy into a single sentence, as in   If no later than 15 days after the date of this agreement the Buyer notifies the Seller that the Equipment is not in good working order ,   then ... .   Doing so would eliminate the need for a verb to introduce the statement of fact. Whether it makes sense to do so depends on whether you’re able to express all desired remedies in that sentence.  Don’t Use the Verb   Warrant   to Introduce an Obligation",
  "13.889   Don’t   use   warrants   to   introduce   obligations,   as   in   Acme warrants   that   it   shall   perform   routine   maintenance   on   the Hardware   once   every   quarter .   It’s   an   example   of   what   this manual calls “throat-clearing” (see 3.25).  Using the Word   Warranty  13.890   The noun   warranty   can be used to refer to provisions in an agreement (as in   The warranties in this section 5 will not apply if ... ) and provisions absent from an agreement (as in   Acme makes no warranties ,   express or implied ). And even if you don’t use   warrants   in a provision, it would be appropriate to give it the heading   Warranty   or   Warranties   if that’s what the section consists of.  13.891   But whether a provision constitutes a warranty depends on its content, not on whether you’ve called it a warranty (see 3.391–.392). So although you might think all the warranties in a contract are to be found in the section with the heading  Warranties , a court could hold that a statement of fact or obligation   located   elsewhere   in   the   contract   constitutes   a warranty supporting an action for breach of warranty, even though the contract doesn’t refer to it as a warranty.  13.892   Similarly, even if a contract calls a provision a warranty, a court could hold that it’s a statement of fact supporting an action for misrepresentation.  WELL AND TRULY  13.893   The   phrase   well   and   truly   is   idiomatic   English.   It   means  completely :   We’re   well   and   truly   lost .   This   sort   of   lexical coupling   has   long   served   a   rhetorical   function.   Another example is   high and mighty .  13.894   Well and truly   also features in contracts, but it’s invariably redundant:  ... if each of the Obligations is   well and truly   performed in accordance with the Loan Documents ... .",
  "13.895   Well and truly   has long featured in a different kind of legal document, oaths. That’s presumably how   well and truly   has come   to   be   used   in   contracts.   Because   oaths   involve   an element of theater, rhetorical emphasis isn’t out of place in oaths. But it is out of place in contracts (see 1.58).  WILLFUL ,   WILLFULLY  13.896   As it’s usually used in contracts, the word   willful , as in   willful misconduct , is not only vague but also ambiguous. It means “intentional,”   but   drafters   usually   don’t   make   it   clear whether   the   focus   is   on   the   party’s   action   or   on   the consequences   of   the   party’s   action—it’s   possible   to   act intentionally   without   intending   to   cause   damages   (see 13.574). For a case that involved this ambiguity, see   Johnson & Johnson v. Guidant Corp. , 525 F. Supp. 2d 336, 349–51 (S.D.N.Y. 2007).  13.897   Instead of   willful   or   willfully , use   intentional   or   intentionally  (they’re clearer words) and specify that the party’s intent pertains to the consequences of its action (see 13.578 for an example   of   a   provision   that   does   that),   unless   given   the context   it   makes   more   sense   to   have   the   party’s   intent pertain to its taking that action.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING  13.898   Drafters use the phrase   without limiting the generality of the foregoing   to introduce one or more examples of a concept described in the immediately preceding language. But you should   almost   always   be   able   to   express   the   relationship between two blocks of text in less ponderous a manner.  13.899   One   problem   is   that   it’s   not   necessarily   clear   what   the foregoing   refers to. ( Notwithstanding the foregoing   suffers from the same problem; see 13.603.) But the main problem with this phrase is that it’s so ponderous.",
  "13.900   A simple alternative would be   including , which serves the same function (see 13.353). Not only is it shorter, it also allows you to express the same meaning in one sentence rather than two, thereby allowing you to eliminate further surplusage:  Acme shall not make any claim or take any action adverse to Bolin GPL’s ownership of or interest in   the Bolin Marks. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Lone Star shall not attempt to register   [read   the Bolin Marks, including registering ] any Bolin Mark or any mark confusingly similar thereto in any jurisdiction.  13.901   It   would   be   redundant   to   use   both   without   limiting   the generality of the foregoing   and   including :  If an Event of Default occurs, Mortgagee, in addition to any other rights, will have all rights granted a secured party on default under the Uniform Commercial Code, including   without limiting the generality of the foregoing   the right to take possession of the Collateral or any part thereof and to take such other measures as Mortgagee deems necessary to preserve the Collateral.  13.902   Another alternative would be to place the examples at the front and modify the general concept so that it becomes a catchall at the end:  Before  Each Credit Party is now and has always been in compliance with all Environmental and Safety Requirements.   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing , each Credit Party has obtained and complied with, and is in compliance with, all permits, licenses, and other authorizations required under Environmental and Safety Requirements for occupation of its facilities and operation of its business.  After  Each Credit Party (1) has obtained and complied with, and is in compliance with, all permits, licenses, and other authorizations required under Environmental and Safety Requirements for",
  "occupation of its facilities and operation of its business and (2) is in compliance with all other Environmental and Safety Requirements.  13.903   And you can keep the general concept and the examples in separate sentences if you use   includes   (or   include ):  Before  The General Partner shall manage the business and affairs of the Partnership.   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing , the General Partner shall do the following:  After  The General Partner shall manage the business and affairs of the Partnership. The General Partner’s duties include the following:  13.904   Sometimes what follows   without limiting the generality of the foregoing   is in fact not an example of what precedes it. In such cases, simply eliminate the phrase:  Each Note Purchaser and its advisors, if any, have been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of the Company and have received complete and satisfactory answers to any such inquiries.   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each  [read   Each ] Note Purchaser has also had the opportunity to obtain and to review the Company SEC Documents.  13.905   If   the   general   concept   and   the   examples   are   sufficiently unwieldy, it might make sense to use   without limiting the generality of the foregoing . But that’s unlikely to be the case.  13.906   A variant on   without limiting the generality of the foregoing   is   in furtherance   of   the   foregoing .   Sometimes   both   phrases   are conjoined, redundantly— in furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation thereof . The same considerations apply to both phrases, so you should be able to do without   in furtherance of the foregoing .  WITHOUT PREJUDICE",
  "13.907   Contracts refer to claims being dismissed   with prejudice , in other words in a way that finally disposes of a claim and bars any future action on that claim. That’s unobjectionable.  13.908   But   without prejudice   is different. It too is a litigation term of art; it refers to disposing of a claim in a way that doesn’t affect one’s legal rights. But when used in contracts,   without prejudice   is usually unnecessarily legalistic. Use instead   does not affect   or   will not affect :  That right of setoff   is without prejudice and in addition to   [read  does not affect ] any other right to which the Holder is otherwise entitled under this Note. That resignation will   be without prejudice to   [read   will not affect ] the contract rights of the Trust.  WORKMANLIKE  13.909   The word   workmanlike   is a term of art. A dated and gender- specific term of art.  13.910   Construction   law   acknowledges   an   implied   warranty   of workmanlike   performance.   And   workmanlike   features   in contracts:  Borrower shall only use contractors ... who generally have a good reputation for completing their work in a neat, prompt, and  workmanlike   manner ... . All Tenant Improvements must be done in a first-class  workmanlike   manner.  13.911   Caselaw offers many definitions of   workmanlike . For example, one court held that it means “doing the work in an ordinarily skilled manner as a skilled workman should do it.”   J. W. Hancock Enterprises ,   Inc. v. Registrar of Contractors , 617 P.2d 19, 22   (Ariz.   1980).   Another   held,   “We   define   good   and workmanlike as that quality of work performed by one who has the knowledge, training, or experience necessary for the successful practice of a trade or occupation and performed in",
  "a manner generally considered proficient by those capable of judging such work.”   Melody Home Manufacturing Co. v. Barnes , 741 S.W.2d 349, 354 (Tex. 1987). The wordiness of such definitions is a function of courts struggling, to no avail, to escape the clutches of vagueness.  13.912   A   simpler   alternative   to   workmanlike   is   competent .   Unless you’re   referring   to   the   implied   warranty,   consider   using  competent   and   competently   instead. But it would be even better to be specific, because the more specific you are regarding the work expected of contractors, the less you have to rely on  workmanlike   or other vague alternatives.",
  "NUMBERS AND FORMULAS  WORDS OR DIGITS Why Words and Digits?  14.1   Many drafters use both words and digits when stating a number,   placing   the   digits   in   parentheses:   six   (6) ;   five thousand dollars ($5,000) ;   eighteen percent (18%) ; and so forth. This practice may have arisen because drafters noted that numbers expressed in digits are easier to read than numbers expressed in words but are more vulnerable to typographic errors than are numbers expressed in words. Such glitches do happen. For example, in a mortgage prepared in New York in 1986,   the   principal   amount   was   erroneously   stated   as $92,885 rather than $92,885,000. The result was “a spate of litigation,   hundreds   of   thousands   of   dollars   in   legal   fees, millions   of   dollars   in   damages   and   an   untold   fortune   in embarrassment.”   David   Margolick,   At   the   Bar;   How   Three Missing Zeros Brought Red Faces and Cost Millions of Dollars , N.Y. Times, 4 Oct. 1991.  14.2   In theory, combining both usages affords the immediacy of digits   while   providing   insurance   against   a   transposed   or missing   decimal   point   or   one   or   more   extra,   missing,   or incorrect digits. This insurance was rendered more effective by the judicial rule of interpretation that a number expressed in words controls in the case of conflict. The words-and-digits approach has doubtless saved the occasional contract party (and its lawyer) from the adverse consequences of a missing decimal point or other error involving digits, or would have done had it been used.",
  "14.3   Another ostensible benefit to using words and digits is that digits can be hard to read in a fax, or a fax of a fax, or fifth- generation photocopy. But that’s not compelling, now that few people send faxes anymore.  Problems  GENERALLY  14.4   Those benefits come at a prohibitive cost. It’s tedious for the reader to encounter, at every turn, numbers expressed in both   words   and   digits.   And   this   belt-and-suspenders approach is faintly ludicrous when applied to all numbers throughout a contract, even though lower numbers are less susceptible   than   are   higher   numbers   to   a   significant typographical error that goes undetected. For use of words and digits in, for example,   three (3) members of the board of directors   to be of any benefit, those drafting and reviewing the contract would have to be particularly inattentive.  14.5   And using both words and digits violates a cardinal rule of drafting—that you shouldn’t say the same thing twice in a contract,   because   it   introduces   a   potential   source   of inconsistency (see 1.62). Even if when you first state a words- and-digits number the words and digits are consistent, they might become inconsistent in the course of revising a draft. It’s easy to see how that can happen—digits are more eye- catching than words, so you might change the digits but forget to change the words.  14.6   Because it’s more likely that any inconsistency is due to changing digits and forgetting to change the words, rather than vice versa, application of the rule that words govern might result in a court choosing a meaning that’s contrary to what the drafter had intended.  14.7   And using words and digits interferes with other usages in two minor but annoying ways. First, normally you would use a hyphen when a number is part of a phrasal adjective, as in  successive   five-year   periods .   If   you   use   words   and   digits,",
  "retaining the hyphen would look decidedly odd:   successive five (5)-year periods . The better choice would be to dispense with the hyphen, as in   successive five (5) year periods , but that would still be less than ideal.  14.8   And when the words-and-digits approach is used in a block of text that includes integrated enumerated clauses, that can result   in   the   reader   mistakenly   thinking,   if   only   for   a moment,   that   a   single-digit   in   parentheses   signals   the presence of an enumerated clause.  14.9   So using words and digits is more of a problem than the issue it was intended to fix—digit mistakes.  STATING   BIG   NUMBERS  14.10   It might seem that using words and digits for the one big number in, for example, loan documentation would be less annoying than using words and digits for all numbers in a contract. But if anything, big numbers are more prone to words-and-digits   inconsistency   than   are   smaller   numbers, because you’re less likely to read the words component if it’s several words long. And the consequences can be particularly unfortunate.  14.11   Charles R. Tips Family Trust v. PB Commercial LLC , 459 S.W.3d 147   (Tex.   App.   2015),   involved   a   dispute   over   a   loan agreement and guaranty in which the principal amount was stated as “ONE MILLION SEVEN THOUSAND AND NO/100 ($1,700,000.00) DOLLARS.” So the amount stated in words was $693,000 less than the amount stated in digits.  14.12   The Texas Court of Appeals held that the words prevailed over   the   digits—the   principal   amount   of   the   loan   was $1,007,000.00. By itself, that should come as no surprise, because courts generally accept the rule of interpretation that words prevail over digits. And the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in Texas says that “[i]f an instrument contains contradictory terms, typewritten terms prevail over printed terms,   handwritten   terms   prevail   over   both,   and   words",
  "prevail over numbers.” But more disconcertingly, the court also refused to consider parol evidence that the borrowers allegedly received $1.7 million from the lender.  Using First Words, Then Digits  14.13   So instead of using words and digits, use words for whole numbers one through ten and use digits for numbers 11 and above.   Garner’s   Modern   English   Usage ,   at   639,   also recommends that approach, whereas   The Chicago Manual of Style , at 9.2, recommends using words for whole numbers through 100. Because contracts prose is relatively numbers- heavy, this manual prefers an earlier transition.  14.14   The   words-to-digits   approach   applies   to   ordinal   numbers ( seventh ,   22nd )   as   well   as   cardinal   numbers.   There   are exceptions: use digits for whole numbers below 11 in lists of numbers; when numbers occur frequently in the text; in percentages; and in statements of amounts of money (see 13.513) and times of day. And use words for numbers 11 and over at the beginning of sentences. But which system you use is less important than ensuring that you don’t distract the reader by being inconsistent.  14.15   Use just digits for the big number in a contract, although it can be appropriate to use a mix of words and digits to express very large amounts of money (see 13.518).  14.16   Using only digits does leave one prone to digit errors. The best fix for that? Proofreading.  Using Only Digits for All Numbers  14.17   In   Numbers: Figures or Words: A Convention Under the Spotlight , 50   Clarity   32   (Nov.   2003),   the   Australian   legal-writing commentator   Robert   Eagleson   argues   that   in   legal documents, all numbers should be stated in digits, and that “the convention that certain numbers must occur as words has a strong streak of irrationality about it.”",
  "14.18   This   manual   doesn’t   recommend   adopting   Eagleson’s approach. For one thing, in everyday English it makes sense to shift from words to digits once numbers pass a certain point. Using digits is redolent of prose used in numbers- heavy fields, so numbers can seem intrusive, as in   We ordered only 1 pizza . But stating larger numbers in digits makes them much easier to read. And with larger numbers, you’re more likely to be in a numbers world.  14.19   It would be more efficient to use only digits to state numbers in   contracts.   And   arguably,   contracts   prose   is   sufficiently numbers-heavy to justify using only digits. But shifting from traditional   contract   prose   to   something   more   modern requires   accepting   pervasive   change.   Instead   of   asking drafters to abandon an entrenched and relatively harmless general-writing usage, this manual focuses on change with greater implications. But you can elect to make this change yourselves.  FORMULAS  14.20   Contracts   often   include   provisions   that   address   how   to calculate, post-signing, a given quantum, such as an interest rate, the number of surplus shares an investor may purchase, or the amount by which the exercise price of an option should be adjusted. Formulas can be expressed in ordinary contract prose or with mathematical equations.  Using Prose  SIMPLE   FORMULAS  14.21   At their simplest, contract formulas involve only one kind of calculation, as in   Acme shall pay Roe an amount equal to X  [ plus ]   [ minus ]   [ multiplied   by ]   [ divided   by ]   Y.   (Don’t   use   a comma before   plus ,   minus ,   multiplied by , or   divided by.   And when calculating an amount of money, insert the phrase   an amount equal to   before the calculation to reflect that money is",
  "fungible.)   With   such   simple   formulas,   concision   favors omitting any extra phrases referring to the end product of calculation, as in   an amount equal to   the sum of   X plus Y   and  an amount equal to   the excess of X over   [insert   X minus ]   Y.   Such phrases have their uses in other contexts (see 14.27, 14.29, and 14.35).  14.22   A quantum can also be expressed as a percentage of a given amount, as in   an amount equal to 5% of the Overdue Amount .  SPECIFYING   THE   ORDER   OF   OPERATIONS  14.23   With   formulas   involving   only   addition   or   only multiplication, you don’t have to be concerned about the order in which to perform the operations. For example, the result of the calculation 2 + 3 + 4 isn’t affected by the order in which the numbers are added. This isn’t the case when, for example, a formula combines addition and multiplication. The calculation 2 × 3 + 4 gives two different results, 10 or 14, depending on which operation you perform first. (Confusion regarding the order of operations is a specialized form of ambiguity   and   is   analogous   to   the   “squinting   modifier”; see 12.18.)  14.24   In   mathematics,   the   convention   is   that   you   first   do   all operations   that   lie   inside   parentheses,   then   do   all multiplication and division, and finally do all addition and subtraction. So if in the calculation 2 × 3 + 4 the addition is to be performed first, it would be expressed as 2 × (3 + 4). If the multiplication is to be performed first, the calculation could, according to mathematical convention, be left as is, but   if   the   calculation   were   to   be   performed   by   someone unfamiliar with mathematical convention—by a lawyer, for example—it would be advisable to use parentheses in this calculation, too: (2 × 3) + 4.  14.25   The order of operations also affects the result of a formula that includes both addition and subtraction. For example, if in the calculation 10 − 4 + 2 the addition is to be performed",
  "first, it should be expressed as 10 − (4 + 2), with 4 as the result.   If   the   subtraction   is   to   be   performed   first,   a convention to the effect that you proceed from left to right in performing additions and subtractions would allow you to do   without   parentheses.   But   you   can’t   count   on   that convention being universally recognized, so the calculation should be expressed as (10 − 4) + 2, with 8 as the result.  14.26   When a mathematical formula is written in words, you can’t use parentheses to specify the order of operations. Instead, two other mechanisms are available, and to avoid any chance of confusion, one or the other should be used whenever priority is to be given one or more operations.  14.27   One   mechanism   is   use   of   the   word   result   to   isolate   an operation from the rest of the formula. This is usually done by   using   the   phrase   the   result   of   before   the   operation   in question, as in this example (the three values that constitute the variables in the formula are shaded):  After the Close of the Distribution, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to a Nonconvertible Parent Option will equal the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that immediately before the Distribution Date are subject to that Nonconvertible Parent Option multiplied by   the result of   the Parent Stock Value divided by the Parent Opening Stock Value.  14.28   The phrase   the result of   indicates that it is the result of the operation that follows the phrase (rather than either variable in that operation) that is to be factored into the rest of the formula. But   the result of   doesn’t indicate the nature of the following operation; that’s conveyed by using   X   [ plus ]   [ minus ] [ multiplied   by ]   [ divided   by ]   Y .   (Don’t   use   and   to   indicate addition.)   Since   it’s   open-ended,   the   phrase   the   result   of  eliminates ambiguity only if the operation that it relates to occurs at the end of a formula.  14.29   Instead of   the result of , drafters often use   the   [ sum ]   [ difference ] [ product ]   [ quotient ]   of   with   calculation   by   addition, subtraction,   multiplication,   and   division,   respectively.",
  "Because each of these terms conveys the operation being performed, it’s standard to refer to, for example,   the quotient of X and Y.   But you can’t count on readers knowing what these terms mean (other than   sum ), so you would instead need to refer to, for example,   the quotient of X divided by Y   or  the quotient obtained by dividing X by Y . Because it would be tautological to do so, the phrase   the result of   represents a better alternative: it’s simple and it applies to all calculations. But   occasionally   it’s   necessary   to   use   one   of   the   other phrases, to avoid repetition (see 14.35–.36).  14.30   There are yet further ways of expressing subtraction, but they should   be   avoided   whatever   the   context.   The   phrase   the amount by which A exceeds B   is wordy; the phrase   the excess of A over B   could be confusing, since   A over B   could also be used to express a fraction; and   the difference between A and B   could also be confusing, since the difference between 5 and 7 could conceivably be either 2 or −2.  14.31   Another   way   the   word   result   can   be   used   to   isolate   an operation from the rest of the formula is by (1) placing at the front   of   the   formula   the   operation   that’s   to   be   isolated, (2) referring thereafter to the result of that operation, and (3) using in the formula the present participle form of the verb of calculation. The following formula represents the formula in 14.27 as revised to reflect this approach (again, the values that constitute the variables in the formula are shaded):  After the Close of the Distribution, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to a Nonconvertible Parent Option will be determined by dividing the Parent Stock Value by the Parent Opening Stock Value and multiplying   the result   by the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that immediately before the Distribution Date are subject to that Nonconvertible Parent Option.  14.32   A second way to avoid ambiguity is to use enumeration, as in this variant of the example in 14.27:  After the Close of the Distribution, the number of shares of",
  "Parent Common Stock subject to a Nonconvertible Parent Option will equal (1) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that immediately before the Distribution Date are subject to that Nonconvertible Parent Option multiplied by (2) the Parent Stock Value divided by the Parent Opening Stock Value.  14.33   Enumeration   is   equivalent   to   placing   parentheses   around each enumerated clause.  WHEN   A   FORMULA   CONTAINS   THREE   OR   MORE   SEQUENTIAL   OPERATIONS  14.34   In mathematical equations, you can have parentheses within parentheses—the   result   of   one   calculation   features   in   a second calculation, the result of which features in a third calculation, and so on. The equivalent is found in contract formulas expressed in prose. The added complexity means that uncertainty regarding which operations come first is best addressed by using enumeration, as described in 14.32.  14.35   In this context, the phrase   the result of   is inadequate to make clear which operation comes first, but it nevertheless comes in handy. Consider this example:  “ Eurodollar Rate ” means, regarding a Eurodollar Advance for the relevant Interest Period, (1)   the result of   (A) the Eurodollar Base Rate applicable to that Interest Period divided by (B) one minus the Reserve Requirement (expressed as a decimal) applicable to that Interest Period plus (2) the Applicable Margin.  14.36   In this example, the phrase   the result of   doesn’t clarify the order   of   operations—that’s   accomplished   by   enumeration. But   it   does   serve   a   different   function.   This   formula   is equivalent   to   parentheses   within   parentheses,   with   the enumeration   (1)   and   (A)   acting   as   the   equivalent   of   two opening   parentheses.   In   algebraic   equations   featuring parentheses within parentheses, the two opening or closing parentheses are located immediately next to each other. But inserting the phrase   the result of   between the enumerations makes   it   clearer   to   the   reader   how   the   elements   of   the formula   relate   to   each   other;   it’s   best   not   to   place",
  "enumerations next to each other without intervening text (see 14.29).  14.37   Here’s an example of a formula that features the equivalent of two sets of double parentheses within a further set of parentheses:  If there are any outstanding Closing Date Liabilities (other than the Identified Debt) or any outstanding Purchaser Claims at the time that the Seller wishes to transfer any Shares, the Seller may transfer only that number of Shares equal to (1)   the result of  (A)   the product of   (i) the aggregate number of Shares held by the Seller multiplied by (ii) the Stipulated Value minus (B)   the sum of  (i) the aggregate dollar amount of the outstanding Closing Date Liabilities (other than the Identified Debt) plus (ii) the aggregate dollar amount of the Purchaser Claims divided by (2) the Stipulated Value.  14.38   Emphasized in bold are three instances of a filler phrase used to keep apart enumerations. Since using   the result of   three times   would   have   made   for   confusion,   two   alternative phrases were also used, despite the tautology (see 14.29).  AN   INSTANCE   OF   FORMULA   AMBIGUITY  14.39   The   English   case   Chartbrook   Limited   v.   Persimmon   Homes Limited and others   [2009] UKHL 38 provides an example of formula   ambiguity   leading   to   dispute.   The   following language was at issue:  23.4% of the price achieved for each Residential Unit in excess of the Minimum Guaranteed Residential Unit Value less the Costs and Incentives.  14.40   It could be interpreted two ways:  Meaning 1  An amount equal to (1) 23.4% of the price achieved for each Residential Unit in excess of the Minimum Guaranteed Residential Unit Value minus (2) the Costs and Incentives.",
  "Meaning 2  An amount equal to 23.4% of the result of (1) the price achieved for each Residential Unit in excess of the Minimum Guaranteed Residential Unit Value minus (2) the Costs and Incentives.  14.41   (“Costs and Incentives” was a label for a single value. If it had meant “Costs plus Incentives,” that would have added to the mix an additional operation and additional alternative meanings.)  14.42   The House of Lords held that the first meaning was the appropriate   one.   If   the   drafter   had   used   enumeration   to express that meaning unambiguously, the parties would have been spared three levels of court review.  AN   INSTANCE   OF   FORMULA   MISTAKE  14.43   An opinion of the Quebec Superior Court offers an instance not of formula ambiguity but of mistake in ordering the operations.   Here’s   the   language   that   ended   up   in   the contract:  “Resort Operation Payment Amount” means the amount, if any, equal to the amount by which (a) 4.8 times Net Resort EBITDA during the Resort Operation Payment Calculation Period exceeds (b) $2,000,000;  14.44   Here’s what it should have said:  “Resort Operation Payment Amount” means the amount, if any, equal to 4.8 times the amount by which (a) Net Resort EBITDA during the Resort Operation Payment Calculation Period exceeds (b) $2,000,000.  14.45   The drafter’s mistake was to put the words “the amount by which” before “4.8 times” instead of after. The result was that instead of owing nothing, her client (Intrawest, a developer and manager of ski and golf resorts) found itself subject to a claim for C$6,203,632.",
  "14.46   Perhaps   if   this   formula   had   been   expressed   as   a mathematical equation (see 14.60) the drafter would have spotted the mistake.  FRACTIONS  14.47   A   standard   component   of   formulas,   including   contract formulas,   is   fractions.   They   are   used   when   a   pro-rata quantum is being calculated. The following sentence is a representative example of language used to express fractions in prose:  Each Investor who elects to purchase Nonpurchased Units may purchase a number of Nonpurchased Units calculated by multiplying the number of Nonpurchased Units by a fraction, the numerator of which is the maximum number of Units that Electing Investor has agreed to purchase under this agreement and the denominator of which is the maximum number of Units that all Electing Investors have agreed to purchase under this agreement.  14.48   A fraction could always be expressed more succinctly as the value   of   the   numerator   divided   by   the   value   of   the denominator, but expressing a calculation as a fraction serves as a helpful signal that a number is being prorated. If a number is not being prorated, a fraction should not be used as an alternative to dividing one number by the other.  “ EXPRESSED   AS   A   PERCENTAGE ”  14.49   Often a drafter will want to express the result of a calculation as   a   percentage.   For   example,   it   would   be   more comprehensible   to   speak   in   terms   of   a   lender   having   an Aggregate Exposure Percentage of 22.45% rather than, say, an Aggregate Exposure Factor of 0.2245.  14.50   When   a   formula   includes   a   fraction,   the   result   can   be converted to a percentage by referring, in the formula, to   a fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which   ... . One can also express as a percentage the result of a division",
  "calculation:   “Offeree Percentage” means, as to each offeree, the result, expressed as a percentage, of   the total number of Common Stock Equivalents held by that offeree divided by the total number of Common Stock Equivalents.  14.51   When   specifying   that   a   number   is   to   be   expressed   as   a percentage, drafters sometimes use a ratio:   “Aggregate Exposure Percentage” means, regarding any Lender at any time, the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of that Lender’s Aggregate Exposure at that time to the Aggregate Exposure of all Lenders at that time . It’s simpler to use a division calculation instead.  14.52   Converting   a   number   to   a   percentage   requires   that   you multiply it by 100, and drafters sometimes state as much in a formula:   The   Sale   Percentage   applicable   to   each   Stockholder equals the result, multiplied by 100, of the aggregate number of Shares of the Majority Group proposed to be transferred in that Sale   divided   by   the   aggregate   number   of   Shares   held   by   the Majority   Group.   But   you   don’t   need   to   be   that   specific, because “expressed as a percentage” is clear enough.  ROUNDING  14.53   When a contract contains a formula, it’s generally a good idea to provide for rounding of the result.  14.54   What increment you use depends on what’s being rounded; convention   may   play   a   part.   Shares   of   stock   are   usually rounded to the nearest whole share; bank interest rates, by contrast, are often rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%. Rounding can also be expressed in terms of decimal places; lending documents routinely contain formulas that require calculation to up to nine decimal places.  14.55   Also specify whether amounts are to be rounded up to the nearest increment, rounded down to the nearest increment, or rounded up or down, whichever increment is nearest. Again, convention may play a part. For example, lenders tend to round interest rates up. Although there exists a convention that decimal numbers are rounded up or down, whichever is",
  "nearest,   you   can’t   count   on   that   convention   being recognized.  14.56   An   issue   relating   to   rounding   up   or   down,   whichever increment   is   nearest,   is   how   to   round   an   amount   that’s exactly halfway between increments. For example, if one is rounding up or down to the nearest cent, does one round $1.245 to $1.24 or $1.25? The convention in mathematics is to round up, but if you want to avoid confusion on the subject, specify how such amounts are to be treated.  14.57   Rounding can be addressed within a formula, for example by referring to   the result,   [ rounded up to the nearest whole share ] [ rounded   down   to   the   nearest   cent ]   [ rounded   up   or   down, whichever is nearer, to three decimal places ] , of X multiplied by Y . But   if   a   contract   contains   several   formulas,   it   might   be efficient   to   address   rounding   in   an   internal   rule   of interpretation:   All calculations in   [ this agreement ] [ this section 2.4 ]   are to the nearest cent (with $.005 being rounded upward) and to the nearest one-tenth of a share (with .05 of a share being rounded upward) .  14.58   Rounding can be awkward when a fixed number or quantity is   allocated   pro   rata   among   a   group.   For   example,   a shareholders agreement might provide that the shares of a selling shareholder are to be allocated pro rata among those of   the   remaining   shareholders   who   wish   to   purchase.   If, when implementing this provision, you round up the shares allocated to each remaining shareholder, you risk having the remaining shareholders agree to buy more shares than are actually   being   sold;   if   you   round   down,   you   risk   having shares   left   over;   if   you   round   up   or   down,   whichever   is nearest, you risk one or the other outcome. The best course is to round down; when the time comes to allocate shares, the purchasing   shareholders   would   presumably   be   willing   to have   the   numbers   adjusted   to   include   any   selling shareholder’s leftover shares.  TABULATION",
  "14.59   To make it easier to read, you could tabulate the enumerated clauses   included   in   a   formula.   (Regarding   tabulating enumerated clauses, see 4.41.) But if a formula is sufficiently complex that it would benefit from tabulation, it’s likely that it   would   benefit   even   more   from   being   expressed   as   a mathematical equation (see 14.60).  Using Mathematical Equations  14.60   The more complex a formula is, the more likely it is that expressing   it   as   a   mathematical   equation   rather   than   in words would make it clearer.  14.61   For   example,   the   formula   in   14.37   would   be   easier   to understand if expressed as this mathematical equation:  If there are any outstanding Closing Date Liabilities (other than the Identified Debt) or any outstanding Purchaser Claims when the Seller wishes to transfer any Shares, the Seller may transfer a number of Shares no greater than the number of Shares calculated according to this formula:  X   =  In this formula, the following applies: X   =   the number of shares that the Seller may transfer SS   =   the aggregate number of Shares held by the Seller SV   =   the Stipulated Value CDL   =   the aggregate dollar amount of the outstanding Closing Date Liabilities, other than the Identified Debt PC   =   the aggregate dollar amount of the Purchaser Claims  14.62   You shouldn’t need to use the percent sign in mathematical equations, and doing so could cause confusion: 3 ÷ 4% could conceivably   mean   either   75%   (with   the   percent   sign conveying “expressed as a percentage”) or 0.75%. If you want",
  "a result to be expressed as a percentage (see 14.49), say so in the prose preamble to the equation.  14.63   If a mathematical equation is particularly complicated, it can be   helpful   to   include   in   a   schedule,   as   an   illustration,   a sample set of calculations.  CONSECUTIVE RANGES OF NUMBERS Distinguishing between “Stepped Rates” and “Shifting Flat Rates”  14.64   When in a contract a quantity is determined by reference to another quantity—as when a royalty or commission is based on sales of widgets—the relationship can often be expressed by a simple formula. For example, a royalty can be expressed as a stated percentage of annual gross revenue from sale of widgets,   or   it   can   instead   be   expressed   as   a   per-widget amount.  14.65   But parties might want a different formula to apply as the quantity being referred to changes. For example, Acme and Widgetco might want to provide that the royalty rate that Acme pays to Widgetco on sales of widgets will increase as the number of widgets that Acme sells increases. Specifically, they   agree   to   the   following   royalty   schedule,   with   the royalties based on a percentage of annual gross revenue from sale   of   widgets,   the   percentage   increasing   as   revenue increases.  Annual Gross Revenue   Royalty  Not over $1 million   5% Over $1 million but not over $2 million   6% Over $2 million but not over $3 million   7% Over $3 million but not over $4 million   8% Over $4 million but not over $5 million   9% Over $5 million",
  "10%  14.66   But this schedule is ambiguous. If the annual gross revenue is $3.4 million, it’s not clear from this schedule whether the 8% rate is applied to all gross revenue (this manual refers to such a   rate   as   a   “shifting   flat   rate”)   or   only   revenue   over   $3 million, with the lower rates being applied to the increments of revenue under $3 million (this manual refers to such a combined rate as a “stepped rate”).  14.67   There are three ways to express the schedule in 14.65 as a stepped rate. One way would be as follows:   5% of the first million dollars of annual gross revenue; 6% of the next million dollars; 7% of the next million dollars; 8% of the next million dollars; 9% of the next million dollars; and 10% thereafter . (This is the method used to express the “Lehman formula” used in calculating compensation for investment banking services.) Alternatively, a single range could be expressed as follows:  When the annual gross revenue from sale of widgets exceeds $1 million, the royalty rate on the next $1 million will be 6% .  14.68   The second way to express a stepped rate would be to use instead   the   table   below.   This   is   perhaps   the   clearest alternative. (This method is used by the Internal Revenue Service to explain tax schedules.)  Annual Gross Revenue   Royalty  Not over $1 million   5% of the total amount Over $1 million but not over $2 million  $5,000 plus 6% of the amount over $1 million Over $2 million but not over $3 million  $11,000 plus 7% of the amount over $2 million Over $3 million but not over $4 million  $18,000 plus 8% of the amount over $3 million Over $4 million but not over $5 million  $26,000 plus 9% of the amount over $4 million Over $5 million   $35,000 plus 10% of the amount over $5 million",
  "14.69   The third way to express a stepped rate would be to so state in the preamble to the table:   The royalty percentage stated next to a given range of annual gross revenue will be used to calculate only royalties to be paid on revenue falling within that range .  14.70   Conversely, if a given percentage does apply to all gross revenue—in other words, if the rate is a shifting flat rate— one way to make that clear would be to state as much in the preamble to the table:   The percentage stated next to the range of annual gross revenue within which falls the annual gross revenue for a given year will be used to calculate all royalties to be paid on that revenue as opposed to just royalties to be paid on revenue falling within the stated range.   It would not be clear enough to state,   for   example,   that   royalties   are   based   on   the “incremental rates” stated in the table.  14.71   A second and simpler way to express a shifting flat rate would   be   to   add   of   total   gross   annual   revenue   after   each percentage figure in the second column.  Gaps and Overlaps  14.72   When expressing consecutive ranges of numbers as described in 14.65, drafters sometimes create overlap. For example, if royalties are keyed to the number of widgets sold, if two of the ranges are “1–10 widgets” and “10–20 widgets,” and if ten widgets are sold, it would not be clear which royalty rate applies. To avoid overlap, the two ranges should have been expressed   as   “1–10   widgets”   and   “11–20   widgets.”   If   the contract provides for a shifting flat rate (see 14.66), more would be at stake than if it had provided for a stepped rate. In the former case, the rate to be applied to all widget sales would be at issue; in the latter case, the question would be the royalty rate that applies to the sale of the tenth widget.  14.73   Overlap can also occur when creating consecutive ranges of numbers that can be expressed to decimal places, such as dollar amounts, as in “from $1,000 to $2,000” and “from $2,000 to $3,000.” You could fix this overlap in one of two",
  "ways. You could revise the ranges so one ends just before the other begins, as in “from $1,000.01 to $2,000” and “from $2,000.01 to $3,000.” (Depending on the unit making up the ranges, it might be necessary to express to several decimal places one of the two numbers in a range.) Or you could use wording similar to that used in the tables in 14.65 and 14.68: “over $1,000 but not over $2,000” and “over $2,000 but not over $3,000.” This would seem the simpler, and therefore better, alternative.  14.74   Revising the ranges to read “from $1,000 to $1,999” and “from $2,000 to $2,999” would create a different problem, namely a gap between two ranges, leaving unclear the range into   which   $1,999.01,   $1,999.99,   and   any   amount   in between would fall. But such a gap is appropriate if the unit involved comes only in whole units. For example, because it doesn’t make sense to speak of half a widget, there is no gap between the ranges in the last sentence of 14.72.  14.75   When   consecutive   ranges   consist   of   dates   rather   than amounts, take care to avoid gaps and overlap due to the ambiguity inherent in many prepositions used in expressing dates (see 10.22).",
  "INTERNAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION  15.1   In contract disputes, courts invoke rules of interpretation to attribute   meaning   to   confusing   or   disputed   contract language.   Judicial   rules   of   interpretation   are   generalized notions, pieced together by courts and commentators over time, about the most likely meaning that writers express, and readers derive, in a given context.  15.2   Some contracts include their own rules of interpretation— what this manual calls “internal” rules of interpretation. Each is stated in a separate section, or they’re collected in one section,   usually   under   the   heading   Interpretation   or  Construction .  15.3   This chapter contains tidied-up versions of common internal rules of interpretation, divided into three types. The first type is comparable to autonomous definitions: they apply a stated meaning   to   a   particular   kind   of   expression.   This   chapter considers only two examples; for another example, see 14.57. The second type states the obvious, or aims to accomplish something that a drafter could achieve more clearly or simply using other means. For another example, see 6.49–.50. And the   third   type   overreaches   in   trying   to   create   order;   for another example, see 17.37. The first type might be useful; the second type you can do without; and you shouldn’t rely on the third type.  15.4   Just as judicial rules of interpretation are problematic (for example, see 12.13 regarding the rule of the last antecedent), internal   rules   of   interpretation   usually   aren’t   compelling.",
  "Generally, if you can’t count on readers understanding basic usages in your contracts without help, something is amiss.  15.5   Internal   rules   of   interpretation   are   different   from autonomous   definitions,   but   autonomous   definitions   are often included with internal rules. They should instead be placed in the definition section, if the contract has one.  15.6   Some internal rules of interpretation begin “Unless otherwise specified” or “Unless the context otherwise requires.” The latter formulation undercuts the certainty that this sort of provision is meant to offer (see 13.866).  THESE MIGHT BE USEFUL  15.7   All references to a time of day are references to the time in  [ location ]. This provision would spare the drafter having to specify, after each reference to a time of day, which location or time zone would be used to determine when that time of day had come. This would be an issue only in a contract between parties based in different time zones or in a contract providing for business to be conducted across time zones (see 10.50). This provision would be of use only in contracts containing more than a couple of references to the time of day.  15.8   If any date specified in this agreement as the only day, or the last day, for taking action falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then that action may be taken on the next Business Day . This provision aims to avoid having a party’s ability to act on a given day undercut because that day isn’t a business day. It would be redundant in a contract that measures all periods of time in business days (see 10.72).  THESE ARE UNNECESSARY, OR SHOULD BE  15.9   References in this agreement to articles, sections, exhibits, and schedules   are   references   to   articles,   sections,   exhibits,   and",
  "schedules of this agreement . This states the obvious (see 4.105, 5.106).  15.10   The definitions in this agreement apply equally to both singular and plural forms of the terms defined . This is intended to ensure that, for example, the definition of   Employee   applies to any reference   to   Employees ,   or   that   the   definition   of   Consents  applies   to   a   reference   to   any   Consent .   But   this   would manifestly be the case even absent this provision. (For the same reason, defining terms in the singular and plural just adds clutter; see 6.4.)  15.11   Any reference to an agreement means that agreement as amended, subject to any restrictions on amendment in that agreement . This provision spares drafters having to add   as amended   after each reference to a contract. But given that adding   as amended   is unnecessary (see 13.54), this provision should be unnecessary too.  15.12   Any reference to a statute or regulation means that statute or regulation   as   amended   and   any   corresponding   provisions   of successor statutes and regulations . This provision is analogous to the provision in 15.11, and equally unnecessary.  15.13   The words “party” and “parties” refer only to a named party to this agreement . This provision aims to preclude a court from concluding, regarding a contract provision specifying that no rights or remedies are being conferred on anyone other than the parties, that the term   parties   includes persons other than the named parties. But there’s a more economical way to address that issue (see 2.113).  15.14   A pronoun used in referring generally to any member of a class of persons, or persons and things, applies to each member of that class, whether of the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender . This would allow a drafter to use gender-specific language in a contract without running the risk of a court holding that, for example, use of only masculine pronouns in that contract excludes corporations from the scope of certain provisions.",
  "But it would be unnecessary if you were to use gender-neutral drafting, which is always a good idea (see 17.11).  15.15   The words “hereof,” “herein,” “hereunder,” and “hereby” refer to this agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this agreement . This doesn’t accurately reflect use of   hereby   in language of performance (see 3.35). But more to the point, you shouldn’t use   here - words at all, except for   hereby   in language of performance (see 13.349–.350).  15.16   For computing periods of time from a specified date to a later specified date, the word “from” means “from and including” and the words “to” and “until” each mean “to but excluding.”   This provision is fine as far as it goes, but it addresses only a small part of the ambiguity inherent in references to time (see chapter   10).   A   provision   resolving   all   sources   of   that ambiguity would be long and unwieldy. Instead of addressing a small part of the problem, you would do better to purge each reference of any ambiguity. That would require that you become familiar with the ways that references to time can be ambiguous.  THESE OVERREACH BY TRYING TO CREATE ORDER  15.17   The headings in this agreement are provided for convenience only and do not affect its meaning . This seeks to render insignificant any   inconsistency   between   the   heading   given   a   contract provision and the substance of that provision (see 4.22). But if it’s clear that because of careless drafting a heading doesn’t match what’s in the related provision, this provision would accomplish only what a court would likely do anyway. If it’s arguable that a unique component of a heading reflects the intended scope of the related provision, then a court might ignore   a   headings-for-convenience   provision.   See,   e.g.,  Infrassure, Ltd. v. First Mutual Transportation Assurance Co. , No. 16-306, 2016 WL 6775921, at *1 (2d Cir. 16 Nov. 2016). That makes this provision of questionable use to drafters.",
  "15.18   The words “including,” “includes,” and “include” are to be read as if they were followed by the phrase “without limitation.”   For why this unhelpful, see 13.363, 13.379–.385.  15.19   The word “or” is disjunctive; the word “and” is conjunctive ; also  The   word   “or”   is   not   exclusive .   Given   the   subtle   ways   the ambiguity associated with   and   and   or   manifests itself (see chapter 11), these two provisions grossly oversimplify. For one thing, consider how, regarding   or , they take opposite approaches.  15.20   The word “will” is to be construed as having the same meaning as the word “shall.”   This provision represents a hopeless attempt to resolve confusion over use of   will   and   shall   (see 3.72–.103).  15.21   The word “shall” is used to express a mandatory duty; the word “may”   is   used   to   express   discretion .   If   as   this   manual recommends you use   shall   only to impose a duty on a party that’s the subject of the sentence, you wouldn’t need this, because courts generally hold that in a contract (as opposed to   legislation),   shall   is   mandatory   (see   3.73).   And   those drafters   who   indulge   in   the   traditional   overuse   of   shall  shouldn’t use this provision, since it couldn’t be applied to their drafting.  15.22   The singular form of nouns and pronouns includes the plural, and vice versa . Presumably what this provision is groping at is the notion that any reference to   a widget   should be construed to mean   one or more widgets . If that’s the meaning you wish to convey, then say   one or more widgets   rather than relying on this overbroad provision (see 11.6). And you shouldn’t rely on this kind of internal principle to prevent a fight over singular versus plural (see 11.8).  15.23   A   reference   to   any   Person   is   to   be   construed   to   include   that Person’s successors and assigns . It would be more usual, and clearer, to address this with a provision specifying to what extent   a   party   may   transfer   elements   of   its   performance under the contract.",
  "TYPOGRAPHY  16.1   Word-processing software has given drafters many options for   making   a   contract   more   readable   or,   conversely, impenetrable. Here are some points to consider.  FONTS The Usual Suspects  16.2   When it comes to choosing a font for contracts, drafters are conservative. Most contracts use one of a handful of fonts.  16.3   In recent decades, the overwhelming majority of contracts have used one of two fonts, namely 12-point Times New Roman, a serif font, and 10-point Arial, a sans serif font. (For an explanation of   serif   and   sans serif , see 16.13.) Companies in technical fields used the latter; everyone else used the former. Both are shown in sample 10.  16.4   Despite its enduring popularity, Times New Roman is not a favorite of typography professionals. It was designed for use in a newspaper, so it has comparatively narrow characters. It works well in the short lines of newspaper columns, but in longer lines, compared with other fonts, Times New Roman can seem crowded and harder to read.   The Complete Manual of Typography ,   at   70,   says,   “Times   is   probably   used inappropriately more than any other typeface today.”  16.5   Beyond that, Times New Roman suffers from overexposure.  Typography   for   Lawyers ,   at   119,   says,   “When   Times   New Roman appears in a book, document, or advertisement, it",
  "connotes apathy ... . Times New Roman is not a font choice so much as the absence of a font choice, like the blackness of deep space is not a color.” It goes on to say, “If you have a choice about using Times New Roman,   please stop . You have plenty of better alternatives.”  16.6   Arial   too   is   unpopular   in   the   typography   community.  Typography for Lawyers , at 80, says, “After 25 years as a system font, Arial has achieved a ubiquity that rivals Times New Roman. And like Times New Roman ... , Arial is permanently associated with the work of people who will never care about typography.”  16.7   Two plausible alternatives are Calibri and Constantia (see sample 10), introduced by Microsoft in 2007. Calibri, a sans serif font, is the default font for body text in Office 2016; Constantia is a serif font. The Word 2016 default font for body text is 11-point Calibri. Both Calibri and Constantia were designed for screen reading; the loss of design details makes   them   less   compelling   in   printed   form.   In   its classification of system fonts,   Typography for Lawyers , at 79, puts both Calibri and Constantia in “The B list: OK in limited doses.”  SAMPLE 10   TYPEFACES (USING   MSCD   FIRST-LINE-INDENT ENUMERATION SCHEME)",

  "16.8   The author of this manual switched from Times New Roman to Calibri. That’s why the indented extracts of contract text throughout this manual are in Calibri, as are the samples and the redrafted version of the contract in the appendix. With its rounded ends and variation in line width, Calibri might be palatable to both Arial users and those who use Times New Roman.  Constraints on Choice  16.9   Drafters could be more adventurous in their choice of font. But   understanding   the   options   requires   considering   the constraints that come with sharing electronic documents.  16.10   If you pick a font that isn’t recognized by someone else’s computer, it will be displayed in some fallback font. That would   interfere   with,   for   example,   exchanging   signature pages. It might also interfere with negotiations, because the line breaks and page breaks in the recipient’s version would likely be different from those in the sender’s version. You could try to get around that by distributing only PDF files, but that’s generally frowned upon by those who work with contracts.  16.11   So   your   best   bet   is   to   use   system   fonts—those   already installed on your computer—as opposed to professional fonts",
  "you buy online and install. It’s likely that those you send a document to will have them on their computer. You can’t be sure of perfect visual fidelity, but that shouldn’t be an issue when exchanging drafts of contracts.  16.12   But there are system fonts on Mac computers, system fonts on computers running Windows, and fonts installed with MS Office. If you want a font that works across all systems, your choice would be limited to a few fonts. But for exchanging drafts with law firms and company law departments, it’s safe to assume that they have Microsoft Office installed on their computers. That would give you more fonts to choose from. Included would be Calibri and Constantia, but you could explore   others.   For   example,   included   in   the   fonts   that  Typography for Lawyers , at 79, lists in “The A list: Generally tolerable” and “The B list: OK in limited doses” are several Word 2016 system fonts suitable for body text. If design considerations are important to you, you could experiment with   system   fonts   without   jeopardizing   cross-system compatibility.  Serif and Sans Serif  16.13   Serifs are finishing flourishes at the ends of a character’s main strokes. One way to categorize fonts is to distinguish those with serifs from those without, which are known as sans serif fonts.  16.14   It has long been assumed that serif fonts are easier to read than sans serif fonts. But studies have cast doubt on this assumption.   The Complete Manual of Typography , at 68, says, “Bad   typesetting   and   bad   typeface   design   aside,   the   fact seems to be that the most readable typefaces are the ones you’re accustomed to reading.” That’s why the author of this manual has no qualms about using Calibri, a sans serif font.  JUSTIFICATION",
  "16.15   Justification refers to fitting text into the width of a column of type. You have a choice between “justified” margins and “ragged-right” margins (also known as “flush-left” margins). With justified margins, the margins are vertical on both left and right. With ragged-right margins, all lines begin flush with the left-hand margin but are allowed to end short of the right-hand margin, creating an irregular margin along the right side of the text column. (For an example of each, see sample 11.)  SAMPLE 11   JUSTIFICATION (USING   MSCD   FIRST-LINE-INDENT ENUMERATION SCHEME)  16.16   Most   printed   text,   whether   in   books,   magazines,   or newspapers,   uses   justified   margins.   But   using   justified margins in word-processed documents, including contracts, makes them harder to read. According to typographers, that’s because subtle word-spacing, letter-spacing, and hyphenation algorithms are needed to make justified text easy to read, and those   in   word-processing   software   aren’t   up   to   the   task. Word-processed documents shouldn’t have justified margins.",
  "16.17   Those who favor using justified margins in word-processed documents will tell you that it looks “professional.” But it’s a phony professionalism, because it comes at the expense of readability, which should be the first priority of any kind of typesetting, including word processing.  EMPHASIS  16.18   You can make certain words, phrases, or paragraphs of a contract   particularly   conspicuous   by   using   italics,   bold, capital letters, underlining, or bold italics, or by putting a box around the text (see sample 12).

  "Emphasizing Names and Article Headings  16.19   Use   all   capital   letters   to   emphasize   article   headings,   the names   of   the   parties   in   the   introductory   clause,   and   the names of the parties in the signature blocks. Because the eye cannot easily differentiate characters that are all of a uniform size,   capitalized   text   is   harder   to   read—don’t   use   it   for continuous body text (see 16.29).",
  "Emphasizing Section Headings and Defined Terms  16.20   Emphasize in bold all section headings (see 4.20) and each defined term when it’s being defined (see 6.36, 6.68)—doing so helps readers find their way around a document.  16.21   Don’t   use   underlining   for   emphasis.   Underlining   is   a typewriter   convention   created   to   approximate   common typographic   effects   that   couldn’t   be   achieved   with   a typewriter. Typographers don’t like it.   The Complete Manual of Typography , at 85, notes that in word-processing software, underlining is too close to the baseline, causing it to overlap descending letters—the effect is “not pretty, and you should avoid using it.”   Typography for Lawyers , at 74, says, “In a printed document, don’t underline. Ever. It’s ugly and makes text harder to read.”  What Not to Emphasize  16.22   Don’t   emphasize   cross-references   and   references   to attachments—doing   so   doesn’t   help   the   reader.   It   might make it easier for the drafter to check cross-references and keep track of attachments, but drafter convenience shouldn’t be at the expense of distracting the reader. And using Word’s “find and replace” function is quicker and more reliable.  Emphasizing Provisions  WHAT   TO   EMPHASIZE  16.23   Unless   a   statute   or   caselaw   requires   it,   or   unless   you’re seeking   to   counterbalance   a   substantial   disparity   of bargaining power or sophistication between the parties, don’t emphasize   any   part   of   the   provisions   themselves.   It’s appropriate to assume that sophisticated parties, or at least their lawyers, will read the entire contract and be able to assess the various provisions for themselves. And flagging a provision   as   particularly   important   necessarily   involves downplaying   the   significance   of   others—an   uncertain",
  "proposition, given that contract disputes routinely arise from ostensibly mundane aspects of a transaction.  16.24   Some statutes specify that certain statements must be in all capitals. See, e.g., Arizona Revised Statutes § 12-1366(A)(1). Others in effect do so by stating in all capitals text that must be   included   in   a   contract.   See,   e.g.,   Florida   Statutes § 718.202(3); Oregon Revised Statutes § 93.040.  16.25   Other   statutes   say   that   certain   statements   must   be “conspicuous.” For example, section 2-316(2) of the Uniform Commercial   Code   (UCC)   states   that   a   disclaimer   of   the implied warranty of merchantability must be “conspicuous.” And   in   Dresser   Industries,   Inc.   v.   Page   Petroleum,   Inc. ,   853 S.W.2d 505, 509-11 (Tex. 1993), the Texas Supreme Court held that the UCC’s standard for conspicuousness applies to a contract provision indemnifying a party for that party’s own negligence.  16.26   Section 1-201(10) of the UCC says that “conspicuous” means “so written, displayed, or presented that a reasonable person against which it is to operate ought to have noticed it,” and includes examples of the attributes of conspicuous terms.  16.27   But a provision doesn’t necessarily have to be emphasized to be conspicuous. The court in   American General Finance, Inc. v. Bassett (In re Bassett) , 285 F.3d 882, 887 (9th Cir. 2002), used the   UCC’s   definition   of   “conspicuous”   to   construe   a Bankruptcy   Code   requirement   that   a   contract   contain   a “clear   and   conspicuous”   statement.   The   court   held   that although the statement wasn’t emphasized in the contract in question, it was conspicuous—it was the first sentence of a contract that took up less than one side of a page, and no aspect of formatting or appearance of the statement made it less visible or difficult to read.  16.28   In response to caselaw, many drafters emphasize waivers of jury trial. But the caselaw addressing whether waivers of jury trial must be emphasized is inconsistent. In New York, for example, a waiver of jury trial may be printed in the same",
  "size type as the rest of the contract, whereas courts in some other jurisdictions, in holding a waiver of jury trial to be enforceable, have noted that the waiver of jury trial was in bold or in all capitals. Unless you’re able to do the necessary research, the cautious approach would be to make waivers of jury trial conspicuous regardless of the law governing the contract.  HOW   TO   EMPHASIZE   IT  16.29   Most   drafters   use   all   capitals   to   emphasize   an   entire provision, but that’s counterproductive—the reader is likely to skim over text in all capitals, because it’s a chore to read (see 16.19).   The   prevalence   of   all   capitals   is   a   relic   from typewriter days—the only easy way to emphasize text on a typewriter was to use all capitals. And depending on the context, text in all capitals might not even be conspicuous. As the court in   American General Finance, Inc. , 285 F.3d at 886, noted, “Lawyers who think their caps lock keys are instant ‘make conspicuous’ buttons are deluded.” See also   Broberg v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America , 171 Cal. App. 4th 912, 922 (2009) (holding that disclaimers “buried in a sea of same- sized, capitalized print” might not be conspicuous). So unless a   statute   requires   it   (see   16.24),   don’t   use   all   capitals   to emphasize a provision.  16.30   Text emphasized in bold italics would be much easier to read. It’s likely that text in bold italics would be conspicuous for purposes of the UCC, given that section 1-201(10) of the UCC   specifies   that   “language   in   the   body   of   a   form   is ‘conspicuous’ if it is in larger or other contrasting type or color.”  16.31   You could also, or instead, place a border around a provision —section   1-201(10)   of   the   UCC   says   that   a   term   is conspicuous if it’s “set off from surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language.”",
  "16.32   When a contract states the legend that’s to be placed on stock   certificates,   the   legend   is   invariably   stated   in   all capitals. Use regular text instead, both in the contract and on the stock certificates. If you want to make the legend more conspicuous, put a border around it, use bold italics for all or part of it, or do both.  16.33   Because   the   distinction   between   regular   text   and   text   in italics is too subtle, don’t use italics for emphasis, except perhaps in amendments (see 18.20).  ACKNOWLEDGING   THAT   TEXT   IS   CONSPICUOUS  16.34   The lack of specific guidelines has resulted in drafters trying to   establish   by   contract   that   certain   text   is   in   fact conspicuous:  ACME AND WIDGETCO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT CONSTITUTES CONSPICUOUS NOTICE.  16.35   But   such   statements   are   illogical.   They   might   appear unobjectionable—if a party subject to a contract provision acknowledges that it’s conspicuous, that might reassure a court that the party had in fact noticed that provision. But invariably   such   acknowledgments   are   located   in   the provision at issue. If that provision is inconspicuous, the acknowledgement   would   be   inconspicuous   too.   So   the acknowledgement would be of value only if the provision is conspicuous.   That   defeats   the   purpose   of   the acknowledgment.  RHETORICAL   EMPHASIS   THROUGH   TYPOGRAPHY  16.36   Don’t emphasize selected words in a provision for rhetorical emphasis—as a way of saying “and we really mean it!” (For more on rhetorical emphasis, see 1.58.) An example of that is the emphasized   not   in this example:  The Licensor shall NOT indemnify, defend, or hold the Licensee harmless from and against any loss, cost, damage, liability, or expense (including reasonable legal fees) suffered or incurred by",
  "the Licensee in connection with any claim by any Person of infringement of any patent, copyright, or other intellectual property with respect to the Licensed Products.  FONT SIZE  16.37   Choice of font size, expressed in “points,” depends in part on what typeface you use. The standard choices have been 12 point for Times New Roman and 10 point for Arial, except when used with a two-column format (see 4.75).  16.38   Regarding   the   progressively   larger   Calibri   point   sizes   on display in sample 13, 11-point Calibri is the Office 2016 and Word 2016 default for body text. It’s a safe choice, but you can experiment with other point sizes.  SAMPLE 13   FONT SIZE (USING   MSCD   FIRST-LINE-INDENT ENUMERATION SCHEME)",

  "CHARACTERS PER LINE  16.39   Some   commentators   recommend   that   the   number   of characters per line not exceed 70; others cite a considerably lower number.   Typography for Lawyers , at 140, recommends a line length of 45 to 90 characters.  16.40   The more characters there are per line, the greater the risk that the reader will get lost in midline or in moving from one line to the next. A line of 11-point Calibri on letter-size paper with   one-inch   margins   (the   default   page   setup)   contains between 85 and 95 characters. That’s at the high end of, or in excess   of,   the   recommended   limits,   although   if   you   use ragged-right   justification   (see   16.15),   the   character   count would be lower for those lines that don’t reach the right margin.  16.41   If you would like to reduce the number of characters per line, the simplest way to do so would be to increase the left and right margins to 1.5 to 2 inches.   Typography for Lawyers , at 141,   recommends   that   you   do   so,   saying   that   for proportional   fonts,   one-inch   margins   are   too   small.   But keeping your blocks of text short (see 4.70) mitigates the high character count’s adverse effect on readability. The author of this manual hasn’t felt the need to increase his margins.  LINE SPACING  16.42   It has been standard to use single-spaced lines for contracts. Typewriters allowed for single-spacing or double-spacing, but word-processing software allows you to adjust line spacing in much smaller increments. Some find single-spaced text dense and hard to read, so you might want to experiment with adding extra space.  16.43   One option for setting line space in Word is “Multiple.”  Typography for Lawyers , at 138, recommends that you use a “Multiple” value of 1.03 to 1.24. In 2017, the default in Word is a “Multiple” setting of 1.08. Another popular “Multiple”",
  "setting is 1.15. Sample 14 shows three different line-spacing settings. The samples in this manual are based on Word documents with single-spacing.  SPACE AFTER PUNCTUATION  16.44   Use   only   one   space,   rather   than   two,   after   punctuation, whether it separates two sentences (periods, question marks, exclamation marks) or parts of a sentence (colons).  16.45   Using   two   spaces   creates   “rivers”   of   white   space.   It’s inefficient, requiring an extra keystroke for every sentence. And it results in documents containing instances of three spaces or one space after a period and two spaces in the middle of a sentence.  16.46   This is standard advice. For example,   The Chicago Manual of Style , at 2.9, says, “Like most publishers, Chicago advises leaving a single character space, not two spaces, between sentences   and   after   colons   used   within   a   sentence.”   And  Typography for Lawyers , at 44, says that use of one space “has the   support   of   typography   authorities   and   professional practice.”  SAMPLE 14   LINE SPACING (USING   MSCD   FIRST-LINE-INDENT ENUMERATION SCHEME)",
  "“CURLY” AND “STRAIGHT” QUOTATION MARKS AND APOSTROPHES  16.47   “Curly” and “straight” quotation marks and apostrophes are of interest not so much from a typography perspective but because of what they can tell you about how a contract was drafted.  16.48   In most typefaces, curly quotation marks (also known as “curved” or “smart” quotation marks) look, to a greater or lesser extent, like small figures six and nine with the enclosed portions filled in. Straight quotation marks (also known as",
  "“dumb” quotation marks) point straight down. You can have double   and   single   quotation   marks,   and   single   quotation marks do double duty as apostrophes.  16.49   Straight quotation marks were introduced on typewriters to reduce the number of keys on the keyboard, and they were retained for computer keyboards and character sets. But curly quotation marks are preferred in formal writing, so Microsoft Word provides an option under “AutoFormat As You Type” that   allows   you   to   replace   straight   quotation   marks   with curly quotation marks.  16.50   That option is set by default, so unless you deselect it, as you type   quotation   marks   and   apostrophes   they   will automatically be changed from straight to curly. But if you import   into   a   document—whether   from   another   Word document, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR   system,   or   elsewhere—blocks   of   text   containing straight quotation marks, those straight quotation marks will remain straight unless you change them. The converse can apply: if the “AutoFormat As You Type” option isn’t selected, you can introduce curly quotation marks into a document in which you’ve typed straight quotation marks.  16.51   What’s the significance of having both straight and curly quotation   marks   in   a   draft   contract?   It’s   messy typographically, but that’s the least of it. When you send a contract to the other side for their review, you would like them   to   get   the   impression   that   you   prepared   it   using contracts that have formed the basis for many transactions. But mixing straight and curly quotation marks is a hallmark of the sloppy copy-and-paste job. A savvy reviewer will pick up on that and will know to look for other, potentially more significant problems.  16.52   Make   all   your   quotation   marks   curly,   given   that   curly quotation marks are preferred for formal writing. If when you type quotation marks straight quotation marks appear, select the   Word   option   that   automatically   turns   your   straight",
  "quotation   marks   into   curly   quotation   marks   as   you   type them. If your quotation marks are already curly, you know that this option has already been selected.  16.53   And   to   change   to   curly   all   instances   of   double   straight quotation marks, use Word’s “Find and Replace” function, typing a double quotation mark in both the “Find what” and “Replace   with”   boxes.   Use   the   same   process   for   single quotation marks.  FIRST-LINE INDENTS  16.54   One way to signal the start of a new paragraph is to indent the   first   line.   Another   way   is   to   put   space   between paragraphs. Typography professionals recommend that you not use both techniques. For example,   Typography for Lawyers , at 135, says, “First-line indents and space between paragraphs have the same relationship as belts and suspenders. You only need one to get the job done. Using both is a mistake. If you use   a   first-line   indent   on   a   paragraph,   don’t   use   space between. And vice versa.”  16.55   That’s   why   in   the   samples   in   this   manual   and   in   the redrafted version of the contract in the appendix, paragraphs without enumeration—the introductory clause, the recitals, the   lead-in,   the   concluding   clause,   and   autonomous definitions—don’t   use   first-line   indents.   (That’s   a   change from previous editions of this manual.)  16.56   The   MSCD   first-line-indent scheme requires first-line indents for sections (see 4.55) and subsections (see 4.58), but that’s unrelated to presentation of unenumerated paragraphs.  DESIGN EMBELLISHMENTS  16.57   Most drafters, and most law firms and law departments, have a   conservative,   no-frills   approach   to   document   design— they’re unlikely to have any interest in adjusting line spacing and margins or experimenting with different fonts.",
  "16.58   But one can go well beyond that by adding further design elements: Different typefaces for headings. Different point sizes for headings. Color for headings. A horizontal line at the top of each section.  16.59   Law firms in Commonwealth countries are partial to adding such design elements to their contracts. This manual leaves it to readers to determine whether they wish to follow suit.  16.60   But   it   might   be   that   design   embellishments   are   less   a function of ease of reading than of “selling”—catching and keeping a reader’s attention in a time of short attention spans and   endless   distractions.   Contracts   aren’t   discretionary reading, so that selling function is less relevant. But it’s not necessarily   absent—for   example,   a   company   in   a   design business might want the document design of its contracts to be consistent with its image.  16.61   Any organization that wants to implement a sophisticated document design for its contracts should consider making it mandatory   that   drafters   apply   the   design   by   using   a numbering utility such as PayneGroup’s Numbering Assistant (see   4.67).   Using   a   more   improvised   approach   isn’t promising, in terms of the potential for erratic results and time wasted fiddling with the design elements.",
  "DRAFTING AS WRITING  17.1   Contract prose may be limited and stylized, but clear and effective drafting nevertheless requires an understanding of general principles of good writing. This chapter considers those that are most relevant.  DON’T MAKE SENTENCES TOO LONG  17.2   In general, long sentences are harder to read than shorter ones. Although contract sentences will usually be longer— often much longer—than the 20 to 25 words recommended for general legal writing, whittle down those sentences that are unnecessarily long.  17.3   A sentence is too long if it strings together clauses that could stand on their own as separate sentences, or if it incorporates one   or   more   unwieldy   exceptions,   qualifications,   or conditions. If you can break such a sentence down into its constituent   components   and   express,   clearly   and economically, how the components relate to each other, the sentence will be more readable.  17.4   Below   is   a   143-word   sentence;   below   that   is   the   same sentence, restructured as three sentences (149 words total). Although it’s a few words longer, the “after” version takes much less of a toll on the reader than the “before” version. The first shaded portion in the “before” version constitutes the first sentence of the “after” version. The second shaded portion in the “before” version is an awkwardly positioned, passive-voice nonrestrictive clause; it forms the basis for the",
  "active-voice   third   sentence   of   the   “after”   version.   The unshaded portion of the “before” version constitutes, with the   addition   of   a   brief   introductory   clause,   the   second sentence   of   the   “after”   version;   it,   like   the   first   shaded portion, describes a consequence of default, but it can be turned into a separate sentence.  Before   If a Default described in section 8(f) occurs with respect to the Borrower, the Lenders’ obligation to make Loans and the LC Issuer’s obligation to issue Facility LCs will automatically terminate and the Obligations will immediately become due without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer, or any Lender and the Borrower will become unconditionally obligated, without any further notice or act, to pay to the Administrative Agent an amount in immediately available funds, which funds must be held in the Facility LC Collateral Account, equal to the difference of (1) the LC Obligations then outstanding minus (2) the amount then on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral Account that is free and clear of all rights and claims of third parties and has not been applied against the Obligations (that difference, the “Collateral Shortfall Amount”).  After   If a Default described in section 8(f) occurs with respect to the Borrower, the Lenders’ obligation to make Loans and the LC Issuer’s obligation to issue Facility LCs will terminate and the Obligations will immediately become due without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer, or any Lender. Upon any such Default, the Borrower will become unconditionally obligated, without any further notice or act, to pay to the Administrative Agent an amount in immediately available funds equal to the difference of (1) the LC Obligations then outstanding minus (2) the amount then on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral Account that is free and clear of all rights and claims of third parties and has not been applied against the Obligations (that difference, the “Collateral Shortfall Amount”). The Administrative Agent shall hold the Collateral Shortfall Amount in the Facility LC Collateral Account.",
  "17.5   It’s standard practice to present lists—such as lists of items to be delivered at closing or lists of events of default—in long sentences made up of enumerated clauses. Tabulating the enumerated   clauses   breaks   such   sentences   down   into manageable portions.  KEEP SUBJECT, VERB, AND OBJECT CLOSE TOGETHER  17.6   A sentence is easier to understand if the subject, the verb, and   the   object   (if   any)   are   close   together.   Drafters   often create unnecessary gaps between subject and verb or between verb   and   object.   In   the   first   example   below,   the   gap   is between the subject and the verb; in the second, it’s between the   verb   and   the   object.   Sometimes   fixing   this   requires turning the intervening words into a separate sentence; at other times, as in the examples below, they can be shunted to the beginning or end of the sentence. (In the examples below, shading denotes the offending text and shows where it was moved.)  Gap   No Gap  Acme shall not without the prior written consent of Excelsior, which Excelsior shall not unreasonably withhold, transfer the Shares to any Person. Acme shall not transfer the Shares to any Person without the prior written consent of Excelsior, which Excelsior shall not unreasonably withhold. Acme shall deliver to Widgetco, no later than 15 days after each Quarterly Period, unless the Gross Revenue for that Quarterly Period is less than $1,000,000, a stock certificate representing those shares of Acme common stock that Acme is required to issue with respect to that Quarterly Period. No later than 15 days after each Quarterly Period, unless the Gross Revenue for that Quarterly Period is less than $1,000,000, Acme shall deliver to Widgetco a stock certificate representing those shares of Acme common stock that Acme is required to issue with respect to that Quarterly Period.  DON’T BURY VERBS",
  "17.7   Like   other   writers,   contract   drafters   are   prone   to   using abstract nouns at the expense of verbs. This practice has been variously described as using ‘buried” verbs (the label this manual   uses),   using   “zombie”   nouns,   and   using “nominalizations”   (itself   an   abstract   noun).   See   Garner’s Modern English Usage , at 983. Abstract nouns are the opposite of concrete nouns—they express things we can’t feel, touch, see, hear, or taste.  17.8   Using buried verbs is a reliable way to write like a bureaucrat and   clutter   prose   with   prepositions   and   “weak”   verbs, including   is   (see the fourth example in the table below) and  has   (see the eighth example). Using buried verbs also allows you to drop the   by -agent (see 3.12), thereby obscuring who the actor is, as in the first example in the table below. The effect is comparable to use of the passive voice (see 3.13). That can force the reader to work harder and can create confusion.  17.9   Whenever possible, use instead “strong” verbs. The first five examples in the table below show two versions of sample language,   one   version   using   an   abstract   noun,   the   other using a verb. Adjectives can also act as buried verbs; in the sixth and seventh examples in the table below, an adjective is replaced with a verb. (The adjective in the seventh example makes that example a buried-actor policy; see 3.309.) This manual uses the label “buried verb” loosely—maybe the best alternative to an abstract noun is an adjective, as in the eighth example in the table below.  Uses Abstract Noun (or Adjective)   Uses Verb (or Adjective)  1. Immediately following issuance of the Notes, ... . Immediately after Acme issues the Notes, ... . 2. ... all expenses the Bank incurs in connection with establishment and maintenance of the Deposit Account. ... all expenses the Bank incurs in establishing and maintaining the Deposit Account.",
  "3. Upon the failure of Smith to timely make the payment of the Purchase Price, ... . If Smith fails to timely pay the Purchase Price, ... . 4. If there is a merger or consolidation of Acme ... . If Acme merges or consolidates ... . 5. Jones shall promptly give notice to the other parties ... . Jones shall promptly notify the other parties ... . 6. If this section is violative of any law or public policy ... . If this section violates any law or public policy ... . 7. The Warrants are not redeemable by Acme. Acme shall not redeem the Warrants. 8. ... for which the Redeemed Member has liability. ... for which the Redeemed Member is liable.  17.10   Because   buried   verbs   allow   you   to   drop   the   actor,   they sometimes serve a purpose, just as use of the passive voice sometimes does (see 3.22). If several different parties might exercise a particular option, you could use the wordy   When any one or more Optionholders exercises the Option   to introduce the   obligations   triggered   by   exercising   the   option,   but   a better choice would be   Upon exercise of the Option .  AVOID GENDER-SPECIFIC LANGUAGE  17.11   When a contract provision refers to a group of persons that includes, or might during the life of the contract include, one or more women and one or more men, it’s best that you not use   exclusively   the   masculine   pronouns   he ,   his ,   and   him  when referring generally to a member of that group. Such gender-specific language might offend, distract, or mislead readers—drafters can no longer assume that readers consider male pronouns to include persons of both genders when the reference   is   general.   And   gender-specific   language   simply seems old-fashioned now.",
  "17.12   In   addition,   using   only   gender-specific   pronouns   when referring generically to a member of a group is jarring when the group includes one or more entities.  17.13   When you’re dealing with a template or any other contract that’s likely to be used as a model, gender-specific language would be a concern even if it happened to be appropriate for the transaction at hand: it would be a nuisance if, each time the contract were revised for a new transaction, the drafter might have to change the pronouns.  17.14   You can avoid in three ways using gender-specific language in contracts: instead of using only a masculine pronoun, (1) use   a   plural   pronoun   and   make   conforming   changes elsewhere,   (2)   repeat   the   noun,   or   (3)   use   a   feminine   or neuter   pronoun,   or   both,   in   addition   to   a   masculine pronoun. Which solution works best depends on the context. Here’s how these options play out in an example involving a member of a group of individuals:  Gender-specific version   Each Stockholder must surrender his stock certificates ... .  Gender-neutral version using plural noun  The Stockholders must surrender their stock certificates ... .  Gender-neutral version that repeats noun  Each Stockholder must surrender that Stockholder’s stock certificate ... .  Gender-neutral version that uses both masculine and feminine pronouns, or masculine, singular, and neuter pronouns  Each Stockholder must surrender [his or her] [his, her, or its] stock certificates ... .  17.15   A fourth option is to use the singular   they   (and its related forms)   as   a   gender-neutral   third-person   singular   personal pronoun. For example:  Gender-neutral version using   their  as singular personal pronoun  Each Stockholder must surrender their stock certificate ... .",
  "17.16   This   usage   has   become   increasingly   accepted.   See   Ben Zimmer,   “They,” the Singular Pronoun, Gets Popular , Wall St. Journal, 10 Apr. 2015. This manual regards it as acceptable, but at least for now it’s up to each drafter to decide whether they   wish   to   embrace   the   singular   they .   For   an   example featuring the singular   their , see 5.43, 5.44.  17.17   But don’t use the singular   they   (and its related forms) for a member   of   a   group   composed   only   of   entities—in   that context,   it   (and its related forms) would be more suitable.  17.18   Finally, a general point regarding pronouns: if you use   it  (and related forms) in referring to an individual, don’t be surprised if a court sees that as somehow significant, even though a copy-and-paste glitch might be the more likely explanation. See   Total Recall Technologies v. Luckey , No. C 15- 02281   WHA,   2016   WL   199796   (N.D.   Cal.   19   Jan.   2016) (pointing to use of   its   in a contract reference to an individual as   a   factor   suggesting   that   the   individual   intended   the contract to benefit the general partnership of which he was partner).  DON’T USE WORDY PHRASES  17.19   One finds in contracts circumlocutions and overly formal words and phrases that characterize not just legal writing but stuffy   writing   generally.   Some   examples   are   listed   below; using instead the suggested alternatives (in the   Better   column) would make a contract easier to read.

To the Extent That  17.21   The phrase   to the extent that   is appropriate when the degree to which a provision applies depends on some variable:   This agreement is governed by the laws of the state of New York, except to the extent that the federal securities laws apply . But the phrase is often used even when satisfying a condition results in the provision   being   applied   to   its   fullest,   rather   than incrementally;   in   such   contexts,   if   would   be   more appropriate. One example: “ To the extent that   [read   If ] any document   is   required   to   be   filed   or   any   certification   is required to be made with respect to the Issuer or the Notes under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Seller shall prepare and execute that document or certification.” Another example: “ To the extent that   [read   If ] the Company has not paid the Investor’s fees and expenses, the Investor may deduct from the Advance the amount of any unpaid fees and expenses.”  The Fact That  17.22   You can almost always improve on constructions containing the   wordy   phrase   the   fact   that .   One   example:   “Executive acknowledges that Acme’s Confidential Information would be valuable to the Company’s competitors   by virtue of the fact that   [read   because ] it is not generally known to the public or in the industry.” Another example:   The fact that there may be",
  "no Loans outstanding   [read   Whether any Loans are outstanding ] at any given time will not affect the continuing validity of this agreement.”  17.23   And the phrases   notwithstanding the fact that   and   regardless of the fact that   can always be replaced by   although ,   even though , or   even if . An example: “Doe will be entitled to receive the stock dividend on the shares of Common Stock acquired upon that Option exercise,   notwithstanding the fact that   [read  even though ] those shares were not outstanding on the record date for the stock dividend.”  There Is   and   There Are  17.24   Whenever you start a clause or sentence with   there   or   it  followed by a form of the verb “to be”— there is ,   there are ,   it is  —you are lumbering the front end of the clause or sentence with a fake subject and a weak verb. Instead, find the real subject and the real verb and use them to start the sentence or clause; sometimes this requires significant restructuring. Below are three sentences beginning with   there is , along with a proposed alternative for each.  There Is   No   There Is  If   there is   a conflict or inconsistency between this agreement and any other Loan Document, the terms of this agreement will control. If this agreement conflicts with or is not consistent with any other Loan Document, the terms of this agreement will control.  There is   no fact that is known to any Seller or that reasonably should be known to any of them that has not been disclosed to the Agent in writing with respect to the transactions contemplated by this agreement and that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. Each Seller has disclosed to the Agent in writing all facts that that Seller knows or reasonably should know that relate to the transactions contemplated by this agreement and could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.",

With Respect To  17.25   A less wordy alternative to   with respect to   is   regarding .

USE POSSESSIVES",
  "17.28   One simple way of making contract prose less wooden is to use possessives, as in these examples:  No Possessive  the board of directors of Acme the shares held by Smith the obligation of the Lender to make Loans under this agreement  Possessive  Acme’s board of directors Smith’s shares the Lender’s obligation to make Loans under this agreement  DON’T OVERUSE INITIAL CAPITALS  17.29   Contract   drafters   tend   to   overuse   initial   capitals.   Use   of initial capitals in references to agreements is one example of that   (see   2.20).   Discussed   below   are   additional   examples. Those who overuse initial capitals presumably think that if something is important, it’s best to give it initial capitals. This   overuse   is   essentially   trivial,   but   not   without   cost, because initial capitals make a document less easy to read. As it is, the typical contract is not wanting for initial capitals used appropriately. So be restrained in using initial capitals. This manual follows the guidelines in   The Chicago Manual of Style .  17.30   Drafters generally add initial capitals to   board of directors , but it’s a generic term, so lowercase letters are appropriate. And drafters invariably use initial capitals when referring to officer titles ( The certificate must be signed by the President of Acme ), but it’s preferable to do so only if the title is followed by a name   ( President   Jane   Roe ),   which   is   never   the   case   in contracts. The same applies to other titles, such as   director  and   secretary of state .  17.31   Initial capitals are often used in references to a company’s organizational   documents   ( Acme’s   Restated   Certificate   of Incorporation and Bylaws ). But you’re referring not to the title of a work but to a category of document, so use lowercase letters.",
  "17.32   Words denoting political divisions are capitalized when they follow a name and are used as an accepted part of the name. When   they   precede   the   name,   such   terms   are   usually capitalized in names of countries but lowercased in entities below the national level—hence   New York State   but   the state of New York . Drafters tend to capitalize   state   whatever the context.  17.33   Many drafters also use initial capitals when referring to a company’s capital stock ( the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Widgetco ); use lowercase letters instead.  17.34   The recommended practice in general English usage is to use lowercase letters when referring to parts of a work. This is mostly the practice in legislative drafting. Contract drafters should fall in line and use lowercase letters for article and section cross-references ( Acme’s obligations under section 12.4 ) and   for   references   to   exhibits,   schedules,   and   other attachments ( an employment agreement in the form of exhibit C ) (see 4.111, 5.82).  THE EXTRANEOUS   THE  17.35   Drafters   often   place   an   extraneous   the   in   front   of   some abstract   nouns;   the   result   is   ponderous   prose.

  "damages suffered by the Borrower or that Lender to the extent caused by   the   willful misconduct or gross negligence of the LC Issuer  CONTRACTIONS  17.36   Don’t use contractions in contracts. It’s generally accepted among commentators on English usage that contractions— including   it’s ,   that’s ,   isn’t ,   won’t —are suitable in all but the most formal kinds of writing. (That’s why this manual uses contractions.) Contractions help you achieve a more natural, conversational rhythm. But that doesn’t mean that they’re suitable   for   business   contracts.   The   prose   of   business contracts is like computer code—it should be devoid of tone or rhythm. So using contractions in business contracts is inconsistent with the nature of contract prose.  PUNCTUATION  17.37   The law has a long tradition of disdaining punctuation. See  Garner’s   Dictionary   of   Legal   Usage ,   at   730.   That   view   has thankfully all but disappeared—rational drafting requires that one use punctuation consistent with standard English, but without relying on it unduly (see 12.36, 12.37, 12.55, 12.76). But you might come across the following internal rule of interpretation, most likely in a contract drafted by an English lawyer:   Punctuation and headings used in this agreement are for the purpose of easy reference or reading only and do not affect its interpretation . Insist that it be deleted.",
  "AMENDMENTS  18.1   It’s commonplace for the parties to a contract to want to amend—that is, make changes to—the contract to fix errors, to address circumstances that hadn’t been contemplated in the original negotiations, or to change the deal terms.  18.2   Amending   a   contract   is   accomplished   by   a   new   writing, which can be in the form of a regular contract or a letter agreement. This chapter considers usages relating to effecting an amendment by means of a regular contract.  AMENDING, OR AMENDING AND RESTATING  18.3   Parties who wish to make changes to a contract can either amend it or amend and restate it. To amend a contract, the parties   enter   into   a   new   contract   that   contains   only   the changes being made to the original contract. To amend and restate a contract, the parties enter into a new contract that consists of the original contract revised to incorporate any amendments that the parties had made since it was signed and any further amendments that the parties wish to make. In theory, the parties could simply restate a contract, in other words incorporate in a new contract, without making any further changes, all amendments that had previously been made to that contract, but that’s done rarely, if at all.  18.4   When only a few discrete changes are being made, it usually makes   sense   simply   to   amend   a   contract   rather   than requiring that lawyers and clients add to their files another copy   of   the   entire   contract,   slightly   revised.   By   contrast, amending and restating a contract is likely to be the more efficient option when the parties wish to make extensive",
  "changes or when the proposed changes come on the heels of other amendments, making it awkward to keep track of the changes.  TITLE  18.5   If   a   contract   amends,   or   amends   and   restates,   another contract, it’s conventional to state as much in the title, and the title should also refer to the type of agreement involved:  AMENDED   AND   RESTATED   MERGER   AGREEMENT.   It’s helpful to number each amendment to a contract, or at least the second amendment onward:   AMENDMENT   NO.   4   TO CREDIT AGREEMENT.   As with titles generally (see 2.2), don’t include   party   names,   because   doing   so   makes   the   title unwieldy. (Regarding use of   allonge   instead of   amendment   in titles, see 13.14.)  INTRODUCTORY CLAUSE AND RECITALS  18.6   The introductory clause to an amendment or a restated and amended   contract   should   follow   this   manual’s recommendations   for   introductory   clauses   generally   (see 2.15–.128). In particular, in the introductory clause you don’t need   to   refer   to   the   contract   that’s   being   amended,   or restated   and   amended,   as   the   case   may   be.   Instead,   the recitals should refer to that contract and, if feasible, state briefly why the parties wish to amend it or amend and restate it. Also, don’t create in an amendment the defined term   this Amendment   (see 2.124).  THE LEAD-IN  18.7   The lead-in to an amendment should be the same as that for any other contract (see 2.160–.213), with the exception that if only one simple change is being made, it could conceivably be wrapped into the lead-in:   The parties therefore amend the Employment   Agreement by deleting section 13 in its entirety.   The",
  "lead-in would then constitute the entire body of the contract, with the concluding clause following. But if you wish to add general   provisions   addressing   matters   such   as   the   law governing   the   contract—and   most   drafters   would—this approach wouldn’t work.  18.8   The lead-in to an amended and restated contract should look like this:   The parties therefore amend and restate the   [ contract being amended ]   to read in its entirety as follows:   ... .  LANGUAGE OF PERFORMANCE  18.9   The language used to state an amendment is an example of language   of   performance.   (Regarding   language   of performance, see 3.33.) So it’s preferable to have the parties state that the contract or provision, as the case may be,   is hereby amended , as opposed to   is amended   or   is amended as of the date hereof   (see 3.35). It would be appropriate to use the passive voice, because there wouldn’t be any question who’s doing the amending (see 3.22).  DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN AMENDING AND SUPPLEMENTING  18.10   An   amendment   changes   the   original   agreement;   a supplement simply adds to it. Acme and Doe are party to an employment agreement that provides for Acme to pay Doe an   annual   salary.   Acme   and   Doe   enter   into   another agreement   in   which   Acme   agrees   to   pay   Doe   an   annual bonus.   One   might   term   the   second   agreement   an amendment of the employment agreement, but it doesn’t amend the employment agreement unless it states that the new   provisions   are   being   added   to   the   employment agreement. If the provisions in the second agreement are freestanding,   the   second   agreement   is   best   considered   as supplementing the employment agreement. If that’s the case, call   it   a   supplement   rather   than   use   the   fusty   Latinism  addendum .",
  "ADDING, DELETING, AND REPLACING LANGUAGE  18.11   In an amendment, the parties can add or delete language or replace   existing   language   with   new   language.   How   this process is handled is a function of whether entire provisions are involved.  Change Affecting Part of a Provision  18.12   When a change involves adding, deleting, or replacing less than an entire section or subsection (a word or two, a phrase, a sentence, or an enumerated clause), the distinction between amending, on the one hand, and amending and restating, on the other hand, can be applied, albeit on a smaller scale: the drafter generally has a choice between specifying only the exact change being made or restating the entire provision.  18.13   Assume,   for   example,   that   an   agreement   contains   this definition:   “Termination   Date”   means   11:00   a.m.,   Houston, Texas, time, on 28 February 2017 or any earlier date on which the Commitment terminates under this agreement . The parties agree to   postpone   the   termination   date   by   two   months.   The agreement could be revised in two different ways to reflect this change. The parties could substitute one date for the other:   The definition of “Termination Date” is hereby revised by replacing “28 February 2019” with “30 April 2019.”   Or they could restate the entire definition, revised to include the new date:   The definition of “Termination Date” is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows:   ... .  18.14   The former approach is more concise and has the benefit of highlighting the change that was made. But that change is presented   out   of   context,   so   a   reader   can’t   be   sure   of understanding   its   significance   without   referring   to   the underlying agreement. Restating the amended provision in its entirety avoids that problem, but at the cost of making the amendment longer and less specific, although the reason for the amendment could be stated in the recitals or in the",
  "amendment proper. Which approach is preferable in a given context requires balancing the pros and cons of each.  Change Affecting an Entire Provision  ADDING  18.15   An   amendment   can   add   a   new   section,   subsection,   or enumerated clause:   The Agreement is hereby amended by adding after section 10 the following new section 11:   ... . Unless the new section, subsection, or enumerated clause is inserted at the end   of   the   agreement,   section,   or   series   of   enumerated clauses, respectively, contract enumeration would be affected. The amendment necessary to change the enumeration would generally follow immediately after the amendment requiring the change in enumeration:   The Agreement is hereby amended as follows: (1) by adding after section 10 the following new section 11 and (2) by renumbering sections 11 through 19 as sections 12 through 20.  18.16   It   could   be   that   the   original   contract’s   internal   cross- references, or references to the original contract that are in another contract, would be rendered inaccurate by a change in   enumeration.   That   problem   could   presumably   be addressed   by   further   amendment   (of   both   the   original contract and any referencing contract), but it would be best if you could avoid the problem by inserting the new section, subsection,   or   enumerated   clause   at   the   end   of   the agreement,   section,   or   series   of   enumerated   clauses, respectively.  18.17   Adding an enumerated clause as the penultimate or last in a series   of   enumerated   clauses   requires   some   fine-tuning   to address the fact that in the penultimate clause the semicolon is followed by   and   or   or   and the last clause ends in a period. For example, adding an enumerated clause at the end of a series of enumerated clauses would, strictly speaking, require amending language along the lines of the following:   Section 9 is hereby amended as follows: (1) by deleting the word “or” at the",
  "end of clause (4); (2) by deleting the period at the end of clause (5) and replacing it with “; or”; and (3) by inserting the following as a new   clause   (6):   ...   .   But   inserting   an   enumerated   clause without doing this fine-tuning wouldn’t change the meaning of any provision and so couldn’t harm a party’s interest.  DELETING  18.18   An   amendment   can   delete   a   section,   subsection,   or enumerated clause of the original contract:   The Agreement is hereby amended by deleting section 10 in its entirety.   Unless the section,   subsection,   or   enumerated   clause   being   deleted occurs   at   the   end   of   the   agreement,   section,   or   series   of enumerated   clauses,   respectively,   enumeration   in   the contract would be affected. One could address this by tacking on a further amendment:   The Agreement is hereby amended as follows: (1) by deleting section 10 in its entirety; and (2) by renumbering sections 11 through 19 as sections 10 through 18.  But you might find it simpler to retain the enumeration of the provision being deleted and replace the provision itself with the bracketed notation   Intentionally omitted , which acts as   a   place-filler   (see   4.114).   This   would   have   the   added advantage of leaving unaffected internal cross-references in the   original   contract   and   any   references   to   the   original contract that are in another contract (unless any of those references is to the deleted provision).  18.19   Deleting the next-to-last or last in a series of enumerated clauses requires fine-tuning of the sort required when you add such a clause (see 18.17). For example, deleting the last of a series of enumerated clauses would require amending language of the following sort:   Section 9 is hereby amended as follows: (1) by adding the word “or” at the end of clause (3); (2) deleting the “; or” at the end of clause (4) and replacing it with a period; and (3) deleting in its entirety clause (5).   Here too, omitting   such   adjustments   when   deleting   an   enumerated clause couldn’t harm a party’s interests.",
  "LAYOUT  18.20   If an amendment is adding an entire section, subsection, or tabulated   enumerated   clause   to   the   contract   that’s   being amended, indenting that block of text, stating it in italics, and otherwise formatting it as you would if it were being stated in the contract being amended would help distinguish it   from   text   that   pertains   to   the   amendment   itself.   This approach is shown in sample 15.  SAMPLE 15   USE OF ITALICS IN AMENDMENTS (USING   MSCD   HANGING- INDENT ENUMERATION SCHEME)",
  "LETTER AGREEMENTS  FUNCTION  19.1   Instead   of   being   in   the   form   of   a   regular   contract,   an agreement might be embodied in a letter agreement, which is a   letter   that   contains   the   terms   of   the   agreement   and   is signed by the sender and the recipient. By convention, some categories   of   agreement,   notably   letters   of   intent,   are generally in the form of a letter agreement. Don’t give a regular contract the title “letter of intent”—it sends mixed signals.  19.2   Usually   the   letter-agreement   format   is   used   for   short agreements, but sometimes they can be lengthy. For example, it’s not unusual for credit agreements to be in the form of letter agreements.  COMPONENTS  19.3   A letter agreement will typically contain the following: the sender’s   address;   the   date;   the   recipient’s   address;   the salutation; an introductory sentence; the substantive terms; a closing sentence; the sender’s signature; and the recipient’s signature. A letter agreement might also have a subject line, but it shouldn’t bear a title.  Sender’s Address  19.4   The sender should be the individual or entity that’s party to the   agreement   and   not,   in   the   case   of   an   entity,   a",
  "representative. The sender’s address can be typed or included in preprinted letterhead.  Date  19.5   What date you use in a letter agreement involves the same considerations   as   what   date   you   use   in   the   introductory clause of a regular contract (see 2.23–.47).  Recipient’s Address  19.6   The recipients of a letter agreement would be those one or more persons or entities, other than the sender, that are to be bound by the letter agreement. If a recipient is an entity, usually one would include in an “Attention” line the name of a representative of the recipient.  Salutation  19.7   If the recipient is an individual, use as a salutation   Dear   and the   individual’s   name.   A   salutation   is   standard   in correspondence with an individual, and it would allow you to reflect the nature of the relationship: in a letter to Jane Doe, the salutation would presumably refer to   Jane   or   Ms. Doe .  19.8   If   the   recipient   is   an   entity,   you   can   dispense   with   a salutation—it would be pointless to use a salutation such as  Dear Acme Corporation , as the reader would know from the recipient   address   stated   above   the   salutation   that   the recipient   is   Acme   Corporation.   A   traditional   choice   for   a salutation to an entity would be   Dear Sirs , but it’s gender- specific (see 17.10), it’s old-fashioned, and it suggests you’re writing to a group of individuals.   Dear Sirs and Madams   (or  Mesdames ) and   Ladies and Gentlemen   exhibit the second and third of those problems.   To whom it may concern   suggests that you either don’t know to whom you’re sending the letter or don’t care.",
  "Introductory Sentence  19.9   The introductory sentence is often something like this:   The purpose   of   this   letter   agreement   is   to   state   the   terms   of   [ the transaction ].  Substantive Terms  19.10   The   substantive   terms   of   a   letter   agreement   should   be phrased just as they would be in a regular contract. In a letter agreement   one   can   dispense   with   section   numbers   and headings, but generally it’s helpful to retain them.  19.11   Use the third person instead of   you , on the one hand, and   we  and   us , on the other hand (see 3.8).  Closing Sentence  19.12   The closing sentence would normally be like that in sample 16, although it could also refer to return of an original signed copy.  Sender’s Signature  19.13   The   sender’s   signature   block   is   placed   where   the   sender usually signs a letter (see sample 16). A closing formula such as   Yours sincerely   isn’t necessary. Letter-agreement signature blocks use the same format as signature blocks in regular contracts (see 5.29). You would use a different arrangement if the letter agreement were signed electronically (see 5.68).  19.14   If the sender is an entity, the sender’s signature block should be in the name of the sender rather than a representative of the sender, although a representative would sign.  Recipient’s Signature  19.15   A letter agreement should contain a signature block for each recipient. They’re usually placed under the sender’s signature block, flush left (see sample 16).",
  "19.16   Each recipient’s signature block should be preceded by text indicating that the recipient is agreeing to the terms of the letter agreement.   Agreed to   is adequate; adding   and accepted  does nothing. And it’s generally helpful to include a date. In the absence of a date a court might conclude that the date at the top of the letter applies, but there’s no point in leaving that to chance.  SAMPLE 16   LETTER AGREEMENT",
  "19.17   If   it’s   important   that   the   date   be   a   particular   date   (for example,   the   same   as   the   date   at   the   top   of   the   letter agreement), the drafter should include that date rather than leaving it blank for the signer to fill in by hand. Saying   Agreed to   on   the   date   of   this   letter   agreement —assuming   that’s appropriate—would leave the drafter only one date to adjust —the one at the top—when finalizing the letter agreement. It would be preferable not to use an   as of   date (see 2.35).",
  "This appendix consists of two versions of a template of a “golden parachute” termination agreement—a contract between a company and one of its employees in which the company agrees to provide the employee with various benefits if the employee’s employment is terminated after a change in control of the company. This template was prepared by lawyers at a national U.S. law firm. It can be said to be representative of mainstream contract drafting, to the extent that any one contract can be said to be representative. Appendix A is the “before” version annotated with footnotes to show its drafting shortcomings. Many footnotes cite relevant paragraphs of this manual. Appendix B is the “after” version—the contract redrafted consistent with the recommendations in this manual. As noted in the footnotes to appendix A, sections 8 (Arbitration), 10 (Notices), 11 (Severability), and 13 (Governing Law) in appendix B replace the corresponding sections in appendix A, because readers would likely find the author’s versions of those boilerplate provisions more helpful than cleaned-up but   still   problematic   versions   of   the   corresponding   appendix   A sections. The difference between appendix A and appendix B demonstrates the cumulative effect of a rigorous approach to the full spectrum of drafting usages. For one thing, appendix B is 86% the number of words   of   appendix   A,   even   though   the   notices   and   severability sections in appendix B are twice as long as their counterparts in appendix A—informed drafting results in shorter contracts. Furthermore, appendix B is much clearer and easier to read, and it fixes some significant problems of structure and logic present in appendix A. Such problems are easy to miss in the murk that is mainstream contract language. Most contracts could be redrafted to similar effect. If an organization were to experience improvements on that scale in all its contracts, its",
  "contract process would operate faster and more cost-effectively, with less confusion. And the likelihood of drafting problems metastasizing into contract disputes would be significantly reduced. Neither appendix A nor appendix B is included for use as a template. For   appendix   B,   the   language   and   structure   of   appendix   A   were retooled, but not the deal terms. This manual offers no opinion regarding   whether   the   deal   terms   are   appropriate   or   could   be improved. And appendix A first appeared in this manual in the second edition; since then no attempt has been made to revise it to reflect changes in how such transactions are handled.",

For purposes of this Section 3(v): “Acquiring Person” 106   shall 21   mean any “person” 69   (as such 28   term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) who or which, together with all Affiliates and Associates 102   of such 28   person, is the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the shares of Common Stock 107   of the Company 100   then outstanding, but shall 21   not include the Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any subsidiary of the Company or any entity holding shares of Common Stock 107   organized, appointed or established for, or pursuant to 55   the terms of, any such plan; and “Affiliate” and “Associate” shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such 28  terms in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 108  4. Benefits upon Termination under Section 2(ii)(c) 109  (i) 110   Upon the termination 80   (voluntary or involuntary) of the employment of Employee pursuant to Section 2(ii)(c) hereof, 111   Employee shall be entitled to receive 47   the benefits specified in this Section 4.112 The amounts due to Employee under subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 4(i) 112  shall be paid 113   to Employee not later than one business day prior to 27   the date that 114   the 78   termination of Employee’s employment becomes effective. All benefits to Employee pursuant to this Section 4(i) shall 21   be subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required by law to be withheld. (a) The Company shall pay to Employee any and all 115   amounts payable 116   to Employee pursuant to 55   any standard or general 117   severance policy of the Company or its Board of Directors; 118  (b) In lieu of 119   any further base salary payments to Employee for periods subsequent to 120   the date that the termination of Employee’s employment becomes effective, the Company shall pay as severance pay to Employee a lump-sum cash 121   amount equal to twenty-four (24) 122   times the Employee’s monthly base salary (as in effect in the month preceding the month in which the termination becomes effective or as in effect in the month preceding the Change in Control, whichever is higher); (c) The Company shall also pay to Employee all legal fees and expenses incurred by Employee as a result of such 28   termination of employment (including all fees and expenses, if any, incurred by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided to Employee by this Agreement whether by arbitration or otherwise); and",
  "(d) Any and all 115   contracts, agreements or arrangements 123   between the Company and Employee prohibiting or restricting the Employee from owning, operating, participating in, or providing employment or consulting services to, any business or company competitive with 124   the Company at any time or during any period after the date the termination of Employee’s employment becomes effective 125 , shall be deemed terminated 126   and of no further force or effect 127   as of the date 128   the 78  termination of Employee’s employment becomes effective, to the extent, but only to the extent 129 , such 28   contracts, agreements or arrangements so prohibit or restrict the Employee; provided that 130   the foregoing 131   provisions shall 21   not constitute a license or right to use any proprietary 132   information of the Company and shall 21   in no way affect any such contracts, agreements or arrangements insofar as they relate to nondisclosure and nonuse of proprietary information of the Company notwithstanding the fact that 133   such nondisclosure and nonuse may 134   prohibit 135   or restrict the Employee in certain competitive 136   activities. (ii) Employee shall 21   not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 4 by seeking other employment or otherwise. 137   The amount of any payment or benefit provided in this Section 4 shall 21   not be reduced by any compensation earned by Employee as a result of any employment by another employer or from any other source. (iii) 138   In the event that 139   any payment or benefit received or to be received by Employee in connection with a Change in Control of the Company 140   or termination of Employee’s employment (whether payable 141   pursuant to 55   the terms of this Agreement or pursuant to 55   any other plan, contract, agreement or arrangement 142   with the Company, with any person whose actions result in a Change in Control of the Company 140   or with any person constituting a member of an “affiliated group” as defined in Section 280G(d)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended 66   (the “Code”), with the Company or with any person whose actions result in a Change in Control of the Company 140   143  (collectively, the “Total Payments” 144 )) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest, penalties or additions to tax with respect to such 28   excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest, penalties or additions to tax, are collectively referred to as 145   the “Excise Tax”), then Employee shall be entitled to receive 47   from the Company an additional cash payment (a “Gross-Up Payment”) in an amount such that after payment by Employee of all taxes (including any interest, penalties or additions to tax imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, Employee would retain an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon 146   the Total Payments, as determined in accordance with the provisions of 147   this Section 4(iii). (a) All determinations required to be made 148   under this Section 4(iii), including whether a Gross- Up Payment is required and the amount of such 28   Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by 149   the independent accounting firm retained by the Company 150   on the date of the Change in Control (the “Accounting Firm” 151 ). The Accounting Firm shall 149   provide detailed supporting calculations of its determination to both the Company and the Employee within 49   15 business days of the Employment Termination Date 152 , or at such earlier time as is requested by the Company 153 . For purposes of determining the amount of any tax pursuant to 55   this Section 4(iii), the Employee’s tax rate shall be deemed 21   to be the highest statutory marginal state and Federal tax rate (on a combined basis and",
  "including the Employee’s share of F.I.C.A. and Medicare taxes) then in effect. (b) Employee shall in good faith 154   cooperate with the Accounting Firm in making 155   the determination of 80   whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, including but not limited to 156   providing the Accounting Firm with information or documentation as reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm 157 . A determination by the Accounting Firm regarding whether a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such 28   Gross-Up Payment shall 21   be conclusive and binding upon 80   the Employee and the Company for all purposes 158 . (c) A Gross-Up Payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 4(iii) 159   shall be paid 113   to Employee within 49   30 days of a final determination 160   by the Accounting Firm that the Gross-Up Payment is required. Employee and Company shall report all amounts paid to Employee on their respective tax returns consistent with the determination of the Accounting Firm. (d) The Company and the Employee shall promptly deliver to each other copies of any written communications, and summaries of any oral communications, with any tax authority regarding the applicability 80   of Section 280G or 4999 of the Code to any portion of the Total Payments. In the event of any controversy with the Internal Revenue Service or other tax authority regarding the applicability of Section 280G or 4999 of the Code to any portion of the Total Payments 161 , Company shall have the right 45 , exercisable in its sole discretion, 76   to control the resolution of such controversy at its own expense. Employee and the Company shall in good faith 154   cooperate in the resolution 80   of such 28  controversy. (e) If the Internal Revenue Service or any tax authority makes a final determination 160   that a greater Excise Tax should be imposed upon the Total Payments than is determined by the Accounting Firm or reflected in the Employee’s tax return pursuant to 55   this Section, the Employee shall be entitled to receive 47   from the Company the full Gross-Up Payment calculated on the basis of the amount of Excise Tax determined to be payable 116   by such 28   tax authority. That amount shall be paid 113   to the Participant within 49   30 days of the date of such 28   final determination 160   by the relevant tax authority 162 . 5. Successors and Binding Agreement 163  (i) The Company will 164   require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise 165   to all or substantially 86   all of the business and/or assets 166   of the Company 100 ), by agreement in form and substance 167   satisfactory to Employee, to expressly 168   assume and agree to perform this Agreement 169   in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure 80   of the Company to obtain such 170   agreement prior to 27   the effectiveness of 80   any such succession shall 21   be a breach of this Agreement and shall 21   entitle Employee 171   to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled hereunder if employee terminated Employee’s employment after a Change in Control for Good Reason, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing 131 , the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall 21   be deemed the date that the termination of Employee’s employment becomes effective. 172   As used in this Agreement, “Company” shall mean the Company and any successor to its business and/or assets 166   which executes and delivers 173   the agreement provided for in this Section 5(i) or which otherwise becomes bound by all",
  "the terms and provisions 174   of this Agreement by operation of law. 175 176 (ii) This Agreement is personal to Employee 177 , and Employee may not 178   assign or transfer any part 179   of Employee’s rights or duties hereunder, or any compensation due to Employee hereunder, to any other person. 180   Notwithstanding the foregoing, 181   this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by 182   Employee’s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees 183 . 6. Arbitration. 184 Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with 185   this Agreement shall be settled 157   exclusively by arbitration in the Borough of Manhattan, in accordance with the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may be entered 186   on the arbitrator’s award in any court having jurisdiction. 7. Modification; Waiver. No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged 187   unless such 28   waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in a writing signed by Employee and such 188   officer as may 134   be specifically 189   designated by the Board of Directors 70   of the Company. No waiver by either party hereto 190   at any time 40   of any breach by the other party hereto 190  of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed 191   by such other party shall be deemed 192   a waiver of similar or dissimilar 193   provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. 194  8. Notice. 195   All notices, requests, demands and all other communications required or permitted by either party to the other party by this Agreement (including, without limitation, any notice of termination of employment and any notice of intention to arbitrate) shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally or received by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, at the address of the other party, as first written above (directed to the attention of the Board of Directors and Corporate Secretary in the case of the Company). Either party hereto may change its address for purposes of this Section 8 by giving 15 days’ prior notice to the other party hereto. 9. Severability. 196   If any term or provision 197   of this Agreement or the application hereof 198   to any person or circumstances shall 21   to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement or the application of such 28   term or provision 197   to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable 199   shall 21   not be affected thereby, and each term and provision 197   of this Agreement shall 21   be valid and enforceable 200   to the fullest extent permitted by law. 10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed 201   in several counterparts, each of which shall 21   be deemed an original, but all of which together shall 21   constitute one and the same 202  instrument. 11. Governing Law. 203   This Agreement has been executed and delivered in the State of New York and shall in all respects be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, including all matters of construction, validity and performance, and without taking into consideration the conflict of law provisions of such state. 12. Effect of Agreement; Entire Agreement. The Company and the Employee understand and",
  "agree that 204   this Agreement is intended 205   to reflect their agreement only with respect to payments and benefits upon termination in certain cases 206   and is not intended 205   to create any obligation on the part of either party to continue employment. This Agreement supersedes any and all 115   other oral or written agreements or policies made relating to the subject matter hereof 207   and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof; provided that 208   this Agreement shall 21   not supersede or limit in any way 209   Employee’s rights under any benefit plan, program or arrangements 210   in accordance with their terms 211 . IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed, all as of the date first written above. 212  RMA WIDGETS, INC. 213  By ____________________________ Janet Doe Its Vice President, Human Resources  _____________________   214  Employee, __________________  1   There are better font choices than Times New Roman (see 16.2–.14).  2   Don’t use a capital   A   in references to “this agreement” (see 2.123–.127).  3   Use instead   is dated   (see 2.22).  4   Using   as of   with a date in the introductory clause is a loose convention used to indicate that one or more parties signed the agreement on a date other than the date stated in the introductory clause. This manual recommends not using   as of   dates (see 2.35). Furthermore, it doesn’t make sense to use an   as of  date in a template.  5   This manual uses the day-month-year format to state dates (see 10.8).  6   It’s unnecessary to state in the introductory clause the address of a party that’s a legal entity. To distinguish a U.S. legal-entity party from any other entity sharing the same name, it’s sufficient to state its jurisdiction of organization (see 2.68).  7   Consider using as the defined term for RMA Widgets a name based on that party’s name rather than “the Company” (see 2.97).  8   Because this is a template that is to be used in transactions with different employees, it’s appropriate to use the defined term   Employee   (see 2.97–.98). But using the definite article   the   with the defined term would make the prose a little less stilted (see 2.105).  9   In the case of a party that’s an individual, in the U.S. stating their address is usually the simplest way to distinguish them from any other person bearing the same name. But if, as in this case, the contract contains a notices provision, nothing would be served by stating an address twice in the same contract—",
  "leave the address out of the introductory clause (see 2.71).  10   Use of   WITNESSETH   is archaic (see 2.136–.137).  11   This use of   WHEREAS   is archaic (see 2.142).  12   The defined term is   Employee , but this contract refers sporadically to   the Employee . Be consistent (see 2.105).  13   End recitals with a period, not a semicolon (see 2.143).  14   These recitals would be improved by making them more concise.  15   NOW, THEREFORE   is archaic (see 2.166).  16   Buried in the lead-in is a purpose recital (see 2.131). It would be clearer to state it as a separate recital.  17   Use the   MSCD   form of lead-in (see 2.159) and eliminate the traditional recital of consideration (see 2.165–.209).  18   Don’t refer to the parties by name in the lead-in, as doing so would serve no purpose and would just make the lead-in longer (see 2.163).  19   Use the   MSCD   first-line-indent enumeration scheme, “sections” version (see 4.2–.3). The   MSCD  hanging-indent enumeration scheme would be equally acceptable, but this contract was drafted by U.S. a law-firm; a law firm would be more likely to choose the first-line-indent scheme.  20   To emphasize section headings, use bold rather than underlining (see 4.20–.21).  21   This is language of policy, so   shall   is inappropriate (see 3.307–.308).  22   It’s sufficiently obvious that a contract becomes effective once the parties have signed it that nothing is gained by saying so (see 2.30). And “the date hereof as first written above” is archaic (see 5.27).  23   It’s misleading to say that the initial term ends on 31 December of the year of execution (in other words, the year the contract is signed). The proviso that follows says that the agreement will automatically be extended for an additional year unless at least 12 months before the beginning of the new term the company notifies the employee that it doesn’t want to renew. Because it would be impossible for the company to give 12 months’ notice to prevent the contract from being extended for an additional year commencing 1 January of the year following the year the contract is signed—the end of the year the contract is signed will always be less than 12 months away—it’s inevitable that the agreement will renew for at least one year. It would be clearer to have the initial term run through 31 December of the year after the year the contract is signed.  24   Using   provided that   is an imprecise way to signal the relationship between two conjoined contract provisions (see 13.663). In this case, the provision that follows   provided that   can stand on its own.  25   The phrase “commencing on ... and each 1 January thereafter” is unnecessary.  26   In this context,   one year   would be the simpler and therefore better choice.  27   Prior to   is wordy; use instead   before   (see 17.19).  28   Don’t use   such   instead of the “pointing words”   this ,   that ,   these , or   those   (see 13.767).  29   The clause beginning “unless” is a conditional clause. The present perfect tense ( has given ) would",
  "be acceptable in this context, but the present tense ( gives ) is the simpler choice, as it works in all contexts (see 3.321). Using   shall   isn’t appropriate, as no duty is being expressed (see 3.322).  30   This parenthetical is redundant, because notice given sooner than 1 January of the year following the year in which the contract is signed would in any event be ineffective to prevent the contract from being extended for an additional year. See note 23.  31   Using   provided, further, that   suffers from the same shortcomings as   provided that   (see note 24). In this case, the provision that follows   provided, further, that   can stand on its own.  32   There’s always a clearer alternative to   notwithstanding   (see 13.599).  33   In this context, “will automatically be extended by two years” would be more concise.  34   Don’t use a capital   S   in   section   (see 17.34).  35   Don’t use   hereof   after cross-references (see 4.105).  36   This sort of parenthetical is an inefficient way of cross-referencing, particularly when used to excess, as in this contract (see 6.111–.114).  37   The clause beginning “if” is a conditional clause, so the present perfect tense ( has occurred ) would be acceptable in this context, but the present tense ( occurs ) would be the simpler choice, as it works in all contexts (see 3.321). Using   shall   isn’t appropriate, as no duty is being expressed (see 3.322).  38   It’s not clear whether after a two-year extension the agreement would be subject to further one- year extensions.  39   Taken together, the elements of section 2 in effect state that both before and after occurrence of a Change in Control the company may terminate the employee for any reason. Section 2 would be much clearer if it were rewritten to say exactly that. One would also need to retain the notification requirements that apply if the company terminates for Cause or the employee terminates for Good Reason.  40   The phrase “at any time” is redundant (see 10.128).  41   It’s redundant to use both “from” and “after” in this context.  42   In this context, the phrase “during the term of this Agreement” is redundant (see 13.254).  43   Stating that certain rights or obligations are as stated elsewhere in a contract is a reliable sign of inefficient structure.  44   Because this is a template that is to be used in transactions with different employees, it would be best to use gender-neutral language (see 17.11).  45   This is language of discretion rather than language of obligation, so use   may   instead of   shall have the right to   (see 3.188–.189).  46   If the notices provision says that all notices must be in writing, elsewhere you can simply use  notice   rather than   written notice .  47   Use of   is entitled to   and   receive   obscures who has the duty (see 3.151, 3.152). Use instead language of obligation imposing the duty on the company (see 3.72).  48   Instead of imposing on the employee an obligation give notice of termination for Good Reason, it would make more sense to have it be a condition.  49   Use instead “no later than” (see 10.68).",
  "50   Use   that   instead of   which   (see 12.43).  51   Using “need only” isn’t the clearest way to express a condition (see 3.359).  52   Set forth in   is wordy (see 17.19).  53   What constitutes proper notice could be stated more succinctly.  54   With only a few exceptions, all text in the body of the contract should be enumerated (see 4.27). This sentence doesn’t constitute one of the exceptions. But more to the point, it would be more efficient to integrate this sentence with the rest of this section.  55   Don’t use the wordy   pursuant to   (see 17.19).  56   It would be clearer to say that termination, rather than the notice, will be effective after five business days.  57   Because the defined terms are interrelated, relatively lengthy, and are used in three different sections, it would make sense to collect the definitions as autonomous definitions within a separate section (see 6.86). And because the defined terms don’t have a universally accepted meaning, it would be best to place them “on site” rather than tucking them at the end of the contract (see 6.88). So retain the section containing definitions—which is more modest in scope than a conventional definition section (see 6.87)—and move it further back in the contract, but not to the end.  58   Add introductory language (see 6.31).  59   Nothing is gained by enumerating the autonomous definitions in a section composed entirely of autonomous definitions (see 6.32).  60   Omit the indefinite article (see 6.30).  61   Put in alphabetical order the autonomous definitions in a section composed entirely of autonomous definitions (see 6.32).  62   Refers to   would be a better definitional verb, because in this case the defined term isn’t equivalent to all elements of the definition (see 6.45).  63   This defined term refers only to changes in control of the company, so add “of the Company”.  64   The phrase “of a nature” is redundant.  65   Awkward wording.  66   The “as amended” is unnecessary (see 13.54).  67   Don’t include an integrated definition within an autonomous definition (see 6.59).  68   The “thereto” is unnecessary.  69   The quotation marks are unnecessary.  70   Don’t use initial capitals in   board of directors   (see 17.30).  71   Instead of stating a general proposition, then narrowing it by means of a proviso, it would be more logical to make the proposition narrower. To do that, put first what had been the proviso, but have it begin “as a result of”.  72   “Direct or indirect result” is an example of needless elaboration (see 1.53). Refer just to “result” or be more specific.",
  "73   The reference to “a proxy fight” is redundant, because a proxy fight entails a contested election.  74   The formula   one or more Xs   is simpler than   X or Xs   (see 11.7).  75   This is rhetorical emphasis (see 1.58).  76   Either this is redundant or it represents a problematic attempt to skirt the implied duty of good faith (see 3.255–.257).  77   Each element of this definition relates to a Change of Control. It would make those elements more concise if the reference to Change of Control were moved to the introductory language.  78   The “the” is extraneous (see 17.35).  79   Once section 2 is cleaned up, this is the only place where the concept of disability is referred to. Rather than create a defined term that is used only once, incorporate the definition here and eliminate the defined term.  80   Use a verb rather than a “buried verb” (see 17.7).  81   Awkward wording.  82   The “or modification” is redundant.  83   Move this phrase to the beginning of this element, eliminating the parentheses.  84   It would be more direct and concise to say “more than 50 miles from”.  85   Awkward wording.  86   Substantially   is vague and so leaves room for dispute (see 7.42, 7.46). But it’s retained in appendix B, as replacing it wherever it occurs would require extensive changes.  87   Saying “except as required” would be more concise.  88   In references to   applicable law , the   applicable   is redundant (see 13.33).  89   The “in effect” is redundant.  90   The following plans all constitute employee benefit plans; revise accordingly.  91   The “materially” is ambiguous, as is the “material” used later in the sentence, so use unambiguous language instead (see 9.8).  92   See note 91.  93   The “to the Company” is redundant.  94   Because “Cause” is used only in the phrase “termination for Cause”, there’s no need to refer to termination when defining “Cause”.  95   Don’t use   willful —it’s ambiguous (see 13.896).  96   The reference to “duty” is redundant (see 3.172–.173).  97   The “materially” is ambiguous, so use unambiguous language instead (see 9.8).  98   Say instead that it’s for purposes of this definition.  99   This defined term is unnecessary (see note 79).",
  "100   Use the possessive (see 17.28).  101   The immediately preceding phrase is unnecessary.  102   Don’t make these defined terms. Instead, say in parentheses that they have the meaning given them in the statute.  103   “First written above” is archaic and imprecise (see 5.27).  104   Insert   then .  105   Reverse the order of the   (a)   and   (b)   enumerated clauses, to make clear that the modifiers after the   (b)   enumerated clause don’t also modify the   (a)   enumerated clause (see 12.10).  106   State this as a separate definition.  107   Don’t use initial capitals (see 17.33).  108   Delete the definitions of   Affiliate   and   Associate   (see note 102).  109   It’s odd to include a cross-reference in a section heading.  110   The enumeration in this section is unhelpful—because the   (i)   hierarchy has the same layout as the   (a)   hierarchy, the reader cannot determine based on layout alone which takes precedence.  111   State what kind of termination entitles the employee to benefits, rather than relying on a cross- reference.  112   Instead of referring indirectly to the benefits, say what they are.  113   Use the active rather than the passive voice to express an obligation (see 3.142).  114   Using “the date that” is redundant.  115   Eliminate redundancy by using one or other word in this traditional couplet (see 1.38).  116   Payable   is a feature of “buried-actor policies” (see 3.309). Rephrase this to make clear that it is a duty that is being referred to.  117   The word “standard” adds nothing.  118   It’s sufficient to refer to a severance policy of the Company.  119   This is a wordy phrase; replace it with   instead of   (see 17.19).  120   This is a wordy phrase; use instead   after   (see 17.19).  121   The words “lump-sum cash” are redundant (see 13.385).  122   For numbers over ten, use digits only (see 14.13).  123   Eliminate the redundancy by using only “agreements” (see 1.38).  124   Competitive   means “likely to succeed in competition”; use instead “that competes with” (see 13.149).  125   Make this more concise.  126   Deem   serves to establish a legal fiction. Here, the parties don’t need to rely on a legal fiction; they can instead just say that the contracts in question will terminate (see 13.216).",
  "127   The phrase “and of no further force or effect” is redundant.  128   Say instead “when”.  129   Eliminate the rhetorical emphasis—say “but only to the extent” (see 1.58).  130   Provided that   is an imprecise way to signal the relationship between two conjoined contract provisions (see 13.663). In this case, the employee could simply acknowledge, in a separate provision rather than a proviso, the limitations in question.  131   Make it clearer what is being referred to (see 7.25).  132   Because the concern here is confidentiality, use the word “confidential” instead of “proprietary” (see 13.660).  133   Saying “notwithstanding the fact that” is wordy; use instead “even if ” .  134   This “may” is unnecessary (see 3.459).  135   Nondisclosure or nonuse can’t prohibit anything—“prevent” would be a better word.  136   Competitive   is the wrong word to use, as it means “likely to succeed in competition” (see 13.149).  137   Express this more concisely.  138   Carve out the rest of this section as a separate section with the heading “Gross-up Payment.”  139   This is a wordy phrase; instead use “if” (see 17.19).  140   The defined term is   Change of Control   and it’s defined with respect to the Company, so “of the Company” is superfluous (see 6.118).  141   Payable   is a potentially confusing word (see note 116) so it’s best to avoid using it. Here, it can simply be omitted.  142   Eliminate the redundancy by using just “agreement” (see 1.38).  143   The immediately preceding phrase is superfluous, in that it also occurs earlier in the parenthetical.  144   This provision would be easier to read if   Total Payments   were defined using an autonomous definition rather than an integrated definition, and if a more informative defined term were used.  145   Wordy; replace everything in these parentheses up to this point with “collectively”.  146   Use “on”;   upon   is best used to refer only to the simultaneous occurrence of events.  147   The phrase “the provisions of” is redundant.  148   The phrase “to be made” is redundant.  149   Don’t use “shall”—the Accounting Firm isn’t a party and so isn’t assuming any obligations (see 3.149).  150   Make it an obligation of the company to retain an accounting firm.  151   This defined term doesn’t add enough value to offset the cost of adding another defined term to the contract (see 6.115).",
  "152   This term isn’t defined.  153   The passive voice is unhelpful here (see 3.11). A good alternative to using the active voice would be to use “unless”.  154   The reference to good faith is redundant, as good faith is inherent in the notion of parties cooperating (see 13.552).  155   This construction suggests, inappropriately, that the employee will be involved in “making the determination.”  156   Omit “but not limited to” (see 13.353).  157   Use the active voice (see 3.11).  158   The phrase “for all purposes” is unnecessary.  159   It would be better to say “any Gross-Up Payment”.  160   In this context it wouldn’t be feasible to use a verb rather than the buried verb   determination  (see 17.7), in that “determine finally” would convey a different meaning than “final determination”.  161   Needless repetition; instead say “in that regard”.  162   The subsection would be more concise if the essence of the second sentence were incorporated into the first sentence.  163   Split this into two sections.  164   This is language of obligation; use   shall   (see 3.72).  165   This is where the closing parenthesis should be, not after “Company”.  166   Regarding   and/or , see 11.86. Rather than saying “the business or assets or both,” a simpler fix would be to omit “business” (see 1.38).  167   In form and substance   is redundant (see 13.306).  168   Instead of using “expressly”, state that the agreement has to be in writing.  169   One doesn’t assume or perform an agreement but rather obligations under that agreement.  170   Use instead “any such”.  171   Use of “shall entitle” is a wordy and unclear way of expressing an obligation. Use instead language of obligation imposing the duty on the company (see 3.72).  172   The preceding sentence is unnecessary, as the definition of “Good Reason” includes breach by the company of its obligations under this subsection. Move to the definition of “Good Reason” the part stating when termination for Good Reason will be deemed to have occurred.  173   Use “enters into” instead of “executes and delivers” (see 13.278).  174   Use “terms” instead of “terms and provisions” (see 13.807).  175   This sentence is unnecessary.  176   This is an appropriate place to put the “Definitions” section.  177   To make this provision easier to read, make the preceding language a separate sentence.",
  "178   Because   may not   is ambiguous,   shall not   is a better choice for language of prohibition (see 3.279).  179   The word “part” is redundant.  180   For an explanation of the alternative language used in appendix B, see Kenneth A. Adams,  Rethinking the “No Assignment” Provision , Adams on Contract Drafting (20 Nov. 2012), http://www.adamsdrafting.com/rethinking-the-no-assignment-provision/.  181   Use instead “except that”, and join the second sentence to the first.  182   Because this is an exception to a restriction on transfer, it’s confusing to use wording that evokes the pointless traditional successors-and-assigns provision (see 13.449).  183   This string of nouns is confusing; express instead the underlying concept (see 1.48).  184   In appendix B, this section is replaced by one based on language proposed in Kenneth A. Adams,  The AAA Standard Arbitration Clause: Room for Improvement , New York Law Journal, 9 Mar. 2010.  185   “Arising under”—or rather “arising out of”—is sufficient (see 13.37).  186   This instance of the passive voice is unobjectionable (see 3.22).  187   It would be simpler to refer to amendment rather than modification, and the concept of discharge is both unnecessary and overbroad. And rather than expressing this sentence as a prohibition, it would make more sense to address effectiveness of any amendment or waiver. (Regarding confusion between obligations and conditions, see 3.356.)  188   In this context, use “any” instead of “such”.  189   Delete “specifically”—it’s an example of rhetorical emphasis (see 1.58).  190   The “hereto” is unnecessary, as it would be unreasonable to think that without it this would constitute a reference to parties to some other agreement (see 2.110).  191   You don’t   breach ,   comply with , or   perform   a condition, you   satisfy   it.  192   Deem   serves to establish a legal fiction (see 13.216). Here, no legal fiction is required.  193   “Similar or dissimilar” is needless elaboration (see 1.53).  194   This sentence is unnecessarily wordy and legalistic.  195   In appendix B, this section is replaced by one developed for the author’s automated confidentiality-agreement template. It is beyond the scope of this appendix B to address all the drafting issues raised by this section.  196   In appendix B, this section is replaced by a severability section developed by the author. See  Kenneth A. Adams, OK, Let’s Try That Again: Revising My Severability Provision , Adams on Contract Drafting (3 Feb. 2017), http://www.adamsdrafting.com/revisiting-my-severability-provision/. It’s not clear whether this kind of severability provision is helpful in this context, but that analysis is beyond the scope of these annotations.  197   The word “term” is redundant (see 1.38).  198   The phrase “or the application hereof” is redundant.  199   Eliminate the redundancy by using just “enforceable” (see 1.38).",
  "200   “Valid” is redundant.  201   Language of policy (see 3.305) makes more sense here than language of discretion.  202   Eliminate redundancy by deleting “the same” (see 1.38).  203   In appendix B, this section is replaced by one developed by the author. See the following blog post and two others linked to in it: Kenneth A. Adams,   Simplifying Governing-Law Provisions, Part 3 (“Governs” and the Alternatives) , Adams on Contract Drafting (15 July 2015), http://www.adamsdrafting.com/simplifying-governing-law-provisions-part-3-governs/. It is beyond the scope of this appendix B to address all the drafting issues raised by this section.  204   This is throat-clearing (see 3.25).  205   This should be language of policy (see 3.305), not language of intention (see 3.442).  206   This concept is adequately addressed in the recitals.  207   Be restrained in using   here-   and   there-   words (see 13.349).  208   Use instead “except that” (see 13.663–.666).  209   Delete “in any way”—it’s rhetorical emphasis (see 1.58).  210   The term “benefit plan” is by itself sufficiently broad.  211   The phrase “in accordance with their terms” is superfluous.  212   This is a traditional concluding clause (see 5.19–.20). Use instead the   MSCD   form of concluding clause for when the date of the agreement is stated in the introductory clause (see 5.4).  213   Use the   MSCD   form of signature block for companies (see 5.30 and sample 8).  214   Use the   MSCD   form of signature block for individuals (see 5.38 and sample 8).",
  "APPENDIX B: AFTER  TERMINATION AGREEMENT This termination agreement is dated ___________ 20__ and is between RMA WIDGETS, INC., a Delaware corporation (“ RMA ”), and ____________________, an individual (the “ Employee ”). The Employee is an employee of RMA. To give the Employee additional incentive to remain an employee of RMA, RMA wants to specify what payments, if any, RMA will be required to make to the Employee if RMA ceases to employ the Employee in the context of a change of control of RMA. RMA and the Employee therefore agree as follows: 1.   Term.   The initial term of this agreement ends at midnight at the end of 31 December 20__ [year following year of this agreement]. The term of this agreement (consisting of the initial term and any one-year extensions in accordance with this section 1) will automatically be extended by consecutive one-year terms unless no later than one year before any such extension begins RMA notifies the Employee that it does not wish to extend this agreement. If a Change of Control occurs, then (1) any notice that RMA previously delivered in accordance with this section 1 that would preclude any extension commencing after the Change of Control will be deemed ineffective and (2) the term of this agreement (consisting of the initial term and any one-year extensions in accordance with this section 1) will automatically be extended by two years and will then terminate without the possibility of automatic extension. 2.   Termination of Employment.   Each of RMA and the Employee may terminate the Employee’s employment with RMA at any time and for any reason, except that (1) for RMA to terminate the Employee for Cause after a Change of Control occurs, RMA must notify the Employee of that termination and specify in reasonable detail the conduct of the Employee constituting the basis for termination for Cause, and (2) for the Employee to terminate for Good Reason after a Change of Control occurs, the Employee must, no later than 60 days after the date that the Employee knew or should reasonably have known of the one or more events or circumstances constituting the basis for termination for Good Reason, notify RMA of the Employee’s termination for Good Reason and specify those events or circumstances in reasonable detail, and the Employee’s termination will be effective five business days after the date that notice from RMA or the Employee, as applicable, is delivered. 3.   Benefits on Termination.   (a) If after a Change of Control RMA terminates the Employee without Cause or the Employee terminates for Good Reason, then RMA shall pay the Employee, no later than one business day before termination of the Employee’s employment becomes effective, the following amounts, subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes that RMA is required by law to withhold: (1)   all amounts that RMA is required to pay the Employee under any general RMA severance policy; (2)   as severance instead of any further base salary for periods after the date that termination of the Employee’s employment becomes effective, an amount equal to 24 times the Employee’s monthly base salary (as in effect in the month preceding the month in which the termination becomes effective or as in effect in the month preceding the Change of Control, whichever is greater); and",
  "(3)   all legal fees and expenses that the Employee incurs as a result of termination of the Employee’s employment, including any fees and expenses incurred by the Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce, including by arbitration, any right or benefit under this agreement. (b)   If after a Change of Control RMA terminates the Employee without Cause or the Employee terminates for Good Reason, then all agreements between RMA and the Employee prohibiting or restricting the Employee from owning, operating, participating in, or providing employment or consulting services to, after termination of the Employee’s employment becomes effective, any business that competes with RMA will automatically terminate when termination of the Employee’s employment becomes effective, but only to the extent those contracts so prohibit or restrict the Employee. The Employee acknowledges that nothing in this section 3(b) constitutes a license to use any confidential information of RMA or affects any provisions of any such agreement regarding nondisclosure or nonuse of confidential information of RMA, even if any such nondisclosure and nonuse prevents the Employee from competing with RMA or interferes with the Employee’s ability to do so. (c)   The Employee will not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment under this section 3, including by seeking other employment. The amount of any payment or benefit under this section 3 will not be reduced by any compensation the Employee earns from any other employment or from any other source. 4.   Gross-Up Payment.   (a) If any Employee Change-of-Control Payment would be subject to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the Code or any interest, penalties, or additions to tax with respect to that excise tax (collectively, the “ Excise Tax ”), then RMA shall pay the Employee an additional amount of cash (a “ Gross-Up Payment ”) such that after the Employee pays all taxes (including any interest, penalties, or additions to tax imposed with respect to those taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed on the Gross-Up Payment, the Employee would retain an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed on the Total Payments, as determined in accordance with this section 4. (b)   On the day a Change of Control occurs, RMA shall retain an independent accounting firm. RMA shall cause the accounting firm to make all determinations required under this section 4 (including whether RMA is required to make a Gross-Up Payment and the amount of that Gross-Up Payment) and to provide detailed supporting calculations of each such determination to both RMA and the Employee no later than 15 business days after the date of termination of the Employee’s employment, unless RMA requests that it does so sooner. For purposes of determining the amount of any tax in accordance with this section 4, the Employee’s tax rate will be deemed to be the highest statutory marginal state and Federal tax rate (on a combined basis and including the Employee’s share of FICA and Medicare taxes) then in effect. (c)   The Employee shall cooperate with the accounting firm as it determines whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, including by providing the accounting firm with any information or documentation that the accounting firm requests. The Employee and RMA will be bound by any determination by the accounting firm regarding whether a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of any Gross-Up Payment. (d)   RMA shall pay any Gross-Up Payment no later than 30 days after the accounting firm determines that RMA is required to make that Gross-Up Payment. The Employee and RMA shall report any Gross-Up Payment on their respective tax returns consistent with the determination of the accounting firm.",
  "(e)   RMA and the Employee shall promptly deliver to each other copies of any written communications, and summaries of any oral communications, with any tax authority regarding whether section 280G or 4999 of the Code applies to any portion of the Total Payments. In the event of any controversy with the Internal Revenue Service or any other tax authority in that regard, RMA may elect to control, at its own expense, resolution of that controversy, and the Employee and RMA shall cooperate in resolving that controversy. (f)   If the Internal Revenue Service or any other tax authority makes a final determination that the Excise Tax to be imposed on the Total Payments is greater than was determined by the accounting firm or reflected in the Employee’s tax return in accordance with this section 4, RMA shall, no later than 30 days after it receives notice of that determination, pay the Employee any additional amount required to ensure that RMA has paid the Employee a Gross-Up Payment calculated on the basis of the amount of Excise Tax that the tax authority determines must be paid. 5.   Successors.   By means of a written agreement satisfactory to the Employee, RMA shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect or by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of RMA’s assets to assume RMA’s obligations under this agreement and agree to perform them in the same manner and to the same extent that RMA would have been required to if that succession had not taken place. 6.   Definitions.   For purposes of this agreement, the following definitions apply: “ Acquiring Person ” means any person (as that term is used in sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) that, together with all affiliates and associates (as those terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of that person, is the beneficial owner (as that term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the shares of RMA common stock then outstanding, but does not include RMA, any RMA subsidiary, any employee benefit plan of RMA or of RMA subsidiary, or any entity holding shares of RMA common stock that is organized, appointed, or established for, or in accordance with the terms of, any such plan. “ Cause ” refers to (1) the Employee’s intentional and continued failure to substantially perform the Employee’s duties as employee (other than any such failure resulting from any physical or mental condition of the Employee or any such actual or anticipated failure resulting from the Employee’s having terminated for Good Reason) or (2) the Employee’s engaging in intentional misconduct that, from the perspective of a reasonable person in RMA’s position, is sufficiently harmful to RMA, monetarily or otherwise, as to merit attention, with any action or failure to act on the Employee’s part not being considered intentional for purposes of clauses (1) and (2) of this definition if that action or failure to act was in good faith or if the Employee reasonably believed that the action or failure to act was in the best interests of RMA. “ Change of Control ” refers to occurrence of any of the following events and circumstances: (1)   a change of control of RMA that falls within the scope of item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or any successor provision, whether or not RMA is then subject to that reporting requirement; (2)   any person (as that word is used in sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of RMA representing 35% or more of the combined voting power of RMA’s then outstanding securities; (3)   as the direct or indirect result of one or more contested elections for positions on RMA’s",
  "board of directors, the Continuing Directors cease to constitute a majority of RMA’s board of directors; and (4)   a majority of the Continuing Directors determine that a change of control of RMA has occurred. “ Code ” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. “ Continuing Director ” means any person who (1) is a member of RMA’s board of directors, (2) is not at the same time an Acquiring Person or an affiliate or associate (as those terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of an Acquiring Person, or a representative of an Acquiring Person or of any such affiliate or associate, and (3) either (A) became a member of RMA’s board of directors after the date of this agreement, if that person’s initial nomination for election or initial appointment to RMA’s board of directors was recommended or approved by a majority of the then Continuing Directors, or (B) was a member of RMA’s board of directors on the date of this agreement. “ Employee Change-of-Control Payment ” means any payment or benefit received or to be received by the Employee in connection with a Change of Control or termination of the Employee’s employment (whether under this agreement or any other plan or agreement with RMA, any person whose actions result in a Change of Control, or any person constituting a member of an affiliated group, as that term is defined in section 280G(d)(5) of the Code). “ Exchange Act ” means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. “ Good Reason ” refers to occurrence of any of the following events after a Change of Control (or, in the case of clause (8), in connection with a Change of Control), except in connection with termination or reassignment of the Employee by RMA for Cause or in connection with the Employee’s death or any physical or mental condition of the Employee that would permit the Employee to qualify for a disability benefit under RMA’s long-term disability plan: (1)   RMA assigns the Employee employment responsibilities that, when compared to the Employee’s responsibilities immediately before the Change of Control, are commensurate with reduced status or seniority or both; (2)   RMA reduces the Employee’s base salary to below what it was immediately before the Change of Control; (3)   except as required by law, RMA amends RMA’s incentive compensation program so as to affect the terms or administration of the program in a manner adverse to the interest of the Employee, as compared to the terms and administration of that program immediately before the Change of Control; (4)   except for purposes of temporary travel on RMA’s business to an extent substantially consistent with such travel by the Employee during the period immediately before the Change of Control, RMA requires the Employee to be based more than 50 miles from where the Employee’s office was located immediately before the Change of Control; (5   except as required by law, RMA fails to continue any compensation plan, stock ownership plan, stock purchase plan, bonus plan, life insurance plan, health-and-accident plan, disability plan, or other employee benefit plan in which the Employee is participating immediately before the Change of Control, or fails to implement plans providing the Employee with substantially similar benefits;",
  "(6)   except as required by law, and in each case to an extent that, from the perspective of a reasonable person in the Employee’s position, is sufficiently important to merit attention, RMA takes any action that would adversely affect the Employee’s participation in, or reduce the Employee’s benefits under, any such plans or deprive the Employee of any fringe benefit enjoyed by the Employee immediately before the Change of Control; (7)   except as required by law, RMA fails to provide the Employee with the number of paid vacation days to which the Employee was entitled immediately before the Change of Control in accordance with RMA’s vacation policy as then in effect; and (8)   RMA breaches its obligations under section 5, in which case RMA will be deemed to have terminated the Employee for Good Reason on the date on which the succession in question became effective. 7.   Assignment.   This agreement is personal to the Employee. The Employee shall not transfer to any other person, other than by will or intestate succession, (1) any discretion granted under this agreement, (2) any right to satisfy a condition under this agreement, (3) any remedy under this agreement, or (4) any obligation imposed under this agreement. 8.   Arbitration.   As the exclusive means of initiating adversarial proceedings to resolve any dispute arising out of this agreement or termination of the Employee’s employment with RMA, a party may demand that the dispute be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules, and each party hereby consents to any such dispute being so resolved. Judgment on any award rendered in any such arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. 9.   Modification; Waiver.   No amendment of this agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the parties. No waiver under this agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver (in the case of RMA, by an individual authorized by RMA’s board of directors to sign the waiver). A waiver granted on one occasion will not operate as a waiver on other occasions. 10.   Notices.   (a) For a notice or other communication under this agreement to be valid, it must be in writing and delivered (1) by hand, (2) by a national transportation company (with all fees prepaid), or (3) by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid (b)   Subject to section 10(d), a valid notice or other communication under this agreement will be effective when received by the party to which it is addressed. It will be deemed to have been received as follows: (1)   if it is delivered by hand, delivered by a national transportation company (with all fees prepaid), or delivered by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, upon receipt as indicated by the date on the signed receipt; and (2)   if the party to which it is addressed rejects or otherwise refuses to accept it, or if it cannot be delivered because of a change in address for which no notice was given, then upon that rejection, refusal, or inability to deliver. (c)   For a notice or other communication to a party under this agreement to be valid, it must be addressed using the information specified below for that party or any other information specified by that party in a notice in accordance with this section 10.  To RMA:   RMA Widgets, Inc. 500 Third Avenue",
  "Suite 400 New York, NY 10022 Attention:   Board of Directors and Corporate Secretary To the Employee:   [Name] [Address]  (d)   If a notice or other communication addressed to a party is received after 5:00 p.m. on a business day at the location specified in the address for that party, or on a day that is not a business day, then the notice will be deemed received at 9:00 a.m. on the next business day. 11.   Severability.   The parties acknowledge that if a dispute between the parties arises out of this agreement or termination of the Employee’s employment with RMA, they would want the court to interpret this agreement as follows: (1)   with respect to any provision that it holds to be unenforceable, by modifying that provision to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable or, if that modification is not permitted by law, by disregarding that provision; (2)   if an unenforceable provision is modified or disregarded in accordance with this section 11, by holding that the rest of the agreement will remain in effect as written; (3)   by holding that any unenforceable provision will remain as written in any circumstances other than those in which the provision is held to be unenforceable; and (4)   if modifying or disregarding the unenforceable provision would result in failure of an essential purpose of this agreement, by holding the entire agreement unenforceable. 12.   Counterparts.   If the parties sign this agreement in several counterparts, each will be deemed an original but all counterparts together will constitute one instrument. 13.   Governing Law.   New York law governs all adversarial proceedings brought by one party against the other party arising out of this agreement or termination of the Employee’s employment with RMA. 14.
